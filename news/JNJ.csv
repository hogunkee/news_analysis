0,JNJ,"Medtech player Stryker (SYK) said Wednesday it isn't in discussions to acquire Boston Scientific (BSX), prodding Stryker shares to pop as Boston Scientific stock toppled.""Stryker is not in discussions with Boston Scientific Corporation regarding a potential acquisition,"" the firm said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.On the stock market today, Stryker shares climbed 2.5% to close at 166.90. Its stock had slid 9.2% over the previous two sessions. Boston Scientific, on the other hand, tumbled 6.2% to 31.73. That reversed two days of gains.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro noted the recent stock decline would have made a potential Boston deal less favorable financially.

Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Assuming a 50%/50% split between debt/equity for the deal, we estimate the decline in Stryker's shares post the (Wall Street Journal) story would have forced Stryker to issue an additional 17 million in shares for the potential Boston Scientific deal,"" he said in a note.Overall, there was some strategic rationale for the deal, but creating value would have been a challenge, Novarro said. He reiterated his outperform rating on Stryker. He also called the pullback on Monday and Tuesday a ""buying opportunity.""Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a better acquirer for Boston, he said. Further, valuations on potential pure-play spine targets could move higher ""as Stryker still has firepower and the appetite for deals,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?When To Sell Great Stocks: Take Profits Regularly, Mostly At 20%-25%

2,JNJ,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix. The industry average is 4.1%.Research is improving, though, Hendrix says. Scientists are aware of the potential impact of beta-amyloid and tau, as well as a number of approaches targeting different stages. In the end, it could be enough for an Alzheimer's treatment to just delay the beginning of the disease by several years, he says.""It might be possible to delay the onset for us to die of something else,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What You Should ExpectHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

J&J's Janssen unit terminated a study testing its drug Darzalex with Tecentriq in patients with an advanced type of lung cancer, according to a news release over the weekend. These patients were previously treated.The decision followed a review by an independent data monitoring committee which found ""no observed benefit"" for the regimen vs. Tecentriq alone. In addition, the committee noted a ""numerical increase"" in patient deaths among those who received the combination.Based on the findings, Janssen also decided to discontinue a study evaluating Darzalex with a drug similar to Tecentriq in patients with multiple myeloma.

4,JNJ,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) became the latest Tuesday in a series of pharmaceutical companies to scrap studies of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment that appeared unlikely to work.The drugmakers discontinued Phase 3 studies of a drug called lanabecestat. An independent data monitoring committee predicted lanabecestat would miss its goals in studies in early Alzheimer's disease and in mild Alzheimer's dementia.""The complexity of Alzheimer's disease poses one of the most difficult medical challenges of our time,"" Lilly Research Labs President Daniel Skovronsky said in a written statement. ""We are grateful for the contributions of the study participants and their families.""Lanabecestat belongs to a class of drugs called BACE inhibitors, which work to prevent the buildup of a substance called beta amyloid plaque in the brain.

Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) ended studies of its drug, verubecestat, in mild-to-moderate and early Alzheimer's disease.Earlier this year, fellow Dow Jones stock Pfizer (PFE) abandoned its research into treatments for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In May, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stopped studies of its BACE inhibitor in patients with late-stage Alzheimer's disease on liver worries.In 2016, Lilly stock crashed after another drug missed its goals in a Phase 3 study. Lilly studied the drug, solanezumab, in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease.The market is increasingly looking to Biogen, which is working on a monoclonal antibody. Its drug, known as aducanumab, works to remove beta amyloid plaques in the brain. Analysts expect Biogen to have data for its key study in 2019 or 2020.Lilly said Tuesday it doesn't expect significant costs associated with its decision to end these studies of a potential Alzheimer's disease treatment.

5,JNJ,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

6,JNJ,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) broke past a buy point on heavy volume and hit a record high Wednesday after ""knocking it out of the park once again"" during its first quarter, an analyst said.Shares of Intuitive jumped 8.2% to close at 471.03 on the stock market today. The stock broke out of a consolidation that began forming in late January with a buy point at 452.10. Intuitive also joined Investor's Business Daily's Leaderboard.All signs point to a strong 2018, Canaccord analyst Jason Mills said in a note to clients.""The firm continues to produce best-in-class results in large-cap medtech, knocking it out of the park once again in the first quarter,"" he said. The lion's share of first-quarter metrics ""all handily eclipsed expectations.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut analysts were more split on procedure growth and expectations. During the quarter, the number of procedures using Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System rose about 15%. Intuitive cited growing demand for U.S. general surgery and worldwide urologic procedures.In the U.S., the number of da Vinci procedures performed grew 14%. Growth was 18% for the rest of the world. Intuitive raised the bottom line of its 2018 outlook to 12%-15% growth in procedures. Placement of new da Vinci systems in hospitals also was a highlight, growing 46% year over year.""Ultimately, procedure growth should remain the key focus for investors, as procedure volume growth has historically been a leading indicator of additional system placements,"" Mills said.Intuitive expects it's still in the early innings of the large hernia repair market, Mills said. Hernia and general surgery are expected to be the biggest procedure volume bucket.Whereas Mills sees Intuitive as firing ""on all cylinders,"" Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar notes Intuitive didn't raise the top-end of its 2018 outlook for procedure volume. In 2017, procedures grew by 16%, he said in a note to clients.The question comes down to valuation for Intuitive stock, Kumar said. If hospitals are, in fact, purchasing da Vinci systems in anticipation of future procedure demand, then a lofty price/earnings ratio could be justified.""However, given historical comments that procedures are a leading indicator for system placements, procedures coming in-line with expectations would argue against a greater than 40 times price/earnings ratio on capital expenditures revenue beat,"" he said.Maintaining a high valuation also depends on whether Intuitive can maintain its standing as the predominant player in the market, Kumar said. Auris Health recently launched its Monarch Platform for lung biopsy. At the same time, Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are moving into the robotic surgery market.""Investors are more comfortable paying premium price/earnings ratios for assets perceived as having monopoly power,"" he said. But with other entrants coming, ""one could make a case against the sustenance of this monopoly power.""Bulls may argue that Intuitive has a technological lead on rivals. The debate is likely to come to a head in the next 12 months, Kumar said.In the meantime, Kumar says he is staying on the sidelines. Canaccord's Mills, though upped his price target on Intuitive to 430 from 410, and kept his hold rating.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The unit, which includes four branded drugs, accounted for 23.5% of total pharmaceutical sales, rising from 21% and 19.6%, respectively, in the prior two quarters.As a result, J&J boosted its full-year sales view to a range of $81 billion to $81.8 billion, with a midpoint that beats the consensus views of $81.27 billion. The Dow Jones component also reaffirmed its adjusted profit target for $8-$8.20 per share. Analysts had modeled $8.11.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro noted J&J beat expectations across the board.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pharma upside (drove) higher revenue guidance and subdued expectations could drive shares higher,"" he said in a note to clients. ""Sales for all three segments were above our estimate (with the) pharmaceutical segment being the primary source of upside.""On the stock market today, J&J shares slid 0.9% to close at 130.54.For the first quarter, J&J reported adjusted profit of $2.06 per share on $20.01 billion in sales. Both metrics rose 12.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Sales easily topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $19.38 billion. Adjusted profit beat by a nickel per share.J&J's pharmaceutical unit brought in $9.84 billion. That beat Novarro's view for $9.56 billion. Cancer drug Zytiga was the ""single biggest source of upside,"" he said. Zytiga generated $845 million in revenue, above Novarro's estimate for $708 million.Darzalex, which treats multiple myeloma in adults, also beat expectations at $432 million, he said. But sales of fellow cancer drug Imbruvica were just in line at $587 million. Respectively, sales of those drugs grew 69.4% and 43.5% vs. last year.At the same time, sales of inflammation drug Remicade declined 16.9% to $1.39 billion. It brought in just 14.1% of total pharmaceutical sales as Remicade faces competition from biologic copies known as biosimilars made by Dow's Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).J&J's consumer unit, which makes products like baby shampoo and Neutrogena, grew 5.3% to $3.4 billion in sales. The biggest upside came from its beauty products, which rose 10.5%. Meanwhile, sales from wound care products fell 6.9%.Medical device sales rose 7.5% to $6.77 billion, beating Novarro's model by $33 million. Within orthopedics, sales of spine products declined 8.9%, leading a 2.8% dip in sales of knee replacements. Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar called the results ""soft"" in that segment.But ""we think most of this was due to tougher sequential comparisons,"" he said in a note. ""Normalizing for this, we think first quarter sequential volume trends slowed by 100 to 200 base points.""RELATED:UnitedHealth Tops Earnings Views, Hikes Outlook SlightlyHow Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

9,JNJ,"A rumored buyout of drugmaker Tesaro (TSRO) by Swiss drugmaker Roche (RHHBY) — which sent shares of Tesaro soaring Wednesday — makes little sense from a strategic standpoint, one analyst says.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay sees the combination as unlikely ""given what we see as a lack of a compelling strategic rationale."" Tesaro makes an ovarian cancer drug called Zejula, which competes against rival drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS).MacKay notes Tesaro's 2018 guidance for Zejula sales is in trouble as rivalries grow in ovarian cancer drug sales. He expects Tesaro to lower its full-year outlook. That would make a potential acquirer hesitant, he said in a report to clients.Spanish website Intereconomia.com said late Tuesday that Roche is interested in acquiring Tesaro after it announced its plan to buy Foundation Medicine (FMI). The site reports Roche could announce the acquisition of Tesaro in the next few days.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt the closing bell on the stock market today, Tesaro stock rocketed 16.3%, to 46.49. The stock popped as much as 19.6% in earlier trading. Roche lifted 2.1%, to 27.09. At the same time, biotech stocks rose less than 1.5%.Further, Tesaro already has ongoing collaborations with Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) in treating forms of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It's also partnered with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in developing Zejula to treat prostate cancer.Roche, on the other hand, is collaborating with Roche's rival Clovis in treating gynecological tumors. Clovis makes an ovarian cancer drug called Rubraca. The duo is testing Rubraca with Roche's immuno-oncology drug called Tecentriq.""With Roche's focus on developing/acquiring best-in-class molecules, we see Rubraca (with its in-line effectiveness and superior safety vs. Zejula) as a potentially better fit within the context of this strategy than Zejula,"" MacKay said.Tesaro, too, already has partnerships with Zejula in markets outside the U.S. This may detract from the value of acquiring it for a global pharmaceutical company like Roche.On the flip side, Roche and Tesaro do have an ongoing clinical collaboration to look at Roche's Tecentriq with Zejula in bladder cancer. Researchers are also combining Zejula and Roche's drug Avastin in a form of ovarian cancer.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

10,JNJ,"Heron Pharmaceuticals (HRTX) catapulted to a three-year high Monday after its post-surgical pain drug outperformed a component used in a rival drug from Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX) in a pair of head-to-head tests.On the stock market today, Heron rocketed 27% to close at 27.30, hitting its highest point since September 2015. Shares of Pacira toppled nearly 10% on the news at one point, but ended the day down 0.7% to 30.68.The trial pitted Heron's drug HTX-011 and bupivacaine, a component of Pacira's already-approved Exparel in patients who had either had a bunion removed or a hernia repaired. In both cases, HTX-011 was superior to a placebo and bupivacaine, Heron said in a news release.Needham analyst Serge Belanger says the data likely support a broad label for HTX-011 if approved. HTX-011 also cut down on the number of patients needing opioids to curb their pain.""Heron believes the data supports an opioid-sparing label, which would be a significant game-changer,"" Belanger said in a note to clients. He raised his price target on Heron to 42 from 30, and kept his buy rating.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHTX-011 cut pain through 72 hours following surgery by 27% and 23%, respectively, vs. a placebo in bunion and hernia patients. On the same measure vs. bupivacaine, HTX-011 reduced pain by 18% and 21%, respectively.Among bunion patients, 29% required no opioids for 72 hours following surgery vs. 2% and 11% of patients on a placebo and bupivacaine, respectively. Of hernia patients, 51% didn't need opioids for pain management vs. 22% and 40% of placebo- and bupivacaine-receiving patients.""Overall, the Phase 3 data confirm prior results seen in three Phase 2 trials where HTX-011 was superior to placebo and (bupivacaine) on both pain relief and opioid consumption,"" Belanger said.In late 2018, Heron plans to report data from two Phase 2 trials of HTX-011 in pain relief for patients after knee replacement surgery and following breast augmentation, he said. The data are expected to be part of Heron's application for approval of HTX-011.""There are an estimated 300 million surgical procedures in the U.S. on an annual basis that require postoperative pain management,"" Belanger said.HTX-011 is poised to be a ""major player"" in that industry. Exparel currently holds about 3% of the market and generates around $300 million in annual sales, he said.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said Heron will likely seek a similar reimbursement strategy for HTX-011 as Exparel.The announcement is the last of the near-term overhangs on Pacira, she said in a report to clients. But Pacira is unlikely to rebound as investors look for HTX-011 to enter the market and amid the declining potential that Dow Jones stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) will buy Pacira.Still, Exparel has some advantage being earlier to the market than HTX-011.""Exparel has been approved since October 2011 and is extremely familiar to hospitals and surgeons,"" she said. ""The government is likely to approve policies that incentivize usage of opioid alternatives, so reimbursement could become more favorable and further increase utilization.""RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityThe Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With HandleLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

The S&P 500 fought to hold a gain of less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq Composite opened to a narrow loss, despite strong early gains from Qualcomm (QCOM) and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Both stocks had kicked into gear, leading the Nasdaq 100 index, after the Wall Street Journal reported Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said China-based telecom giant ZTE would pay a $1 billion fine to the U.S. ZTE had been banned from buying U.S.-made components, due to violations of U.S. sanctions against North Korea.A planned $44 billion merger between Qualcomm and NXP had been stalled by Chinese regulators following the U.S. ruling against ZTE.

Chipmaker Entegris reported the unit produced earnings of $33.1 million and $91.5 million in revenue for 2017. Entegris' early gain broke the stock out past a 38.35 buy point in third stage cup base.Despite powerful gains by Qualcomm and NXP, heavy early losses from Vodafone Group (VOD) and Lam Research (LRCX) helped drag the Nasdaq 100 into negative premarket territory.But Nasdaq-listed Zscaler spiked 31.8% at the open. The security software play's fiscal third-quarter results showed its loss narrowed to 2 cents a share during the quarter, vs. expectations for an 8-cent per-share loss. Revenue rose a much-better-than-forecast 50%. Zscaler has soared nearly 17% since the start of June, to 92% above its March IPO price.

Same-store sales came in a bit lighter than expected, but management gave Q2 revenue and earnings guidance well above consensus targets.

12,JNJ,"A dozen drugs launching in 2018 from heavy hitters like Roche (RHHBY), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are expected to reach blockbuster status by the end of 2022, an analytics firm says.Clarivate Analytics describes 2018 as ""the year of the blockbuster,"" in which these 12 drugs have either launched or are expected to launch, and eventually bring in north of $1 billion in sales over a five-year period. That's the biggest number since Clarivate began making its forecast in 2013.It's setting up ""to be an exciting year that will see valuable additions to existing treatments as well as disruptions to certain markets and first-in-class treatment options for some diseases,"" the firm said in its report, issued late Thursday.By the end of 2022, three drugs from Roche, Gilead and Novo Nordisk (NVO) are expected to top $3 billion each in annual sales with the remaining nine likely to account for $1 billion to $2 billion a year in revenue, analysts said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAmong the 12 are two diabetes drugs, a Food and Drug Administration-approved medicine derived from cannabis plants and the first in a series of drugs expected to prevent migraines in some patients. In all, these dozen drugs are projected to collectively top $22.5 billion in sales in 2022.Roche's Hemlibra, a treatment for some patients with hemophilia A, tops the list and is expected to generate north of $4 billion in sales in 2022. Though there only 350,000 hemophilia A patients in the world — with roughly 30% of them eligible for Hemlibra — the treatment costs $482,000 the first year and $448,000 every year after that.The drug was approved three months early and launched in December 2017. Sales of $496 million are forecast for 2018 with the drug set to reach blockbuster status in 2019 at a forecasted $1.46 billion.Hemlibra is expected to take share from Shire's (SHPG) Feiba and Novo Nordisk's NovoSeven.Hemlibra also will compete against Bioverativ's (BIVV) Eloctate and Shire's Advate. For 2018, Eloctate was forecast to be a blockbuster, but Advate will continue to be the market leader with an estimated $1.8 billion in sales.""However, (Advate) sales are forecast to decline further thereafter,"" the Clarivate report said.Gilead's Biktarvy grabbed approval in February and targets an estimated 37 million people globally living with HIV. Of those, 21 million are receiving antiretroviral therapy which suppresses viral replication and allows the immune system to strengthen.Biktarvy adds to Gilead's HIV franchise which has long rivaled that of GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The two have traded market share since 2006 when Gilead first entered the market with Atripla. Two of Gilead's HIV drugs were featured in Clarivate's 2016 Drugs to Watch report.In 2019, Biktarvy will become a blockbuster, generating $2.28 billion in sales before spiking to $4.3 billion in 2021 and declining to $3.72 billion in 2022, the report says. The trajectory is similar to GSK drug Triumeq, which is expected to bring in $3.68 billion this year, five years after its launch.Rounding out the top three, Novo Nordisk got approval for diabetes drug Ozempic in December. The drug helps stimulate the body's own insulin release and limit how much sugar gets into the blood from the liver, and slows down how quickly food leaves the stomach.Ozempic is expected to become a blockbuster in 2020 with $1.58 billion in revenue on its way to $3.47 billion in 2022.In 2017, immuno-oncology treatments from Novartis (NVS) and Gilead grabbed headlines for ""their ability to revolutionize the treatment of the disease,"" the report said. And more than half of all drugs on the potential blockbuster list were cancer therapies.But in 2018 just one drug on the list of expected blockbusters is a cancer treatment.Erleada, a product of Dow Jones component Johnson & Johnson, was approved in February to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer that hasn't spread across the body. J&J and fellow Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) have drugs that treat the same cancer once it's spread.""While Zytiga and Xtandi battle to expand their market share, including the market for patients with non-metastatic disease, J&J's second-generation oral anti-androgen, Erleada, became the first approved in that setting in mid-February 2018,"" Clarivate said.The drug is projected to bring in $1.2 billion in 2020 and rise to $2 billion in 2022. It also could be expanded to treat other forms of prostate cancer and in combination with J&J's Zytiga contribute to its blockbuster potential.In 2021, GSK's shingles vaccine, called Shingrix, and a rare disease drug from Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) known as patisiran are expected to join the blockbuster list with $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion in sales, respectively.Revenue is expected to hit a respective $1.37 billion and $1.21 billion in 2022.GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH) is expected to grab approval this summer for the first cannabidiol drug derived from the cannabis plant to treat patients with two seizure disorders. In 2022, the drug, called Epidiolex, is expected to generate $1.19 billion in sales.""If approved, Epidiolex will likely encounter bureaucratic barriers to distribution and political hurdles associated with cannabis-derived medicines, particularly in the U.S., where strict guidelines for use of medicinal cannabis exist,"" the report said.But the biotech isn't alone in this market. Cara Pharmaceuticals (CARA), Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals (ZYNE) are also working on treatments based on the cannabis plant.A migraine drug from Amgen (AMGN) and Novartis, Aimovig, is projected to bring in $115 million in 2018 sales before spiking to $1.17 billion in 2022 sales. This drug, and others like it, seek to prevent migraines by blocking a specific peptide, or group of amino acids.If approved, Aimovig would be the first drug known as an anti-CGRP to market, ahead of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA), Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Eli Lilly (LLY). Allergan (AGN) also is working in this area.""A first-in-class mover advantage will be crucial for Aimovig since competition from two other subcutaneously administered monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP is not far behind,"" Clarivate said. Lilly and Teva filed for FDA approval of their drugs late last year.Meanwhile, Alder is in Phase 3 testing with its drug. Analysts are worried, though, that Alder may falter in submitting its application to the FDA after co-founder Randall Schatzman unexpectedly stepped down from his chief executive role on Tuesday.In other areas, Shire's lanadelumab, a treatment for a swelling disorder, is forecast to bring in $1.15 billion in 2022. Next is AbbVie's (ABBV) Elagolix, a treatment for painful symptoms associated with menstruation.Rounding out the list, Pfizer and Merck's (MRK) diabetes drug Steglatro and Indivior's opioid dependence drug Sublocade are forecast to become blockbusters in 2022 with $1.09 billion and $1.07 billion in sales, respectively.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?How To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

That topped expectations for $10.4 million, Needham analyst Serge Belanger said in a note to clients.The momentum has continued with Xtampza prescriptions up about 74% quarter over quarter in the first eight weeks of the first quarter ""due to the inclusion of the product as the exclusive oxycodone (extended release) on numerous prominent plans,"" he said.""Xtampza is well-positioned to continue growth,"" Belanger said.

19,JNJ,"Pacira Pharmaceuticals (PCRX) collapsed to a five-year low Friday after U.S. regulators voted against recommending its biggest moneymaking drug for a key expansion in regional anesthesia.X On the stock market today, Pacira plummeted 16.5% to close at 30.15, ending the week at its lowest point since June 2013. That defied a fractional jump in the broader biotech group as stocks climbed for the sixth day running.Analysts had counted on the Food and Drug Administration's approval to expand revenue of its local anesthetic, called Exparel. But on Thursday an FDA panel voted 6-4 against recommending the approval of Exparel as a regional pain drug.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have been in an upswing for six days straight, but is the market turning around after hitting a correction earlier this month? The Investor's Corner outlines key aspects to look for when sizing up a turnaround.""It should be noted that the five anesthesiologists on the panel voted 4-1 against approval,"" Needham analyst Serge Belanger wrote in a note. ""It now seems unlikely that FDA will approve the label expansion, even for a narrow indication, without additional studies.""Belanger downgraded Pacira stock to a hold rating from buy.Exparel was tested as a regional anesthetic in patients following shoulder and knee surgeries. Panelists discussed the risk of falls in patients after knee surgery and whether Exparel could be approved for blocking specific nerves, Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said.""There was concern that usage via a femoral nerve block (after knee surgery) could prolong quadriceps weakness, thereby inhibiting the extent to which a patient can ambulate, and to the extent that a patient is ambulating, increasing the risk of a fall,"" he said in a note.But Amsellem kept his overweight rating and 49 price target on Pacira, saying the absence of a label expansion won't prevent Pacira from enjoying steady long-term volume growth of the drug.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!Exparel brought in $78.7 million in fourth-quarter sales, accounting for nearly all of $79.1 million in total revenue, Pacira said in a preliminary release last month.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler suggested Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could acquire Pacira for its base business and potential cost synergies. But, following the FDA panel on Exparel, ""the likelihood of takeout is now somewhat lower,"" she said in a note to clients.Pacira said it will work with the FDA to address outstanding panel concerns ahead of the full FDA meeting in April.The ultimate goal, Chief Executive Dave Stack said in a written statement, is to offer ""additional flexibility in the way Exparel can be administered so that clinicians and patients alike have increased opportunity to realize the benefits of long-lasting non-opioid pain control.""RELATED:AbbVie Stock Rises After Increasing Dividend By 35%This Biotech Stock Pops 30% On FDA Nod — 'Slamming Door' On WoesWhy Biogen May Seek A Merger In The Wake Of Alzheimer's Worries

21,JNJ,"Tuesday's premarket trading received several shots in the arm. First was Netflix (NFLX), which surged after reporting strong first-quarter results late Monday. Then a cohort of blue chip names kicked in and posted early advances, following above-expectation quarterly results.The result: futures for the Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 1%. The S&P 500 traded 0.8% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures pressed 1.1% higher.Netflix was the premarket trading powerhouse, up more than 7% and easily the largest gainer among Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 stocks. Merck (MRK) bolstered the Dow in early trade, following an analyst upgrade. But the drugmaker quickly surrendered its lead as investors waded into an early batch of blue-chip earnings reports from Goldman Sachs (GS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH).The positive premarket trading poised the week-old uptrend to hurdle resistance. The uptrend is in good standing, carrying no distribution days. But the 50-day moving average remains the key test for all three major indexes.

Chips account for a big share of the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index. Chips also are in just about every tech product. So if chip stock stocks are faring well, there's a good bet that chip demand is strong, and thus demand for a variety of tech gear is also strong.And yet, chip stocks have been lagging the S&P 500 index since the market peaked just over a month ago.

Boston shares spiked on the rumor as Stryker toppled. But Canaccord analysts say Stryker could be far from the only medical device maker with interest in Boston.""If the headlines are substantiated and Stryker is in fact making a bid on Boston Scientific, we see a high likelihood that J&J could emerge as another potential bidder,"" they said in a note to clients.

""Indeed, we see merits to such a combination from the standpoint of product line synergies.""For Stryker, the acquisition would help it add products in sectors with higher potential for growth and in bigger markets. It would also help Stryker to differentiate its portfolio of technologies and compete with large companies like J&J and Medtronic (MDT).In Boston's case, the deal would cap a five-year turnaround, allowing it to ""end on a high-note,"" Canaccord analysts said.""In sum, we definitively think Boston Scientific is game to do a fair deal here,"" they said.But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro viewed the deal ""unfavorably,"" though acknowledged from a strategic rationale the it would make sense. It's also likely Boston won't OK any deal for less than $40 per share.""It would combine two of the premier growth companies in the (medical device) space, and there would be limited product overlap,"" he said. However, ""the bar for value creation is set high given the potential valuations of both companies.""A combined Stryker-Boston Scientific would have 2019 revenue of around $25 billion. It stands to grow at a sustainable 6% or higher compound annual growth rate in the medium term, Novarro said. It would have an enterprise value of about $61 billion.Canaccord analysts called the potential deal a ""merger of equals."" Stryker is only about a third larger than Boston. It could also lead to further med-tech consolidation.""If consummated, this would create four $100 billion behemoths in (medical devices) with Stryker/Boston Scientific joining Abbott (ABT), J&J and Medtronic,"" they said.

It's expected to bring in $47 million in the first quarter, and ""sales look to be tracking ahead of the consensus projecting out longer term, in 2019,"" he said.Hepatitis C drugs Harvoni and Epclusa are seen beating views for $923 million. Abrahams models $1.02 billion for the two drugs. That's despite competition from AbbVie's (ABBV) new drug Mavyret, which treats a wide group of hepatitis C patients.""If the franchises perform as we expect, we could see an 8-cent bottom-line beat in the first quarter and earnings per share tracking to exceed the consensus for the year — which we believe would help drive upside as the pipeline matures and visibility increases into earnings growth in the out years,"" he said.Abrahams has an outperform rating on Gilead shares.Biogen looks ""generally solid"" for the first quarter. Abrahams expects $3.13 billion in sales to be slightly below the consensus for $3.15 billion based on prescription trends. He expects earnings per share to come in 8 cents below the consensus.Multiple sclerosis drug Tecfidera is experiencing steady erosion. But Celgene's experimental drug ozanimod has been delayed in multiple sclerosis. Meanwhile, revenue from spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza is likely to be in line.""With multiple sclerosis contracts for 2018 secured, key competitor ozanimod delayed and a temporary lull in competitive spinal muscular atrophy news flow, we expect the focus of the call to be on potential out-year growth drivers,"" he said.The biotech is expected to outline plans for aducanumab, which is being tested in Alzheimer's disease. Recently, Biogen made some changes to its studies for the drug. Investors also are likely to key in on potential acquisition talk.""We expect shares to trade in-line pending more clarity on the long-term picture,"" he said. Abrahams boosted his price target to 330 from 316. He has a sector perform rating on the stock.The first quarter tends to be seasonally weak for Celgene, ""though we believe it should be solid enough to allay any concerns emerging following the departure of their president/chief operating officer,"" Abrahams said.Abrahams boosted his expectations for inflammation drug Otezla to $346 million in the first quarter and $1.63 billion for the year — in line with consensus views. Otezla sales have been a source of pain in the past, widely missing in the third period before rebounding in the fourth.But Abrahams lowered views for Pomalyst, an anti-cancer drug, ""to reflect weaker-than-expected use patterns"" and the likelihood of indirect erosion from Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Darzalex.Investor focus will be on the next steps for ozanimod after U.S. regulators rejected the drug in multiple sclerosis. Celgene could also offer up further details for Acceleron Pharma (XLRN)-partnered luspatercept in blood diseases.Abrahams cut his price target to 120 from 131. But he has Celgene as a top pick stock.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses Short

30,JNJ,"U.S. stock indexes sauntered to small gains midday Friday, with only small caps holding a losing hand for the week. Volume was running higher on the NYSE but flat on the Nasdaq.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average sagged 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which was on track for a loss for the week, rose 0.8%.Breakouts midday Friday in strong volume included Signature Bank (SBNY), up 3% in volume 78% above average, and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA), up 3% in volume 330% greater than usual. Lions Gate has been rallying on word that the company is in buyout talks.Investors also might want to monitor stocks that are either in buy zones or close to buy points. For example, despite rising 25% last year and 5% year to date, the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average still has some potential buy opportunities.Stocks in their 5% buy zones include Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM), Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and DowDuPont (DWDP).Dow stocks in bases and not far from potential buy points include Coca-Cola (KO) and Travelers Companies (TRV).Of the above seven Dow stocks, four are expected to accelerate earnings growth in 2018. The four are Apple, Travelers, DowDuPont and Coca-Cola. Each has a base that is either first or second stage.As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.The base count is one reason why Apple may have more left as an investment. Also, Apple grew earnings 11% in fiscal 2017 ended in September, and the Street expects growth to pick up to 24% in fiscal 2018. While the 24% growth may be priced into the stock, earnings surprises offer the potential for additional thrust.Meanwhile, among IBD's 197 industry groups, three groups have shown uncommon strength this week.Over the past five sessions, the chip equipment group jumped 7% (think of stocks such as Applied Materials (AMAT)), while the commercial document group popped 4% (think label company Multi-Color (LABL)) and the hotel segment rose 3% (think La Quinta (LQ)).

31,JNJ,"The Nasdaq composite outperformed Friday in an uneventful session that saw the Dow Jones industrial lag, mostly due to weakness in IBM (IBM) and American Express (AXP), which both reported earnings.X IBM gapped down, falling 4%, despite reporting a 4% rise in sales. That news was offset by gross margin and operating margin that came in below views. American Express, meanwhile, lost nearly 2% after reporting earnings and announcing it's suspending its share buyback program for the first half of 2018.The Nasdaq ended a shortened week of trading with a gain of nearly 0.6%; the S&P 500 picked up 0.4% and the Dow added 0.2%. Major stock indexes extended their weekly win streaks to three, shrugging off the threat of a possible government shutdown. Small caps were the stars of the day as the Russell 2000 jumped 1.2%. It's not far from cracking through the 1,600 level.The U.S. dollar was weak again, near a three-year low, while the 10-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 2.64%.Among the FANG names, Amazon.com (AMZN) gave back early gains, but still rose 0.1%, on news it's raising its monthly Prime membership to $12.99 from $10.99.Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, got a flurry of price target hikes ahead of its earnings report Monday after the close. Shares rose less than 0.1% ahead of the results.In the stock market today, Nvidia (NVDA) was a nice gainer in the Nasdaq 100, helped by positive comments from BofA Merrill Lynch.

32,JNJ,"Analysts weren't surprised Wednesday after Dow's Merck (MRK) terminated a late-stage study of a potential Alzheimer's disease drug and argued that it won't have implications for Biogen (BIIB) which announced an expansion to a key Alzheimer's trial, but Biogen shares fell anyway.X Late Wednesday, after its shares slid as much as 9.1%, Biogen announced it would enroll 510 more patients to the original recruitment plan for its Phase 3 aducanumab trials. Enrollment is still expected to be complete by mid-2018, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients.Biogen's news follows Merck's decision late Tuesday to scrap a study of a drug called verubecestat in patients with early-stage Alzheimer's disease. Verubecestat is known as a BACE inhibitor and aims to prevent the buildup of amyloid plaques in the brain associated with Alzheimer's.""In the context of Merck's recent disappointment with the Merck BACE inhibitor verubecestat, Biogen's aducanumab is one of what is now only a handful of Alzheimer's medicines still active in pivotal trials,"" Porges said.Merck halted a late-stage trial of verubecestat this time last year when investigators found it had ""virtually no chance"" of working in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said the failure was a disappointment, but not surprising.""We remained hopeful that the drug would potentially show some benefit if given to patients earlier in the course of the disease,"" he said in a note to clients. ""We now remove all verubecestat revenues from our model.""Divan cut his price target on Merck to 65 from 66, though he kept his outperform rating. Merck will likely have to seek out mergers big enough to ""move the needle"" on a $150 billion market cap company with annual sales north of $40 billion.""The rest of the business is not strong enough to allow for the growth they are seeing in oncology to come through,"" he said. ""While today's news was not unexpected, we do believe it adds incremental pressure on Merck to pursue business development opportunities to bring additional growth drivers into their mid-late-stage pipeline.""IBD'S TAKE: The 50-day moving average can be used to pinpoint times of opportunity or risk in stocks. How? Head to the Investor's Corner for more tips on smart stock buying and selling tips.Evercore analyst Umer Raffat points out ""any failure in the (Alzheimer's) space is never good news."" Others including Biogen/Eisai, Eli Lilly (LLY)/AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are also working on BACE inhibitors.Biogen's aducanumab works differently from the BACE inhibitors. It aims to remove plaque buildup in the brain. Analysts are particularly hopeful for the prospects of aducanumab.""If you look at the actual amount of amyloid plaque reduction with BACE inhibitors, it's dramatically less than what Biogen saw with aducanumab,"" Raffat said in a report. ""This plaque reduction on aducanumab is by the far the most important thing going in Biogen's favor.""RBC analyst Brian Abrahams is more bullish on aducanumab than Biogen/Eisai's BACE inhibitor, elenbecestat.""Though aducanumab also targets beta-amyloid, we would not necessarily make direct read-throughs from failure of a BACE inhibitor to a beta-amyloid targeting monoclonal antibody,"" he said. ""We believe the unknowns about the beta-amyloid hypothesis are already baked into Biogen shares.""On the stock market today, Biogen tumbled 6.6% to close at 296.08. Merck was unchanged at 54.90.RELATED:These Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystBiotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThis Biotech Stock Rocketed On An Immuno-Oncology Tie With Bristol

33,JNJ,"Business software, internet, chip and FANG stocks got pummeled on Tuesday as the Nasdaq composite suffered the worst of the stock market's decline. The more broadly diversified Dow Jones industrial average fell less.With less than an hour to go in the session, the tech-driven Nasdaq sank 3%, essentially wiping out nearly all of Monday's strong rebound. The Nasdaq 100 reversed from session highs to fall nearly 3.7%.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, generally a lagging market index, resisted the stock market sell-off for much of the session, but was down more than 1.5% heading into the close. Defensive Dow Jones plays Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) rose modestly.Worries over the future of self-driving technology efforts in the wake of a fatality during a recent Uber driving test in Arizona appear to be sparking some of the sell-off across the tech sector.The automaker group fell the most among IBD's 197 industry groups and subgroups, down 7.2%. Tesla (TSLA) paced the decline, dropping more than 8% in volume running 130% above usual levels. The all-electric vehicle pioneer undercut support near the 290-300 level it had been enjoying since early May of 2017.The Dow saw at least eight of its 30 stocks fall 2 points or more, including tech heavyweights Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Apple, down 2.6% at 168.34, failed to hold early gains one day after it reclaimed the key 50-day moving average. However, the iPhone giant is still just 8% below its all-time high of 183.50.

The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond dropped to 2.78%, the lowest since Feb. 6.Financial giants Visa (V) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also lost 2 points or more. Visa, falling nearly 3% to 117.40 in average trade, has been unable to rebound sharply since it sliced through the 50-day moving average on Thursday for the second time this month.Notice on a daily chart how on March 2, the first time the credit card and debit card payment processor undercut the 50-day line, Visa managed to bounce off its lows and finish mildly above that key support-and-resistance level. So, continued to failure to quickly retake the 50-day moving average would indicate a change in the stock's character.Dow Jones tech component Microsoft reversed from decent early gains and plunged nearly 4%, back below the key 50-day moving average.Boeing (BA) dropped nearly 2% despite recent news that it may win a huge airplane order from American Airlines (AAL).Boeing triggered a key sell signal when it ditched its 50-day moving average in heavy volume two weeks ago. But since then, the stock has not given up a whole lot of ground. This suggests that the aerospace giant may have enough long-term institutional demand to craft a new base in the future.At 321, the military jet, airline and satellite maker trades less than 14% below an all-time peak of 371.60.

34,JNJ,"Shares of Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) toppled early Tuesday after a U.S. appeals court upheld a ruling that invalidated a patent on blockbuster arthritis drug Remicade, just a week after it lost another blockbuster patent.X The decision limits J&J's ability to seek damages from fellow Dow stock Pfizer (PFE), which launched its Remicade biosimilar Inflectra in late 2016. According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the antibodies covered were disclosed in an earlier patent, Bloomberg reported.J&J stock dipped as much as 2.9% on the news, which came about the time of its fourth-quarter earnings report. By the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J tumbled 4.3% to finish at 141.83. Just last week, the nation's top patent court invalidated a patent covering blockbuster cancer drug Zytiga.During the quarter, sales of Remicade fell 9.7% worldwide with the steepest decline in international sales, down 18.7% vs. the year-earlier period. Remicade is part of J&J's immunology unit, which grew 5.1%. But J&J says Remicade faced ""increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.""Evercore analyst Umer Raffat says Pfizer's Inflectra, which competes directly with Remicade, didn't get much traction in the fourth quarter. Pfizer contends in its court complaint that J&J has blocked access to an overwhelming share of consumers with its ""Biosimilar Readiness Plan.""""It seems that J&J is protecting the volume by engaging in proactive rebating, which basically limits the uptake of any biosimilar,"" Raffat said in a note to clients.Late Tuesday, Pfizer issued this prepared statement: ""This is a good day for patients battling chronic diseases, because the court has ruled a key patent that J&J has asserted to block access to Inflectra is invalid. However, J&J continues to use their scheme of exclusionary contracts to maintain Remicade's monopoly position that prevent patients, payers and providers from the opportunity to benefit from Inflectra.""J&J responded by saying: ""We are disappointed with the Court's ruling. We believe that biopharmaceutical intellectual property protections, such as patents and data protection, enable us to invest in the discovery and development of tomorrow's life-changing and life-saving new medicines. We're proud of the impact Remicade has made in improving the health and lives of more than 2.6 million people worldwide and are committed to helping ensure Remicade remains accessible and affordable to patients.""Meanwhile, the new tax rate for corporations helped J&J issue Street-topping 2018 profit guidance, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said after the bellwether health giant beat fourth-quarter sales and earnings expectations.But the full-year revenue forecast lagged analysts' collective view and drugs acquired through the takeover of Actelion Pharma missed Novarro's expectations.For 2018, J&J calls for $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion in sales and adjusted income of $8-$8.20 per share. Revenue guidance lagged the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $81.56 billion, but the adjusted earnings forecast crushed views for $7.86 a share.IBD'S TAKE: Some biotechs are poised to surprise to the upside in the fourth quarter, while others are still struggling with competition taking the edge off key products, analysts said in a preview of the earnings season. See what other schemes might crop up by visiting IBD Industry Themes.Novarro, who was less bullish, had predicted $79.7 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $7.90 per share for 2018.""We believe higher revenue guidance is a combination of better pharmaceutical performance and currency, while a lower tax rate is partially responsible for higher (earnings per share) guidance,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, the Dow stock reported adjusted income of $1.74 per share on $20.2 billion in sales, growing a respective 10.1% and 11.5% year over year. The consensus was for adjusted profit of $1.72 a share on $20.2 billion in sales.Worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $9.68 billion narrowly beat analysts' collective view for $9.66 billion, Novarro said. Organically, sales growth was 7.6% on a constant-currency basis.Sales of anticoagulant Xarelto and a schizophrenia drug topped expectations, he said. Cancer drugs Imbruvica and Darzalex were in line, while plaque psoriasis and Crohn's disease drug Stelara missed.Drugs bought in the acquisition of Actelion Pharma broadly missed Novarro's forecast by $65 million. But the more ""important brands,"" Opsumit and Uptravi, brought in-line sales.Medical device sales of $6.97 billion topped Novarro's estimate by $60 million. Revenue from the consumer segment met Novarro's view for $3.54 billion.RELATED:Will Biotech Merger's 'Spigot' Turn On After Juno, Bioverativ?Which Biotech Stocks Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?This Biotech Stock Rocketed 15% On Rumors Biogen Could Buy It

38,JNJ,"Major stock indexes turned negative in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, not a surprise given the ebullient gains during the first two weeks of trading in 2018.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 both showed losses of around 0.4% to 0.5% after rising as much as 1% and 0.8%, respectively. The 500 breached 2800 for the first time. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% after rising as much as 1.1% in the early going.At one point, at least nine of the 30 components in the Dow industrials advanced 1 point or more, By around 3 p.m. ET, however, only three stocks in the Dow were up 1 point or more, and all three hailed from the health care arena: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK) and UnitedHealth (UNH).Merck gapped up nearly 6% to 62.07 in quadruple normal turnover on good news regarding a potential treatment involving Keytruda with two additional medicines for lung cancer. For now, Merck continues to be in base-building mode.Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was running sharply higher vs. the same time on Friday.Meanwhile, Bitcoin and other alternative digital currencies continued to cool off. Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) gave back most of Friday's rebound, losing 10% to 1,763. However, the overall picture of the fast-rising exchange-traded note has not changed. It's been in a normal correction since peaking at 3,523 on Dec. 19, and Tuesday marks the start of a fifth week of digesting the superlative gains seen in the fourth quarter of last year.On Nov. 22, Bitcoin Investment Trust broke out of a very deep cup with handle at 985.10 and roared more than 257% higher in less than a month. On a daily chart, one can see that Bitcoin Investment is trying to halt its slide at the 50-day moving average.Crude oil prices and copper eased too, while gold prices rose on the back of a weaker U.S. dollar. The euro last week moved past $1.22 for the first time since December 2015. WTI near-term futures edged 0.7% lower to $63.88 a barrel.Market breadth turned negative in U.S. equities, with losing stocks outmatching winners by nearly 2-to-1 on both exchanges.A few leading stocks let their strong gains slip. Weibo (WB) moved past a 122.31 buy point in a seven-week cup with handle and rallied to as high as 128.37, up 4.9% past the proper entry. But the stock backtracked to cut its gain to roughly 1%.The decline within Weibo's cup base runs from 123 on the left-side peak to 97.49, a correction of 20.7%. That's within the normal parameters for this important chart pattern for investors on the hunt for strong breakouts. However, the most recent base is late stage, which increases the risk of failure.The Chinese social network broke out of a first-stage base at 19.20, also a cup with handle, during the week ended April 8, 2016.Weibo was initially featured in the IBD Stock Analysis column on March 24, 2016. It also became the 10th current stock on IBD Leaderboard on Tuesday, joining fellow Chinese ADRs Autohome (ATHM) and 58.com (WUBA).Weibo wasn't alone in terms of top-rated companies starting the MLK holiday-shortened trading week on a sour note.LGI Homes (LGIH) fell more than 8% to 69.53 and triggered one sell signal as volume jumped 125% above its 50-day average. The stock posted its biggest point drop since breaking out of a solid seven-week cup base at 50.05 on Oct. 2. Tuesday's drop was also the largest since the entry-level homebuilder cleared an earlier, deeper cup base at 40.57 in late June 2017.Shares in LGI are now testing institutional buying support at the critical 50-day moving average.Lithium metal supplier Sociedad Quimica (SQM), NetEase (NTES), New Oriental Education (EDU) and streaming video hardware play Roku (ROKU) also staged negative reversals in heavy or increasing volume. Such concerted selling hinted at some pronounced profit-taking among mutual funds, hedge funds, banks, insurers, large investment advisors and the like.Stay abreast of future potential changes in the overall market trend by reading The Big Picture column each day.Amid the broad market reversal, a few highly-rated names still acted well.Oneok (OKE) gained for a fourth day in a row, rising more than 1.3% to 59.45 in above-average turnover. The oil and gas transport play has cleared a 16-week cup pattern at 56.19 and is slightly outside the proper buy range. The 5% buy zone goes up to 59.00. Buying too far extended in price puts an investor in a vulnerable spot as a stock can quickly pull back and test the initial entry following a strong move up.Wall Street expects the Oklahome-based firm to stage a strong rebound in earnings in 2018, up 34% to $2.25 a share following a 1% climb in 2017. Fourth-quarter results are likely to be announced in late February.Oneok also sports a 5.1% annualized dividend yield.Abiomed (ABMD), the heart pump maker and one of 15 names in IBD Sector Leaders screen, rose more than 1.2% to 217.74 in slightly above-average turnover. The market leader is extended after surpassing a narrow flat base at 200.38 on Jan. 5.Abiomed scores a lofty 98 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup.Grubhub (GRUB), No. 23 in the IBD 50, is off around 0.7% yet remains above the key 50-day moving average following a two-day rebound on Thursday and Friday. Continued support at the 50-day line, or 10-week moving average on a weekly chart, would give investors a chance to add to a current position in the mobile and online food ordering service.Grubhub is up 21% since clearing a 57.71 buy point in a six-week flat base on Oct. 25 following robust third-quarter results (earnings up 22% to 28 cents a share, revenue up 32% to a record $163.1 million). The Street sees earnings accelerating to a 35% gain to 31 cents a share in Q4.RELATED:Can You Spot The Next Major Stock Market Top?

The ETF marked a new closing high on Monday as it extended its win streak for a seventh straight session. Until a drop below the 200-day moving average during last month's market rout, RPG had been advancing along the 50-day line since November 2016.It was last featured in this ETF column on Aug. 23, as shares tested support at their 50-day moving average.The $2.5 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Pure Growth Index, marked its 12th anniversary on March 1.

40,JNJ,"Stocks rose early on Tuesday but the Nasdaq surrendered moderate gains to fall mildly. The Nasdaq composite, up more than 0.6% during the first hour of trading, slumped 0.5% right before lunchtime in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average, up as much as 0.7% after the open, edged slightly lower.Alphabet (GOOGL) helped lead the pullback, falling more than 1% to 1,153. The Google site operator and pioneer in self-driving technology is forming a new base after selling off hard in early February. The megacap internet content firm limited its decline to 17% from a 1,197 peak as shares found support at the 200-day moving average.Meanwhile, semiconductor shares also cooled but still show high relative strength.ASML (ASML) was off around 0.2% but at 210.95 the Dutch chip equipment giant still held above a 208.68 buy point in a three-month base on base, one of the most powerful chart patterns that top growth stocks form before breaking out to new highs and strong price advances.ASML has grown its earnings per share by 25%, 74%, 115%, 34%, 46% and 39% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters on revenue gains of 17% to 53%. As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the megacap member of IBD's semiconductor equipment firm gets a solid but not great EPS Rating of 88. Q1 profit is seen rising just 1% to $1.13 a share, burdened by a very big gain (115%) in the year-ago quarter.At the market get-go, investors applauded the arrival of tamer U.S. consumer price increases in the U.S. and looked past the sudden termination of President Trump's Secretary Of State, Rex Tillerson.The CPI index and the core index both showed a 0.2% rise in February, down from much bigger month-to-month gains in January.Within the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, just three names rose 1 point or more, including UnitedHealth (UNH), McDonald's (MCD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).General Electric (GE) marked the Dow industrials' index's low end, down more than 3%. JPMorgan Chase reportedly cast doubt on the viability of GE's already reduced cash dividend. The industrial powerhouse is slated to pay shareholders 12 cents a share on April 25 to holders of record Feb. 26. That gives GE an annualized yield of 3.3%, vs. 1.8% for the S&P 500.GE holds a 3 Relative Price Strength Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, meaning it's outperformed just 3% of all companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.The large-cap S&P 500 let gains of 0.4% slip to a 0.1% loss near lunchtime on Wall Street after finishing 0.1% lower on Monday. Yet the 500 continues to create a solid cushion above its 50-day moving average, a healthy sign for stocks. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% on Monday, hit new highs again with another 0.4% jump. The Nasdaq is aiming for an eighth straight advance.As noted in IBD's The Big Picture column, on Friday the Nasdaq spurted into new high ground, ending a six-session phase in which the market uptrend was under pressure. The current outlook is now back to ""Confirmed uptrend,"" which means that investors can actively search out breakouts in big volume by companies with high-quality fundamentals.The S&P SmallCap 600 edged 0.3% higher early before sliding to a 0.1% loss. At 972, the index is up 3.8% year to date.Among small caps, Canada Goose (GOOS) flew back above its key 50-day moving average as shares jumped more than 2% to as high as 33.87, then settled back. It's the second rebound back above the 50-day moving average, offering a new secondary buy point following an early-November breakout at 22.10.The seller of ultra-premium outerwear and cold weather apparel has been a stunning stock within the apparel and retail group, tripling in price since its March 16, 2017, IPO at 12.75 a share.Canada Goose cleared a first-stage cup with handle at 22.10 on Nov. 8, catapulting higher the next session on solid quarterly results (earnings up 32% to 29 cents a share, sales up 35% to $172.3 million). Last month, Canada Goose posted another solid quarter of growth with EPS up 38% and sales up 27%.The Street sees the small cap firm posting a net loss of 6 cents a share in fiscal Q4 ending in March vs. a net profit of 17 cents in the year-ago period. In the quarter ended June 2017, Canada Goose lost 13 cents a share.Despite the checkered bottom-line results over the past two years, influenced by the seasonality of its merchandise mix, Canada Goose gets a 95 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 in IBD Stock Checkup.Elsewhere in the stock market today, Lumentum (LITE) held on to Monday's strong gains and then some, rising 0.6% to 72.35. The expert in 3D sensors for smartphones and other optical communications components has cleared a 66.80 early entry point in a deep seven-month base and is 8% past that buy point.In February, the company reported a big turnaround in earnings, up 193% in the December-ended fiscal second quarter to $1.67 a share, ending a two-quarter slump in profits. Sales leapt 53% to $404.6 million.In a Feb. 6 IBD technology story, industry analyst and Loup Ventures Managing Partner Gene Munster noted that Lumentum management indicated 3D sensor revenue should more than double in the second half of 2018 over 2017.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, top industry groups, breakouts and financial markets.)RELATED:Do You Know The Golden Rule Of Investing?Finding Great New IPO Leaders: Who Are The Next Home Depot, Microsoft, Cisco, Google?The Latest In Investor's CornerWant To Sharpen Your Market Timing In Buying Stocks?

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is stepping up its review process for cryptocurrency futures, Reuters reported.If you like steady income stocks such as Coca-Cola (KO) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), you're not alone. Billionaire investor Warren Buffett does too.Those two household names — and many, many more — are part of SPDR S&P Dividend's (SDY) portfolio. Four down sessions in a row have brought the ETF back near its 50-day moving average. A solid rebound off the support line could provide a new opportunity to buy shares. Shares advanced 5% from a late-December bounce off the 50-day to their Jan. 26 intraday high. SDY was featured in this ETF column on Dec. 27.SDY fell below the 50-day Friday as the market came under pressure.

Smaller positions in health care, telecommunication services, energy and information technology made up the rest.Top holdings included AT&T (T), Tanger Factory Outlet Centers (SKT), IBM (IBM), Target (TGT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).

Its average annual returns of 13% and 14.4% over the past three and five years respectively, slightly lag the benchmark index's 14.7% and 15.9% gains for those periods. But the ETF's 10-year average of 10.3% is just ahead of the S&P 500's 9.9%.The dividend fund's annualized yield is 2.1% vs. the S&P 500's average payout of 1.7%.

42,JNJ,"Exchange traded funds' popularity keeps growing as investors plow money into the popular low-cost vehicles that offer access to a basket of stocks.X And that trend doesn't appear to be waning. The combined assets of U.S. ETFs surged to $3.6 trillion in January, according to the Investment Company Institute, up 38% from a year ago. And the total number of U.S. ETFs rose 7% to 1,853 from January 2017.In the 25 years since the launch of the very first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), there are now some 2,000 funds available across a variety of categories and styles.To gain further insight into ETFs, their potential benefits and growth outlook, we checked in with Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Before CFRA acquired S&P Global in 2016, Rosenbluth was director of ETF and mutual fund research in the U.S. for S&P Capital IQ. His previous experience includes managing editor of Value Line Mutual Fund Survey and financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.The full interview with Rosenbluth, who also discusses current trends in the ETF space, follows:IBD: Should an investor own ETFs, and why?Rosenbluth: Investors who want exposure to the stock or bond market should look to ETFs, which typically provide low-cost exposure to a broad investment category or a narrower thesis with the benefits of diversification and transparency. For example, rather than own just Merck (MRK), investors in Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) or Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC) would hold Merck; its peers, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE); and companies in other related industries, including Medtronic (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Unlike in an actively managed mutual fund, investors can see daily what's in an ETF and determine if they think it continues to fit their portfolio.IBD: Are there too many ETFs out there?Rosenbluth: Approximately one-third of CFRA-rated ETFs came to market since March 2015. So we think (that before investing) investors should determine whether an ETF serves a legitimate investing purpose. If so, it's more likely to gain sufficient assets to be viable.Keep in mind that CFRA rates far more mutual funds than ETFs, with several dozen asset managers offering similar-sounding products. Given the sentiment shift toward lower-cost ETFs and away from more expensive mutual funds, CFRA expects more mutual funds to be closed or merged in response.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!IBD: What do you think could fuel further ETF growth — and what could hinder growth?Rosenbluth: Investor and advisor adoption of ETFs designed to support their asset-allocation needs is going to further drive ETF growth. Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) or iShares Core MSCI EAFE (IEFA) are examples of such well-diversified products. As more investors gain comfort with ETFs, money will continue to flow into both established and up-and-coming products.Some investors will always favor the mutual-fund wrapper, wanting active management. To address this, many large asset managers including Davis Funds, Legg Mason, PIMCO and Vanguard offer actively managed ETFs — another area of potential growth.IBD: Even though factor-based ETFs aren't new, ""smart beta"" continues to be a buzzword. What has contributed to the rising popularity of smart-beta funds?Rosenbluth: As actively managed mutual funds struggle to keep up with the returns of the S&P 500 or the MSCI EAFE index, investors are seeking an alternative. Smart-beta ETFs launched in the last three years, including popular Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) and iShares Edge MSCI MultiFactor USA ETF (LRGF), combine factor approaches to offer a diversified yet lower cost approach to quantitative investing.Here again, many large asset managers have expanded their ETF presence using smart-beta products in response to growing demand. In the last six months, JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility (JMIN), Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Low Volatility Factor (OVOL) and USAA MSCI USA Value Momentum Blend Index ETF (ULVM) have launched. All of these are covered by CFRA Research.IBD: ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been in the news too. Do you think that's a lasting trend?Rosenbluth: ESG mutual fund assets have been quite sticky, even as many actively managed mutual funds slowly bleed assets in favor of index-based ETFs. We expect over time, ESG ETFs will gain traction as investors further embrace ETFs and put money to work focused on the conviction of their values.IBD: Any new trends you're seeing now?Rosenbluth: We're seeing investors look more closely at thematic ETFs. Unlike traditional sector or well-diversified ETFs, these ETFs focus on robotics, blockchain or other potentially long-term investment trends. These more narrowly constructed products — such as Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index (ROBO), Reality Shares NASDAQ Nexgen Economy (BLCN) and Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) — tend to charge a premium price relative to market-cap-weighted ETFs, but as more asset managers compete for investor interest, fees have and will continue to move lower.IBD: Which types of ETFs do you expect to outperform as interest rates rise?Rosenbluth: With equity ETFs, CFRA thinks more economically sensitive sectors, including financials and industrials, should benefit if rates rise due to a strong U.S. economy. Vanguard Financials Index ETF (VFH) and iShares Transportation Average (IYT) are a couple of examples.In addition, as interest rates rise, CFRA is focused on bond ETFs with limited interest-rate sensitivity. These low-duration products reduce the downside impact as the Federal Reserve raises rates. IShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond (SHYG) and SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) are examples of short-term ETFs rated favorably by CFRA.IBD: Given the Feb. 5 market sell-off and early redemption of VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), what are your thoughts on VIX-tied volatility ETFs? Are they appropriate for any type of investors?Rosenbluth: VIX-based products are not rated by CFRA as we focus on ETFs that directly hold stocks or bonds and not derivatives. However, investors need to understand that inverse and leveraged ETFs can aggressively move without warning and losses can pile up quickly.IBD: Does XIV's early redemption mean it's harder for investors to manage risk — and if so, how does that affect how the market operates?Rosenbluth: XIV was an exchange traded note, not a traditional ETF as are the other products we've talked about. With ETNs, investors need to understand that there is issuer risk to consider on top of the usual investment risks. With an ETF that shuts down, investors get fair warning and can understand what's inside the portfolio. This helps them track what they will receive if they hold until the product closes. With XIV, the mechanics were much different and the road to closure was much shorter.It's important to note, however, that what happened with XIV was spelled out in its prospectus. So this is less an example of a larger market issue and more an example of why investors need to know exactly what they're getting involved with, particularly with leveraged, inverse and volatility products.IBD: What is a sound strategy for a long-term investor in ETFs?Rosenbluth: Long-term investors should regularly review what's inside the ETFs they're holding to understand how the securities fit going forward. Investors should also periodically rebalance their assets as positions do not move up or down in tandem. You should not necessarily stand still even with passively managed ETFs.IBD: How does CFRA assess ETFs — and how does that differ from other industry researchers?Rosenbluth: CFRA provides a forward-looking rating on more than 1,300 ETFs, combining holdings analysis with fund attributes, including expense ratio and technical analysis. What's inside an ETF and how much it costs is a bigger driver of future returns than its three-year track record or how well it tracks a typically unique index. ETFs that rate favorably to CFRA do so because we have confidence in the valuation and risk considerations of the holdings. We also compare ETFs with one another and separate from mutual funds, as the relevant metrics differ, while others compare active mutual funds trying to beat the S&P 500 with ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 that seeks to replicate the index.Since our equity ETF ratings launched nearly 10 years ago, under the S&P Global umbrella, our top-rated ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 index and the bottom-rated ETFs have underperformed. S&P Equity and Fund Research was acquired by independent research provider CFRA Research in late 2016.

60,JNJ,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are likely to beat fourth-quarter earnings estimates, an analyst predicted, but biotech guidance will be cautious despite the windfall of tax reform.X The fourth-quarter earnings reporting season kicks off next week with Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis (NVS) weighing in Tuesday and Wednesday on the pharma side. Celgene (CELG) and Biogen (BIIB) are on deck early Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV) trailing on Friday.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges expects cautious predictions at the beginning of 2018, noting the example of Celgene's pre-announcement earlier this month. Uncertainties in payer dynamics, competition and U.S. drug access are likely to play into forecasts.""All these factors, along with an imminent return to a more challenging political environment, suggest that management teams will be more than typically cautious in the guidance that they first provide to the financial community on their earnings calls,"" he said in a note to clients.For the fourth quarter, Porges calls for Vertex's cystic fibrosis drugs Orkambi and Kalydeco, Gilead's hepatitis C and HIV drugs, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' (REGN) Eylea and Dupixent — the latter two eye disease and eczema treatments, respectively — to surprise to the upside.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs suffered in the third quarter as high profile drugs missed expectations and smaller players took headlines by beating views. Head to the Industry Snapshot for more on what happened in the prior quarter and whether history is expected to repeat itself.But he sees older drugs from Amgen (AMGN), including psoriasis and arthritis med Enbrel, as at risk of disappointing investors. Biogen's multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Plegridy, and AbbVie's cancer med Imbruvica could also disappoint, he said.Needham analyst Alan Carr sees investors focusing on mergers on the fourth-quarter calls and throughout 2018. This week, rumors emerged that Celgene could be considering a takeover of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), and Biogen could be considering putting in a bid on Acorda Therapeutics (ACOR).""We continue to believe pharma has a bias towards de-risked assets that are on the market or in some cases still under regulatory review,"" he wrote in a note to clients.In the first half of 2018, he expects the Food and Drug Administration to approve Vertex's cystic fibrosis regimen of Kalydeco and tezacaftor as well as an HIV combination from Gilead. AbbVie and Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) could also get the OK for a drug to treat severe menstrual pain.Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) is also likely to grab approval for patisiran, a drug to treat a condition in which abnormal protein deposits throughout the body can cause systemic problems. Achaogen (AKAO) and Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals (TTPH) are also nearing approvals for two antibiotics.RELATED:Why Celgene's Rumored Acquisition Of Juno Actually Makes SenseDow's Merck Does An About-Face, Releases Cancer Trial ResultsHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers

61,JNJ,"Shares of drug giant Merck (MRK) fell Tuesday after a federal judge tossed a record $2.54 billion verdict it had won against Gilead Sciences (GILD) over a hepatitis treatment.A federal jury in 2016 had said Gilead owed Merck 10% of the sales of its Sovaldi and Harvoni hepatitis C drugs. District Court Judge Leonard Stark in Wilmington, Del., agreed Friday with Gilead's argument that the Merck patent was invalid.The patent, issued in 2009, is for a compound that Merck's Idenix unit contends is the basis for all major treatments for hepatitis C, including ones made by Gilead. Merck claimed it was first to synthesize the compound, while Gilead said it didn't cover a new idea.Patent owners are required to describe inventions with enough detail to allow others to replicate them without unnecessary time and effort. In this case, Stark said, Merck's patent covered so many potential compounds that it would take ""excessive experimentation"" to narrow them down.Based on that, ""the only reasonable finding"" is that the patent is invalid, Stark said in the decision.Merck shares lost 1.3% to close at 54.98. Foster City, Calif.-based Gilead added 0.3% to 80.94. Merck, based in Kenilworth, N.J., pledged to appeal the judge's findings, saying it ""does not reflect the facts of the case.""""The patent at issue in this case facilitated significant advances in the treatment of patients with HCV infection, and achieving these advancements required many years of research and significant investment by our subsidiary and its partners,"" the company said in a written statement.""We believe strong patent protection is essential to innovation,"" Merck added. ""Given that it guarantees a firm a period of return on investment, patent protection provides the research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries with an incentive to invest in research and development.""Sovaldi was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2013 and Harvoni got the regulatory go-ahead a year later. Merck's drug, Zepatier, was approved in 2016.Gilead had conceded infringement of the patent, a common legal tactic that allowed it to focus on the validity issue during trial. After rejecting Gilead's argument about the patent, the jury said that Gilead owed 10% royalties on $25.4 billion in total sales for the two drugs.In a separate part of the ruling, Stark rejected Gilead's argument that the damages amount was unfair — an issue that becomes important only if the patent is later revived on appeal.The verdict was the largest patent-infringement verdict in U.S. history, dwarfing the next biggest, a $1.67 billion verdict won by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) against Abbott Laboratories (ABT) that was later thrown out on appeal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

67,JNJ,"The stock indexes reached record highs Tuesday afternoon as the market continued its superb start to 2018.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 0.5% increase, thanks mainly to Boeing's (BA) 2.6% rally to new highs and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) breakout from a base on base pattern.Boeing said today it delivered 763 commercial jets in 2017 from 748 in 2016. The company ramped up production of the 737 midrange plane, and its order backlog hit a record 5,864 jetliners.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq added 0.3%. Both have yet to post a single-day loss since the start of the new year. The Russell 2000 climbed less than 0.2% but still made a new high as well.Volume was running higher compared with the same time Monday.Financials were a leading sector after the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.53%, the highest level since last March.

68,JNJ,"Stocks are trying to rebound after investors backed away from the market on breaking news that a federal grand jury indicted 13 Russian nationals on charges of interfering with the 2016 U.S. elections. The Nasdaq suffered the biggest blow during afternoon trading but edged higher within minutes left in the session.The premier index of growth companies also still looks poised for a strong weekly advance, up at least 5%, following drops of 3.5% and 5.1% in the prior two weeks.X On Wednesday, the Nasdaq composite sparked the confirmation of a potential new market uptrend by rising 1.9% in higher volume vs. the prior session. The solid rally came on Day 4 of a new rally attempt after the leading U.S. equities index got trampled by sellers and fell 11.7% from its all-time perch of 7505.On Friday, the Nasdaq slipped about 0.1% after rising as much as 0.6%.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both edged nearly 0.4% higher with roughly an hour to go before the close.Small caps, which lagged their big-cap brethren in 2017, outperformed on Friday. The Russell 2000 gained nearly 0.6%.At 1544, the popular small-cap index is now back in the black in 2018, up almost 0.6% year to date.At least six of the 30 components within the Dow industrials rose 1 point or more, including consumer spending and medical names Walt Disney (DIS), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD).Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 5% to 17.65, dashing hopes of a possible rebound back above the 50-day moving average this week. But a strong weekly advance suggests that GBTC is beginning to form a new deep base. A rally back above the 50-day line would be bullish, but it would not be a proper buy point yet.The reason: GBTC had fallen more than 70% from its December peak. A correction that deep often indicates that the potential for new sell-offs is high. When a highflying stock or ETF rebounds in price, it's vulnerable to the overhead supply of potential sellers who bought on the way down and are looking to cut their losses.Elsewhere, steel companies, homebuilders, long-term medical care, medical services and pollution control firms paced the upside with gains of 1.5% or more.Nucor (NUE) has trampolined higher since testing the 60 level on Feb. 5. The return back above the 50-day moving average is also bullish. The U.S. steelmaker rallied more than 5% on Friday to 68.67 in volume running more than 40% above the 50-day average.Note on an IBD daily chart how it's easy to see when turnover is higher than normal. Just compare the volume bar for any trading session with the line that goes across the volume bars. That line is the 50-day moving average, which shows the average amount of shares traded per day in the past 50 sessions.A stock that rises back above the 50-day moving average, or the 10-week line on a weekly chart, in above-normal turnover is flashing bullish action. Why? It indicates that mutual funds, hedge funds, pension plans, corporate treasury divisions, insurers and the like are accumulating shares.Nucor has experienced stiff upside resistance at the 70 level. The stock has traded between 51 and 68 over the past 14 months. A potential new base could form.Charlotte, N.C.-based Nucor grew fourth-quarter earnings 91% vs. a year ago to 65 cents a share on a 29% jump in revenue to $5.09 billion.U.S. Steel (X) retook a 40.06 buy point in a cup with handle that began in February 2017. The handle formed over five trading sessions from Jan. 16 to 22, and a handle must be at least five trading days long.RELATED:This Is When The Stock Market Outlook ChangedWhich Way Is The Stock Market Headed Now?

69,JNJ,"This year is shaping up to be boisterous for biotech acquisitions after Celgene (CELG) and Sanofi (SNY), in a matter of days, announced plans to spend north of $25 billion to take over three companies, analysts say.X Celgene and Sanofi, in particular, are facing challenges in areas where insurance companies are pushing back on payments in rheumatology and diabetes. That also leaves the likes of Novo Novartis (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) in trouble, said Brad Loncar, who manages an immunotherapy-based fund.""These companies have to buy growth,"" Loncar told Investor's Business Daily. ""They've been growing their revenue doing artificial things whether that's drug price increases, tax inversions or some kind of other type of financial engineering. Those things are going away.""In all of 2017, there was $50 billion spent in biotech deals, Mizuho analyst Salim Syed told IBD. This year, so far Celgene has said it would spend $9 billion to buy the remainder of Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it doesn't already own. Sanofi is spending $11.6 billion and $4.8 billion to acquire Bioverativ (BIVV) and Ablynx (ABLX).""For companies who haven't bought anything, it's just a matter of opportunity,"" Syed said.The buying spree kicked off in August when Gilead Sciences (GILD) announced its plan to acquire cancer play Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion. Gilead has been suffering from a major slowdown in hepatitis C drug sales amid high cure rates and saturation in the U.S. and Europe.Celgene and Sanofi announced their plans to acquire Juno and Bioverativ on the same day in January. Days later, Sanofi said it would buy rare disease drugmaker Ablynx.For Celgene, the acquisition followed a disappointing third quarter in which sales of psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis drug Otezla widely missed expectations. The biotech also cut its 2020 guidance on Otezla's shortfall and after terminating several trials in Crohn's disease.Loncar described Celgene's long-term growth prospects at the time as a ""bleak picture."" It's also facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s for its cancer drug Revlimid.IBD'S TAKE: It's challenging holding on to a stock amid a market correction as it declines. But that could help shares form a new potential base. Is it still possible to capture a big gain? Head to the Investor's Corner for four tips on how to make gains during a correction.""So they really couldn't afford to wait,"" he said.Sanofi, on the other hand, was skunked twice in 2016 and 2017 as it tried to acquire Medivation and Actelion Pharma. Dow component Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi for Medivation and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) was able to acquire Actelion out from under Sanofi.Roy Behren, a fund manager for Westchester Capital Management, says Sanofi committed a faux pas in both acquisitions — it made a hostile bid for Medivation and went back on an initially higher bid for Actelion, filings show.""Hostile approaches are generally unsuccessful in this space because of the fact the scientists are such an important part of the value equation,"" he told IBD. ""In the case of Sanofi and Medivation, they couldn't arrive at a price unless it was friendly. It was very difficult to complete the acquisition.""Among the high profile acquisitions in late 2017 and early 2018, the acquirers have suffered from pressure on sales of key moneymakers. That, along with tax reform allowing companies to pay less in corporate taxes and repatriate cash at a lower rate, could prime the pump for acquisitions.""I'm a strong believer this is going to be a huge year for acquisitions,"" Loncar said. ""No. 1, for larger companies, their growth is slowing, and No. 2, this tax reform deal adds fuel to that fire. It makes it easier for them to do these deals.""Novo Nordisk lost out on Ablynx to Sanofi. Now, Loncar expects Novo Nordisk to go after other assets to contend with its deep exposure to the diabetes market. Lilly, too, is seeing challenges in diabetes. Meanwhile, Amgen's (AMGN) older drugs are facing new competition.""All big companies really need to do this,"" he said.But there are outliers, Mizuho analyst Syed said. Biogen (BIIB), for instance, guided to flat 2018 sales for its multiple sclerosis unit, including the impact of a royalty it will get on revenue from Roche's (RHHBY) new drug Ocrevus.""There's this perception that the franchises are dwindling,"" he said. ""That's the argument that investors make for a lot of these guys like Biogen, like Amgen — that their base business is going away. That's not necessarily the case. Biogen is stable for 2018.""Still, flat sales won't be enough to pique investor interest. Biogen's aducanumab, a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, is a ""carrot"" for investors until clinical trial data is available toward the end of 2019 or early 2020.""But as long as that carrot is out there, it becomes really difficult for the hedge fund community to short the stock,"" he said. ""Aducanumab can produce returns — if it works — that large-cap biotechs typically don't see.""Westchester's Behren notes biotechs seem to be fairly interested in immunotherapies and oncology. That includes Gilead's acquisition of Kite and Celgene's plan to acquire Juno. Both are working on drugs known as CAR-T therapies, which teach the immune system to identify and fight cancer.""There has been a lot of activity in the oncology space in terms of immunotherapies,"" he said. ""The larger companies are trying to gobble up any promising technology they can while it's still affordable. We are also seeing quite a few testing companies being acquired.""Celgene's acquisition of Juno followed a common storyline, Behren said. Celgene invested in Juno in 2015 to create immunotherapies in cancer and autoimmune diseases. The duo is furthest along with JCAR017, a potential treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.When Celgene pulled the trigger on Juno on Jan. 22, it made sense that it was at a 28% premium to Juno's closing price on the prior trading day.""Biotechs — even more than high tech — tend to come at significant premiums to trading prices,"" he said. ""That's because they're somewhat risky, but could be a huge payoff in the event they're successful.""Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) could be amid a similar plot. In September 2016, the duo paired up to test Nektar's drug called NKTR-214 with Bristol's Opdivo in patients with melanoma, kidney cancer and lung cancer. In November, Nektar presented strong early data from the combos.Loncar pegged Nektar as a potential takeover target in 2018, calling NKTR-214 ""revolutionary."" Days later, Bristol announced it would pay Nektar $1.85 billion upfront — comprised of $1 billion in cash and the purchase of 2.28 million shares — to test NKTR-214 with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy.The deal allows Bristol to remain the leader in immuno-oncology/immuno-oncology combinations without risking a $16 billion bid on Nektar, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a Feb. 14 note to clients.""I have no doubt (Nektar's) phone has been ringing off the hook since (November) because their data was so interesting,"" Loncar said. ""If someone is bold enough to buy them, it could put the acquirer into a class of their own in immuno-oncology.""Drugs called PARP inhibitors also look interesting, Loncar said. Clovis Oncology (CLVS) and Tesaro (TSRO) both have drugs approved in this class and are small enough to acquire. AstraZeneca (AZN) also works in that space.Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT), Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) and BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) have also had successful launches recently.""If a company wants revenue growth, buy a rare-disease drug,"" he said. ""They have the best sales ramps. I think those types of companies are really interesting right now. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them get bought out.""RELATED:Biotech Investors Flee In Droves As Market Correction Rocks The GroupThese Biotechs Could Spring Back After Market Correction: AnalystWhy These 3 Biotech Stocks Could Outperform Their Peers In 2018

71,JNJ,"Over the last several years, smart beta ETFs have surged in popularity as a potential replacement for an active management strategy, but at a much cheaper price.X In the first nine months of 2017 alone, global smart beta equity ETF/ETP (exchange traded products) assets surged 22% to $644 billion, according to London-based ETF tracker ETFGI.Smart beta, sometimes called strategic beta or factor investing, refers to rules-based strategies that go beyond ETFs that track traditional market-cap weighted indexes. Market-cap weighted ETFs include SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), which track the Nasdaq 100. SDPR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA), tracks the price-weighted Dow industrial average.Smart beta ETFs come in a variety of strategies, including value, growth, income, dividend yield and dividend growth, fundamentals-weighted and equal-weighted.Why diversify away from weighting a portfolio by market cap, which is a stock's price times shares outstanding? Consider QQQ.The top five holdings of the Q's are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Together, they account for more than 39% of the ETF's total portfolio.When each of those companies perform well, the fund will have a good year. In 2017, for example, the Q's are up over 34% year to date through Dec. 19. But if Apple has a multiyear correction — like it did in 2013 and again in 2016 — the vanilla ETF's performance could be muted compared with a smart beta ETF that has either avoided Apple or rotated out of the stock into a different equity opportunity.A number of smart beta ETFs that can provide both an active investment strategy and lower costs, compared with the Qs. As a comparison, the expense ratio of the QQQ ETF is 0.2%.According to Ben Johnson, Director of Global ETF Research at Morningstar, there are two key factors of analyzing smart beta ETFs: the fund's investment process and the fee that the fund charges.Investors should have a thorough understanding of the ETF's investment process and how it constructs the portfolio and its weighting. Meanwhile, the fund's fee should be compared to its actively managed peers and vanilla ETF alternatives.These two income-producing funds have strong Morningstar Analyst Ratings: Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) and Schwab Dividend Equity (SCHD).The Morningstar Analyst Rating measures the quality of the fund within the context of the fund's objective, benchmark and peer group. Meanwhile, the fund must distinguish itself across Morningstar's five pillars of investment success: talented management team, sound investment process, portfolio that is in sync with the fund's process, reasonable expenses and a strong parent organization.VIG boasts a Gold Star Analyst Rating, indicating that Morningstar analysts have the highest-conviction recommendation for its investment objective, which seeks to select a diversified portfolio of highly profitable U.S. dividend-paying companies. In the meantime, the fund reduces exposure to firms with weak fundamentals that may have difficulty sustaining their dividend.Yielding an annualized 1.9%, its top holdings include consumer products company Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), tech giant Microsoft (MSFT) and beverage king PepsiCo (PEP). According to IBD data, the fund's dividend growth rate is a staunch 20%, compared with the S&P 500's 13% growth rate.Year to date, the ETF is up 22%. It carries an expense ratio of 0.08%.SCHD sports a Morningstar Silver Star Analyst Rating. Similar to the Vanguard fund, the Schwab fund looks to focus on equities with strong fundamentals and attractive yields. The fund's three biggest positions are Intel (INTC), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Microsoft. The annual dividend yield is 2.8%.Year to date, the fund is up 20.9%. Its expense ratio is 0.07%.According to Todd Rosenbluth, Director of ETF and Mutual Fund Research with CFRA, there are two different types of income-related plays: high-yielding income generation and dividend-paying stocks with growth potential.On the income-generation side, Rosenbluth likes iShares Core High Dividend (HDV). The fund focuses on blue chip energy and telecom names, like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), AT&T (T) and Verizon, which account for about 30% of the portfolio.The fund is up 12.9% year to date and has an annualized dividend yield of 3.2%. Its expense ratio is 0.08%.On the dividend-paying growth side, Rosenbluth mentions WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW), which yields 1.7%. The design of the dividend-with-growth angle is to participate in some of the market's upside, while protecting against some of the downside through the income stream.IBD'S TAKE: Apple has outperformed the broader market this year, but how does it rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Among its top holdings are J&J and Apple. The iPhone maker is strongly weighted within the portfolio due to its strong fundamental profile — three quarters of accelerating earnings and sales growth — and its solid 1.4% annual dividend.Even though it has a slightly higher expense ratio — coming in at 0.28% — the fund in the past three years has returned an average annual 12.3%, compared with the S&P 500's 11.3%. Year to date, the fund is up 27.2% vs. the S&P 500's 22.1% return, according to Morningstar Direct.RELATED:Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksTop Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These Three SectorsDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?Apple Weighs On Dow; Bitcoin Drops Again; Nvidia Ready To Run?

72,JNJ,"Clovis Oncology (CLVS), Sage Therapeutics (SAGE) and Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) could stoke acquisitive appetites in 2018 as large-cap biotechs struggle with slowing growth and major patent cliffs, analysts said Tuesday.X Deal-making has slowed since hitting a record high in 2015, RBC analysts said in a note to clients. The number of deals valued above $1 billion hit 17 two years ago. This year, there have been six of those mergers, including Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.Investors had expected Gilead's major buy to stoke more acquisitions. When that didn't come to fruition, biotech stocks suffered. But ""pent-up demand"" could prompt mergers and acquisitions to play out next year, analysts say.""Many large-cap companies generate a disproportionate share of overall revenues from a handful of blockbuster drugs — many of which are facing impending patent cliffs in the coming years,"" RBC's note said. ""The need to make up for lost sources of revenue and stimulate growth may encourage future M&A.""Gilead bought Kite after suffering major declines in its hepatitis C drug unit. But its HIV drug, tenofovir alafenamide, is likely to lose patent protection in 2025. Celgene's (CELG) cancer drug Revlimid is facing patent cliffs in 2024-26. Amgen's (AMGN) anti-inflammatory Enbrel is likely to lose protection in 2019.These three also had the most cash on hand as of their recent updates. Amgen reported $41.35 billion, Celgene had $11.76 billion and Gilead noted $29.07 billion. The remainder of large-caps in the biotech realm had under $4 billion each.IBD'S TAKE: Analysts said Monday that large-cap biotech franchises will feel the pain of competition in 2018 amid a speeding number of rival branded and generic drug approvals. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what this could mean for the likes of Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Gilead and Amgen.Overall, cash positions are nearing a five-year high, analysts say. Tax reform could help. Under the most recent proposal, companies can repatriate earnings at as a 15.5% tax rate. Amgen, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) have an excess of 90% of their cash currently overseas.""However, we think it's unlikely that the majority of overseas cash would be repatriated immediately upon institution of tax reform,"" RBC analysts said. Celgene, for instance, has suggested a chunk of its foreign earnings are expected to be reinvested permanently outside the U.S.Analysts also note the average projected revenue for the next seven years for mid-cap biotechs is likely to do little to offset the losses from patent cliffs. Performance of acquirers over the past two years has been poor. Industry checks also indicate large deals are on the outs — Gilead/Kite being the exception.Still, expectations are high for mergers and acquisitions, analysts say. In a recent survey, investors cited M&A as the biggest tailwind for the group. Drug pricing is expected to be the biggest headwind in 2018. RBC analysts are slightly bullish on M&A and slightly bearish on drug pricing.""With expectations high for M&A as a major tailwind for the sector, if it does not materialize in the first half of 2018, we could see broad downside,"" RBC said.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, too, notes M&A will be important for the Big Pharma group and that it will likely come as a result of changes in tax rates for repatriation. His top pick for 2018 is J&J, though he also expects Dow's Merck (MRK) and Allergan (AGN) to rebound.""Additional funds for dividend growth and share repurchases should also boost the overall outlook for the sector from an investor perspective,"" he said. ""We see the regulatory environment remaining generally favorable and providing more rapid paths to market for products that bring real innovation.""RELATED:Beware: Price Wars For Big Pharma, Biotech Companies On HorizonThis Biotech Stock Seen As Cheapest Among Rivals In Cancer DrugsGeneric Drug Makers Face Pricing Issues That Other Pharmas Don't

73,JNJ,"The major indexes were narrowly mixed Wednesday afternoon, trading in a narrow price range that saw only a few sectors make significant moves.The Nasdaq composite held to a minimal gain, while the S&P 500 eased 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.3%. The Russell 2000 was up a fraction. All indexes held near new highs, and the Nasdaq inched up to another new high this morning before ceding some gains.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) fell to its 50-day moving average, which coincides with a 137.18 buy point the stock cleared in October. The medical products company now seeks support at that key level. Verizon (VZ) rose 2%. The company stands to gain more power if the Federal Communications Commission rolls back net-neutrality rules, which the commission said Tuesday will be voted on Dec. 14.Volume was tracking below Tuesday's levels at the same time of day. That's not surprising on the eve of Thanksgiving, when many traders plan to take a four-day break. Winners led losers by a 9-7 ratio across the board.Health care stocks led, with hospital, home care and drug wholesale industry groups flashing gains of more than 2%. But those industry groups rank low, and are lacking in leading stocks. The energy sector also led, after the price of oil rose 88 cents to $57.71 a barrel, off from a session high just above $58.The weakest industry groups were spread among semiconductors, scientific equipment, automakers, RV makers, jewelry companies, plastics and other industries.Salesforce.com (CRM) fell 1.7% in heavy trading after the company beat profit and sales expectations for the October-ended quarter but gave a profit guidance for the current quarter that disappointed. The stock, however, remains in a strong uptrend since its breakout past 98.32 on Oct. 20.Despite the outlook, BMO Capital Markets, Royal Bank of Canada, Pivotal Research and SunTrust Banks raised their price targets on the stock. Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis also raised his price target, to 130 from 120.""With this quarterly print and guide ... we do not know how anyone can reasonably argue that Salesforce is not one of, if not the, highest-quality software companies on the planet,"" Davis wrote. He cited the company's major deal with the Department of Homeland Security during the quarter, and the launch of its Financial Services Cloud business for banking.Fastenal (FAST) cleared the 49.07 entry of a cup with handle. But volume was below average. Fastenal is in the building products industry group, which includes leaders such as Home Depot (HD) and Beacon Roofing Supply (BECN).

75,JNJ,"As the current bull market approaches its ninth year and signs of sector rotation and a possible top emerge, now is a good time to see who joins Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC) and Bank of America (BAC) on IBD's latest list of new buys by top-performing mutual funds.X Over the last three months, these leading fund managers have continued to pick up shares in semiconductor-related stocks like Intel and Texas Instruments (TXN), building sector names like leading homebuilder Pulte Group (PHM) and construction products manufacturer Masco (MAS), as well as several industrial machinery companies, including Parker-Hannifin (PH) and Illinois Tool Works (ITW).With tensions around North Korea's nuclear missile program rising, it's not surprising that these funds have also been investing in defense contractors, including Aerojet Rocketdyne (AJRD) and Heico (HEI).Apple, Intel and BofA topped the list in terms of money invested. Seventy-four funds invested an estimated total of $2.3 billion in Intel, while 97 funds scooped up nearly $2 billion of Apple shares. Eighty-nine funds put $1.3 billion into Bank of America.Apple broke out on Oct. 27, but after a short rise has eased back to form a new flat base showing a possible 176.34 entry. Intel has pulled back after making a solid gain from an early October breakout. The chip giant is now testing support at its 10-week line and appears to be setting up a new base with a possible 47.40 buy point.BofA remains extended after clearing a 25.45  entry on Sept. 27. The financial titan is currently 13% above the buy point.Several stocks on this month's list are in or near a potential buy zone, but keep in mind that recent selling pressure in the major indexes and pullbacks by several leading stocks means the current uptrend could be starting to roll over into a correction. If that happens, it will be difficult for individual stocks to make a sustained upward climb.Orthopedic implant maker Stryker (SYK) is working on a first-stage base-on-base with a 160.72 entry. Look for the relative strength line to get closer to new high ground and for the stock to find support at its 50-day moving average. Stryker closed below that benchmark line on Thursday in rising volume.Heico has found support at its 10-week moving average as it tries to complete a flat base with a 93.10 entry. The pattern is part of a long, first-stage base-on-base formation.Fellow defense contractor Aerojet Rocketdyne is also working on a base, but is trading below its 10-week moving average with a lagging RS line.Regional bank stock Synovus Financial (SNV) jumped past a 47.77 entry on Nov. 28, but has now pulled back to test that buy point once again.Three stocks on the list currently pay a dividend yielding at least 2% on an annualized basis: Texas Instruments (2.5%), Intel (2.5%), New Mexico-based electricity utility PNM Resources (PNM) (2.4%) and Dover (DOV) (2%).For a look at how to generate income with stocks and mutual funds without taking on undue risk, see IBD's new special report on income investing.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) topped the list of new sells, with 94 net sellers (163 funds selling minus 69 buying). But recent chart action may be telling a different story.Like BofA and other big bank stocks, JPMorgan has gotten a bump as the likelihood of Donald Trump and Republicans passing tax reform has risen.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had 55 net sellers (130 selling, 75 buying), while Aetna (AET), which will merge with CVS (CVS) if the deal clears regulatory hurdles, had 35 (94 selling, 59 buying).Johnson & Johnson is working on a flat base as part of a longer first-stage, base-on-base formation.

76,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) flirted with a buy point Thursday on another bullish report citing strength in its pharmaceutical unit ahead of the Dow component's third-quarter earnings, slated for early Tuesday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J advanced 0.1% to close at 136.83, though shares briefly topped a 137.18 buy point out of a flat base that began forming in July. Shares are trading at an all-time high.""We remain bullish on the story, driven in large part by the upside we expect from the pharmaceutical segment as we move into the third-quarter results next week and beyond,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote in a note to clients.For the third quarter, the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research calls for J&J to report adjusted income of $1.80 per share on $19.28 billion in sales, up 7.1% and 8.3%, respectively.But Divan notes there are ""some important unknowns this quarter,"" including the impact Hurricane Maria had on J&J's manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. It's possible J&J's fourth-quarter and 2018 outlook could be more guarded, he said.IBD'S TAKE: On Wednesday, an analyst called J&J ""an EPS growth and dividend machine"" and remained bullish on the stock ahead of the firm's third-quarter results. Head to The Income Investor for more on why it might be time to buy J&J.Divan kept his 147 price target and outperform rating on J&J. He sees the firm's pharma unit as the driving force behind long-term upside, including blood-thinner Xarelto and cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica.On the third-quarter conference call he expects investors to key in on the impact of Hurricane Maria and the underlying performance of growth drivers and to look for stronger top- and bottom-line growth.It's also possible more mergers could be on the table after Actelion Pharmaceuticals.""We look to understand their willingness to pursue larger-scale business development now that the Actelion deal has closed, and how they see macro debates around drug pricing and tax reform impacting their strategy going forward,"" Divan said.He noted J&J will serve as a bellwether for the quarterly results of all other U.S. large-cap pharmas in his coverage, set to be released from Oct. 24 to Nov. 2.RELATED:This Drugmaker Hit A 4-Month High On Collaboration With Dow's MerckWhy Amgen, Lilly, J&J Are Interested In These Small BiotechsHow This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite Competition

77,JNJ,"Novo Nordisk (NVO) is shedding its restraint and embracing acquisitions after all.The Danish drugmaker, which has traditionally eschewed deals and looked inward to develop new treatments, signaled a desire to seek growth from outside its own labs as it disclosed a $3.1 billion takeover offer for Ablynx (ABLX).Novo CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who walked in his predecessor's footsteps in his first year at the helm, is now attempting to clinch Novo's biggest deal ever — despite Ablynx spurning two offers in less than a month. The strategy extends beyond Ablynx: Novo said it's reviewing other potential takeovers and, after years of relying mostly on in-house research, is keen to look elsewhere for new medicines.""It marks a higher risk willingness and a willingness to obtain innovation from outside Novo Nordisk compared to what we historically have done,"" Chief Financial Officer Jesper Brandgaard said in an interview with Bloomberg.Novo has sat out a recent wave of industry deals in which a handful of giants snapped up promising biotechnology companies. The company has spent less than $500 million on mergers and acquisitions over the past decade, according to data disclosed by Novo.Swiss rival Roche Holding (RHHBY), by contrast, committed three times as much just last month when it agreed to buy U.S. biotech firm Ignyta (RXDX). Other pharmaceutical transactions last year include Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) $30 billion purchase of Swiss biotech Actelion Ltd. and Gilead Sciences' (GILD) $11.9 billion takeover of Kite Pharma.The 51-year-old Jorgensen may find he's not the only one interested in Ablynx. Novo isn't aware of other suitors, Brandgaard told reporters on a conference call, but some may emerge now that Novo's interest is out in the open. Ablynx shares surged more than 49% to close at 38.62. Novo shares ticked down 5 cents to 54.69.Belgium-based Ablynx said late Monday that Chairman Peter Fellner has resigned from the board. Fellner, 74, had served as chairman since 2013 and had been slated to step down later this year. Ablynx gave no reason for the departure.Fellner has had numerous corporate board appointments, and was a member of the advisory group to Novo A/S, an investing arm of the Novo Nordisk Foundation, until January 2016. He'll be replaced as chairman by Bo Jesper Hansen, a non-executive director, the company said in a statement.Jorgensen is working to beef up a unit that has traditionally had a low profile. The business of selling treatments for rare blood disorders makes up only a fifth of its sales and is overshadowed by the company's diabetes operations.Unless the unit gets split off it needs to grow, said Kim Nielsen, a fund manager at C Worldwide Asset Management in Copenhagen.""Otherwise you risk it being too small or too uninteresting,"" said Nielsen, who holds Novo shares. ""Overall I feel confident they should do something like that.""Novo went public after Ablynx rejected a proposal that includes an upfront cash offer of 28 euros a share and additional cash payments known as contingent value rights of up to 2.50 euros per share tied to the success of two experimental medicines. The maximum payment is 44% more than the stock's closing price on Friday in Brussels.The choice of target isn't a shot in the dark: The two companies have been involved in a research collaboration since 2015.Ablynx's most advanced drug, caplacizumab, addresses a rare disorder called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, in which blood clots form in small blood vessels throughout the body. The illness can block the flow of blood to the body's organs, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.Jorgensen, who grew up on a family farm in Denmark and joined Novo in 1991 as an economist, replaced its retiring leader at the start of last year. He joined just as Novo's traditional diabetes business came under pressure from insurers and payers, who demanded lower prices in the U.S., Novo's largest market.Ablynx ""holds great potential and has highly competent employees,"" Brandgaard said. ""This is a natural first asset for us to pursue.""

79,JNJ,"The major averages closed with heavy losses as the weeklong market slide came to an important test.X The Dow Jones industrial average led with a 4.6% loss, or nearly 1,200 points, after losing nearly 1,600 points earlier. The S&P 500 index lost 4.1%. Both indexes fell through their 50-day moving averages. A bounce from the line would be a positive sign. But if either index falls much below the 50-day line, the market could have even further to drop.The Nasdaq composite was off 3.8%, below its 50-day line. The composite had a better performance than the Dow and S&P in the hot January market rally.Volume was higher than at the same time Friday. Market breadth continued to deteriorate: Declining stocks led advancers by nearly 6-to-1 on the NYSE and 5-to-1 on the Nasdaq.Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) pressured the Dow industrials again. Both oil companies sold off Friday after their earnings reports. Exxon Mobil drilled down nearly 6% and pierced its 200-day moving average. Chevron lost 5.2% and is 15% below its January high.The two certainly aren't alone: The SPDR Energy ETF (XLE) is down 10% from its prior high and also falling below the 50-day line.Industry groups in the energy, building, health care and banking sectors were some of the weakest in today's market.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), two Dow components that also have been selling off since reporting earnings, were off more than 5%. J&J fell below its 50-day line, while Pfizer violated the 20-day average.Most IBD 50 stocks were lower also, but some are holding up above the 50-day line. Fourteen of the 50 are trading below the 50-day moving average. Grubhub (GRUB) fell below its 50-day line Monday after Raymond James cut the rating to market perform from outperform. Earnings are due Thursday before the open.On average, the IBD 50 stocks are down more than 8% from their 52-week highs, an average that has been skewed lower by big decliners such as PetMed Express (PETS), Five Below (FIVE) and Daqo New Energy (DQ).In one breakout of note, Oppenheimer Holdings (OPY) briefly cleared the 28.85 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was more than double its average, and the relative strength line made a new high. But shares fell back below the entry point amid the market plunge.RELATED:Dow Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Not HistoricHere's How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy WayIt's Time To Review Your Stock-Selling SmartsExxon Mobil Misses Q4 Forecasts Badly; Chevron Profit WeakDow's J&J Topples After Judge Tosses Patent On Blockbuster Drug

80,JNJ,"A steepening stock market sell-off made for a tough first day of work for Jerome Powell, officially sworn in as the chairman of the Federal Reserve on Monday, as markets sliced lower in a continuation of Friday's heavy distribution.X The Dow Jones industrial average faltered 4.6%, down almost 1,200 points for its largest-ever point loss, with all but three of its stocks posting losses greater than 2%.The S&P 500 unraveled 4.1%, with Wells Fargo (WFC) posting the index's worst decline,  down almost 10%,  as investors reacted to penalties imposed by the Federal Reserve on Friday. The sanctions, imposed on Janet Yellen's final day as head of the Fed, stirred concerns that regulators, under Powell, could be set for a more authoritarian turn.The Nasdaq composite dropped 3.8%, with Apple (AAPL) carving 2.5% lower and, among the FANG tech leaders, Alphabet (GOOGL) and Netflix (NFLX) down about 5%.A couple of brief intraday market rebound attempts quickly collapsed, although bonds took back some ground, driving the 10-year yield to 2.79% from 2.84% as both the dollar and commodities traded mixed.Big Oil names were again key contributors to the day's declines, as U.S. benchmark crude dropped more than 2%, to just below $64 a barrel.  Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and  Chevron (CVX) led the downside on the Dow, each skidding more than 5%. Total (TOT) and BP (BP) fell sharply.Among other Dow components, Boeing (BA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) dived 6% and 5%. United Technologies' (UTX) decline reached 5.5% as the stock fell below the 50-day line.Shipping was the session's strongest industry, buoyed by a 3% gap up from Kirby (KEX). The inland and coastal waterways operation announced it would buy barge transportation outfit Higman Marine for $419 million. Kirby shares are extended after a breakout from a cup-with-handle base in January.China-based stocks took some bruises, led by Sina's (SINA) 4% fall. The firm-volume decline droves shares to a test of their 10-week moving average. Sina is less than 4% below a 113.05 buy point in a double-bottom base — avoiding an automatic sell rule.Chips traded broadly lower, despite the ostensibly positive news that Broadcom (AVGO) had ratcheted up its bid to acquire Qualcomm (QCOM) to more than $121 billion. Broadcom lost 3% and Qualcomm skittered nearly 6% lower.Among other chip leaders, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) gave up 7%, Qorvo (QRVO) declined 6%, Xilinx (XLNX) took a 5% loss.Graphics chip leader Nvidia (NVDA) unspooled an 8.5% decline.

Just like extreme bearish readings have been seen at market bottoms in the past, excessive optimism has been seen near tops in the past.The Nasdaq composite is showing some signs of institutional selling but not much. The distribution-day count might seem high at five, but one was a stalling session (heavy volume without meaningful price progress).

It's not a market under meaningful distribution.Wednesday's session served up plenty of gaps up in price.Planet Fitness (PLNT) gapped out of a flat base with a 27.32 buy point. The stock's open price of 28.87 was a legitimate entry. A strong earnings report and bullish guidance were the catalysts.Elsewhere, IBD 50 name Coherent (COHR) gapped up over a 288.10 buy point, rising 11% to 295.62, also on strong earnings. The growth of OLED displays has been a boon for Coherent.Other solid gainers in the IBD 50, which is trouncing the S&P 500 year-to-date, included Sina (SINA), Arista Networks (ANET) and Align Technology (ALGN), with gains ranging from 2% to 5%.Small-cap medical products firm Inogen (INGN) gapped out of a flat base with a 105.45 buy point after the company reported earnings and sales growth that accelerated from the prior quarter.

An earnings miss at Match was offset by a strong sales outlook.On the downside, Snap (SNAP) plunged 17.5% on a sales miss and weak user growth figures. Wall Street looked past news that China-based Tencent Holding (TCEHY) took a 12% stake in Snap.After the close, watch for earnings from Alarm.com (ALRM), Square (SQ) and RingCentral (RNG).RELATED:'Grand Theft Auto' Game Maker Crushes Views; Stock Seen As A StealThis Top-Rated Laser Maker Is Blasting Past A Buy Point On Earnings, GuidanceU.S. Crude Production Hits Record High, Stockpiles Unexpectedly Rise

84,JNJ,"U.S. stock indexes deepened their losses midday Friday, as Senate Republicans scrambled to salvage its tax-cut package. The indexes rallied Thursday on belief that the bill would pass, but doubts delayed a vote late Thursday.X The S&P 500 dropped 1.1% midday Friday, while the Nasdaq slipped 1.5%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.9%. The small cap Russell 2000 fell 2.5%.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges.The Republican tax-cut package stalled Thursday after the Joint Committee on Taxation said the bill would not generate enough tax revenue to avoid increasing the deficit. That along with a parliamentarian snag derailed the vote Thursday evening. With additional fixes, a Senate vote is expected this morning.Selling picked up midday Friday after an ABC news report that former national security adviser Michael Flynn would testify against President Trump in a plea deal with special counsel Robert Mueller.Concerns over tax cuts and tax revenue is an old and tiresome story on the Hill. When Reagan sought passage of a tax-cut bill in 1985, the New York Times reported that the Joint Committee on Tax Revenue said it would reduce tax revenue. Reagan prevailed and the tax revenue rose in each of the next five years, proving the panel's projections wrong. The panel, though, always has a challenging job. Dynamic factors are difficult to predict, and economics is all but dynamism.In midday stock-market action, blue chips were roughly even between winners and losers. On the plus side, Merck & Co. (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) each initially rose about 1% before gains faded. On the negative side, General Electric (GE) sagged 1.4%.GE has been a laggard this year. The diversified manufacturer's stock is down 43% this year.In S&P 500, the biggest gainer for the day was oil and natural gas explorer Apache (APA). The stock rose about 6% in heavy volume. Apache is on track for its fourth daily gain in a row. The stock has gained 11% since Monday's close. Light sweet crude popped 1.31 to 58.71 per barrel.The Street expects Apache to turn in a profit of 4 cents a share in 2017 after two years of losses. In 2018, analysts expect a profit of  54 cents a share for Apache.Meanwhile, the exchange-traded fund Innovator IBD 50 Fund (FFTY) slipped about 1% as it tested its 50-day line. The ETF is based on the IBD 50 and is up 38% for the year. The stock  recently pulled about 5% off its Nov. 22 high.Money center banks, which are up almost 4% for the week, stirred midday Friday. Citigroup (C) rose 0.63 to 76.13 in brisk trade. Citigroup is trying to clear a 76.24 buy point. The stock crossed above an alternative entry at 74.95 in strong volume Wednesday.Bank of New York Mellon (BK) added nearly 1% in average turnover, then dropped 1%. The stock is in a shallow, cuplike pattern. The potential buy point is 55.39.Superregional bank KeyCorp (KEY) rose 1% to 19.21 in moderately higher volume, then lost its gains. The stock is just above a 19.13 buy point in a cup-with-handle pattern.The bank stocks launched a nice rally about a year ago, rising from November to March. The banks then traded in a shallow, mostly sideways channel until recently. On Thursday, the money centers and superregionals hit 52-week highs.The superregional group is No. 44 among 197 industry groups. Six weeks ago, superregionals were No. 140.

IShares Nasdaq Biotech (IBB) lost 4.4%, extending its slide for a fifth straight session and slicing through its 50-day moving average. SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) lost 3.9%. SPDR Energy (XLE) and iShares U.S. Energy (IYE) plunged 4% each. A 2.6% drop in West Texas intermediate crude prices to $63.71 a barrel didn't help.SPDR S&P Metals & Mining (XME) gave up support at its 50-day moving average as it reversed to a 2% loss. Also diving below their 50-day lines were Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) and VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH), down more than 4% each.The Dow ended in a sea of red as Intel and Apple, the only gainers at midday, headed south. Apple ended with a 2.5% loss; it had rallied nearly 2% after bouncing off its 200-day line. The iPhone maker triggered the 7%-8% sell rule from its 176.34 buy point.

Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) slumped 16% to extend its decline for a fifth straight session.

But two emerging markets ETFs outperformed.SPDR S&P Emerging Markets Dividend (EDIV) and iShares Emerging Markets Dividend (DVYE) each saw year-to-date gains of 7.6% through Jan. 30, according to Morningstar Direct, ahead of the S&P 500 index's 5.7% return. They also topped the benchmark index last year. Over the longer haul, however, they lagged the S&P 500.Most of the other names on the list, composed primarily of U.S. equity funds, have performed more in line with the broader market over the past three and five years. WisdomTree Japan SmallCap Dividend (DFJ) and WisdomTree Europe SmallCap Dividend (DFE), the two non-U.S. focused ETFs, have also performed largely in line with the S&P 500 for those periods.EDIV, which has attracted $484.8 million since its February 2011 launch, tracks the S&P Emerging Markets Dividend Opportunities Index. South Africa made up its biggest country weight as of Feb. 1, at nearly 26% of assets. Taiwan was next at 21%, Thailand 16%, China 15% and Malaysia 7%.DVYE, launched in February 2012, has $456.4 million in assets and tracks the Dow Jones Emerging Markets Select Dividend Index. Taiwan represented its largest country weighting at 25.5% of assets, followed by 14% in China, 12% each in the Russia Federation and Thailand, 8% in Brazil and 7% in South Africa.The two emerging markets plays were also among the top dividend payers. EDIV offered an annualized yield of 3% and DVYE paid 4.8%, well above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) came in third with a YTD return of 5.4%. The $2.2 billion fund, which tracks the index with the same name, will turn five in May. Information technology accounted for the biggest sector weight at 20% of assets, industrials 19%, health care 17%, consumer discretionary 12% and consumer staples 11%.The top five holdings as of Feb. 1 were Exxon Mobil (XOM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wells Fargo (WFC), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). They made up 22% of the portfolio. Exxon had a bad day Friday; shares slid 5% after the oil giant's earnings report.

86,JNJ,"Stock fought to a positive finish on Wednesday, as health care and construction stocks booked some of the day's widest losses, while video-game stocks notched a bevy of breakouts.X The Dow Jones industrial average led, ending up 0.3%, boosted by Boeing's (BA) monster 5% advance, on the heels of its glowing Q4 results. The Nasdaq Composite rose 0.1%, while the S&P 500 struggled to a fractional gain.Markets dropped sharply after the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement. The committee held its target interest rate unchanged, but offered a slightly more wary tone on inflation. The day's other economic news was positive, with early data from ADP showing January hiring slipped less than expected, while December pending home sales and a Chicago-region manufacturing for January gauge easily topped expectations.The Dow was held back some by medical components Merck (MRK), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE), which all dropped more than 2%. Drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY) tumbled 5%, following a generally positive fourth-quarter report. But drug sector investors were apparently still reacting to Tuesday's news of an innovative health care partnership between Amazon.com (AMZN), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) and JPMorgan (JPM).Amazon advanced 1.5%, putting it 20% past its 1213.10 buy point and in a profit-taking zone. The other three FANG stock tech leaders lost ground. Netflix (NFLX) fell furthest, down nearly 3%, but still extended after its early January breakout.Tesla (TSLA) rose 2.5% in average trade, for its third gain in four sessions. Shares are now up more than 20% from their November low and back above support at their 10- and 40-week moving averages, climbing the right side of a possible four-month base pattern.The video game trade was among the day's winners, with Ninetendo (NTDOY), Take-Two Interactive (TTWO) and Electronic Arts (EA) all clearing buy points or adding to entries. Ninetendo trimmed gains in afternoon trade, but remained just beyond buy range above a cup-base buy point at 54.06. Electronic Arts pared its advance and held in its buy range, after topping a 122.89 buy point, also from a cup base.Take-Two chalked up a 7% surge to end at the very top of a buy range above a 120.72 cup base buy point.Concrete and aggregates suppliers took the session's worst performance among industries, with U.S. Concrete (USCR) tumbling more than 6%, Eagle Materials (EXP) down 5% and Martin Marietta (MLM) and Vulcan Materials (VMC) falling 3% apiece. Eagle materials posted a mixed fourth quarter report before the open, but the reaction could also have been linked to public-private infrastructure cost-sharing questions raised in President Trump's State Of The Union address.Among IBD 50 names, telecom software developer Casa Systems (CASA) gained more than 6% in soft trade. The stock is attempting to start the right side of its first base, ending about 10% below its Jan. 16 high and 46% above its December IPO price.Argentina-based bank Grupo Servielle (SUPV), also an IBD 50 name, jumped almost 5% in nearly average trade. The move technically placed the stock in a buy range on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average. But volume would need to kick in over the next day or so in order to confirm the buying opportunity.At the bottom of the IBD 50 list, MiMedx Group (MDXG) and Daqo New Energy (DQ) each shed about 5%.Other Important Market News For Wednesday:Bring Your Game As Apple, Amazon, Alphabet Report: Action PlanBiggest U.S. Homebuilder Hits Resistance, Despite 40% Earnings GainHow To Sell: Don't Freeze If Double-Digit Gain In A Stock Shrinks FastLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

87,JNJ,"The S&P 500 index and other major averages hit record highs amid a wave of earnings and a weaker dollar, though the greenback rebounded somewhat. Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors. Texas Instruments (TXN) posted in-line results and its shares were punished. The sector continues to wrestle with concerns that the chip cycle has ebbed. Top chip-gear makers Lam Research (LRCX) and KLA-Tencor (KLAC) beat views, but sold off on the news. Meanwhile, Xilinx joined Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD) in benefiting from the sale of high-performance chips for mining Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.RELATED:Intel Beats Fourth-Quarter Targets, Offers Cheery 2018 OutlookBiotech mergers heated up with Celgene (CELG) agreeing to pay $9 billion for the 90% of CAR-T drug developer Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) it didn't already own while Sanofi (SNY) reached a deal with Biogen (BIIB) hemophilia spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion. Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus. On Thursday, Biogen (BIIB) reported sales grew 15% to $3.31 billion and topped the consensus. Adjusted earnings grew 4% but were short. Also Thursday, Celgene beat lowered analyst views. AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views. Verizon (VZ) missed on EPS but topped on revenue. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped views, but fell on a patent ruling vs. its blockbuster arthritis fighter Remicade.President Trump slapped tariffs of up to 50% on imported large washing machines and parts, and up to 30% on solar panels. The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%. First Solar (FSLR), which initially popped, closed up less than 1%. China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) lost about 4%.U.S. crude topped $65 a barrel and Brent edged above $71 briefly as oil inventories continued to drop. Oilfield service provider Halliburton (HAL) crushed quarterly forecasts, with international growth outpacing domestic growth. Shares shot up 5%, clearing a buy point. Baker Hughes (BHGE) edged past earnings estimates and was upbeat on spending among its customers. But shares fell nearly 6% as markets priced in the possibility that GE would fully spin off the business.Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue. Northrop gave strong 2018 guidance and lifted its dividend. Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion. Analysts had expected EPS of 42 cents on sales of $37.5 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Ford is buying mobility startups Autonomic and TransLoc. Shares extended the sell-off from the prior week, when Ford's 2018 outlook disappointed investors. Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) delivered strong results and generally affirmed ambitious 2018 financial targets, sending shares to a fresh 52-week high.New Oriental Education (EDU) logged 8% EPS growth, short of views, while a 37% sales gain to $467.2 million narrowly beat fiscal Q2 estimates. Student enrollments grew 43%. The China-based after-school education provider offered guided Q3 sales views higher, but shares tumbled, though they recouped some losses by the end of the week. TAL Education (TAL), meanwhile, surged nearly 18% on Thursday, retaking their 50-day, after Q3 EPS jumped 168% on 66% revenue growth to $433 million. TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines. Fiscal Q1 earnings per share jumped 95% at TD Ameritrade as revenue expanded 46% to $1.26 billion. It sees full-year earnings of  $2.55-$3.05 excluding items, vs. expectations for $2.69. TD Ameritrade also said it will allow customers to buy and sell certain ETFs 24/7, five days a week. E-Trade reported Q4 EPS up 49% and revenue up 25% to $637 million. It'll also acquire one million retail brokerage accounts from Capital One Financial (COF) with about $18 billion in assets. Shares of both online brokers fell modestly for the week.Millennial-focused free investing app Robinhood will let people buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with zero commission.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) reported adjusted income of $2.54 per share on $892 million in sales, rising a respective 25% and 18%. Both metrics topped expectations. But the robot-surgery gear maker gave cautious guidance.Homebuilder NVR (NVR) missed Q4 earnings and sales views. Shares tumbled 11%, crashing through its 10-week line for the first time in more than a year in huge volume. Along with DOJ subpoena of the mortgage unit of Lennar (LEN) and a bigger-than-expected new-home sales decline, other homebuilders also suffered notable declines.

88,JNJ,"France's Sanofi (SNY) agreed to buy recent Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) for $11.6 billion, the companies announced early Monday. Meanwhile, Celgene (CELG) will acquire CAR-T drug partner Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for $9 billion.X Sanofi's deal values Bioverativ for $105 a share cash, a 64% premium to Friday's close. Bioverativ shot up nearly 62% to close at 103.79 on the stock market today. Sanofi fell 3.1% to 43.20.Celgene will acquire Juno Therapeutics for $87 a share cash.

Celgene ticked up 0.3% to close at 102.91.Juno works on CAR-T therapies that use patients' immune cells to fight against cancer.

89,JNJ,"The major market averages trimmed early gains Tuesday as FANG stock Netflix (NFLX) soared after its Q4 earnings release in the stock market today. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average fell about 0.1% apiece.X Among the Dow Jones industrials, Verizon Communications (VZ) reversed from solid early gains to fall 0.4% after its quarterly sales results topped estimates, even as its earnings came in a bit light.Elsewhere in the Dow, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) topped the Street's targets, but the stock fell 2% in early trade. The stock is just above a 144.45 flat-base buy point after a breakout on Jan. 9.Among companies reporting earnings, Netflix surged 10% after reporting a strong surge in new subscribers with 8.33 million additions compared to its 6.3 million target. The stock is extended from a 204.48 flat-base buy point after a breakout on Jan. 3.Fellow FANG Facebook (FB) looked to extend its win streak to four trading sessions after a recent sell-off back to its 50-day line and 175.59 flat-base entry. The stock rose 1.2% to trade near a new high.Tesla (TSLA) jumped nearly 1% after the company updated its pay package for CEO Elon Musk to tie his compensation solely to key performance benchmarks, like a $650 billion market cap. The stock currently has about a $60 billion market cap, as it builds the right side of a potential base.Solar stocks were on the move Tuesday amid President Trump's decision to impose a 30% tariff on imported solar panel technology. Among the winners was First Solar (FSLR) which advanced 6% and looked to snap a three-day downdraft. Shares are well-extended from their most recent buy point.China-based Daqo New Energy (DQ) reversed from heavy losses to rise over 1%. It too is extended from a buy point after finding support several times at the 10-week moving average line.Inside the IBD 50, Coherent (COHR) declined nearly 4% to fall through its 50-day line and further trigger the 7%-8% loss-cutting rule from a 320.83 late-stage buy point. Later-stage bases are more prone to failure than earlier-stage ones.Elsewhere, New Oriental Education (EDU) declined 5% after missing its fiscal-Q2 earnings estimates early Tuesday, as revenue came in stronger than expected. Shares are battling for support at their 94.73 buy point after it broke out of the flat base on Dec. 29. Investors should also watch to see if the stock can find much-needed support at the 50-day line.RELATED:Energy Giant Breaks Out; These 2 Other Leaders Approach Buy PointsThese 3 Dow Stocks, This Hot Chipmaker, United Airlines Earnings On Tap: Investing Action PlanHow To Buy Stocks: Why The 10-Week Moving Average Offers New Entry PointsBitcoin Falls As South Korean, U.S. Regulators Get TougherNetflix Fourth-Quarter Earnings Report: 5 Key Takeaways

90,JNJ,"Blue chips led the indexes on a strong day Thursday, as several bullish elements converged. X The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average stormed 1.4% higher, while the S&P 500 spurted 0.8%.

"
91,JNJ,"Stocks slumped in late-afternoon trading Monday, but the declines among the major indexes remain mild. Apple (AAPL) bucked the drop with a 2.2% lift to 166.72 and new all-time highs.XApple has now gained 41% after a Jan. 6-9 breakout from a first-stage cup with handle at 118.12.The iPhone giant, which reportedly is seeing brisk orders for its most expensive iPhone ever (the X), is also following through on Friday's breakout from a brand-new cup with handle that shows a 160.97 proper entry.General Electric (GE), meanwhile, led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 0.3% decline as the firm that goes back to the days of Thomas Edison lopped off another 38 cents, or 1.8%, to 20.41. That marked GE's sixth straight loss.The S&P 500 also slipped 0.3% despite strength across the oil patch. WTI near-term futures edged 0.4% higher to $54.13 a barrel on the Nymex. The Nasdaq composite was down slightly.Institutions were selling GE shares hard. The stock's volume finished at 95.8 million shares, 64% heavier than usual. The megacap firm's average daily turnover over the past 50 sessions is 58.2 million shares.GE slid nearly 13% in monster weekly volume last week.The Dow Jones industrial average is a price-weighted index of 30 names, and the keepers of the average replace lagging companies with higher-priced better performers. Recent new entrants include not just Apple but also Goldman Sachs (GS) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). All three trade at more than 100 a share.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Pfizer (PFE) have the next-lowest share prices within the Dow 30, trading near 34 and 35.08, respectively.Cisco, a giant in computer networking and internet-based telecom gear, is challenging institutional buying support near a 34.20 buy point in a new cup with handle. The stock fell more than 1% to 34 in dull turnover.Apple replaced dividend-rich AT&T (T) in March 2015, when the latter traded near 33 a share. AT&T, which has been featured in IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, has made virtually no progress since then.GE had recently peaked at 33 in the summer of 2016 and now stands nearly 39% below that high. The stock's all-time peak is 60.50 back in August 2000.GE's Relative Price Strength Rating is a horrifying 7 on a scale of 1 to 99, as noted in IBD Stock Checkup. Certainly, pressure is mounting on GE's new management team, led by John Flannery, to reinvigorate growth. Flannery has served in many top posts at GE, including head of GE Capital and the India operations.The company's adjusted third-quarter earnings fell 4% to 26 cents a share, sharply missing Wall Street's view, according to data from William O'Neil + Co.Q3 revenue increased 14% to $33.47 billion, snapping a three-quarter slump. But GE has not seen a double-digit annual gain on the top line for more than nine years. The best result was a 6% rise in revenue to $182.5 billion back in 2008.Helping the Nasdaq's cause was Broadcom (AVGO), rising 8.33, or more than 3% to 261.23 in strong turnover. The chip designer for auto, telecom, data center and other markets has cleared a 259.46 buy point in a new nine-week flat base.The proper buy zone goes up 5% past that 259.46 buy point, or 272.43.Broadcom appears in IBD's real-time Stocks On The Move table, a great source for watchlist ideas and potential new breakouts. The table shows stocks moving sharply up or down in heavy volume, based on a real-time analysis of price-and-volume data, and can be seen on the home page.Back to Apple, earnings had dropped 10% in the fiscal year ended in September 2016, on an 8% slump in revenue. However, Apple has been staging a classic turnaround in fundamentals lately.In the past three quarters, the iMac maker's earnings rose 2%, 11% and 18% vs. year-ago levels, following a three-quarter slump. And in Q4 (ended in September), earnings are seen increasing 12% to $1.87 a share, which would mark a third quarter in a row of mild double-digit gains. It's slated to report Q4 results on Nov. 2 after the market close.For fiscal year 2019, the Street sees earnings accelerating 24% to $11.16 a share.Another positive for Apple shareholders: a respectable annualized dividend yield of 1.5%, with plenty of potential for  further increases in that cash payout. Apple tends to raise its dividend in the spring. But William O'Neil + Co. calculates that the company has a long-term annual dividend growth rate of 24% in recent years.IBD'S TAKE: The current yield of the S&P 500 is 1.87%. Track the yield and other vital market indicators by going to the special General Market Indicators page, available as a PDF link at Market Trend on Investors.com. The yield is posted on the top bar of the large daily chart of the S&P 500.Apple's SmartSelect Ratings have improved steadily throughout the year.On Jan. 1, the Composite Rating was dismal at 51 on a scale of 1 to 99, according to IBD Stock Checkup. The RS Rating, which compares a stock's 12-month price performance with all other companies in IBD's database, was equally dim at 59.But today, those two scores are now at 74 and 83, respectively. Expect the Composite Rating to be somewhat weaker when a stock such as Apple is undergoing a major turnaround in both fundamentals and in stock-price action.Elsewhere among the Dow Jones 30 components, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is making what appears to be a normal-looking pullback after breaking out of a flat base at 137.18 on Oct. 17. The diversified medical and personal-care products titan has so far rallied as much as 5.2% from that proper entry, getting briefly extended from the correct buy point.J&J has posted single- to mild double-digit EPS gains for eight quarters in a row. The Street sees Q4 earnings rising 9% to $1.72 a share.The market reacted a tad negatively on reports that Congress is considering a phase-in pace toward lower corporate taxes. It's not the first time such a plan has been reported in the media. In any case, the market appears to be unwilling so far to give up much of its strong gains over the past five weeks.One big reason: U.S. GDP rose 3% in Q3 on an annualized basis, despite the enormous damage caused by hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. That follows a 3.1% gain in Q2.While the Q3 GDP figure is bound to change in future data revisions, Eric Winograd, senior U.S. economist at AllianceBernstein, notes that investors should focus on the recent monthly data that point to an ""economy balanced among sectors.""""Each of personal consumption, private investment and net exports made a positive contribution to the headline rise, with the increase in private investment particularly noteworthy; it rose 4.2% year over year, the highest in two years,"" Winograd told IBD. ""We may not yet be back to pre-crisis levels of investment, but the news on that front is good.""Winograd also says consumption data point to an accelerating expansion in the U.S. economy.""I think of final sales to domestic purchasers, one of the subcategories of GDP, as essentially a 'core' measure — the single figure that best captures the underlying dynamics of the economy. With the (household) paycheck growing at about 4% YOY, the 4.1% YOY gain in final sales makes perfect sense,"" he added.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Apple In Buy Range; 2 New IPOs To WatchHow To Find Top Growth Stocks: Why The Cup With Handle Is A Money MakerWhen To Buy A Stock: Master This Key Growth Stock Chart PatternHow To Invest: Finding Great Stocks Inside IBD 50Top Stocks Today: Can This Chipmaker Rise Sharply Again On A New Breakout?Technology News: Nvidia Gets Another Price Target Hike

92,JNJ,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) delivered a $100 million sales beat in the third quarter, helped by strength in its pharmaceutical and medical devices units, an analyst said Wednesday.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, Abbott had gained 1.3% to finish at 55.77. Shares broke out of a flat base at a 51.23 buy point in early September and have since climbed 7.5% from that mark.For its third quarter ended Sept. 30, Abbott reported adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share on revenue of $6.8 billion. Sales grew 5.6% on a comparable basis — excluding the impact of its St. Jude Medical acquisition. Earnings grew 11.9%.Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for adjusted profit of 65 cents a share on $6.71 billion in sales.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro credited the $100 million sales beat to strong sales from Abbott's established pharmaceuticals, diabetes care, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products. He kept his outperform rating on Abbott stock.IBD'S TAKE: A Washington, D.C.-based expert recently suggested President Donald Trump could sign an executive order to bring down drug prices ""any day"" now, prodding biotech stocks down a collective 0.2% on Monday. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what an executive order could mean for biotech and drug stocks.During the quarter, established pharmaceuticals posted 14.3% year-over-year growth to $1.17 billion. This group doesn't sell in the U.S. Key emerging markets delivered 18% growth on a comparable year-over-year basis, helped by a quick recovery in India, Novarro said.Worldwide medical device sales grew 5.6% vs. the year-earlier period on a comparable basis to $2.6 billion. That followed Dow stock Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) report Tuesday that saw medical devices grow 7.1%, but lag some views.Neuromodulation sales grew 46.8% to $208 million globally. Neuromodulators are implantable devices that use electricity to deliver pain relief. Electrophysiology, tests that study the electrical activity of a heart, rose 10.7% on a comparable basis. Structural heart sales grew 11%.In the same medical devices business, global diabetes care jumped 19.1%, driven by 33.9% growth internationally, which helped offset a 13% decline in the U.S. Rhythm management sales declined 12.1% vs. the year-earlier period.Diagnostic sales grew 5.2% globally to $1.28 billion. Within core laboratory products, U.S. sales growth slowed to 4.6% compared with double-digit growth in the first half of 2017, Novarro wrote in a note to clients. But international sales growth improved again to 5.9%.Abbott also narrowed its 2017 adjusted profit growth to $2.48-$2.50 per share, from its earlier view for $2.43-$2.53, Novarro said. The new guidance brackets the consensus for $2.49. For the year, analysts see Abbott pulling in $26.5 billion in sales.RELATED:Dow Component J&J Pops After Topping Views On Pharma StrengthIBD Rating Upgrades: Johnson & Johnson Shows Improved Relative Price StrengthFDA Chief Gottlieb Addresses Opioids, Cancer, New Therapeutics

93,JNJ,"Investors preferred to continue investing in U.S. stocks and trimming their stakes in Bitcoin-related securities on Tuesday as the Nasdaq continued to stage one of its biggest month-to-date gains.X The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7% while the Nasdaq 100, capturing the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that exchange, rose 0.8%.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), meanwhile, flashed a warning sign that a prolonged correction may be in the works. The popular fund dropped 2% to 1,653.90, sinking for a third straight session and giving back all of last Thursday's strong rebound. The fund is also losing more ground below its critical 50-day moving average.Bitcoin Investment Trust gave astute chart readers a pair of sell signals in December when it showed some clear signs of a climax run, one of the most important sell signals featured in IBD market columns. Bitcoin also slashed through its 10-day moving average, a good sell trigger for short-term traders.The PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, is now at 169.49. The heavily traded ETF extended its overall gain since a Day 3 follow-through on June 30, 2016, to more than 57%. A follow-through is a vital market-turning signal that was noted by The Big Picture back then. Typical follow-through rallies occur on the fourth day or later after an initial rally attempt that follows a significant market correction.Meanwhile, some blue chips took a break as the Dow Jones industrial average finished practically at breakeven. At least seven of the 30 member stocks in the Dow Jones industrials fell 1 point or more, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) following its plan to take a $13.6 billion charge following the new tax code and repatriate billions in profits back into America immediately. The company also suffered a setback in court over a drug patent.The S&P 500 lifted 0.2%. Breadth was positive on both exchanges; on the Nasdaq, winners smashed losers by a nearly 4-3 margin. NYSE winners crushed losers by nearly 9-to-5.J&J slid 4% to 141.83 in heavy turnover, but the uptrend remains in place as the diversified medical products giant remains above its 50-day line. At its recent peak, the stock held a 14.9% profit since clearing a 129.10 buy point in a long base on base, a key pattern for those who want to buy the most bullish growth stocks.Apple (AAPL) edged slightly higher to 177.04 and trades just a few points off its all-time peak of 180.10. At that peak, the largest company in the U.S. exchanges by market cap ($900 billion) has run 52% since the pivotal breakout from a cup with handle at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Apple is also up nearly 10% from its latest true base, a second-stage cup with handle that provided a 160.97 entry. The base formed from Sept. 5 to Oct. 26. Volume on the Oct. 27 breakout came in strong, 64% above the 50-day average. It later tried to break out from a flat base at 176.34 but has not climbed much from that entry.While the iPhone and digital services titan has sort of set the standard over the past 12 months on how a giant company can turn things around and rally nicely from key breakouts points, the market's rally across techland means that IBD-style growth investors can possibly find other big cap names that could present even richer stock profit potential.Four names to consider include:Lam Research (LRCX), a play on semiconductor equipment, $34 billion market cap: The stock rallied nearly 3% to 215.05 and is crafting the right side of a new cup-style base since peaking at 219.70 on Nov. 21.Lam, which had been regularly featured in IBD Big Cap 20 throughout 2017, is expected to grow fiscal second-quarter earnings by a whopping 64% to $3.68 a share. In contrast, Apple's profit in the just-ended fiscal first quarter is expected to rise 13%.PayPal (PYPL), digital payments pioneer, $101 billion market cap: The stock floated 0.2% higher to 84.18, a fifth straight gain, and is now up 5.9% past the recent breakout from a good flat base at 79.48. Shares are thus a tad extended from the proper buy zone.Earnings are seen rising 24% to 52 cents in Q4, following year-over-year gains of 13%, 17%, 19%, 28% and 31%.Salesforce.com (CRM), a business software innovator, $81 billion market cap: The Marc Benioff-led cloud-based enterprise software giant is nominally in buy range at 113.24, 3.6% above a 109.29 entry in a six-week flat base.Earnings in the January-ending fiscal fourth quarter are seen rising 18% to 33 cents a share following EPS increases of 26%, 14%, 47%, 17%, 38% and 62% in the prior six quarters. The average gain over the time span: up 34%.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for additional commentary and analysis on growth stocks, charts and financial markets.)RELATED:Stocks Near A Buy ZoneYou're Invested In Stocks And Equity ETFs; What To Do Now?

94,JNJ,"Stock futures buzzed in mixed trade just ahead of Tuesday's open, through a busy morning in which federal employees headed back to work, markets reacted to earnings and regulatory news, and earthquakes and volcanoes rattled several corners of the globe.XThe Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2% at the starting bell, buoyed by strong early moves from Netflix (NFLX) and Adobe Systems (ADBE).

95,JNJ,"Biotech mergers heated Monday after Celgene (CELG) announced it would acquire Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) for $9 billion and French pharma Sanofi (SNY) said it would spend $11.6 billion to tack on Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV).X Analysts lauded Celgene's Juno buy, noting it will help fill a hole after Celgene's blood disease drug Revlimid begins losing exclusivity in 2022. But the Street was more split on Sanofi's purchase as the hematology market is expected to soon face disruption from gene therapies.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Juno surged 26.8% to 86. Celgene ticked up 0.3% to 102.91. Bioverativ rocketed 61.9% to 103.79, but Sanofi dived 3.1% to close at 43.20. The broader biotech group popped 3.7%.Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster suggested in a report the group could see a mad scramble in mergers and acquisitions after Sanofi announced its plan to buy Bioverativ. He lists Biomarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN), Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) and AveXis (AVXS) as his top takeover picks.""This deal could be a sign that the (merger) spigot has finally turned on as other large pharma companies may feel pressured to move to make full-value bids to grab what is a fairly scarce selection of commercial and commercial-ready assets among the small and midcap biotech spaces,"" he said.Celgene said Monday it would spend $87 per share to acquire Juno — a 93% premium to the stock's closing price —  before rumors sent Juno flying last week. Celgene already owned 9.7% of Juno from a 2015 deal to collaborate on cancer and autoimmune drugs. The merger is expected to close this quarter.Juno is among those working on CAR-T therapies, which engineer a patient's own immune cells to identify and fight cancer cells. Celgene pegs its lead drug, known as JCAR017, as getting approval in the U.S. in 2019 and bringing in a potential peak of $3 billion in sales beyond 2020.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene was particularly hurt in the third quarter when its bigger drugs Revlimid and Otezla missed expectations. And it's not the only one facing a patent cliff in the mid-2020s. See who else is at risk by visiting the Industry Snapshot.Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond suggested that guidance could be overly bullish.Celgene is ""setting a relatively high bar for an asset that likely won't be alone in its class,"" he said in a note. ""However, if this guidance is achievable, this could be an important source of revenue in the mid- to long-term as Celgene looks to plug a Revlimid hole once its goes generic starting in 2022.""But competition is looking stiff. Gilead Sciences (GILD) spent nearly $12 billion to acquire Kite Pharma last year. About that time, Gilead-Kite gained approval for a CAR-T therapy, following Novartis (NVS), which was first out of the gate with an approval in August.Celgene expects JCAR017 to get approval to treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Gilead's drug, Yescarta, is approved to treat that population and Novartis is looking to get its drug, Kymriah, approved for that use as well.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges views the deal positively as it ""consolidates and streamlines"" Celgene's efforts in CAR-T. Celgene also partners with Bluebird Bio (BLUE), working on a multiple myeloma drug known as bb2121, which targets an antigen known as BCMA.""Owning Juno allows Celgene to focus its BCMA efforts initially on Bluebird's bb2121 and to make Juno the vehicle for all development of (drugs that target the CD19 protein), and for the exploration of other targets as opportunities,"" he said in a note to clients.Mizuho analyst Salim Syed noted there can be no cross-pollination in the manufacturing of Juno and Bluebird drugs, but there will be knowledge-based synergies. It's unsure whether Celgene could even look to acquire Bluebird without triggering antitrust concerns, he said.Early Monday, Sanofi said it would buy hemophilia player Bioverativ for $105 per share. The deal is a 64% premium to Bioverativ's closing price Friday, Piper Jaffray's Raymond wrote in another note.""We're not shocked one bit,"" he said. ""With a $1 billion topline and revenue growth of more than 31% last year, yet trading at just five times fiscal year 2018 revenue estimates, we have long viewed Bioverativ as a potential takeout target.""The deal comes after Sanofi twice failed in 2016 and 2017 to make big acquisitions. In 2016, Dow's Pfizer (PFE) beat out Sanofi in a battle for cancer player Medivation. Last year, Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) acquired rare disease biotech Actelion Pharma out from under Sanofi.Sanofi is facing mounting competition for its diabetes drugs. But the trick will be convincing investors that the hemophilia market won't be disrupted by gene therapy and product launches like Roche's (RHHBY) drug Hemlibra, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note.""At a minimum, after a number of speculated successful bids, including Medivation and Actelion, Sanofi investors now have a deal to digest that is immediately accretive to 2018 earnings and estimated to be 'up to 5% accretive in 2019,' "" he said.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay called the bid strong given upcoming competition from Roche, but noted it's likely Sanofi is building on ""lessons learned in the Medivation and Actelion processes where Sanofi led with low offers and was later bested by competitive bidders.""But investors weren't as sure of the merger. Biogen spun out its hemophilia business into Bioverativ a year ago.Bioverativ has two approved drugs, Eloctate in hemophilia A and Alprolix in hemophilia B. Last year, Bioverativ acquired True North Therapeutics.Credit Suisse's Martin called True North ""one of the stronger acquisitions of 2017."" Under it, Bioverativ gained access to a drug now known as BIVV009 to treat a rare autoimmune disease. He models $19 per share for that drug alone.RELATED:Which Biotechs Could Surprise To The Upside On Earnings?This Biotech Stock Rocketed 15% On Rumors Biogen Could Buy ItHow Hospitals Plan To Put Pressure On Generic-Drug Makers

96,JNJ,"Stocks held a broad rally into the final hour of trading on Wall Street on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average leading the way. Dow industrials component General Electric (GE) staged a positive reversal, up nearly 0.8% after tanking more than 5% intraday.XAt 3:25 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average gained around 0.6% and was close to session highs as at least six of the 30 components rose 1% or more.The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite both rallied nearly 0.4% and looked set to make their fourth and sixth straight weekly advances, respectively.Volume is running higher vs. the same time Thursday on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), highlighted in an earlier Stock Market Today column as it cleared a new buy point at 137.18, looked poised to finish the week up more than 4% and remained within proper range.GE, which reported disappointing third-quarter results and poor guidance, is in need of strong leadership by its new CEO John Flannery to turn around the company's fortunes. He is expected to unveil a new strategy next month.For recent new traders in the stock the best time to have sold GE was after its breakout from a 22-week cup with handle at 32.10 on Dec. 20, 2016. Volume was decent that session, 20% above average, but not great.Soon, GE shares tanked and on Jan. 23 triggered the golden rule of selling. The stock sank 2.6% to 29.75, more than 7% below the recent breakout entry. Cutting losses short would have allowed an investor to raise cash and buy a better performer.Notice how on a daily chart, the stock had already dived beneath its critical 50- and 200-day moving averages in heavy turnover. That's not the kind of action you want to see after a breakout.Elsewhere, steel shares continue to rebound. IBD's Steel Producers group is up more than 16% since August. The leaders include Steel Dynamics (STLD) and South Korea's Posco (PKX).Steel Dynamics rallied 3% to 38.95, streaking past a 38.80 early buy point in a long flat base that can also be construed as a saucer.The mini mill expert reported a 2% rise in Q3 profit after showing a huge increase in the year-ago quarter. Sales rose 16%, extending double-digit top-line gains for a fourth quarter in a row.Q4 profit is seen accelerating 29% to 58 cents a share.IBD's TAKE: As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Steel Dynamics garners an A- for IBD's proprietary Accumulation/Distribution Rating. See how the Stock Checkup doctor is smiling? A C+ or higher grade is preferred when a stock is aiming to break out. Also keep an eye out for a potential fast improvement in the stock's Relative Price Strength Rating. IBD research has found that the average RS Rating among the greatest market winners at the breakout is around 87.Posco is working on a new cup-shaped base that can also qualify as a flat base. The decline from its latest 52-week high of 77.76 to a September low of 67.17 is a mild 13.6%.For now, the current new buy point is 77.86, 10 cents above the new base's left-side lip.Posco has shown a nice turnaround in fundamentals. Earnings per share vaulted 143% and 77% vs. year-ago levels in the past two quarters on sales increases of 24% and 17%.The Street sees Q3 profit up 7% to $1.64 a share and full-year profit up 101% to $7.49 a share.RELATED:Stock Market Today: Apple Is Recovering, J&J Breaks OutHow To Find Great Stocks: Start HereCould You Have Spotted The Black Monday Crash Of 1987?

97,JNJ,"Stocks bounced back big time Thursday as Wal-Mart (WMT), Cisco (CSCO) and Apple (AAPL) powered the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite hit a new high.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rallied 1.4%, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) gained 0.9% and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) also rose 0.9%. Emerging markets led with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) running up more than 2%.Wal-Mart soared 10% after its Q3 results topped views, while Cisco leapt 6% on a quarterly profit beat and a better-than-expected outlook. Apple rose 1.4%, on track to snap a five-session losing streak. The Dow component is still extended from a 160.97 cup-with-handle buy point. GBH Insights said the iPhone maker could potentially hit a market cap of $1 trillion next year.Among sector plays in the stock market today, retail, semiconductors and consumer staples scored big gains. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) gained more 2%, boosted by Wal-Mart. The ETF regained its 50-day line for the first time in nearly three weeks.Utility and energy funds were among the few laggards. West Texas intermediate crude prices slipped, while gold futures were slightly higher.The stock market had been coming off its highs — but the recent pullback may give investors a chance to buy previously extended names.Vanguard High Dividend Yield (VYM), which owns Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),  JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) is getting close to a potential test of its 50-day moving average.If it finds support at the line and makes a solid rebound, it could set up a new opportunity to buy shares. After regaining its 50-day line in early September, the fund rose 6% to its Oct. 23 intraday high. It offered another buy point Sept. 11 on a breakout from a flat base — and advanced 4% through the Oct. 23 peak.VYM was last featured in this June 16 ETF column, just ahead of its breakout from a prior flat base. It cleared the buy point June 19, before easing the next session to start the most recent pattern.The fund, which marked its 11th year last week, has amassed $20.1 billion in assets. It tracks the FTSE High Dividend Yield Index, which comprises U.S. companies that tend to pay above-average dividends. VYM offers a 2.9% annualized dividend yield, above the 1.9% average payout of the S&P 500.Technology accounted for the ETF's biggest sector weight as of Oct. 31, at about 15% of assets. Financials came next at 14%, followed by roughly 13% a piece in health care, consumer goods and industrials. Oil & gas and utilities represented 9% and 8%, respectively, while consumer services, telecommunications and basic materials made up the rest.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer examination? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.Top five holdings are Microsoft, Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan Chase, Exxon Mobil and Wells Fargo. Microsoft, which has run up more than 30% this year, is extended from a 74.52 flat-base entry. Three of the top 10 — J&J, Wells Fargo and Procter & Gamble (PG) — were also in Warren Buffett's Q3 portfolio. Wells Fargo, which yields an annualized 2.9%, was the billionaire investor's top holding.VYM's 11.4% year-to-date return through Nov. 14, according to Morningstar Direct, lags the S&P 500's 17.2% gain. Its average annual returns over the past three, five and 10 years trail the benchmark index by about one percentage point or less in each of those periods. The ETF sports a 0.08% expense ratio.Wednesday's pick, SPDR Utilities (XLU), remains in buy range from a 56 flat-base entry.RELATED:Apple, Target Weigh On Market; These Stocks Offer Big DividendsApple Drops On This iPhone News; Will Dow Stock Offer New Entry?

98,JNJ,"The stock market kept going down in afternoon dealings as indexes traded at session lows and small-caps lagged noticeably.XThe Dow Jones industrial average was down a fraction, buoyed in part by several Dow components that made new highs, such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wal-Mart (WMT) and Intel (INTC). J&J has been rallying since it reported earnings last week. Wal-Mart is extended from an 82.09 buy point cleared in an Oct. 10 breakout.Cisco Systems (CSCO) followed through on Friday's breakout, adding nearly 1%. Trading was slower than usual for Cisco, despite it confirming reports that it will acquire BroadSoft (BSFT). The value of the deal was put at $1.9 billion. Shares of BroadSoft, a telecom software company, climbed less than 2% in huge volume.The Nasdaq was down 0.3% and the S&P 500 fell 0.2%. But the Russell 2000 was off 0.5%. After leading the market from mid-August to early October, the small-cap index has been stalled sideways. Regional banks were broadly weaker in today's trading, which contributed to the Russell's woes.Airline, internet content, media and some consumer industry groups were at the bottom of the day's performance table. The energy sector also was weak although the price of crude oil was little changed at just under $52 a barrel.LogMeIn (LOGM) broke out of a cup-with-handle base, topping the 121.35 buy point in heavy trading. The teleconferencing and remote-access software company will announce earnings Thursday after the close. Analysts expect a profit of $1.11 a share.That's about double its year-ago profit, but it includes the merger, completed in January, with Citrix Systems' (CTXS) GetGo subsidiary.Ball (BLL) rose past the 42.73 buy point of a cup-with-handle base. Volume was about one-third more than usual. Ball will announce Q3 results before the market's open on Nov. 3. Ball is an odd combination of low-tech products, such as beverage cans and aerosol dispensers, and high-tech defense systems.YPF (YPF) made a breakout from another cup with handle, this one with a 23.32 buy point. Volume was more than triple the average. YPF was part of a rally in Argentine stocks after President Mauricio Macri saw his ruling coalition make important strides in elections over the weekend, which could pave the way for economic reforms.The Global X MSCI Argentina (ARGT) ETF was up more than 2%, near an all-time high.RELATED:Cisco Will Buy BroadSoft For $1.9 Billion; Tesla Nearing China Deal?

99,JNJ,"Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria didn't just devastate Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico: Medtech players Medtronic (MDT), K2M Group (KTWO) and Wright Medical Group (WMGI) were flailing in the headwinds on Monday.XIn afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 116-company Medical-Products industry group, which Medtronic leads by market cap, fell a collective 1.1% after K2M and Medtronic acknowledged the impact the hurricanes had on their quarterly metrics.But they won't be alone, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients. News reports indicate 70% of Puerto Rico's hospitals were not operational at the end of the third quarter. Those that were operational may not have been running at full capacity, he said.""We assume two lost weeks of procedures at the end of the third quarter (in Puerto Rico) for device manufacturers,"" he said. ""Also, we conservatively estimate that no elective procedures will be performed in Puerto Rico in the fourth quarter.""On Friday, Medtronic said it expected a $250 million impact to both revenue and earnings in its fiscal second quarter. The firm said it's too early to determine whether there will be an impact in the latter half of the year. At least three analysts cut their price targets on the stock.K2M followed Medtronic on Monday, pre-announcing negative Q3 results and sustaining at least two price-target haircuts. For the quarter, K2M expects to report $62.7 million in sales, up 6% vs. the year-earlier period, but below analysts' views for $67 million.The firm also trimmed its 2017 sales outlook to $255 million to $257 million, which would grow 8% to 9%.Shares of K2M were among those hardest hit in the Medical-Products group, plunging 18.4% to close at 17.77 Monday. Wright, NuVasive (NUVA) and Globus Medical (GMED), which make medical implants, dove a respective 5.2%, 4.9% and 3.9%.But Novarro says there could be opportunities for investors in NuVasive and Wright. NuVasive is capable of accelerating organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter and 2018, and Wright has a strong product portfolio plus operating-margin expansion opportunities, he said.""We expect management teams to cut guidance due to hurricane-related revenue shortfalls, which the sell-off over the past several weeks is already discounting,"" he said. ""While NuVasive and Wright are each dealing with specific short-term issues, the setup for 2018 looks attractive.""In a separate report after K2M's pre-announcement, Novarro noted that investor sentiment on spine stocks remains negative. He cut his price target on K2M to 22 from 26, but kept his outperform rating and said he would be a buyer on any pullback in the stock. The worst is already priced in, he argued.Needham analyst Mike Matson is more bearish still on spine players. Outside of the hurricanes, K2M was impacted by weaker degenerative and deformity procedure growth in August and September, Matson wrote in a note to clients. It's likely Globus and NuVasive will miss estimates in the third quarter.Matson lowered his 2017 view on K2M to $256 million from $267 million. For 2018, he now sees $279 million, down from earlier expectations for $300 million. He also trimmed his price target on K2M to 27 from 29, though kept his strong-buy rating.Medtronic toppled to an eight-month low Monday on a series of price-target cuts after it announced Hurricane Maria's damage in Puerto Rico could hit earnings and revenue by up to $250 million. Also last week, Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) said the hurricanes will be a headwind against its third-quarter earnings.Novarro expects Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) to chip away at sales of Medtronic's implantable heart devices. Several newly launched products are on back-order status or had lower inventory levels before the hurricane, the firm said in a press release.IBD'S TAKE: Medtronic has an IBD Composite Rating of 48 out of a best-possible 99, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a look at stronger performers.""Competitors may be able to take advantage of such a supply shortage, which is hard to quantify at this stage,"" Novarro said. ""Therefore, we see downside risk to both revenue and (earnings) guidance for the second half of 2018.""For the second fiscal quarter, Novarro trimmed his model to $6.8 billion in sales and 92 cents earnings per share, down from $7.05 billion and $1.07.Novarro also slashed his views for fiscal 2018-19. For 2018, he models $28.9 billion in sales and $4.55 earnings per share. He forecasts $5.13 in EPS on $29.8 billion in sales in fiscal 2019. This resulted in his price target cut to 85 from 90, though Novarro kept his outperform rating.At least two other analysts cut their price targets on Medtronic stock. Wells Fargo downgraded Medtronic to a market perform from outperform. Medtronic toppled 3.6% to finish at 76.93.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) appeared to sustain ""minimal damage"" to its Janssen unit Gurabo facility, which makes Remicade, Xarelto, Prezista and a number of other drugs, according to UBS analyst Carter Gould, who viewed satellite images of the facilities.""Based on utilization of most of the lots on site it appears that activity is returning to the facility,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Fellow drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) had visible damage to the roofs of two buildings and flooding on an access road to a manufacturing site in Puerto Rico. But by Oct. 4, both roofs appeared to have been fixed and the parking lots were at 80% capacity, Gould said.Amgen confirmed to Gould it's using diesel generators on site and contracted fuel providers have been making shipments. In the meantime, the first shipment from its inventory on Puerto Rico has already flown off the island, Gould said.It's unlikely the Food and Drug Administration will require an inspection before allowing Amgen to restart production.""While we would ultimately expect some accounting charge related to this, we are incrementally less concerned on potential disruptions to product supply,"" he said.RELATED:Medtronic Sinks After Sales Lag, Though Earnings Beat ViewsThis Robotics Player Neared 1,000, Then Toppled — Here's WhyThis Drug Bellwether's Sales Miss Actually Bodes Well For The Sector

100,JNJ,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH) and Exelixis (EXEL) tick off most of the acquisition boxes for Big Pharma in an overview of the biotech merger picture, an analyst said Friday.X""Acquisition of biotech companies by pharma is an important theme for the space,"" Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. ""We believe late development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets, in part due to reduced risk.""Of the companies Carr covers, Theravance could attract big pharmas like Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA). In total, Carr counts 21 companies that could be interested in buying Theravance based on research areas, business development interest and past acquisitions.Theravance has one approved drug, an antibiotic for hard-to-treat infections. Beyond that, Exelixis, Agios Pharmaceuticals (AGIO), Bavarian Nordic, Biohaven Pharmaceutical (BHVN) and Progenics Pharmaceuticals (PGNX) may be attracting the interest of 18 pharmaceuticals apiece.AbbVie, AstraZeneca (AZN), Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY) and Dow stocks Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) could be the most acquisitive, based on Carr's criteria. Each has at least 20 potential targets.But some biotechs may stand a better chance of being acquired vs. others, Carr said. Since January 2014, there have been 37 acquisitions of public biotech companies involving a payment of more than $250 million upfront.More than half already had an approved drug and 78% had at least some Phase 3 data, Carr wrote. Oncology was a key target for U.S. and Japanese pharmas, while rare-disease plays are likely to be acquired at later stages.IBD'S TAKE: Last month, one of these potential acquisition targets jumped to an IBD Relative Strength Rating of 92 out of a best-possible 99. Today, it still has a rating of 90. Head to IBD Data Stories for a closer look at the stock and its catalysts.Rare diseases tend to be of interest to mid-specialty pharmas and biotechs, as traditional drugmakers are likely to avoid the drug-pricing controversy. Since January 2014, the only rare-disease firm snatched up was Actelion Pharmaceuticals by J&J.U.S. and European pharma acquired more later-stage biotechs vs. the less risk-adverse Japanese pharmas and Allergan (AGN). Big areas of interest included central nervous system, rare diseases and oncology which accounted for 22%, 19% and 16% of acquisitions, respectively.Since January 2011, there have been 235 new chemical entry approvals by the Food and Drug Administration. Of the 65 small-to-midsize biotechs which gained this type of approval, 20 (31%) have been acquired. All of them already had a drug on the market at the time of the acquisition.""Many oncology companies, but few rare disease companies were acquired,"" he said.Gilead Sciences' (GILD) acquisition of Kite Pharma (KITE) could break that approval rule. Gilead announced its plan to spend $11.9 billion to buy Kite months ahead of the expected approval date of its first drug in a blood cancer. Novartis' rival treatment was approved days later.RELATED:This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyExelixis Recovers From Bristol-Inspired Pitfall In Kidney CancerBristol Dives But 'Still Has A Chance' In Kidney Cancer: Analyst

101,JNJ,"In his first run with the Food and Drug Administration, gene and cell therapy were early-stage, theoretical concepts, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said Tuesday.XBut last month, the FDA approved its first cellular therapy, a drug called Kymriah from Novartis (NVS) to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger. Kite Pharma (KITE), soon to be acquired by Gilead Sciences (GILD), is expected to grab a similar approval in November.In 2005, gene/cell therapy and drugs that biologically copy an existing product — known as biosimilars — didn't exist, Gottlieb told the MedTech Conference in San Jose, Calif.""Now we have products we're reviewing and approving,"" he said.Gottlieb is nearly five months into his stint as FDA commissioner. He was among the first appointments by President Donald Trump and took office in May. He first served as an FDA deputy commissioner in 2005-07.Gottlieb's background has him uniquely prepared to head up what is now a much bigger FDA, said Scott Whitaker, Chief Executive of AdvaMed, the world's largest medical technology association. Gottlieb was diagnosed with a type of lymphoma when he was younger.""It was the kind of tumor only a hypochondriac doctor would have found on himself,"" Gottlieb told the audience at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center. As a doctor, Gottlieb researched the type of treatment he wanted, knowing he had a very good chance of survival.IBD'S TAKE: Medtech stocks have been riding out drug-pricing fears that have hurt the pharma and biotech sectors, analysts say. Head to the Industry Snapshot for a closer look at winners and losers in the political discourse.He acknowledged not every patient fits into that bucket.""I was a very different patient from the patient who is told, 'You have a 20% chance of survival,'"" he said. ""They're looking for something experimental; something that might not be approved yet. There's a lot of different cancer patients.""Part of his challenge, Gottlieb says, is ensuring the FDA has policies that help all patients.""It's difficult to simultaneously serve both types of patients because by serving one patient you could potentially impact another patient,"" he said.Today, the FDA has its hands in a number of areas. Gottlieb says most people would be surprised to find he spends most of his time working on the tobacco side. What won't surprise the public, though, is that the FDA is working closely on ameliorating the opioid crisis.Last month, Trump declared the opioid crisis a national emergency. To cope, companies like Boston Scientific (BSX), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and Medtronic (MDT) are working on therapies called neuromodulation, which use electricity to conceal pain from the brain.Gottlieb notes medical products could step in as alternatives to addictive opioids. A medical device ""could deliver localized therapy or a patch to treat localized pain vs. drugs that have a systemic approach and are very addictive,"" he said.The FDA is also working on a framework for quicker review and certification of software programs. Rather than go through the longer products review, these software programs can be reviewed with less information.Apple (APPL), FitBit (FIT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pear Therapeutics, Phosphorus, Roche (RHHBY), Samsung, Tidepool and Verily will be involved in the pilot program which seeks to identify the information companies will need to provide for the quicker review process, Gottlieb said.""We need to modernize our regulatory framework so that it matches the kind of innovation we're being asked to evaluate, and foster beneficial technology while ensuring that consumers have access to high-quality, safe and effective digital health devices,"" he said.RELATED:This Biotech Craters 70% On Late-Stage Alzheimer's Drug Failure

102,JNJ,"The Nasdaq composite shuffled mildly lower at lunchtime in New York as most of the FAANG stocks slumped. But the Dow Jones industrial average edged higher, rising around 0.1% despite a 4% slide by General Electric (GE). Three of the Dow 30 stocks climbed 1 point or more, including Apple (AAPL), Home Depot (HD) and new medical-sector breakout Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).XGE reported disappointing Q3 results on Friday as adjusted earnings sharply missed views. But revenue climbed 14% to $33.47 billion, marking the first top-line increase in four quarters.J&J catapulted past a 137.18 flat-base buy point after reporting double-digit earnings and sales growth for Q3 last week. The 5% buy zone goes up to 144.04.At 1pm ET, the Nasdaq cut its loss to 0.1%; the PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100, was also down around 0.1%.The S&P 500 was flat as gains in retail, building and wood products, medical, and select computer-related shares offset sharp losses in the toy, internet content, airline, media, homebuilder, and oil and gas machinery industry groups. Volume is running a tad higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Friday.Breadth is negative on both exchanges. Losing stocks exceeded winners by a more than 3-2 ratio on the NYSE and the Nasdaq.Halliburton (HAL) weighed on the oil sector, falling as much as 2.2% before shaving some losses and bouncing off its 50-day moving average. The company reported third-quarter earnings of 42 cents a share vs. a penny in the year-ago quarter on an adjusted basis. Revenue jumped 42% to $5.44 billion, marking a second quarter of accelerating growth. Revenue rose 2% in Q1 and 29% in Q2.Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller said in a news release that its North American business ""is hitting on all cylinders"" while the international side has ""proved resilient.""WTI crude oil prices, currently near $51.85 a barrel, have rebounded 22% since bottoming near $42.53 in late June.Notice on a daily chart how the oil and gas field services giant is forming a new base, but the base still has a lot of work left. The base began in late January when Halliburton topped at 58.78, then dived below the 50-day moving average on Feb. 16.IBD's TAKE: The 50-day moving average is drawn in red in both IBD daily charts and on MarketSmith, IBD's premium charting and stock screening service. A leading stock tends to rise ahead of its 50-day line, and the moving average itself is rising. Read this column in Investor's Corner to learn more about how the 50-day line is a great tool for determining the right time to sell a good stock.Also in the energy sector, Argentine oil and gas explorer YPF (YPF) cleared a 23.32 buy point in a long cup-with-handle pattern. The 5% buy zone extends to 24.49.The company is aggressively pursuing fracking and horizontal drilling opportunities. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see earnings of 62 cents a share this year and $1.44 a share in 2018, a 132% leap.The latest base passes the midpoint test; that is, the midpoint of the handle is higher than the midpoint of the base. Yet shares are still building the right side of the cup. The cup's left-side high is 26.48.At 24, YPF is still nearly 10% off that cup's left-side high.Volume is running at triple normal levels. The average daily volume is currently 929,000 shares over the prior 50 trading sessions. YPF's integrated oil industry group is a market laggard, still dwelling in the bottom half of IBD's 197 industry groups. But group mate Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) has been hitting 52-week highs lately.Returning to Apple, the stock resisted the Nasdaq's slide, edging nearly 0.8% higher to 157.47 in light trade. While the stock is back near an Aug. 2 breakout point at 156.75 from a flat base, the iPhone giant is forming a new base with a 165.04 buy point.The stock's weekly chart shows Apple remains a leader and is still carving out a long-term uptrend.Apple, which reports fiscal Q4 results on Nov. 2, has gained 39% after breaking out of a bottoming base on Jan. 6-9. That base was a cup with handle, featuring a 118.12 entry.The Street is expecting long-term acceleration in Apple's fundamentals, a key factor for the stock's market-beating rise so far this year.Earnings are seen rising 8% for all of fiscal 2017 (ended in September) to $9.01 a share, then grow 23% to $11.09 a share in FY 2019 as sales pick up 6% to $227.5 billion and 17% to $265.6 billion.The iPhone giant is expected to begin selling its ultraluxury iPhone X later this week, but analysts have been noting component shortages and production bottlenecks are likely going to make it very difficult for consumers to purchase the $999 smartphone soon.Apple is reportedly meeting with officials at outsourcing manufacturer Foxconn to discuss the issue.First Solar (FSLR) rose more than 2.6% to 48.98. Volume is running mildly above average. The solar power systems supplier to utilities broke out of a deep bottoming base last summer and tried to break out past a 50.31 buy point in September. Since then, the Tempe, Ariz., midcap stock has encountered stiff resistance near 50 for weeks.Earnings are expected to plunge 56% to $2.21 a share this year, then fall an additional 42% to $1.28 in 2018. Revenue is seen rising 4% this year, but then falling 24% in 2018.First Solar's RS Rating is a respectable 88 on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in timesaving IBD tool Stock Checkup.In the IBD 50, longtime member TAL Education (TAL) slid more than 2% in fast turnover, but shares remain above the 50-day moving average. The stock has gained more than 150% since clearing resistance near 14 on a split-adjusted basis.TAL, a specialist in cram schools for Chinese students, broke out at 22.44 in July.RELATED:Halliburton Beats As North America Revenue Nearly DoublesThe Bottoming Base Pattern, And How It Makes Money For TradersFinding Hot Growth Stocks: A Peek Inside IBD 50How To Find Great Stocks: Start Your Journey Here

103,JNJ,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) approached a buy point Wednesday after pulling an upgrade with an analyst calling the pharma giant ""an EPS growth and dividend machine.""XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J popped 2.1% to close at 136.65. Shares began forming a flat base in July with a buy point at 137.18.Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford upgraded J&J to a buy rating and raised his price target to 157 from 145. He argues the consensus is undervaluing some of J&J's pharma assets, including drugs that treat plaque psoriasis, cancer, blood clots, depression and others diseases.Synergies from its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals — which it won in a bidding battle with Sanofi (SNY) — could help drive expectations for 2021. For that year, the consensus is currently modeling $44.6 billion in sales vs. Holford's view for $50 billion.""In turn, this should produce strong (earnings per share) momentum and better-than-expected dividends,"" he wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: J&J is far from the only stock nearing a buy zone with a number of FANG stocks nearing potential buy points. For a clearer breakdown on which stocks are approaching that key mark, visit IBD's Stocks Near A Buy Zone list.By 2021, J&J's pharmaceuticals unit is expected to drive 52% of sales and 65% of profits, ""yet we believe it is under-modeled by the sell-side,"" Holford said. He expects oncology drugs to drive 40% of the pharma unit's revenue growth over the midterm.Commentators have focused on the ""unlikely"" breakup of J&J's business. Instead, the firm should be appreciated as an earnings growth and dividend machine, Holford argues. Others say J&J is too expensive. But Holford disagrees on that point.""We think consensus estimates are too low after our deep-dive on pharma, as well as considering the company's ability to use its own capital to augment EPS growth,"" he said. ""We think the stock will re-rate to a market premium of at least 10% based on its diversified growth platform.""RELATED:Why Amgen, Lilly, J&J Are Interested In These Small BiotechsHow This J&J Partnership Bit The Dust On Gilead-Kite CompetitionDow Member J&J And Bayer Face A Battle In Augmenting Aspirin

105,JNJ,"MacroGenics (MGNX) toppled Friday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) terminated an agreement to develop a cancer treatment that would have rivaled drugs from Gilead Sciences (GILD)/Kite Pharma (KITE) and Novartis (NVS).XIn midday trading on the stock market today, MacroGenics dove as much as 11.5% to a six-week low, but was down 1.8% to close at 18.57. Johnson & Johnson fell 1% to finish at 131.03.J&J cited increasing competition in the space as well as neurotoxicity associated with the drug, duvortuxizumab, for its decision to bail out of the pact. Duvortuxizumab showed anti-cancer activity in a Phase 1 trial, J&J noted.Duvortuxizumab belongs to a class of drugs, known as bispecific antibodies, which stimulate an immune cell and direct it to a targeted antigen. The drug is being investigated as a potential treatment for several lymphomas and leukemias.""While bispecific antibodies hold tremendous promise, we think this news highlights some of the remaining development challenges for these agents, in particular in the context of the recent emergence of highly effective CAR-T cell therapies,"" Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to gain approval for a CAR-T therapy, but others are just on its tail. Get the scoop on how the major players break down by visiting IBD Industry Themes.CAR-T drugs are created by extracting immune cells from a patient, and then reprogramming them to fight cancer before reintroducing them to the patient. In some cases, bispecific antibodies and CAR-T drugs have the same targets, Schmidt said in a note to clients.Earlier this week, Novartis (NVS) was the first to gain approval for a CAR-T treatment. Kite, which is being acquired by Gilead, is expected to be next. Celgene (CELG) is also partnered separately with Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) on CAR-T drugs.""How various bispecific antibody platforms currently in development differentiate clinically remains unknown,"" Schmidt said.MacroGenics has a total of seven bispecific antibody programs which have entered Phase 1 trials in recent years. It's possible bispecific antibodies could be more potent in treating solid tumors, an area that remains challenging for CAR-T drugs, Schmidt said.Schmidt reiterated his outperform rating on MacroGenics. He doesn't expect MacroGenics to continue developing duvortuxizumab in the wake of competition from CAR-T drugs and other therapies in cancers that affect what are known as B cells.RELATED:Celgene Flirts With A Breakout; Could These 2 Giants Soon Join It?Gilead-Kite Deal Boosts Biotech ETF As It Clears A Buy PointAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To BenefitThese 4 Biotechs Just Moved Into Buy Zones; Is This Giant Next?How Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite Deal

108,JNJ,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer (BAYRY) will have an uphill battle in persuading doctors to add Xarelto to aspirin therapy for heart-disease patients, analysts said Monday after a trial showed some complications.XXarelto, a blood thinner, was tested alone and in combination with aspirin to cut down the risk of cardiac events in patients with some heart diseases. The combo reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, stroke or heart attack by 24% vs. aspirin alone.But it was also tied to more bleeding events. These events occurred in 3.1% of patients treated with the combination vs. 1.9% of patients treated with aspirin alone. Most of the bleeding occurred in the gastrointestinal tract, Johnson said in a news release.""Encouragingly, the trial found no difference in the rates of fatal bleeds, intracranial bleeding or symptomatic bleeding into a critical organ,"" RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in a note to clients.The results appear sufficient for the Food and Drug Administration to approve Xarelto in combination with aspirin in this setting, Novarro said. Doctors commonly use aspirin-only therapy to help cut down on the risk of cardiac events in heart-disease patients.Novarro notes the benefit/risk profile could have a ""potential impact on peak sales for Xarelto."" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, though, is more bullish. He notes the combo cut the risk of stroke and cardiovascular death by 42% and 22%, respectively.None of the bleeding in the trial proved fatal or occurred in the brain, he wrote in a note to clients. These results could ""drive a re-acceleration of growth for Xarelto as it expands the potential treatment population for the product by more than 50%,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks have seen better days. In July, the sector hit an 18-month high in anticipation of the second-quarter earnings season. Since then, long-term views for some companies have investors shaken. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at the setup.Fellow drugmaker Novartis (NVS) will be more challenged with its drug known as Ilaris, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said in a note to clients. In a Phase 3 trial, Ilaris cut down on the risk of major cardiac events in heart-attack survivors by 15% vs. a placebo.""We see these results, together with a lack of a significant benefit in cardiovascular mortality, as underwhelming and unlikely to result in a reasonable commercial opportunity for the drug in this overall population,"" he wrote.Overall, Ilaris showed a 24% relative reduction in the risk of heart attack and a 10% cut in the risk of cardiovascular death. In a subgroup of patients who hit a specific level of inflammation after the first dose, Ilaris resulted in a 27% cut in the risk of major cardiovascular events.Ilaris could have some legs in this group if Novartis can define the subgroup with regulators and negotiate with health insurers, Fernandez said.""Despite this, we believe the drug could still struggle to gain meaningful uptake based on the recent experience with anti-PCSK9 antibodies, and note that the current patent life of the drug extends to only 2024,"" he wrote.PCSK9 inhibitors are cholesterol-reducing drugs from the likes of Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN)/Sanofi (SNY). Cutting ""bad"" LDL cholesterol has been shown to have a benefit on the cardiovascular side as well, but PCSK9 inhibitors have struggled to gain uptake.At the close on the stock market today, J&J ticked up 6 cents to 131.74.

109,JNJ,"While the major indexes moved little Tuesday, megacaps still rallied and individual stocks still moved with gusto as earnings results continued to roll in at a faster pace.XLeading the market were the managed health care and diversified medical industry groups. The main reason: a pair of megacap plays, UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rallied sharply on positive third-quarter results. J&J gained 3.4% to 140.79 and cleared a 137.18 buy point in an excellent three-month saucer base in heavy trading.J&J's volume zoomed more than double average levels to 11.5 million shares. Over the prior 50 sessions, an average 5.1 million shares exchanged hands each day.The Dow Jones industrial average edged nearly 0.2% higher, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 were virtually flat. Volume is running lighter vs. the same time Monday on the NYSE and is a touch higher on the Nasdaq.The Nasdaq remains the market's leading index, up 23%, vs. a 14.3% gain for the 500 and a 16.4% lift for the Dow Jones industrials.The Russell 2000 fell 0.3%. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond inched up to 2.31%. Crude oil bounced off intraday lows and edged higher, with WTI futures rising almost 0.2% to $51.96 a barrel.The Dow Jones industrial average component J&J posted a 13% increase in earnings to $1.90 a share, matching the biggest gain in 12 quarters, as revenue growth accelerated (up 10% to $19.65 billion). The pharmaceutical, medical product and personal care giant had grown sales by 2% to 4% in each of the prior five quarters.J&J's saucer base could also be viewed as a long flat base as well. Either way, the buy point is the same, 10 cents above the base's left-side high.J&J's 61 Relative Price Strength Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, may seem low on a scale of 1 (very weak) to 99 (super strong), yet for long saucer base patterns, such an RS Rating is actually par for the course.Also, watch the stock's relative strength line, painted in blue on IBD and MarketSmith charts; an RS line that rises into new high ground helps confirm a stock's ability to outperform the S&P 500 and become a new market leader.Also, within J&J's saucer pattern, the heaviest weekly volume came during the week ended Sept. 15, when the megacap health care play rallied nearly 2.7% for the week. Big gains in heavy weekly turnover point to strong institutional demand.(Read more about the elements of a great saucer base via this Investor's Corner column written by my colleague Paul Whitfield.)J&J has a market value of $377 billion.The company's after-tax margin improved by 20 basis points to an impressive 26.5%. Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler told Reuters that J&J's oncology business ""is doing exceptionally well. It's really hard to figure out where that stops for both Darzalex and Imbruvica."" Both are used to treat cancer, the former for multiple myeloma, the latter for use in chemotherapy.UnitedHealth notched a fifth quarter in a row of 20%-plus EPS growth as earnings rose 23% to $2.66 a share. Revenue grew 9%, stretching a high single-digit pace for a fourth straight quarter.Elsewhere on the stock market today, Apple (AAPL) gained an additional 0.4% to 160.47 in dull volume. On Monday, shares boosted back above a 156.75 buy point in an 11-week flat base that was cleared Aug. 2. The 5% chase zone goes up to 164.59.Apple also is now back above the 50-day moving average, a bullish sign for techs and the major indexes.Since late 2016, investors have been warming up to Apple after the iPhone giant proved it can still grow.Earnings had fallen 18%, 23% and 15% in the three quarters through fiscal 2016, ended in September that year. But in the three most recent periods, Apple grew its profit 2%, 11% and 18%, and Wall Street sees Q4 profit rising 12% to $1.87 a share.Revenue is seen climbing 9% to $50.9 billion, then rising 10% to $85.91 billion in the holiday quarter ending in December.Apple has gained more than 39% since clearing a superb first-stage cup with handle, part of a long bottoming-base pattern, at 118.12 on Jan. 6-9. As seen in Stock Checkup, Apple's ratings have improved markedly as a turnaround play since the start of the year.Meanwhile, among newer issues, Azul (AZUL) (April 11 IPO) and Bright Scholar Education (BEDU) (May 18 IPO) deserve close watch as potential new market leaders.Azul, the Brazilian airline, dropped for a third straight session but shaved its loss to a measly 0.2%. At 27, the mid-cap transportation and Latin American play is testing support at the 50-day moving average for the fourth time since Aug. 30.The Street expects Q3 profit of 26 cents a share, up from a penny in the year-ago quarter. Revenue has climbed 30%, 32%, 20% and 15% in the past four quarters. Q3 revenue is expected to rise 18% to $631 million.China's Bright Scholar focuses on kindergarten to 12th grade international and bilingual education. The firm grew its revenue 34% to a record $159 million in 2016. In the May-ended fiscal third quarter, revenue jumped 24% to $60 million, a quarterly high.Wall Street expects earnings of 2 cents  a share in the fiscal fourth quarter ended in August, vs. a net loss of a penny a share in the year-ago quarter.Then, in the November-ending fiscal first quarter of 2018, profit is seen leaping 150% to 20 cents a share. The autumn tends to be a busy time for Chinese students who are preparing for exams and applying to new schools.The small cap is up 152% since its debut at 10.50 a share.(Follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung and track intraday updates on breakout stocks, market trends and other commentary.)IBD'S TAKE: At least three of the current stocks on IBD Leaderboard are also relatively new in the market, having gone public in 2014 or later.

111,JNJ,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter expectations early Tuesday on strength in its pharmaceutical unit and boosted its 2017 guidance — prompting shares to pop in premarket trades.XBy the closing bell on the stock market today, J&J stock jumped 3.4% to finish at 140.79. Shares broke out of a flat base with a buy point at 137.18 on Oct. 12.For its third quarter, J&J reported $19.7 billion in sales and adjusted income of $1.90 per share, up a respective 10.3% and 13.1% vs. the year-earlier quarter. Both metrics topped the consensus of analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research for $19.28 billion in sales and $1.80 a share in earnings.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro attributed J&J's sales beat to upside in its pharma unit. Global sales were $300 million above his forecast and $360 million above the consensus.Pharma revenue topped Novarro's estimate by $270 million, but medical device sales lagged.Worldwide pharma sales of $9.7 billion increased 15.4% on a year-over-year basis. Key products included cancer drugs Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, with the latter beating Novarro's views by $125 million. Sales from the new Actelion brands were $30 million below Novarro's model.IBD'S TAKE: J&J isn't alone in reporting quarterly results this week as earnings season kicks off in earnest. Keep tabs on IBD's Investing Action Plan for what's on deck each day.Medical devices sales grew 7.1% to $6.6 billion, but that included some shortfalls and was slightly below Novarro's view for $6.61 billion. Orthopedic and vision care revenue both were light by $25 million and $40 million, respectively, he wrote in a note to clients.J&J's consumer unit grew 2.9% to $3.4 billion and were just ahead of the RBC estimate for $3.31 billion. On an operational basis, over-the-counter and beauty sales each grew 4.4%, but all other categories fell ""highlighting the continued pressure in the segment.""The firm also raised its 2017 guidance to sales of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion, up from $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion. It sees adjusted income of $7.25-$7.30 per share vs. earlier expectations for $7.12-$7.22, Novarro wrote. Analysts had modeled $75.9 billion in sales and $7.19 in per-share earnings.J&J disclosed that its medical devices segment sustained a negative impact of 30 basis points following hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico. J&J is among a number of firms with manufacturing facilities in Puerto Rico. Investors have been wary of the effects of the storms.The negative impact was attributed to lost surgery days in areas affected by stormwater, wrote Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges in a note to clients. There was no supply disruption and all six of the firm's sites in Puerto Rico are open with generator power and running at different capacities.Porges notes that J&J's results could extend to others in the biotech space.""Given J&J's reliance on Puerto Rico for pharmaceutical manufacturing, and their lack of disclosure regarding demand and supply impacts, we are increasingly confident that companies in our biopharma coverage will not experience material storm-related Q3 headwinds,"" he said.But RBC's Novarro is a bit less bullish. J&J's results point to ""continued soft U.S. market trends"" in medical devices and diagnostics, he said. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, J&J's medical devices and diagnostics unit grew just 1.2% year over year.Overall, U.S. hospital admissions were down 50 to 100 basis points with U.S. surgical procedures down about 250 basis points, on a year-over-year basis, Novarro wrote. J&J's orthopedic sales were short on weak performance in its knee and spine segments.""Weak knee performance was blamed on the negative impact of India implant pricing legislation,"" he wrote, estimating a $10 million sales impact in the quarter. Worldwide, knee revenue declined 4.4% year over year. Revenue from hip products, though, grew 1.5% on pricing declines.J&J likely lost share to Stryker (SYK) in its knee-products unit, Novarro said. Global spine-product sales declined 7%. It's losing share in its U.S. spine-product segment, which benefits NuVasive (NUVA) and K2M Group (KTWO). This also suggests continued weak growth in the quarter for the U.S. spine-product market.Separately, it looks like J&J lost some share of the U.S. trauma-product market to Stryker, though worldwide sales grew 2.1%.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) and Medtronic (MDT) are taking pieces of J&J's surgery unit, Novarro said.RELATED:Why It Might Be Time To Buy Dow's J&J, A 'Dividend Machine'Dow's J&J Flirts With Buy Point On Bullish Pre-Earnings ReportThese Medtech Players Are Flailing On Hurricane-Related Headwinds

112,JNJ,"Stocks were narrowly mixed just after the starting bell Tuesday's, Netflix (NFLX) dragged on the Nasdaq and a slip by Boeing (BA) limited early gains on the Dow.XThe Dow Jones industrial average ticked up 0.1%, then harrowed its gains. The Nasdaq opened fractionally lower, and the S&P 500 surrendered its opening advance and also dipped into the red.IBD'S TAKE: Finding early stage, top-flight stocks is only part of the investing game. Knowing when to buy, and when to sell are just as important. IBD's CAN SLIM-based investment program tutors you through the start-up stages, and provides an arsenal of powerful tools as you progress.UnitedHealth (UNH) reported third-quarter results, jumping 3.3% to lead the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates and revenue met expectations. The stock had slipped last week, following new healthcare insurance rules set in motion by President Trump.Goldman Sachs (GS) opened down 0.4% as third-quarter earnings and revenue gained, while analysts had projected decreases on both lines. Investing and lending revenue played a big role, up 35% for the quarter.  Shares are trading below a 247.17 buy point in a seven-month saucer-with-handle base.Dow peer Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) added 01% after reporting an across-the-board beat in the third quarter. The stock is just above a 137.10 buy point in a four-month flat base.Boeing (BA) dropped to the bottom of the Dow, down 1.1% on news that European archrival Airbus (EADSY) had taken a controlling share in the embattled C Series Airliner program of Canada's Bombardier. Complaints from Boeing that Bombardier had sold a number of the narrow-body jets to Delta Air Lines (DAL) at artificially low prices led the U.S. Department of Commerce to impose a 300% tariff on the aircraft.Boeing shares Monday were trading just beyond buy range of a 246.59 buy point in a flat base.Netflix fell 2% after delivering its third-quarter report late Monday. Earnings grew less than expected, although revenue growth topped expectations and the company added more subscribers than forecast and offered fourth-quarter guidance above consensus forecasts. Netflix shares are extended, just out of buy range above a 190.05 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Among IBD 50 stocks, Centene (CNC) popped 1.6% after BMO Capital initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating. The stock is in a buy range, on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Economic news kicked into gear Tuesday morning with import-export prices from the Labor Department. Export price increased 1% in September, up from a 0.8% gain in August. Economists had projected price gains would slow in September, forecasting a 0.4% gain.The prices of imports rose 0.7%, above expectations for a 0.5% gain.

114,JNJ,"Stocks launched in a tight, flat mix Friday as weaker-than-forecast August retail sales and industrial production, a possible U.K. terror attack and a North Korean missile test kept investors in a cautious mood.The Dow Jones industrial average added 0.2%, pressing to another new high as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Verizon (VZ) and Caterpillar (CAT) showed strength in opening trade. The S&P 500 futures turned narrowly positive, while the Nasdaq Composite trimmed its thin, early gains as Apple (AAPL) and three of four FANG stocks stuck close to their starting levels in early trade.Global markets paused, but showed little response to a missile fired out of North Korea and over Japan early Friday. In Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 recovered to a 0.5% advance on Friday, leaving it up 3.3% for the week and marking its first weekly close above its 50-day moving average since July. China's markets posted a mixed finish, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up 0.1% Friday and ahead 0.5% for the week.Markets traded lower in Europe, where Frankfurt's DAX slipped 0.2% and the CAC-40 in Paris fell 0.4%. The FTSE 100 in London dropped 1.2% — taking an early fall after Britain's pound leaped to its highest level vs. the dollar since the U.K.'s June 2016 Brexit vote, then coming under additional pressure after a bomb exploded on a London subway, reportedly injuring 22 people in what police there were treating as a terrorist attack. For the week, the DAX and CAC-40 are tracking toward gains of around 2%, while the FTSE 100 is down more than 2%.Caterpillar rose 0.8% to take an early lead among the Dow Jones industrials. The stock is rattling off new highs, and extended after a July rebound from 10-week support.Boeing (BA) climbed 0.8%, clearing a flat base buy point at 246.59.Apple gained 0.3%, preparing to cap its seventh week of trade since edging above a 156.75 buy point. The tight, incremental gains are technically positive, but fundamentally maddening for investors who bought in as the stock cleared the entry point. Apple has now given up ground in six of the past seven sessions, despite this week's launch of the iPhone X and a passel of device updates, and is potentially heading for a test of support at its 50-day moving average.Nvidia (NVDA) rose 2.5% in powerful volume to lead the IBD 50 list. The gain put the chip developer at a new high, and just above a 174.66 buy point in a flat base.Oracle (ORCL) dropped 5.9%, the worst early hit among S&P 500 stocks. Better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter results reported after Thursday's close weren't enough to encourage investors, who focused on second-quarter guidance below consensus targets. The loss sent shares back below a 51.95 buy point as well as the stock's 50-day moving average, triggering a sell signal.Tempe, Ariz.-based First Solar (FSLR) grabbed an early 5% gain to lead the S&P 500. The company is still projected to see two years of profit declines, but shares are up 90% from an April low and looking for volume on a rebound from 10-week support. The heavy-volume leap lifted the stock above a 50.31 buy point in a six-week flat base.In economic news, retail sales took an unexpected dip in August, down 0.2%, according to the Commerce Department. That reversed July's 0.3% increase and disappointed consensus views for a 0.1% gain. Minus autos and gas, sales dipped 0.1%, vs. July's 0.5% gain and estimates for a 0.3% increase.Manufacturing activity in the New York region slowed less than expected in September, putting the New York Federal Reserve's September Empire State Manufacturing Survey at 24.4 for the month. That was just below August's 25.2 reading, but better than the drop to 19 forecast by economists.Industrial output slipped 0.9% in August, the Federal Reserve reported, down from a 0.4% gain in July and missing economists targets for a slowdown to growth of 0.1%. Capacity utilization decreased to 76.1%, also below estimates for a steady-as-she-goes reading of 76.7%.Commerce Department business inventories estimates for July and the University of Michigan's preliminary reading on September consumer sentiment come out at 10 a.m. ET.At 1 p.m., Baker Hughes (BHGE) delivers its weekly report of oil and gas drilling rig activity. Oil prices reversed early gains, sending West Texas Intermediate oil down 0.1% and back below the $50 per barrel mark.RELATED:The Big Picture: Nasdaq Falls, But These 2 Top Techs Break OutIBD Investor Research Tools Getting Started With IBDFollow The Market: Stock Market TodayUnderstand The Market: The Big Picture

115,JNJ,"Major indexes traded mixed in late afternoon trading Thursday, but remained in good shape overall.XMeanwhile, Square (SQ) showed a solid breakout from a second-stage base with a 28.07 entry. The electronic payments facilitator rose more than 4% to 28.77 and is still in buy range.As noted in IBD's premium stock-picking service, Leaderboard, the stock is in buy range. Don't buy shares more than 5% past the proper entry, or in this case 29.47.At 3:45 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq composite was off nearly 0.5% but remains up for the week with a 1.1% weekly gain. Plus, the Nasdaq's intraday range is narrow, suggesting that large players in the market — from mutual funds and hedge funds to banks, insurers and pension managers — are reluctant to sell with vigor.The S&P 500 was off just 0.1% and is within arm's length of its recent new all-time high of 2498. The S&P SmallCap 600 was down nearly 0.2%.Only a handful of IBD's 197 industry groups are up 1% or more; they include the solar, automaker, water utility, hospital, leisure product and semiconductor equipment names. Applied Materials (AMAT) is leading the chip gear names with a 2% gain to 47.19 in slightly above-average turnover.Watch for a potential breakout by the tech giant past a 47.96 base entry. Aggressive traders could act if the stock breaches the 47.59 near-term high.There doesn't seem to be too much hoopla about the possibility of the S&P 500 breaking the 2500 barrier. In fact, as seen in IBD's Psychological Market Indicators section, bullishness among stock newsletter editors tracked by Investors Intelligence has actually fallen to 47.1%, the lowest since the aftermath of the Nov. 8 U.S. elections.Meanwhile, the put-call volume ratio recently notched a high of 1.18 on Aug. 17, meaning that among options traders, pessimism is still rampant. And that's good for equities. Why? Pessimistic investors have generally sold stocks and raised cash, thinking that equities are due to fall. But if they don't, these pessimists could potentially become new buyers of stocks.The Dow Jones industrial average rose nearly 0.2% as four of the 30 components, including United Technologies (UTX), 3M (MMM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), rose 1 point or more.United Tech is trying to reclaim its key long-term support level, the 200-day moving average, which is near 116. Meanwhile, the 50-day moving average is now trending lower. The manufacturer of aircraft engines, elevators and security systems triggered a sell signal for short-term investors when shares pierced the 50-day moving average near 122 during a high-volume sell-off on July 25.On that day, United Tech reported a 2% jump in Q2 profit to $1.85 a share. Earnings growth has been stuck in the low- to mid-single digits for four straight quarters, unlike the bigger EPS increases seen among members of IBD Big Cap 20, IBD's screen for premier growth companies with a market value of $15 billion or more.Like Apple (AAPL) in earlier years, when Steve Jobs reassumed the CEO post, then spurred a series of game-changing consumer electronic devices and digital services, San Francisco-based Square has made a big hit with its easy-to-use hardware and software for small shops and individual sole proprietors (think plumbers, taxi drivers and the like) to enable fast, secure transactions at the point of sale.IBD's TAKE: Notice how, on a daily chart, Square is showing two bullish traits. First, the stock found buyers near the 50-day moving average (painted in red on an IBD daily chart), a common occurrence among stocks that get strong institutional support. Second, the relative strength line, drawn in blue in both IBD charts and in IBD's professional-grade stock screening and charting service MarketSmith, has rocketed into new high ground. This means that Square is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.Square lost money from 2012 to 2015, but last year it notched earnings of 4 cents a share. Wall Street now expects profit to catapult 500% higher this year to 24 cents a share and another 79% to 43 cents in 2018.Revenue jumped 35% to $1.71 billion in 2016, up from $203 million in 2012. The Street sees the top line sliding 45% to $942 million this year, but then rebounding 25% to $1.17 billion in 2018.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Square gets a commanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, which means that the stock's fundamental, technical and fund sponsorship attributes place it in the top 2% of all companies in IBD's database.As noted in IBD Leaderboard, the current new base is second stage.Apple shares, meanwhile, continue to hold on to a thin gain following an Aug. 2 breakout from a second-stage flat base at 156.75. The stock was featured heavily in IBD's Stock Market Today column back in early January when the iPhone giant broke out of a first-stage bottoming base at 118.12. Shares have since climbed more than 39%.Apple is expected to post a third quarter in a row of double-digit EPS growth, up 13% to $1.88 a share in the September-ending fiscal fourth quarter.Apple's earnings rose 2% in the fiscal first quarter ended in December 2016, snapping a three-quarter streak of falling profits, then grew 11% and 18% in the next two quarters.In FY 2018, earnings are accelerating 21% to $10.91 a share, up from an 8% jump in the current fiscal year.Elsewhere, Oracle (ORCL) is hanging tight ahead of its fiscal first-quarter results due after the close. The stock, nearly flat at 52.74, holds a 12% cushion of gains after it gapped up powerfully on June 22 on improved Q4 results. That move sent shares past a 47.09 entry in a solid flat-base pattern.The database and cloud-based enterprise software giant is mimicking Apple's latest trend of slowly reaccelerating its growth. In the November-ended fiscal second quarter, Oracle's earnings slumped 3%, but then rebounded 8% and 10% in the past two quarters. Analysts see Q1 profit rising 9% to 60 cents a share on a 5% increase in revenue to $9.03 billion.In fiscal Q4, Oracle's net margin improved by 220 basis points to 34.5%.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures surged nearly 2% and reached as high as $50.50 a barrel intraday, while natural gas futures eclipsed the $3/million BTU level and hit its highest levels since May of last year. Futures got as high as $3.10.The sell-off in U.S. government bonds remained in place; the yield on the benchmark Treasury 10-year bond returned to the 2.20% level.The spread between the 3-month note (1.05% yield) and the 10-year bond remains healthy at 115 basis points.RELATED:When To Sell A Stock: Take Many Gains When The Profit Reaches This LevelHow To Invest: How To See If It's The Right Time To Buy StocksInvesting For Kids: How To Make A Million Dollars

116,JNJ,"AstraZeneca (AZN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) face ""tough tasks"" of not disappointing during the upcoming European Society of Medical Oncology meeting, an analyst said Thursday as he noted a series of looming catalysts for the drug industry.XThe market is assuming multibillion dollar peak sales for AstraZeneca's Imfinzi and Tagrisso, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford wrote in a note to clients. AstraZeneca is set to present trial information for both during the September conference.Imfinzi is an immuno-oncology drug with accelerated approval to treat bladder cancer. It was tested in one trial to treat advanced lung cancer. Tagrisso has accelerated approval to treat lung cancer and recently wrapped a different series of tests for lung cancer.""Any shortfalls in quality or even just treatment durations could drive up to 8%-10% downside moves for either study in our view,"" Holford wrote. The trials are important after AstraZeneca's immuno-oncology combination trial disappointed in July.Eli Lilly, meanwhile, needs to positively surprise on what is known as the Monarch 3 trial for its breast cancer drug abemaciclib after setbacks for drugs baricitinib and Trulicity. Regulators recently delayed baricitinib, a rheumatoid arthritis drug.IBD'S TAKE: Drugmakers are ranked No. 105 out of 197 groups IBD tracks. Keep tabs on strong sectors and the best performers within them by bookmarking IBD Data Stories.Last week, Novo Nordisk's (NVO) diabetes drug semaglutide proved more effective than Lilly's Trulicity on two measures in a head-to-head comparison. Both belong to a class of diabetes drugs called GLP-1 medicines.""If it can achieve this (positive results in Monarch 3), we see 3%-5% midterm earnings and valuation upside against 2%-4% downside if it misses out more conservative expectations,"" Holford said.Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer (BAYRY) look likely to benefit from the European Society of Cardiology conference when they unveil results of a trial testing the ability of their drug, Xarelto, to reduce major cardiovascular events in patients with heart diseases.""The key focus will be on the bleeding profile given the market appears to assume that only the Xarelto/aspirin combo arm will hit, but with excessive bleeding,"" Holford said. A more positive outcome could spike Bayer stock 4%-6%.Similarly, Novartis (NVS) is expected to present full results from a trial called Campos which looked at a drug known as ACZ885 in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients who've survived a heart attack. Good results could prod Novartis up 5%-7%.RELATED:How Two Drugmakers Will Benefit On AstraZeneca's CoattailsAll Eyes Will Be On This Dow Component's 'Star' Drug Next WeekWhy Dow's Merck Is Credit Suisse's Top Pharma Pick

117,JNJ,"Key U.S. index funds were moderately higher Tuesday as the S&P 500 rose to a new record high.XSPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) and SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gained 0.3% each; PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) added 0.1%. Small caps led the upside with iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) up 0.7%.Oil, financials and homebuilders led the upside in the stock market today, while utilities, real estate and biotech lagged. SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) surged 3% to reclaim its 50-day moving average, VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) rose 2.5% to also retake its 50-day line. West Texas intermediate crude prices were up 0.4% to $48.24 a barrel.SPDR S&P Regional Banking (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE) gained 2.4% each. Goldman Sachs (GS) jumped 3% after announcing plans to boost annual revenue by $5 billion.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK), which has Apple (AAPL) as its top holding, was flirting with the flat line. Apple reversed higher as its much anticipated product launch event got under way. The iPhone maker's shares remain in buy range from a 156.75 flat-base entry.A market pullback can set up potential buy opportunities at the 50-day or 10-week lines, while a rebound can yield a breakout from a base.As such, two dividend funds are in or near breakout territory, given the stock market's solid bounce during Monday session.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) cleared a 37.60 flat-base buy point on Monday to close at an all-time high. It remains in buy range from the entry. Shares rose 4% from an April flat-base breakout and 6% from a breakout in January.The $1.6 billion fund tracks the index with the same name, which is comprised of the 300 companies in the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Index that rank the highest in terms of combined growth and quality factors. The factors include long-term earnings growth expectations and three-year historical averages for return on equity and return on assets.Information technology and health care accounted for the two biggest sector weightings as of Sept. 8, at about 21% of assets each. Industrials weighed in at nearly 20%; the next largest sectors were consumer discretionary and consumer staples at a respective 17% and 13%. Top holdings included Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Apple, Microsoft (MSFT) and McDonald's (MCD).The fund has outperformed the S&P 500 year to date through Sept. 8 with a 13.6% vs. 11.5% gain, according to Morningstar Direct. It's also ahead for the past three years. DGRW's annualized yield is in line with the S&P 500 at 1.9%; its expense ratio is 0.28%.IBD'S TAKE: Apple is a big holding in many big-cap equity funds. Is it worthy of your watch list? One way to find out is to consult IBD Stock Checkup. It tells you how a stock ranks in its industry group.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Arisocrats (NOBL) closed just shy of a 59 buy point, also of a flat base, on Monday. The fund was featured in the July 11 ETF column as it sought support near its 50-day moving average. It advanced 2% from that bounce before pulling back along with the broader market to form a flat base.The $3.1 billion fund tracks the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which is made up of companies that have increased their dividends every year for 25 consecutive years. Consumer staples, industrials and health care were its three biggest sector weights at 26%, 17% and 14%, respectively. Consumer discretionary made up 12%.AbbVie (ABBV), Brown-Forman (BFB), Chevron (CVX) and Target (TGT) were among its top holdings. NOBL lags the S&P 500 with a YTD gain of 9.3%, but slightly leads the benchmark index with a three-year average annual return of 9.9% vs. the S&P 500's 9.4%. The ETF bears a 0.35% expense ratio.Monday's picks, SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) and First Trust NYSE Arca Biotechnology Index (FBT), edged higher Monday and remain squarely in buy zones from their respective entries at 82.48 and 121.02.RELATED:2 Hot Biotech Plays In Reach, But Is Apple Still In Buy Range?Dow Leads Thanks To This Stock; 2 Ideas To Tap Emerging MarketsNew Chance To Buy Hot Chip Stocks Like Nvidia May Be Coming Up

118,JNJ,"Stocks faded into the close Thursday, although index moves remained generally mild. Meanwhile, Nasdaq titan and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) topped a buy point.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 lost less than 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, a market leader of late, fell a fraction. The Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.1%.XVolume was higher, according to preliminary figures.Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) edged past the 137.18 buy point of a base-on-base pattern but closed below it. Credit Suisse offered praise for the pharmaceutical and diversified medical products giant, saying it remains ""bullish on the story.""Alphabet, whose base was highlighted in a Stock Market Today story earlier this week, made the new highs list as it edged higher and topped a 1,006.29 buy point. But volume was below average and the price move itself lacked power, with shares closing unchanged at 1,005.65. A lagging relative strength line added another doubt to the breakout.Megacap stocks don't usually move in outsized volume, but several were on the decliners list: Northern California power utility PG&E (PCG) slid 6%; AT&T (T) gapped down on a sharp loss in TV subscribers; and Citigroup (C) reversed lower sharply after its earnings report.Blackhawk Network (HAWK) plunged 20.5% after it reported earnings and gave a weak outlook. ""We have recently seen increasing competitive pressures in some retail markets and believe this will result in lower growth in our U.S. retail physical channels going forward,"" CEO Talbott Roche said. He added the company is seeing excellent growth in digital channels and broader diversification.NMI Holdings (NMIH) gapped past a buy point Thursday on news that the mortgage insurer is being added to the small-cap S&P 600. NMI shares surged past the 12.70 buy point of a cup-with-handle base in huge volume.XNMI Holdings is replacing SciClone Pharmaceuticals (SCLN), which is being acquired by GL Capital Management.

The maker of Monster Rehab and other drink brands is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 8, with analysts expecting 21% EPS growth.

Time will tell if, in the short term, that turns out to be a good bet.Applied Materials is 19% above its recent 47.69 buy point in a later-stage cup with handle, putting just below a potential profit-taking zone. Lam Research is already in the 20% - 25% profit-taking area.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and automaker General Motors (GM) topped the list of new sells this month. JPMorgan showed 42 net sellers (89 selling minus 47 buying), while GM had 29 (43 selling, 14 buying).Megacap medical stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) came in third, with 24 net sellers (68 selling, 44 buying).Despite the selling, Johnson & Johnson is still within buy range after retaking a 137.18 entry on Oct. 17 after reporting a 13% rise in Q3 earnings.JPMorgan has continued to climb beyond a 95.32 buy point, but after reporting earnings on Oct. 24, General Motors has been giving back a chunk of the 25%-plus gains it made from a breakout in September.

125,JNJ,"Stock indexes were mixed midday Thursday, but the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average kept its leadership role vs. the major indexes.XThe Dow rose 0.4%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq advanced 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 added 0.5%.Volume in the stock market today was higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq  vs. the same time Wednesday.In each of the previous three weeks, the Dow has outperformed the major indexes. The Dow also is leading so far this week.What accounts for that?Four Dow components are largely responsible. So far this month, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) is up 14%; 3M (MMM), 12%; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), 10%; and Caterpillar (CAT), 10%.Also, the 30-component Dow is a price-weighted index, and three of the four stocks are in the top 10 in price. Caterpillar, 3M and Johnson & Johnson recently reported earnings and each topped the Street's consensus views on earnings and revenue.Wal-Mart will report quarterly results before the open Nov. 16. The Street expects revenue to rise 2%, but earnings to slip 1%.In the IBD 50, a list of some of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, advancing issues led declining issues by a 7-to-4 ratio.The top percentage gainer was Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL), which popped more than 5% in heavy volume.

126,JNJ,"Celgene (CELG) and AbbVie (ABBV) are likely to be the biggest beneficiaries of the inflammatory bowel disease market which is expanding at a rapid 20% clip, an analyst said Wednesday.XThe biologics market for these gastrointestinal diseases generated $9.2 billion in sales in 2016, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a note to clients. AbbVie's Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade, both anti-TNF drugs used to fight inflammation, dominate the market today.""We believe this market is likely to continue or exceed its recent 20% growth rate, with significant share and value likely to accrue to Celgene and some offsetting value available also for AbbVie despite the inevitable erosion of AbbVie's dominant Humira franchise,"" he said.New classes of inflammatory bowel disease drugs are arising. That's where the likes of Celgene, Roche (RHHBY), Galapagos (GPLG), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie are looking to make their marks with drugs now in Phase 3 trials for Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis — common forms of the disease.But earlier trials, without the benefit of clinical data to back them up, are having some difficulty in recruiting patients, Porges said. Many of these trials also exclude sicker patients, including the patients who've stopped responding to their current treatments.IBD'S TAKE: Earlier this year, AbbVie said it expects Humira to hit peak international sales in 2018 before facing erosion. Head to IBD's Technology page for a breakdown on where AbbVie sees its biggest drug going and how it plans to offset competition.Though anti-TNFs like Humira and Remicade were the ""first truly disease-modifying treatment approaches,"" many patients don't respond to or stop responding to anti-TNF drugs, Porges said. Studies suggest 50%-60% of anti-TNF patients don't respond or lose response within a year.Estimates show there are up to 1.6 million patients in the U.S. with inflammatory bowel disease. Of those, about 640,000 have Crohn's disease and another 680,000 have ulcerative colitis. Patient numbers in Europe are about 60%-70% higher than in the U.S.This ""provides a large opportunity for drugs based on new mechanisms,"" he wrote.RELATED:Perrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCould This Small Biotech Break Out On A Tie-Up With Eli Lilly?AbbVie Topples As Humira Sales Brake For Third Straight Quarter

127,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bayer's (BAYRY) anticoagulant Xarelto will likely be the ""star"" of next week's European Society of Cardiology conference, an analyst said Friday.XIn February, Dow component J&J ended the trial dubbed Compass earlier than expected, based on how efficient Xarelto was in reducing major cardiovascular events, including heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death, in patients with some heart diseases.Full results from that Phase 3 trial are to be presented during the conference Aug. 26-30. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan reiterated his outperform rating and 147 price target on J&J ahead of the meeting.""We expect meaningful improvement in efficacy,"" he said in a note to clients. Xarelto was tested as a 5-milligram dose twice daily and as a 2.5-milligram dose twice daily in combination with aspirin. The trial was stopped a year early after the drug proved efficient vs. aspirin alone.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs are now ranked tenth out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from seventh last week and fourth two weeks ago. What caused the stocks to lose their steam? Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look.""For such a large study to be stopped so early for efficacy, we assume the added benefit in Compass must be quite meaningful,"" he wrote. ""Based on the trial design population and our conversations with experts, we assume the relative risk reduction will be 20% or more.""J&J hasn't said whether Xarelto alone or in combination with aspirin proved successful in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events. Divan notes the Data Monitoring Committee allowed the 27,000-plus pool of patients in the trial to remain on Xarelto, likely due to limited safety concerns.How well each side of the trial performed will define the commercial impact, Divan said. Talking physicians into no longer using aspirin — if Xarelto alone proved strongest — will be more of a challenge than persuading them to add a low dose of Xarelto onto aspirin treatment.Divan sees the Compass data helping to expand the total addressable market for Xarelto by at least 50% and could lead to an additional $1.5 billion in annual sales in the U.S. alone.Fellow Dow component Merck (MRK) is expected to unveil data from its trial dubbed Reveal during the conference. In June, Merck said its drug anacetrapib proved effective in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients already receiving LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs.Investors will key in for Merck's comments on how long the drug stays in the body after it's been administered. In earlier studies, as well as in the most recent Reveal trial, anacetrapib was found to accumulate in fat tissue.Novartis (NVS) is also expected to have data from a Phase 3 trial named Cantos to determine the benefit of its drug Ilaris in patients with a high risk of a recurring cardiovascular event. In June, Novartis said the trial hit its main goal, but it gave limited data in the release.""Previously, Novartis management has said (Ilaris) would need to show a 20% relative risk reduction in order to be commercially relevant and the company ideally wanted to see a 25% (relative risk reduction) from the study,"" Divan said. He noted a relative risk reduction of 14% would be statistically significant.Ilaris is already approved to treat several rare inflammatory diseases.RELATED:Why Dow's Merck Is Credit Suisse's Top PickTrump Blasts Dow's Merck After CEO Resigns From Manufacturing CouncilHow AbbVie's 'Gauntlet' Could Squeeze Gilead's Drugs In Hepatitis C

His resignation was in apparent protest to Trump's response.Trump condemned the ""hate, bigotry and violence, on many sides,"" in a statement Saturday. He's since drawn heat for not being more explicit in his condemnation. In response, Frazier said he felt it was his  ""responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism.""""America's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,"" Frazier said in a statement on Twitter.IBD'S TAKE: Merck has an IBD Composite Rating of 48, meaning it performs in the bottom half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

136,JNJ,"Puma Biotechnology (PBYI), Portola Pharmaceuticals (PTLA) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) led a deluge of losses Thursday that saw the sector slide to a seven-week low and IBD's 444-company Biotech industry group slip two spots in rank.XIn midday trading on the stock market today, biotechs overall lost 3.1%, touching a low last seen June 20. The biotech industry group is now ranked sixth out of 197 groups IBD tracks, down from fourth last week.Biotech stocks hit an 18-month high in July, riding a wave ahead of second-quarter earnings. As of Wednesday's close, the sector has fallen 6% from that high as the earnings season comes to a close. On Wednesday, Portola, Puma and Alnylam offered their reports.Alnylam's sales missed expectations and adjusted losses were deeper than expected, prodding shares to drop 7.5%, near 74.50. But Leerink analyst Paul Matteis remained bullish on Alnylam, keeping his market perform rating and 83 price target.He sees an ""ideal"" opportunity for Alnylam in treating acute hepatic porphyria with its drug, givosiran. The disorder involves the buildup of chemicals within the body. Alnylam's drugs belong to a class that use RNA interference to silence specific genes.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked like it had chilled in late July as long-term views remained cloudy. But that followed a number of biotechs that beat second-quarter expectations and raised guidance. Get the details via IBD Industry Themes.""We think acute hepatic porphyria represents an ideal indication for RNA interference medicine on the basis that it is an underserved orphan disease driven by a single target,"" Matteis wrote in a research report.Alnylam is also aiming to file an application for patisiran before year's end. Patisiran is being developed to treat a rare condition known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis in which abnormal proteins build up on multiple organs, damaging and impeding them.Puma dove 9.9%, near 71.70, after announcing late Wednesday that European approval of its breast cancer drug, Nerlynx, has been pushed back to at least the first quarter of 2018, from earlier view for the third quarter of 2017.Nerlynx's commercialization is likely to be the biggest driver of shares in the near-term, RBC analyst Matthew Eckler told clients in a note. There's also the potential, ""or lack thereof,"" for partnering of mergers and acquisitions, he said.The firm also reported losses of $2.10 per share, widening from $2.05 per share in the year-earlier quarter. That missed analysts' view for a $2.04 per-share loss. Adjusted losses of $1.38 per share widened by 21 cents. Analyst views were not immediately available.Late Wednesday, Portola said it's working through some manufacturing-process changes that could push its U.S. launch of Bevyxxa to the first quarter of 2018. But the biotech reiterated its plan to launch sometime between September and November, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.Bevyxxa is a treatment to prevent blood clots in hospitalized patients at risk due to moderate or several mobility restrictions. The drug is Portola's first and only approved in the U.S. Its pipeline includes another anticoagulant, blood cancer drugs and an anti-inflammatory drug.European regulators are expected to issue an opinion on Bevyxxa by late 2017 or early 2018.For the second quarter, Portola reported $3.8 million in collaboration and license revenue, dipping from $4.2 million in the year-earlier period and lagging a $4.3 million model. Losses of $1.22 per share grew by 20 cents and were wider than the consensus view for a 98-cent loss.Revenue stemmed from agreements with Dow components Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) under its Janssen unit, as well as with Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Bayer (BAYRY) and Daiichi Sankyo.Portola toppled 8.2%, near 55.40.RELATED:Alnylam Reports Lagging Sales, Wider-Than-Expected LossesPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan TrendCan Generic Drug Stocks Catch A Break After Mylan's Crash?

137,JNJ,"Though the Federal Reserve kept its key interest rate steady last month, it's widely expected to start unwinding its balance sheet in September.XWhen the Fed stops buying Treasuries and mortgage backed securities, the increased supply could send prices down and drive yields up, leading to higher interest rates.That means investors will again focus on which sectors of the stock market are most likely to outperform as rates climb. For instance, banks and other financials, industrials and consumer discretionary are areas that tend to benefit from higher rates.A couple of new (or fairly new) kids on the exchange traded fund block aim to offer outperformance with stocks in a rising rate environment. One of the newest is ProShares Equities for Rising Rates (EQRR), which launched July 25.""EQRR is for investors who expect rising interest rates and want to outperform traditional large-cap indexes as rates go up,"" Michael Sapir, co-founder and CEO of ProShare Advisors, said in a statement. ""EQRR takes those sectors most positively correlated with interest rates, then within those sectors invests in the companies that have tended to outperform during periods of rising rates.""The fund, which tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Large Cap Equities for Rising Rates Index, has attracted $14.3 million in assets. The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 21 were financials at 30%, energy 24%, materials 18% and industrials 16%. Information technology accounted for 12% of assets.Its top holdings included E-Trade Financial (ETFC), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), Lincoln National (LNC) and Bank of America (BAC). The top 10 stocks, which account for about 30% of assets, are all banks or insurers.EQRR carries a 0.35% expense ratio.Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR), set to mark its anniversary Sept. 12, has gathered $152.5 million.The fund, which tracks the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates, invests in large and midcap companies that are expected to keep paying and growing their dividends. The stocks must also have a positive correlation of returns to rising 10-year U.S. Treasury yields. Boston-based Geode Capital Management serves as subadvisor for the fund.Technology led FDRR's sector weights at nearly 22%, followed by a 14% weighting in health care, 11.5% consumer cyclical and 10% in financial services as of Aug. 18, according to Morningstar Inc. It had modest exposure to sectors such as real estate and utilities, which pay big dividends, but can be highly sensitive to increasing interest rates.Six of the fund's top 10 holdings as of Aug. 21 were Dow Jones industrial average components: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Merck (MRK) and Exxon Mobil (XOM). The top 10 comprised nearly a quarter of total assets.The ETF has slightly underperformed the broader market this year with a 7.4% return vs. the S&P 500's 10% gain through Aug. 21. FDRR's expense ratio is 0.29%.Keep in mind that with FDRR still under a year old and EQRR about to mark its first month, there isn't a proven yet track record available.The next Fed monetary policy meeting is scheduled for Sept. 19 and 20. The odds of a rate hike in December are at 40%, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.RELATED:Miss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits HighsNext-Gen ETFs For Rising Rates Offer High Yields And Low Volatility

139,JNJ,"Botox-maker Allergan (AGN) topped Wall Street's second-quarter model Thursday, but stock reaction was muted on light sales of eye drug Restasis and stagnant revenue from fat-stripping drug Kybella.XFor the second quarter ended June 30, Allergan reported adjusted income of $4.02 per share on $4.01 billion in sales, up a respective 20% and 8.7% vs. the year-earlier period. The consensus expected adjusted earnings of $3.95 a share on $3.95 billion in sales.Allergan also raised its 2017 guidance to $15.85 billion to $16.05 billion in revenue and adjusted income of $16.05-$16.45 per share. Previously, Allergan had guided to $15.8 billion to $16 billion in sales and adjusted earnings of $15.85-$16.35 a share.""This raise was unexpected in our view,"" Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler said in a note to clients. Koffler kept her 267 price target and buy rating on Allergan stock. ""The stock may be held back by some mixed performance in key products.""Botox cosmetic revenue of $210.3 million in the U.S. missed Koffler's estimate for $212.7 million, though it grew 10.7% year over year. But Botox as a therapeutic in the U.S. brought in $346.9 million, topping Koffler's view for $325.6 million and grew 17.2%.Allergan cited ""trade buying patterns"" despite stable volume demand for a 9.4% decrease in sales of eye drug Restasis to $336.4 million. That number also missed consensus views for $359 million, Koffler said.IBD'S TAKE: Allergan leads the medical aesthetics market, but rivals like Hologic (HOLX), Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) have pieces of the sector. Head to Industry Snapshot for a closer look at the layout.In its gastrointestinal unit, sales of Linzess increased 11.5% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $167.8 million but widely missed Street expectations for $186 million to $188 million, Koffler said. This follows a $20 million destocking in the first quarter.Sales of Kybella, an injection used to improve the appearance of fat under the chin, were flat at $12.7 million. Juvederm collection sales climbed 7.3% to $126.2 million. CoolSculpting sales were $78.9 million, following the close of the Zeltiq acquisition in late April.On the stock market today, Allergan inched up less than 0.1% to close at 250.36. In July, shares topped a 251.04 buy point out of a flat base that began forming in February.RELATED:Could This Biotech Be Headed For A Deal After CEO Takes Reins?This Small Biotech Launched To A 9-Month High Today — Here's WhyHow These 2 Biotechs Defied The Downtrend To Hit Fresh Highs

"
144,JNJ,"The potential cancer-cure disclosures that propelled Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock up 43% one day in June and an additional 15% one day in September indicate innovation in cancer research and treatment that many investors say could keep Loxo aloft.XWith a potential near-blockbuster cancer treatment in the making, Loxo is recognized by Investor's Business Daily in the inaugural IBD Biotech Innovators Awards. Its lead drug looks medically promising, but it targets a relatively small patient population, so annual revenue is expected to fall short of the $1 billion that defines a commercial blockbuster.But it could get close. Loxo stock made that big leap on June 5 after the company disclosed progress in Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials for its lead drug candidate, larotrectinib. The Sept. 13 leap for Loxo stock followed word it would disclose Phase 1 trial data for its tumor fighter at the annual meeting of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, set to start Saturday, Oct. 15. Loxo stock touched its all-time high of 95.92 on Sept. 28.The company expects to file a New Drug Application for  larotrectinib by early 2018. If the Food and Drug Administration approves the NDA within six months, as Loxo expects, the company could begin sales to specific patients almost immediately.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers, and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)Loxo's focus on developing highly selective ""precision medicine"" for patients with genetically defined cancers is gaining ground with researchers, patients and doctors — and fund managers.Rather than looking to attack a specific cancer, say by using compounds that kill lung tumors (and sometimes either don't work or kill healthy cells too), Loxo uses increasingly popular gene sequencing to identify patients hosting a specific gene mutation resulting in a tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) fusion. These are abnormal proteins that tell tumor cells to grow. Using Loxo's novel compound that inhibits TRK fusion activity — called TRK inhibitors or kinase inhibitors – Loxo's clinical trial therapy demonstrated improvements in patients with 17 different types of cancer.Hence, Loxo's larotrectinib is gaining attention in research clinics and on Wall Street. It could well become the first drug initially approved by the FDA to target mutant proteins in many cancers rather than targeting a cancer itself.Loxo spokesman Dan Budwick calls this approach ""tumor agnostic,"" and notes that Merck's (MRK) Keytruda was indeed approved in May for treatment of any unresectable metastatic solid tumor with specific genetic qualities, a first from the FDA.But Keytruda was initially approved, in 2014, for metastatic melanoma, then for non-small-cell lung cancer in 2015, then head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in 2016, and was already in widespread use when Merck applied to the FDA to also use Keytruda in a gene-sequencing tumor-agnostic approach rather than the old tumor-specific approach. In contrast, Loxo's larotrectinib would be the first time the FDA initially approved a cancer drug using the tumor-agnostic gene-sequencing approach.IBD'S TAKE: Loxo recently hit an all-time high, but what companies are doing so at the moment? IBD's New Highs list tracks these movers, but also ranks them by IBD Composite Rating.Loxo's potential has Wall Street's attention. The number of mutual funds holding Loxo shares jumped 27% in Q2, supporting a market cap near $2.7 billion and a secondary offering in late June. It marked eight straight quarters of rising fund ownership. Loxo of late sports a highest-possible IBD Relative Strength Rating of 99, putting it among the top 1% of stocks in price performance over the past 12 months.Some two weeks after Loxo's June 3-5 reports at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago, the world's biggest cancer conference, Loxo sold more than 3.6 million shares of common stock in a secondary offering, pricing shares at 72, although the stock had traded well below 20 as recently as November. The company raised $260.8 million before expenses.The stock performance of Loxo rivals or would-be rivals, however, has been spotty at times, though most are on a roll of late.Loxo's peer Ignyta (RXDX) — which went public in early 2014, five months before Loxo — has mostly traded below its IPO price of 10, though on Thursday Ignyta stock touched a 22-month high of 14.70.Loxo partner Array Biopharma (ARRY) peaked near 16 shortly after its 2000 IPO, but the stock is way up since touching a six-year low below 2.50 in February 2016, this month hitting an eight-month high of 12.68.Blueprint Medicines (BPMC), which like Loxo develops kinase inhibitors, went public at 18 in 2015 and on Sept. 29 hit a new all-time high of 71.67 after a 50% September run-up.At ASCO in June, Loxo reported a 76% objective response rate — tumor sizes were reduced in 76% of patients — across many cancer types in clinical trials with patients whose tumors hold TRK fusions.""Larotrectinib delivers consistent and durable responses in TRK fusion patients across all ages, regardless of tumor context, and does so with few side effects,"" Dr. David Hyman, the research team's principal investigator in Loxo's larotrectinib trials, told the ASCO conference. Hyman is chief of early drug development at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. ""In this way, the larotrectinib/TRK-fusion story fulfills the promise of precision medicine, where tumor genetics rather than tumor site-of-origin define the treatment approach.""Cowen analyst Eric Schmidt says Loxo estimates 1,500 to 5,000 U.S. patients annually could benefit from larotrectinib treatment. In the trial data disclosed to ASCO, patients with the greatest tumor shrinkage — at or near 100% — included those with soft-tissue sarcoma, lung and colon cancers, melanoma and salivary-gland cancer. In all, 17 types of cancer are being treated in three trials with 55 patients who have at least one thing in common: those gene mutations causing kinase or TRK fusions that tell the cancer cells to grow.Larotrectinib earned Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA in July 2016, meaning the FDA gives it some priority because early trials suggest the new therapy offers a serious advantage over existing treatments for people with life-threatening diseases. (Breakthrough is not necessarily the FDA's highest priority, however. Fast Track and Priority Review designations and an Accelerated Approval Pathway are the FDA's urgent alternatives.)Larotrectinib, then called Loxo 101, received the Breakthrough designation for ""unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with (neuronal) TRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed (worsened) following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments,"" noted the Friends of Cancer Research. The nonprofit counted 47 FDA Breakthrough designations in 2016, of which 17, including larotrectinib, targeted cancer.Analyst Schmidt says the recent efficacy data for larotrectinib are among ""the best ever that we have seen in oncology."" He estimates a peak larotrectinib market of $500 million in annual sales in five to 10 years. Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison sees larotrectinib peaking at $800 million in annual sales around 2025.Loxo, which went public in August 2014 at 13 per share, conceivably could get acquired at a blockbuster-like premium, though no buyout talk has surfaced. Among biotechs that end up being purchased, most are acquired before becoming profitable, says Schmidt. Cowen estimates Loxo won't escape the red ink until after 2020.""One thing that has transpired since (ASCO in June) is Celgene's (CELG) pricing on Idhifa at $25,000 per month, a new high for the niche oncology market,"" Schmidt told IBD.  ""This will give Loxo some breathing room and perhaps lead them to consider a higher price for larotrectinib.""Idhifa was approved by the FDA on Aug. 1 to treat AML, the most common form of acute leukemia in adults. Celgene estimates some 21,000 new AML cases are diagnosed in the U.S. annually.June's secondary offering, which more than doubled Loxo's cash pile to nearly $470 million as of June 30, helped Loxo make a $40 million acquisition of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitors program from Redx Pharma. It renamed the Redx drug candidate Loxo-305.In Loxo's acquisition release, its chief business officer, Jacob Van Naarden, called the deal ""another program to our pipeline that so nicely aligns with our larger strategic vision and capabilities. The Redx team has created a novel chemical matter that selectively and reversibly inhibits BTK, a validated molecular target across numerous B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.""Analyst Schmidt told IBD the $40 million price tag ""looked right to me. The BTK target is validated, and there is unmet need in patients who fail Imbruvica,"" AbbVie's (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) commercial name for ibrutinib, which treats complications from stem-cell or bone-marrow transplants known as chronic graft versus host disease, or GVHD.In his research note, Morgan Stanley's Harrison praised the BTK acquisition, calling it ""a logical addition to the Loxo pipeline."" He rated Loxo stock as overweight, with a 91 price target. Cowen's Schmidt rates Loxo outperform but doesn't offer a price target.The Cowen analyst was unfazed by Loxo's Q2 financials, with losses greater than estimated. ""Cash-burning biotech earnings rarely are interesting,"" Schmidt said. Loxo reported a wider loss of $30.4 million, or $1.14 a share, up from $15.9 million, or 77 cents, in Q2 2016. Loxo is slated to post Q3 results on Oct. 31.With its cash hoard, Loxo is in no danger of running out of money for years, but  investors expect sales and profit before then.Cowen's Schmidt, who's met at least twice recently with Loxo's top brass, says the company is ""on track"" toward speedy approval for larotrectinib.Loxo is working on other potential drugs, including the BTK inhibitors bought from RedX to target leukemia and lymphoma, and a pipeline with partner Array Biopharma for six kinase inhibitor targets. But it's too early to suggest that any will approach blockbuster status.RELATED:Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkHere's Why Loxo Oncology Stock Hit A Record HighWhy This Small-Cap Biotech Stock Popped To A New High

145,JNJ,"Jeffrey Leiden's office shelves are plastered with all the accoutrements you'd expect from the chief executive of a $39 billion biotech. But from the awards, letters of accommodation and inevitable family photos, emerges a theme.Gratitude.Leiden's Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) currently aims to treat 31,000 cystic fibrosis patients across the globe. Cystic fibrosis is a progressive, genetic lung condition and those who survive into adulthood generally don't live past the age of 38, according to most estimates.XIn 2012, Vertex set out to change that and the success it's seen with two medicines — soon to be three — on the market have generated the 50 to 100 pieces of mail plastered to Leiden's shelves. They're letters of thanks from graduates and newlyweds.""We get about 50 (letters and emails) a week from patients and families thanking us for what we do,"" Leiden told Investor's Business Daily. ""We know all these patients. Most of them are kids and teenagers and we watch them grow up. It's like being part of a family. Not a company.""Vertex wasn't always a cystic fibrosis play. In earlier days, it was focused on treating hepatitis C and launched a drug known as Incivek in 2011. Then Gilead Sciences (GILD) launched its drug, Sovaldi. That launch was one of the most successful in history. It also nearly put Vertex out of business.Though Incivek became a blockbuster drug shortly after its launch, Vertex pulled it from the market in 2014 as demand withered. Leiden describes that time as one of ""crisis"" for the company.""We were in the middle of a crisis,"" he said. ""We had gone from being a hepatitis C company with a billion-dollar drug for literally one year to essentially zero revenue. And there are very few companies that can, frankly, survive that kind of crisis simply because it's so hard to pivot to a new area or drug.""But for 13 years, a division of the company in San Diego had been quietly working in the cystic fibrosis arena. The indication fit in with Leiden's strategy: investing in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for serious diseases with large unmet medical needs in specialty areas.Vertex's specialty focus allows it to keep its sales and marketing forces slim which, in turn, allows it to reinvest nearly nine in 10 dollars of its revenue back into research and development. It sells cystic fibrosis drugs in the U.S. with a sales force of fewer than 20, Leiden said.Fast forward to 2017. Vertex has two drugs on the market — Kalydeco and Orkambi. In the second quarter, sales of Kalydeco, its first approved cystic fibrosis drug, grew 5% year over year to $190 million and Orkambi rocketed 32% to $324 million.Year to date, Vertex stock has more than doubled, rising 108%. Shares began forming a cup with handle and a 163.74 buy point in late July. Meanwhile, the broader biotech industry group has risen 28% and is ranked eighth out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 20 just 13 weeks ago.Shares of Vertex dipped 0.5% to close at 151.26 on Friday.Vertex is a rarity among biotechs, in a way. Its pipeline is almost solely in cystic fibrosis. Of 13 drugs in its pipeline not already licensed out to bigger pharmaceuticals, 11 are in cystic fibrosis. Leiden acknowledges the risk from a portfolio standpoint.But some products simply don't make sense for Vertex, he said. Vertex has farmed out drugs in flu and cancer to Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck KGaA because the enormous sales contingent it would take to sell drugs in those indications would take away from reinvesting in science.Reinvesting in science has allowed Vertex to do something else unique. Whereas medicines from other firms target the symptoms of cystic fibrosis, Vertex is working to correct the genetic underlying causes of the disease to, eventually, prevent infants diagnosed with it from ever fully developing it.The underlying science focuses on about 200 genetic mutations that can be divided into four ""buckets,"" Leiden said. Kalydeco can treat 10% of patients. Orkambi, a combination of Kalydeco and a drug known as lumacaftor, can treat another 50%. Eventually, though, Vertex plans to treat 90% of patients.Getting to that third ""bucket"" of patients, though, will require a three-pronged treatment strategy. Already, the ""backbone"" for that triple is being considered for approval in the U.S. and Europe: A combination of Kalydeco and a drug called tezacaftor. That looks likely to be approved in February 2018.On top of Kalydeco/tezacaftor, Vertex is adding a ""next-generation corrector,"" a drug that can fix other abnormalities in genes to treat another 30% of patients. Vertex has strong Phase 1 data for three next-generation correctors in combination with Kalydeco/tezacaftor, and a fourth ready to read out soon.The eventual goal is to decide which of the four possible triple-pill combinations will provide the most efficient treatment with few to no side effects. After that, Vertex plans to use gene editing to treat the last 10% of cystic fibrosis patients for whom traditional small molecule medicines won't work.Leiden won't comment on when he expect a triple-pill to get approval. He sees pivotal trials beginning next year. Most analysts take that to mean the U.S. Food and Drug Administration could approve a triple-pill from Vertex in 2019-20.Vertex's goal with the triple is to prevent infants, less than 1 year of age, from developing cystic fibrosis as it's known today. In adults who already have lung damage, Kalydeco has been shown to improve lung function within two weeks and, over time, slow the rate of decline in lung function.IBD'S TAKE: Vertex is among several leaders nearing a buy zone. Head to IBD's list, Stocks Near A Buy Zone, for other near-term opportunities including an entertainment stock and a financial services play.""Rather than declining at 1%-2% per year, they decline at 0.75% per year in lung function,"" Leiden said. ""And while that may not sound that significant, it's sort of like compounded interest. Take that over a lifetime and it makes an enormous difference in both their survival and their quality of life.""The quality of life improvement is huge, Leiden said.""They used to go to the hospital four to five times per year. Now it's zero to one time per year,"" he said. ""They used to be on a transplant list. Now they're not a transplant list. They used to be able to walk one block. Now they can walk miles. It's not just their longevity but their quality of life.""Galapagos (GLPG) and AbbVie (ABBV) have teamed up to follow in Vertex's steps, but both Leiden and JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko are doubtful the duo can catch up. To get FDA approval for a triple-pill combo, they must show strong data for each component first.Bayko estimates Galapagos is several years behind and even if it does make it to market, its triple-pill would have to have outstanding efficiency to persuade Vertex's patients to switch to a new medicine.""Vertex has done a good job at continually improving on its meds,"" she told IBD. ""They keep moving the bar higher. They make it challenging for people to want to go on a drug that will be just as good as Vertex's. Why would you want to do that if you can just get on Vertex's drug?""Some are more bearish, though. Jefferies analyst Michael Yee sees Galapagos eventually getting 20% of the cystic fibrosis market. Still, he notes Vertex has created a strong setup for itself with making barriers to entering the market high and delivering strong medicines.He, like others, questions what Vertex will do after its cystic fibrosis well runs dry. Leiden acknowledges the cystic fibrosis journey is nearing an end but says Vertex has plans to shift into other rare diseases like sickle cell, a genetic lung/liver condition and a deadly nerve disorder.""Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (a lung/liver condition) looks a lot like cystic fibrosis,"" Leiden said. ""We have the technology and we know how to go after it.""And as to the bears skeptical about Vertex's cystic fibrosis pipeline?""There's a group of analysts or investors out there that say, 'Well, it's really great they want to do that but we'll see if they're able to, I'm skeptical,'"" he said. ""The reason that's weird to me is we've already done it. We've proven we can do it and we've proven the model.""""I don't think it's a question anymore.

146,JNJ,"AbbVie (ABBV) threw ""the gauntlet down"" to Gilead Sciences (GILD) with the approval of a hepatitis C drug that could further hammer Gilead's multibillion-dollar franchise, an analyst said Friday.XLate Thursday, the Food and Drug Administration approved AbbVie's drug dubbed Mavyret with a coveted eight-week label for all genotypes of hepatitis C patients — most hepatitis C drugs are taken over a 12-week period. AbbVie is pricing the treatment at $26,400 for eight weeks, at a deeper discount than two prominent drugs now being prescribed for the condition: Gilead's Harvoni and Epclusa.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges estimates Mavyret will be offered at a 14% discount to what Gilead sees in revenue for a prescribed course of Harvoni and at a 63% discount to Epclusa.""This competitive dynamic, now solidified by the FDA, agrees with our forecasted market share and price erosion for Gilead, and our modeled rebound of AbbVie's hepatitis C revenue beginning in 2018,"" Porges wrote in a note to clients.Porges called for Gilead to remain competitive in the 75% of patients where Harvoni can be given for eight weeks, but it will still lose some share there based on contracts with payers. Two populations of patients treated with Mavyret will undergo treatment for 12-16 weeks.Other patients will likely migrate to Mavyret based on the convenience of the eight-week regimen, he predicted. Gilead's drugs Epclusa and Vosevi are dosed over 12 weeks. Harvoni is prescribed 12-24 weeks, but some patients can be treated in eight weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Whether Gilead makes an acquisition could be the linchpin in sending the biotech sector higher, one industry observer says. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a closer look at which companies Gilead might be considering.Mavyret's broad label gives AbbVie access to the vast majority of hepatitis C patients, with the exception of those who've failed on some drugs from Dow components Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and a drug from Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).The FDA is not requiring genotype testing ""which is a big advantage over Gilead and other participants in the market,"" he wrote. But Mavyret does have a black box warning on its label for the risk of hepatitis B reactivation in patients with both infections.Patients will undergo pretreatment testing for hepatitis B infection and then monitoring if they are found to have both hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Porges says this isn't a significant burden as most hepatitis C patients will have already been screened for hepatitis B.AbbVie will likely focus early efforts on the government segment where Mavyret's wholesale price is in line with Harvoni but undercuts Epclusa.""Conversely, for AbbVie, this pricing means that the revenue contribution from Mavyret is likely to be limited, and largely consistent with our existing forecast,"" he said.On the stock market today, AbbVie closed flat at 70.99. Gilead fell 1.6% to 73.16.RELATED:Gilead Could Be Making An Acquisition — But It's Not What You ThinkGilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Up On BeatHow AbbVie Could Hammer Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise

147,JNJ,"Stocks dropped at the starting bell despite some strong early economic news Thursday, as disappointing earnings reports from Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Wal-Mart (WMT) compounded the market's reaction to Wednesday's release of Federal Reserve minutes and concerns over developments in Washington.XThe Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 shed 0.2% at the start of trade. The Nasdaq Composite dumped 0.2%, as Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks all posted moderate losses.Markets stalled Wednesday ahead of the release of minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's July meeting, and just after news broke that the Trump administration had abandoned two key business councils manned by blue chip top executives. The decision once again stirred concerns that Washington's commitment to tax cuts and other key elements of the president's agenda would not be soon in coming.The chief executives of Corning (GLW), General Electric (GE), United Technologies (UTX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had decided to leave the council Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported, in response to the President Trump's response to events Saturday in Charlottesville, Va. The heads of Merck (MRK) and Under Armour (UA) had announced their exits Monday, and leaders of the Alliance for American Manufacturing and the AFL-CIO resigned from the group Tuesday.Blackstone Group (BX) Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman informed the White House that members of the President's Strategic and Policy Forum had decided to dissolve the group, according to the Wall Street Journal. Minutes later, the President tweeted that he was eliminating both the Manufacturing Council as well as the Strategy and Policy Forum.On the Dow, Wal-Mart and Cisco threw out the early anchor, both posting declines after their quarterly results.Cisco fell 2% after earnings and revenue declined in line with expectations, but growth in services and recurring revenue was lackluster. The loss dragged shares back below 10-week support, as the stock attempts to build a floor in a three-month consolidation.Wal-Mart dragged 2.2% lower after meeting analysts' second-quarter targets and providing guidance below expectations. Comparable store sales rose 1.8%, near the top end of guidance in a 12th straight advance.

The stock has been attempting to retake a 46.05 cup base buy point.Data storage gear maker NetApp (NTAP) slumped more than 3% in early trade, despite reporting a fiscal first-quarter sales and earnings beat late Wednesday. Second-quarter guidance was in line with expectations. The decline cut the stock's 10-week moving average in heavy tgrade, sending a sell signal, but stopped short of a 7% decline below a 43.18 buy point, avoiding the automatic sell rule.After the close, Applied Materials (AMAT), Latam Airlines (LFL), Gap (GPS) and Ross Stores (ROST) are among the companies scheduled to report.Manufacturing slowed less than expected in the mid-Atlantic region in August, sending the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey to 18.9, down from a reading of 19.5 in July, but above consensus forecasts for a dip to 17. The report pointed to notable increase in shipments and new orders, and continued expansion in jobs growth, in a 13th month of consecutive growth.The New York Fed's Empire State Survey on Wednesday surged past forecasts to its highest mark in three years.First-time unemployment claims dropped to 232,000 in the week ended Aug. 12, the Labor Department reported.

149,JNJ,"President Trump said Wednesday he's disbanding two advisory groups of American business leaders, after CEOs quit this week as the president faced blowback for failing to sufficiently condemn white supremacists.Trump made the announcement on Twitter, less than an hour after one of the groups was said to be planning to inform the White House that it would disband.Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum, I am ending both. Thank you all!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2017Trump's remarks were a reversal of what he said a day before, when he tweeted that he had plenty of CEOs who wanted to be on the panels to replace those who quit, and called the CEOs who left ""grandstanders.""Several more CEOs on the councils said after Trump's remarks that they had informed their respective panels that they would step down, suggesting that Trump scrapped the panels before they dissolved entirely.The strategy council, led by Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman, said that participation had become an unwelcome ""distraction.""BlackRock CEO Larry Fink told staff in a Wednesday memo that he had informed the strategy council he was stepping down within the past 24 hours.JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon, who earlier this year hailed Trump for reigniting ""animal spirits,"" said Wednesday afternoon that ""it is a leader's role...to bring people together, not tear them apart.""The strategy group is one of several the White House convened earlier this year to advise the president. Several CEOs from a manufacturing council quit this week, following blowback over Trump's remarks about racially charged violence in Virginia on Saturday.Pressure to leave the groups has grown following a press conference Trump held in New York Tuesday where he placed partial blame for the weekend violence on demonstrators protesting a gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Va. A woman was killed during the event after a man rammed a car into a crowd.While more than half a dozen CEOs have quit a manufacturing CEO group, others have said they wanted to stay on the panels in order to influence White House policy.The manufacturing council hasn't met since February. The CEOs of Under Armour (UAA), Intel (INTC) and Merck (MRK) quit earlier this week. And on Wednesday Inge Thulin, CEO of 3M (MMM), left, as did Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison.""Following yesterday's remarks from the president, I cannot remain on the Manufacturing Jobs Initiative,"" Morrison said in a statement. ""I will continue to support all efforts to spur economic growth and advocate for the values that have always made America great.""Jeff Immelt of General Electric (GE), Alex Gorsky of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Gregory Hayes of United Technologies (UTX) stepped down from the manufacturing council minutes after Trump said he was scrapping that body.

150,JNJ,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) stock neared an all-time high Thursday after the medical giant reported second-quarter profits and revenue that narrowly topped Wall Street's views.XIn early trading on the stock market today, Abbott surged 2.9% to 50.85, near its all-time high of 51.74 reached in July 2015. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), its closest competitor, lifted 1% to reach 136.57, an all-time closing high.For the second quarter ended June 30, Abbott reported adjusted income of 62 cents a share on sales of $6.64 billion, growing a respective 12.7% and 24.4% vs. the year-earlier period. The consensus had called for adjusted profits of 60 cents per share on $6.62 billion in sales.The major sales growth included the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which was completed in January. On a comparable year-over-year basis, excluding that acquisition, sales grew 2.9%, Abbott said in a news release.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro credited the slight revenue beat to higher-than-expected sales in Abbott's medical devices unit, which offset light sales from the nutrition segment. Revenue from medical devices grew 3.2% on a comparable basis. Nutrition sales rose less than 1%.IBD'S TAKE: Abbott belongs to a medical-related exchange traded fund that have racked up healthy gains this year. Visit IBD's ETFs page for a closer look at other top holdings and how they performed in the first half of the year.Adult nutrition sales fell hardest, down 2% across the globe, on a comparable basis. In the U.S., sales from the segment toppled 3.4% on ""competitive and market dynamics,"" Abbott said. In the first half of the year, adult nutrition revenue declined 4.5% in the U.S.But a ""solid quarter"" in Abbott's diagnostics unit helped offset that. Diagnostics sales inched up 5.4% on a comparable basis to $1.27 billion with sales growth in the U.S. easily outperforming international sales.Meanwhile, drug sales climbed 3.5% excluding the impact of acquisitions to $1.02 billion. Key emerging markets led the drug unit, growing 4.6% worldwide. Sales of other drugs were flat.Abbott also boosted its 2017 adjusted profits outlook to $2.43 to $2.53 per share. Analysts are broadly calling for $2.47 earnings per share, Novarro wrote. He kept his outperform rating on Abbott stock.RELATED:Could Philips' Rivals Stage A Coup For Spectranetics?Which Biotechs Benefit Most Under Trump's Tax Reform Vision?

151,JNJ,"Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) remains Credit Suisse's top pick heading into the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in October, but drugmakers Allergan (AGN) and Eli Lilly (LLY) also look strong, the brokerage said Monday.Around that time, Merck is expected to unveil the results of its trial, dubbed Keynote-189, testing immuno-oncology drug Keytruda plus chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with advanced lung cancer. The combo received accelerated approval in May.""We expect continued discussions around the potential uses of Keytruda while awaiting the top-line data from the confirmatory Keynote-189 study in the September/October time frame, which we expect to be positive,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said.On its second-quarter conference call in July, Merck confirmed a cyberattack could delay some products this year, saying ""full recovery from the cyberattack will take some time."" Still, Merck is best-positioned for the remainder of 2017, Divan said in a note to client.Merck shares ended the regular trading session up 0.5% to 62.67.Though investors seem to prefer AbbVie (ABBV) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), Divan is placing his bets on Allergan and Lilly. Still, there are several months until Allergan is expected to unveil data in a migraine trial, he said.And though Lilly offers a diverse pipeline, more interest is on Novo Nordisk's (NVO) trial known as Sustain-7, which is looking at its diabetes drug semaglutide vs. Lilly's Trulicity. Divan sees Trulicity as safer than Novo's drug.Lilly is expected to unveil data from a trial of its drug abemaciclib in breast cancer during an upcoming oncology conference, Divan said. Lilly is also planning to file applications for a migraine drug and is driving adoption of new drugs in cancer and plaque psoriasis.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have struggled lately and are now ranked seventh out of 197 groups tracked by IBD, down from fifth last week. The sector hit a seven-week low Thursday after hitting an 18-month high in July. Head to IBD Industry Themes for more on what happened.Meanwhile, Divan isn't as bullish on the commercial potential of drugs from AbbVie in inflammatory diseases and immuno-oncology. He also calls for ""relatively rapid erosion"" of sales from key drug Humira in the U.S. once generics enter the market, likely in 2022.In Bristol's case, rumors it could become a takeover target have limited its stock in the near term. But early assets in immuno-oncology and potential approvals in kidney and liver cancers could drive upside over time, Divan argued.Credit Suisse also reinstated coverage of Dow stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in July, but Divan noted its valuation may be limiting investor interest. This will likely change after J&J's release of data from its Compass trial during the European Society of Cardiology meeting.That meeting is set later this month. J&J is looking at the ability of its anticoagulant, Xarelto, to prevent major adverse cardiac events including cardiovascular death, heart attack and stroke in patients with some heart diseases.""We expect Compass to be the star of the meeting and has the potential to dramatically increase uptake of Xarelto in the coming quarters, something that can move the needle even for a company J&J's size,"" Divan wrote.But Divan also noted he downgraded Pfizer (PFE) and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) to neutral ratings from outperform during the quarter. Dow stock Pfizer is struggling with near-term catalysts and a lacking acquisitive appetite amid the potential for tax reform.Teva, on the other hand, is range-bound ""until a new leadership team is in place, a strategy to reduce their debt is more certain and more clarity on the potential of generic versions of Copaxone (a multiple sclerosis drug) 40-milligrams is obtained,"" he wrote.RELATED:Will Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?Generic Drugs Are Rebounding Despite Teva, Mylan Free-FallPerrigo's Beat-And-Raise Lifts Generic Drugs, Bucks Teva-Mylan Trend

152,JNJ,"Major stock indexes held near highs Monday afternoon, but weren't moving much in either direction, as the Nasdaq hit another record high and Wall Street weighed weaker-than-expected existing-home sales data and a lowered U.S. economic growth outlook.The Dow eased 0.2%, weighed down by weakness in shares of Nike (NKE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and General Electric (GE), which were down close to 2%. The S&P 500 lost 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite gained 0.2%. Volume on the NYSE was tracking about 20% lower than Friday.

Several other analysts also initiated Blue Apron with buy ratings. Shares soared 16% to 7.59. The stock is still about 30% off its high after a 43% plunge.Inside the IBD 50, 10 stocks were up 2% more in afternoon trading.Veeva Systems (VEEV) gained 3% to 65.25.

The question to ask now is: Does Momo have the potential to be a true leader? Fundamentals are solid at the social networking platform, but volume has been light during the stock's recent rally. Keep in mind that China stocks have been running higher for a while now, and Momo still hasn't broken out yet.Meanwhile, IBD 50 component Winnebago Industries (WGO) added nearly 2% to 35.35 as it works on a cup-with-handle base with a 36.70 buy point.Elsewhere, Alphabet (GOOGL) was little changed ahead of its earnings report after the close.

153,JNJ,"Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) stock bolted late Wednesday after the biotech smashed Wall Street views for second-quarter sales and reported narrowing losses just a day after it settled a patent dispute with BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN).For the second quarter ended June 30, Sarepta reported adjusted losses of 46 cents a share on revenue of $35 million, compared with losses of $1.19 per share and no revenue in the year-ago quarter.

The gain scored a breakout past a 32.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base, and the gap up move opened a buy range valid through 34.72.Chipmaker Inphi (IPHI) surged 7% out of the starting gate, as investors reacted to second-quarter earnings and revenue that narrowly topped analyst targets, while third-quarter revenue guidance was below consensus views. The gain boosted Inphi back above its 10-week moving average, as the stock tries to start up the right side of a six-month, 36% deep consolidation.Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) vaulted 6%. The Quebec-based drug maker reported a smaller-than-expected decline in earnings, and revenue slipped in line with forecasts. Management trimmed slightly its full-year revenue guidance. The stock is up 96% from an April low, and extended above a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.On the downside, Tenet Healthcare (THC) tumbled 11% as revenue more than tripled but failed to meet expectations and the company significantly lowered its full-year earnings guidance.Avis Budget Group (CAR) dived more than 9% upon reporting a big second-quarter earnings miss late Monday. Revenue also missed views, but by a narrower margin, and management carved back its full-year EPS guidance. UniCredit downgraded its bond rating on  both Avis and Hertz Global (HTZ) to sell.

The Nasdaq composite backed out of thin early gains and slipped into negative trade.The weakening overnight of the Republican effort to overhaul the Affordable Care Act, and considering more strongly the option to simply repeal the ACA without any sort of replacement legislation, sent the U.S. Dollar Index to a 10-month low in very early trade Tuesday and weighed on early market action.Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) posted the Dow's heaviest opening losses, down 0.9% and 0.8%, respectively. Goldman reported a strong earnings beat and a smaller-than-expected decrease in second-quarter revenue. Trading revenue fell 17%, the bank said, led by a 40% drop in fixed-income trading — a metric that has been weak across banking sector reports so far for the second quarter.Netflix (NFLX) pounded out an 8% opening gain, after reporting a 67% rise in second-quarter earnings, just below analyst targets, while a 32% revenue gain topped expectations and management raised its third-quarter sales and earnings guidance to above consensus views. But the big number was subscriber gains: up 5.2 million vs. Street expectations for 3.2 million new paying viewers.

158,JNJ,"Bellwether Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) second-quarter report bodes well for the biotech sector, an analyst said Tuesday, after the Dow component topped profit expectations and narrowly lagged sales views.On the stock market today, J&J stock climbed 1.8% to 134.46, as biotech stocks dropped nearly 1% as a group. Generic drugmakers inched down 0.3%.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges remains bullish on the biotech sector and Needham analyst Mike Matson says J&J's second-quarter results point to a stable period for medtech players like Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Stryker (SYK) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).During the quarter, J&J's drug sales grew 4.7% sequentially, though they fell 2.6% vs. the year-earlier period. Porges partially blamed a one-time positive rebate adjustment in 2016 which eliminated 4% of year-over-year volume/price growth in the second quarter.Sales of J&J's immunosuppressant Remicade declined 14% year over year. But rivalry from biosimilars contributed to just 5% of that decline, which is lower than guidance for a 10%-15% decline in 2017, Porges wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Cancer and rare-disease specialists are expected to do well in the second half of 2017 as positive sentiment returns to the biotech space. Visit IBD's Industry Snapshot for a look at who may outperform in the second quarter.J&J also expects currency headwinds to subside in the second half of 2017 and called for acceleration in its pharmaceutical unit as well as positive trends in sales outside the U.S. Based on the presumed currency impacts, the firm raised its outlook for adjusted profits to $7.12-$7.22 a share.Outside the U.S., drug sales grew 7% sequentially in the second quarter, beating views for 3% growth, Porges said.""(This) supports our expectations for sequential outside-U.S. revenue growth for our companies due to a weakening dollar in the second quarter,"" he said.Porges expects guidance increases for biotechs during the second quarter. Earlier in the week, he called for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) to easily beat June quarter sales views and for Gilead Sciences (GILD) to handily top profit expectations.""Our covered companies will not be negatively impacted by the same prior period adjustments as J&J, and those with current or imminent biosimilar competition may surprise consensus if the Remicade market dynamics can be viewed as a proxy,"" he said.AbbVie (ABBV) could see some pain, though. Sales of cancer drug Imbruvica grew 40% in the U.S. and 64% outside the U.S., J&J said. J&J is partnered with AbbVie on Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J typically books 40% of U.S. Imbruvica sales, Porges said. This translates to about $501 million for AbbVie's Imbruvica sales.This would be a ""miss vs. consensus of $514 million and our estimate of $537 million,"" he said. ""For AbbVie, Imbruvica is considered the largest growth driver beyond the Humira patent cliff, but continued missed consensus expectations repeated in the second quarter would be a negative for the stock.""RELATED:'Stars Align' For These Biotechs To Crush Earnings ConsensusThese 2 Drug Giants In Buy Range Just Beat Earnings ViewsHow Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its Rivals

159,JNJ,"Two stocks in buy range — Swiss drugmaker Novartis (NVS) and Dow industrials component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) — both reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings early Tuesday.XNovartis earned $1.22 a share excluding various items, down from $1.23 a year earlier. Sales fell 2% to $12.24 billion amid growing generic competition for cancer drug Gleevec. But the numbers were better than analyst forecasts for earnings of $1.16 a share and revenue of $12.1 billion.Excluding Gleevev/Gilvec, sales of cancer drugs rose 9%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. Bone marrow stimulant Promacta/Revolade pulled in $210 million, up 35%. Sales of advanced melanoma and advanced lung cancer combination Tafinlar and Mekinist grew 28% to $216 million.Consentyx was another driver, growing 90%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, to $490 million, Novartis said in a news release. The drug is approved to treat plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and inflammation of the spine and joints.Despite broadening competition in multiple sclerosis treatments that includes the likes of Biogen (BIIB), Roche (RHHBY) and Sanofi (SNY), Novartis' MS drug Gilenya brought in $837 million, up 5% excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. But Celgene (CELG) is now working on a drug that could directly rival Gilenya.Novartis' Alcon eye-care unit reported a small sales increase to $1.5 billion. Novartis raised its full-year Alcon sales target slightly, hinting at a possible spinoff for the division. Sales of contact lenses grew for the fifth consecutive quarter, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted in a report.On the stock market today, Novartis ended the day up 1.8% to 84.77. Novartis cleared an 82.04 cup-with-handle buy point last month. The 5% chase zone runs to 86.14.Johnson & Johnson, meanwhile, cleared a flat-base entry of 129.10 in early June. J&J stock rose 1.8% to finish Tuesday's regular session at 134.46, after the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.83 a share, up 28% vs. a year earlier and beating analyst views by 4 cents. Revenue was $18.84 billion, up slightly from a year earlier but just missing views of $18.9 billion.IBD'S TAKE: Small biotechs performed well over the past few weeks amid a biotech rally that saw the sector hit a 17-month high in June. Head to IBD's Technology page for a look at who looked strong in the pop.Worldwide pharma sales of $8.6 billion declined a fraction vs. the year-ago period, and missed for the third straight quarter, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro told clients in a note. U.S. drug sales dipped 2.6%, but 3.3% growth in sales outside the U.S. helped to partially offset that decline.Meanwhile, consumer and medical devices segments grew 1.7% and 4.9%, respectively. Though pharma sales missed Novarro's estimate by $170 million, revenues from J&J's consumer and medical devices units were in line with expectations.J&J sees full-year earnings of $7.12-$7.22 a share, with revenue of $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion. Analysts see earnings of $7.10 a share with revenue of $75.71 billion. Novarro says the guidance is likely taking advantage of favorable foreign exchange rates in the second half of the year.RELATED:How Novartis' FDA Win In Cancer Also Could Be A Boon For Its RivalsNovartis Grabs Key FDA Panel Approval Of Experimental Cancer DrugNovartis Faces Key FDA Panel On Cancer Drug; Why Kite Could Be The WinnerUnitedHealth Set For Record High After Strong Earnings, Raised Full-Year TargetBank Of America, Goldman Sachs Earnings Top, But Trading Weak

160,JNJ,"Biotechs, led by Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), outperformed their pharmaceutical brethren in the June quarter, an analyst says as earnings season nears a close.XLeerink analyst Geoffrey Porges  estimates that, of the large-cap biotechs, sales topped Wall Street expectations by an average 5% — with the most impressive beats coming from Alexion, Gilead, Vertex and Biogen (BIIB).Alexion's $912 million in sales topped the consensus by 8%. Gilead's hepatitis C unit fell again in the quarter, but total revenue of $7.14 billion topped by 13%. Vertex reported $544.14 million in sales, beating by 12%. Biogen topped by 10% with $3.1 billion in sales.""By comparison pharma company results were more tepid with Eli Lilly (LLY) and Merck (MRK) delivering significant revenue surprises, but otherwise fairly tepid results consisting of modest beat, in-line results and modest misses,"" Porges said in a note to clients last week.Dow-component Merck and Lilly topped the consensus by 4% and 2%, respectively. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Roche (RHHBY) delivered modest beats; Novartis (NVS), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) were in line. Sanofi (SNY), Pfizer (PFE) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) missed.On the earnings side, ""performance was even more robust in biotech,"" Porges said. Large-cap biotechs beat by an average 9.8%, relative to the consensus. Bigger pharmas delivered earnings that topped the consensus by an average 4.8%.Revenue growth vs. the year-earlier quarter was 10.5% for biotechs and 2.4% for drug firms, on average, Porges said. Across the board, companies reported improved patient-access to drugs, as well as positive demand, inventory and currency effects.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech fever looked chilly in late July. Can the sector overcome the challenges outlined in this IBD Industry Themes report?
"
161,JNJ,"In the quarter, rare-disease players on the biotech side did particularly well, Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told Investor's Business Daily. Biogen, Vertex and Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) all positively surprised the market.Spinraza, a treatment for spinal muscular atrophy from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), nearly tripled consensus models. The drug brought in $203 million, obliterating views for $70 million, an analyst said.Sarepta absolutely crushed analyst expectations and rose to an eight-month high in July. Its key drug, Exondys 51, treats Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and brought in $13 million more than analysts had expected. Sarepta also cut loss-expectations by half.""I think that's one category of drugs where investors have been expecting payer pushback,"" Loncar said. ""And so far that hasn't shown up. If there was ever a group of companies that was going to boom more, it's rare-disease companies.""But sentiment has soured since the biotech sector hit an 18-month high in late July. Loncar cited political uncertainty, noting that the lion's share of biotechs and drugmakers with revenue-earning products beat expectations and raised guidance.""The fact they're not trading up (indicates that) investors have already reset their expectations for the year, so maybe it just hasn't been quite as impressive in that context,"" he said. ""We had a big run coming into earnings season, and that played a factor as well.""Uncertainty over tax reform is keeping most major players from looking to make big deals, Porges said. The Trump administration has yet to offer further details on its plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%, which would make corporate inversions less desirable.Though Gilead has been under the gun to buy something in the wake of slowing hepatitis C sales, it didn't comment on M&A on its second-quarter call. Dow's Pfizer says it's putting deals on pause while awaiting more on the tax situation out of Washington.Loncar noted Pfizer's call was the one that really ""crystalized"" this theme for the broader medtech sector. He had previously said a big deal in biotech could really send the stocks higher. But that looks unlikely in the near term.""Mega-deals might be on pause until that happens, or if that happens,"" he said. ""That's pretty disappointing. It shouldn't really affect what we call bolt-on deals. For the mega-deals, that seems to be holding things up.""RELATED:Gilead's Hepatitis C Franchise Topples Again, But Shares Are Up On BeatWill Pfizer's Cancer Drugs Help It Grow Without A Merger?This Biotech Just Blew Past Its Buy Point On A $13 Million Sales BeatAstraZeneca Beat, But Stock Dives On Drug Failure; 4 More ReportVertex Sings Late Despite Crushing Sales, Profit Expectations

162,JNJ,"Talk about hot! Brian Demain is lead manager of $14.2 billion Janus Henderson Enterprise (JANEX), which is an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. So is the fund's twin, $1 billion Aspen Enterprise (JAAGX), of which he also is skipper.XThe portfolios won Best Funds honors by outperforming the S&P 500 in four time periods ended Dec. 31 — the trailing one, three, five and 10 years.And they did so in not just one category but in three — diversified equity mutual funds, growth mutual funds and midcap mutual funds.That put them into a small group of gems. A mere 44 U.S. diversified stock mutual funds, out of 1,104 with assets of at least $100 million, prevailed as winners across those four time spans.Demain and Cody Wheaton run the funds with little turnover, just 20% now, according to Morningstar Inc. Among both portfolios' holdings are Crown Castle (CCI), Microchip Technology (MCHP), Global Payments (GPN), Sensata Technologies (ST) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). All are either forming basing patterns or in buy ranges.Enterprise is open to investors who already own shares. It's also open to old or new shareholders in 401(k) plans that already offer the fund, as well as to old or new investor clients of a wirehouse brokerage that offers the identical strategy through a separately managed account. Twin sister Aspen Enterprise can be bought by old or new investors through some insurance companies.A midcap fund at Janus Henderson that is still open to new investors is $4 billion Mid Cap Value (JMIVX).Demain, who is 40 years old, talked about his investment approach and several key stock holdings in a recent interview with IBD:IBD: Brian, summarize your investment approach.Demain: First, we look for what we call sustainable growth. We want companies that are growth companies today and will be three, five, seven years from now. They may not be the fastest growers, but they can grow for the long term.Second, we're looking for companies with sustainably high returns on invested capital. It's great if a company can grow. But if it's not earning high returns on invested capital, it's not increasing shareholder value. So we try to understand a company's competitive advantage, because that's what will drive its long-term return on invested capital.Third, we care about the quality of a company's management team. We like management teams that focus on the right areas, and that are good leaders.If we find companies that meet those three criteria and we can buy them at attractive valuations and hold them for the long term, we can outperform our peers.IBD: The fund's performance is consistent, as shown by its being an IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winner. Is the key its outperformance during up markets or during down markets?Demain: We've generally been able to keep up in up markets and outperform in down markets. We try to have a predicted beta (a measurement of volatility relative to the market or benchmark) against our Russell MidCap Growth Index benchmark of between 0.85 and 1, so we have less absolute risk than the benchmark. But it's higher than 0.85, because we don't want to only outperform in a down market. That's where we want to shine, but we do OK in up markets as well.IBD: Why do you like midcaps?Demain: They're not as mature as large caps, so they have real growth opportunities ahead of them. But their business models are more established than small caps'.Many have withstood competitive challenges, which small caps may not have. But they tend to be less volatile than small caps.IBD: You've got about 70% of your assets in the technology, industrials and health care sectors. Why do you expect to find so many opportunities in those spaces?Demain: With tech and health care, it is the power of innovation. In tech, we've been overweight in hardware and semiconductors. The mobile internet is driving semiconductor growth. And we're seeing a lot of innovation in software pushing itself into our lives.In health, we own biotechs, pharmaceuticals, life-science tools and diagnostic companies. Aging baby boomers and an emerging middle class globally are driving innovations in drug development and diagnostics.IBD: You've noted that corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation may not occur as fast as many investors have hoped. How have you hedged your bets on those areas?Demain: Take tax cuts. Sensata is a Netherlands domiciled company (which makes sensors for aircraft, cars and other products) but it does business in the U.S. It pays a low tax rate because of where it is domiciled, so it will not benefit from lower U.S. rates.We also own TD Ameritrade (which is a brokerage). It pays a full tax rate, so if there's reform it will benefit. But policy changes can cut both ways. Ameritrade also benefits from rising interest rates. It sweeps clients' cash balances into TD Bank and earns more money on that spread as rates rise. And we own Crown Castle (a REIT that owns wireless cell towers). It has high levels of borrowing, so it will be hurt by high interest rates.IBD: Lam Research (LRCX) must be one of your semiconductor plays. Describe it, please.Demain: They are a semiconductor capital equipment manufacturer. In the last few years, we've gone from everything being etched on one plane of each microchip to effectively stacked layers on chips. So a lot of growth has gone to etching deposition players like Lam.In addition, demand in the memory market is robust. That's driven by uptake in solid-state drives. We're going from the old disk drives to solid-state flash-driven drives. That demands lots of chips, which is good for Lam.And we like their valuation. The stock trades at 13.5 times forward earnings. If you back out their cash, it is close to 12 times. The market's multiple is north of 18 times. And several high quality semiconductor companies are trading at 20 times.IBD: Celgene (CELG) is best known for Revlimid, its blood-cancer treatment. Do you like its other products?Demain: You're right, Revlimid is its workhorse and continues to grow due to longer treatment duration and finding new patients. But what do they do after Revlimid goes off-patent in 2026?The outlook for three other Celgene products — Pomalyst, Otezla and Abraxane — is constructive. And we're excited about its pipeline of new (treatments). Also, they've done business development deals with cash from Revlimid to build emerging franchises in gastroenterology and immunology, and inflammation and immunology. Those things should make the 2026 patent cliff for Revlimid a manageable event.IBD'S TAKE: Celgene is the No. 1 ranked stock in IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group, which is ranked a very strong No. 4 among 197 groups. Celgene earns its top-dog status thanks to such traits as a best-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an annual pretax margin of 50.4, which is the highest it's been in at least nine years. Compare its other technical and fundamental strengths to its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.IBD: Microchip Technology's earnings per share growth has accelerated for six quarters in a row. Does your thesis revolve around the fact that their chips are used in a variety of products?Demain: The majority of their revenue is from microcontrollers, which are very simple computers that can go into all sorts of devices from airplanes to microwave ovens to kids' toys. That has great growth dynamics, which is a function of the growth of the Internet of Things. That's the company's sustainable growth.That business has a very fragmented customer base. You're not just selling a ton of chips to one customer like Apple (AAPL). You're selling to thousands of end markets. That's their competitive advantage.As for a good management team, the company is led by Steve Sanghi. We have high regard for his value creation. The company recently acquired Atmel, which was a large microcontroller competitor. It had good assets, but was poorly managed. Sanghi has improved operating margins and driven strong earnings growth. And valuation is not that demanding at about 15 times forward earnings.IBD: How does SS&C Technologies (SSNC) illustrate your investment approach?Demain: This is another example of sustainable growth plus competitive advantage plus strong management. SS&C provides back-office services for financial companies. As asset management matures, more companies want to focus on their core competencies. Rather than run back offices in-house, they look to outsource. And once they are embedded with a customer, other departments at the customer may outsource to them as well.SS&C is run by Bill Stone, who has a proven record of value creation. And their valuation is reasonable.IBD: Global Payments' earnings per share growth has sped up. Why?Demain: Think of Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) as electronic payment highways. Global Payments is the on- and offramp. They have relationships with merchants who accept credit card terminals. If you run a restaurant, for example, Global gives you software that not only accepts credit cards but also helps you run your restaurant. And Global has benefited from consolidation.IBD: What makes Heico (HEIA), which designs and repairs parts for aircraft and engines, attractive to you?Demain: Only certain approved suppliers can sell parts to airlines. Planes are in service for 25, 30 years, and need servicing. But only a relatively small number of companies have parts-manufacturing approval (PMA) from the Federal Aviation Administration and the European (regulatory) body. The FAA has (limited resources) and can only approve so many parts per year. Heico has the best position in the PMA market. They earn healthy margins.Also, the Mendelson family owns a large percentage of the company. It's most of their liquid net worth, so they care a lot about creating shareholder value, so we like to partner with them.IBD: What's driven the share-price uptrend by contact-lens developer Cooper (COO)?Demain: We like their sustainable growth. Contact lens are a growing category as contacts get more comfortable. They also benefit from international growth.There are only four players: Bausch & Lomb, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Alcon and Cooper. Once a consumer picks one, they usually stick with it and won't change because of a small price difference.IBD: Why is index operator MSCI attractive?Demain: The way to think about them is that they benefit from the growth of ETFs. An active manager like Janus Henderson pays a fixed fee for access to a benchmark operator. For MSCI, when a fee dollar moves from an active to a passive fund, that dollar becomes more profitable.And once you are a standard index, it is hard (for users) to change.IBD: By the way, any plans to reopen Enterprise Fund to all investors?Demain: No, we are managing $18 billion (including money in Aspen Enterprise and in separately managed accounts using Enterprise's strategy). It makes us one of the larger midcap strategies. Our first priority is working on behalf of existing clients. They think being closed is in their best interests and that's why we've done this.RELATED:Winning Mutual Fund Focuses On Leading Stocks Like Autohome, MarketAxess7 Steps For Millennials Who Want To Become Rich Retirees

Its biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 1 were technology, at about 21%, health care at 19% and consumer defensive at 15%. Top holdings included drugmaker AbbVie (ABBV), Kraft Heinz (KHC) and PayPal (PYPL).PayPal has rallied about 50% this year. AbbVie has advanced 13%. Kraft Heinz is slightly negative. The top five holdings accounted for nearly 33% of assets.The fund outperformed the S&P 500 with a 12.8% vs. 11.9% gain through Aug. 1, according to Morningstar Inc. It lagged the benchmark index over the past three years but has outpaced the S&P 500 on a five- and 10-year basis. FPX has a 0.60% expense ratio.IShares Edge MSCI U.S. Quality Factor (QUAL), which gained 2% from a June 1 breakout past a 74.39 buy point to a June 19 peak, is testing support at its 50-day line for the second time since the breakout.A solid rebound off the line could set up a buy opportunity. The $3.5 billion fund, which marked its fourth anniversary last month, trails the S&P 500 this year with a 10.2% gain. Its three-year average annual return of 11.4% is just ahead of the benchmark index's 11.1% advance.QUAL, featured in this column June 1, counted among its top holdings as of Monday: Altria Group (MO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). Apple leapt 5% Tuesday on the heels of its quarterly earnings report. QUAL carries a 0.15% expense ratio.Wednesday's picks remain slightly below their respective buy points: iShares Edge Min Vol USA (USMV) is just shy of a 50.13 flat-base entry; FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF) is less than 1% away from a 41.85 flat-base buy point.Key U.S. index funds were mixed in the stock market today. SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) up 0.1%, while SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) gave up 0.1% and 0.2%, respectively.Health care, utilities and retail ETFs held modest gains. SPDR Health Care (XLV) advanced 0.4%. It's near the top of a buy range from a 76.84 flat-base entry. The fund is drawing close to its 50-day line, where it could set up a buy opportunity on a solid bounce.Oil plays were lower as West Texas intermediate prices dipped 0.7% to $49.26 a barrel. United States Oil Fund (USO) and PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) gained nearly 1% each.VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) was down 1%, while SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) sank nearly 4%, on track for a fifth straight slide.Energy, banks and gold miners also lagged. But SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) were slightly higher.Among foreign ETFs  iShares MSCI South Korea Capped (EWY) gapped down and fell 2%. The Kospi Composite Index tumbled 1.7%. The move sent EWY shares to a test of the 50-day line.

164,JNJ,"Two large-cap funds are among those setting up for potential breakouts as the stock market remains near all-time highs.XFirst up is iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA (USMV), which is just shy of a 50.13 flat-base buy point. It briefly cleared a prior flat-base entry in late April, pulled back below the buy point, and bounced off its 50-day moving average en route to a 4% gain.The $13.5 billion fund tracks the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index, which comprises domestic stocks that tend to be less volatile than the broader U.S. equity market. It carries a 0.15% expense ratio.USMV's biggest sector weighting was health care as of July 31, at just over 19% of assets. Information technology followed at nearly 19%, consumer staples 13% and financials 11%. Health care names accounted for half the top 10: Becton Dickinson (BDX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Stryker (SYK), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).The fund's top 10 names made up less than 15% of total assets. USMV also helps limit volatility by keeping each holding to about 1.5% or less and has a relatively low annual turnover of 28%.Its year-to-date gain of 11.5% through July 31 is in line with the S&P 500, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF outpaced the benchmark index over the past three years at 13.1% vs. 10.9%, and slightly underperformed the past five years at 13.5% vs. 14.8%. It has a dividend yield of 2.05%.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF), which tracks the Northern Trust Quality Dividend Index, is near a 41.85 buy point of a flat base.The fund, which launched in December 2012, targets stocks with a sustainable yield. That leads to profitable companies that should have the ability to keep paying dividends. Top holdings as of July 28 included Procter & Gamble (PG), Boeing (BA), Pfizer (PFE), Apple (AAPL) and Merck (MRK).Its top 10 stocks accounted for about 27% of assets; annual turnover is 85%. QDF has lagged the S&P 500 this year and over the past three years. That's despite an annualized yield of 3%, which is well above the benchmark index's 1.91% average yield. Its expense ratio is 0.37%.Tuesday was a good day for many foreign ETFs, including WisdomTree International Equity Fund (DWM) and iShares MSCI Hong Kong (EWH). DWM is still in buy range from a 53.51 entry and EWH from a 24.32 flat-base buy point.The stock market pared early gains Wednesday, leaving only the Dow Jones industrial average in positive territory.Despite a 5% earnings-fueled jump by Apple (AAPL), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) held only a 0.15% gain. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) slipped 0.2% and PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) edged 0.1% lower.Stocks sold off across the board with telecom, retail and real estate leading the decline. SPDR S&P Telecom (XTL) fell 1.5%, slipping below its 50-day line for the first time in two weeks.But VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) reversed to a 0.1% advance. West Texas intermediate crude prices, down 1% early, reversed 0.6% higher to $49.45 a barrel.Among the few sectors bucking the decline, Industrial Select Sector SPDR (XLI) rose 0.4% and Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) climbed 0.2%.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) was up 0.3% but VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) gave up 0.3%. PowerShares DB Gold Fund (DGL), SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) held small gains.RELATED:Dow Keeps Win Streak Alive; Which Foreign Plays Breaking Out?Dow Hits New High, But Techs Give Up Gains; Apple In FocusDow Marks Record High; Check Out 2 Solid Plays Near Buy PointsFind out what's happening in the stock market today.

166,JNJ,"Eli Lilly (LLY) is gouging share from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) in two classes of diabetes drugs, an analyst said Monday, though he suggested Lilly's second-quarter metrics would just meet consensus views.Prescription trends show Lilly's sales and earnings will be roughly in line with Wall Street views, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a note to clients. The consensus expects Lilly to report $1.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $5.59 billion in sales.But Fernandez upped his price target on Lilly stock to 93 from 90, noting that diabetes drugs Taltz and Trulicity are doing well. Meanwhile, Lilly's Jardiance and Trulicity are displacing drugs from Dow's J&J and Novo Nordisk in the SGLT-2 and GLP-1 classes of diabetes drugs, respectively.U.S. prescriptions of SGLT-2 diabetes drugs grew 17% year over year and 6% sequentially in the second quarter, Fernandez said. At the same time, prescriptions from the GLP-1 class of diabetes drugs grew 24% vs. the year-earlier period and 108% quarter over quarter.IBD'S TAKE: In the biotech space, Exelixis stock has popped 69% this year on its kidney cancer treatment. Head to The New America for a closer look at what catalysts are upcoming for this stock.In the SGLT-2 space, Lilly's Jardiance is taking share from J&J's Invokana. A study by J&J showed Invokana can reduce cardiovascular events in diabetes patients, but it also comes with a greater risk of amputation.The study ""validated the class' (cardiovascular) benefit,"" Fernandez said. But it also ""provided a clear tailwind to Lilly's Jardiance which saw accelerated growth in Q2 of 74% year over year and 19% sequential growth compared with 68% year-over-year and 14% sequential growth in Q1.""He expects Jardiance to overtake Invokana in the SGLT-2 class by 2021. The risk of amputation wasn't seen in a separate Jardiance trial by Lilly.Meanwhile, Trulicity is ""nipping at the heels of Novo Nordisk's Victoza with the latter's market share at 43% vs. Trulicity's 33%,"" Fernandez said. He expects Trulicity to overtake Victoza as the leader of the GLP-1 drug space in the 2018-19 time frame.Fernandez expects Novo Nordisk's overall diabetes business to decline 2% in 2017 and 4%-6% in 2018-20 as competition intensifies in the insulin arena. But he raised his estimates on Novo Nordisk's semaglutide, a competitor in the GLP-1 space.He has a market perform rating on Novo Nordisk stock, and outperform ratings on Lilly and Sanofi (SNY) stocks.Lilly stock ended Monday flat at 82.28. Novo Nordisk stock inched 0.3% higher to 42.12 on the stock market today. Sanofi stock fell 0.5% to 47.66.RELATED:Dow's J&J Hosted A Diabetes Study — And Lilly Will Benefit MostNovo Nordisk Diabetes Lead Unscathed Following AstraZeneca TrialLilly Could Grab Diabetes Share From Dow's J&J On Amputation Woes

167,JNJ,"Arena Pharmaceuticals (ARNA) and Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD) led the biotech pack Tuesday on strong Phase 2 drug data and a favorable regulatory decision, respectively, sending both stocks to nearly two-year highs.Arena popped 41% to 26 on the stock market today. It dipped 1.7% in after-hours trading after it announced a secondary stock offering. Arena stock broke out of a cup base with a 21.70 buy point on Tuesday. Shares touched a high last seen in August 2015.Amicus shares leapt 26% to 12.92. Amicus rocketed to a 21-month high.Meanwhile, IBD's 437-company Biotech industry group rose 0.7% on Tuesday.Other risers included Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA) and Assembly Biosciences (ASMB), up a respective 8.3% and 6.9%.Early Tuesday, Arena said its drug ralinepag improved blood flow in a Phase 2 study of patients with high blood pressure in the lungs, a condition known as pulmonary arterial hypertension. The drug also improved six-minute walking distance.Ralinepag improved median pulmonary vascular resistance — the pressure with which blood flows in the lungs — by a median 29.8% vs. the placebo, Arena said in a release. The drug also helped patients improve from baseline in six-minute walking distance.IBD'S TAKE: In other biotech news, Gilead Sciences (GILD) could change its fortunes with an acquisition, analysts say. A number of cancer-focused biotechs and drugmakers could be on the auction block, but one viral company really stands out, a Needham analyst says. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look at why this firm would be a smart buy.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz noted ralinepag's improvement in pulmonary vascular resistance from baseline was stronger than Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) rival drug Uptravi in a similar study — 20.1% vs. about 14%, respectively. Uptravi was approved in 2015.Dow stock J&J's effort on Uptravi could give some insight into what awaits ralinepag in Phase 3, Needham analyst Alan Carr said in a note to clients. The company's Actelion unit ran a 1,156-patient trial with a number of goals prior to its approval.Also Tuesday, Amicus announced the Food and Drug Administration will not require it to run a Phase 3 trial of its drug, Migalastat, prior to regulatory submission in the U.S. The drug is already approved in Europe and has been submitted in Japan.Migalastat is a treatment for patients with Fabry disease, a genetic disorder that causes a specific form of fat to build up in the cells, causing a wide variety of systemic issues. Now, Amicus plans to file for approval in the U.S. in the fourth quarter.The submission package will include data culled from completed clinical trials. Additional data, regulatory developments outside the U.S. and the new administration's push for quicker approvals for deadly diseases could have prompted the FDA's decision, Carr said.""Irrespective of the underlying developments, investors will welcome the positive developments on Migalastat,"" he said. ""Submission is anticipated in the fourth quarter that could potentially lead to U.S. commercialization in the second half of 2018.""RELATED:Could This Biotech Win In Hemophilia With 'One And Done' Drug?Could Biogen Spinoff Bioverativ Have A Blockbuster On Its Hands?Why Eli Lilly Is Gouging Diabetes Drug Share From Dow's J&J, Others

169,JNJ,"Chinese internet and top-rated medical plays showed strength amid a dull showing by major indexes in late-afternoon trading Monday. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq composite gained more upside in the final half hour of trading, rising 0.5%, and Apple (AAPL) looked poised to post a sixth straight session on the north side of the 50-day moving average.X The action by Apple is critical, not only to the stock but the greater market, given Apple's heft. The iPhone and iPad giant has a market cap of $790 billion. And the recent action represents an opportunity to buy shares near 149 as the stock stages its second follow-on entry point after breaking out of a bottoming-base pattern Jan. 6-9 at 118.12.The first follow-on entry came in late March as Apple surpassed a 3-weeks-tight pattern at 141.12, justifying the addition of a small number of shares to an already profitable core position in the stock.The 118.12 entry comes from adding 10 cents to the handle's high in a cup-with-handle base that formed from Oct. 11 through Jan. 5 of this year. After the Jan. 6-9 breakout, Apple has gained as much as 32.5%, triggering a key IBD rule to sell at least a partial position of shares when the gain hits 20% to 25%.Apple, featured in IBD's Stock Market Today column last week as it retook the 50-day line, gained 1.4% to 152.32, helping the Nasdaq composite edge more than 0.4% higher. The Nasdaq 100 rose 0.3% and tacked on a new all-time high.The S&P 500 is up fractionally and is trying to avoid a third straight decline, giving up a trifling 0.1% over that time frame. The Dow Jones industrials slipped less than 0.2%, hurt by losses of 1 point or more in at least four of the 30 components, including Home Depot (HD) (falling further below the 50-day moving average, a sell signal for recent new holders), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) (down 1.7% to 133.01, but holding above the 50-day line and up 3.5% from a 128.47 cup-with-handle buy point) and Goldman Sachs (GS) (building a new potential saucer pattern, still up significantly from an October breakout past 172.52).The Russell 2000 eked out a small gain, up nearly 0.2%. Volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq and sharply slower on the NYSE vs. the same time in the prior session.Chinese consumer and e-commerce plays continued to surge, even as the Hong Kong and mainland China equity markets were closed for a holiday.Baidu (BIDU)'s breakout past a 193.84 buy point is gaining more momentum as the stock rallied nearly 3% to 198.72. Volume is running more than 40% higher than normal. Read more about the Chinese search engine's chart action and other market leaders in IBD's New Highs feature.The permissible buy zone for Baidu goes up to 203.53, 5% past the 193.84 handle entry.Baozun (BZUN) has emerged as a runaway small-cap winner. On Monday, shares gapped up more than 5%, to 34.10, in fast turnover and are now up more than 92% since clearing a long cup-with-handle base at 17.68 on May 5.Notice on a daily chart how the stock saw volume zoom 143% above its 50-day average on the May 5 breakout day. At the time, volume traded on average 678,000 shares each day.Baozun's expertise lies in helping multinational brands such as Nike (NKE) succeed in their marketing campaigns in China. In 2016, earnings jumped 154% to 33 cents a share on a 23% jump in sales to $504 million.IBD's TAKE: Baozun was featured earlier this year in The New America. The New America index, as seen in the Market Indexes table on page B6 of the latest IBD Weekly print edition, is up 26% since Jan. 1, pummeling the major indexes. See what other companies have qualified for this proprietary IBD screen for hot growth companies.Celgene (CELG), Abiomed (ABMD) and Bioverativ (BIVV) are also acting well. Abiomed, a heart pump innovator, is close to breaking out of a narrow flat-base pattern at 147.55. Eight stocks in the IBD 50 are tied to the medical sector.Abiomed, up nearly 2% to 147, is expected to grow full-year earnings per share by 48% to $1.84 in FY 2018 (ending in March next year) and 41% in FY 2019.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures rose 1.2% to $46.33 a barrel as the U.S. dollar has shown weakness in recent weeks. The dollar is currently worth 111.13 yen but appeared to be testing buying support near 110, a level last seen in mid-June.

170,JNJ,"These are salad days for the biotech sector, as a number of industry leaders are hitting new highs and the group as a whole is near the top of its game in terms of stock performance.XStock inflows hit $1.6 billion over the last four weeks, and there have been a number of clinical trial successes and a new industry-friendly Food and Drug Administration regime is in place.As a result, Investors Business Daily's 439-company Biotech industry group has clawed its way to No. 4 out of 197 groups tracked by IBD from sixth just last week. Shares look likely to close at an 18-month high on the stock market today. And that's before a slew of earnings next week.""Just about everything that could be going right for biotech lately has been going right,"" Brad Loncar, chief executive of Loncar Investments, told IBD on Friday. The onslaught of biotech earnings next week could really give investors some fodder, he said.But there's one thing missing, says Loncar: mergers and acquisitions.""If that last piece fits into the puzzle, then the biotech sector could really be cooking with gas,"" he said.Gilead Sciences (GILD) is the likely linchpin. Loncar calls Gilead the ""poster child"" for a large biotech that needs to do a deal. In 2016, Gilead's multibillion-dollar hepatitis C drug franchise toppled for the first time. Now, Gilead says it's interested in a deal in the cancer space.Though some analysts have keyed in on Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) as a smart acquisition, Loncar sees Gilead as more likely to buy an early cancer asset — something it can develop and commercialize, rather than putting its money to work on buying a developed revenue stream.Vertex is already a hugely successful biotech in its own right, he said. Earlier this year, Vertex delivered the best news this year in the space, he pointed out. It had ""exceptional results"" in Phase 1 and 2 trials looking at a triple-pill to treat cystic fibrosis. The stock gapped up nearly 21% on Wednesday.IBD'S TAKE: Rare disease and cancer plays have been front and center in the biotech sector as of late. Could these cutting-edge firms keep the rally going? Head to the Industry Snapshot for a deeper dive.""That's a multibillion-dollar stock,"" Loncar said. ""When a company like Vertex goes up 20%, that's something everybody in the stock market notices.""Gilead is set to report its second-quarter earnings Wednesday. But it will be sandwiched among a slew of strong contenders in the biotech space including Celgene (CELG), Amgen (AMGN), Biogen (BIIB) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN).No. 1 biotech Celgene is slated to report its second-quarter earnings before the open Thursday. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 99, leading its 438 peers and is sitting at a high last seen in July 2015.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says Celgene and Alexion will be bellwethers for the group this time, in the same way Dow's Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is often seen as a proxy for the pharmaceutical group. He calls for Celgene to beat and raise, and for Alexion to rise by topping low views.Alexion is slated for Thursday. On Tuesday, Amgen could overtake a four-month high and jump to a record high if its second-quarter earnings report proves strong. Shares broke out of a cup-with-handle on July 13 at a 175.55 buy point and still remain in a buy zone.This trio could help catapult the sector, analysts say. Meanwhile, on the pharma side, investors will key in to AstraZeneca (AZN) early Thursday. In recent weeks rumors have emerged that Chief Executive Pascal Soriot could jump ship for Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA).Loncar notes that the timing of those rumors were bad for AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca is set ""any day now"" to report the results of an immuno-oncology combination trial in lung cancer. Lung cancer treatment is a huge commercial opportunity and AstraZeneca is taking on players like Merck (MRK) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY).""Regardless of these rumors and controversy, I do think it's not an overstatement to say Pascal Soriot's job is on the line with (the trial) because this is make or break for AstraZeneca,"" he said. ""This study is the most important thing for AstraZeneca in the last 10 years.""Though biotech stocks are up 22.5% for the year, there's still room to run, CFRA Research analyst Jeffrey Loo told Investor's Business Daily. Valuations hit historic lows in 2016 amid the presidential election, and are still below both the S&P 500 and the overall health care sector.""Relative to historical valuations, the biotech sector is still attractively priced,"" he said.In late June, the sector got a massive push after President Donald Trump released a draft proposal on drug pricing. The initiative didn't include much to really tug down on drug prices, Loo said. He didn't credit the entire gain to the proposal, but it certainly helped, Loo said.Clinical trials, near-term FDA approvals and strong launch trends have also helped prod the sector this year including the cystic fibrosis news from Vertex, a gene therapy from Novartis (NVS) and a Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug from Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT).On the latter development, Loncar says Sarepta's $13 million second-quarter sales beat for Exondys 51 could bode well for the broader sector. Sarepta also raised guidance for the year which most analysts have called conservative.""Everybody was watching that for a sign as to how drug launches are going and how payors are pushing back on things,"" he said. ""The fact the launch (of Exondys 51) is going well is a good sign not just for Sarepta, but for all biotech companies.""RELATED:Biotechs Find Strength In Numbers In Treating Multiple SclerosisToo Late To Catch Biotech Rally As Trump Fears Subside?Biotech Rally Gets Second Wind As This Small Cap Nears Break OutWhy The Biotech Rally Could Still Tack On Another 15% Upside

171,JNJ,"The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 index hit new highs as techs continued to reassert market leadership. Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT) all hit record highs. Netflix soared on subscriber gains while Amazon will sell Kenmore appliances from Sears (SHLD), sending the latter sharply higher but hitting several retailers, including the Dow's Home Depot (HD). The Dow Jones industrial average also was hit by General Electric and banks, though blue-chip Visa (V) and American Express (AXP) continued the good news for payment stocks.XThe Nasdaq composite rose 1.2%, hitting record highs during the week, rising 10 straight sessions through Thursday. Netflix and other FANG stocks, such as Facebook and Amazon, contributed. The S&P 500 index climbed 0.5%, also hitting fresh highs during the week. Dow industrials fell 0.3%, weighed down by Goldman Sachs (GS), General Electric (GE) and Home Depot.Internet television network Netflix added 5.2 million net new subscribers in the June quarter vs. Wall Street's consensus estimate of 3.22 million. It also guided higher for the current quarter, with a forecast of 4.4 million net new subscribers, topping the consensus view for 3.97 million. Bulls pointed to its strong subscriber growth, while bears voiced caution about its ballooning video-content obligations, including original TV series like ""Stranger Things"" and ""Glow."" Netflix ended Q2 with 103.95 million subscribers worldwide, including 51.92 million in the U.S. and 52.03 million in foreign markets. Netflix's international streaming subscribers topped those in the U.S. for the first time in Q2.Netflix skyrocketed 17% to record highs for the week.Sears will sell Alexa-enabled Kenmore appliances via Amazon, sending its shares soaring on Thursday but the gave up most of that gains on Friday. But Whirlpool (WHR) and major sellers of appliances Home Depot, Lowe's (LOW) and Best Buy (BBY) were hit. Home improvement chains Home Depot and Lowe's had been seen as Amazon-proof, or at least Amazon-resistant. Best Buy, which has bounced back in recent years from Amazon's initial onslaught, was hurt earlier this month on news that Amazon is creating a Geek Squad rival.Amazon appears to be getting more government attention as its size and scope grow, with an FTC probe and antitrust rumblings.Software giant Microsoft earned 98 cents excluding items for the June fiscal fourth quarter, up 42% year over year and well above views for 71 cents. Revenue rose 9% to $24.7 billion after forecasts for $24.27 billion. Microsoft credited demand for cloud-computing services like Azure and Office 365 as well as its acquisition of LinkedIn. But the Dow component gave cautious guidance for the current quarter.

Fellow industrial conglomerate Honeywell International (HON) also beat on top and bottom lines, but guided full-year estimates slightly higher. Honeywell shares rose Friday, retaking a buy point.RELATED:General Electric Stock Dives On Earnings OutlookAmerican Express beat on the top and bottom lines, though provisions for losses jumped 26% due to loan-portfolio growth and a rise in the rate for lending write-offs. Visa earnings also topped, with strong cross-border travel – helped by the stronger dollar – and global payment volumes driving results, according to Mizuho analyst Thomas McCrohan. The company also hiked its full-year revenue growth outlook above views. Visa and American Express, both Dow components, rose 2.8% and 0.4%, respectively, with both still in buy range.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) stock broke out from a long consolidation on July 18 as the online broker beat on both the top and bottom lines, even as industry trading fees for stocks and ETFs have plunged this year. Charles Schwab (SCHW) that day matched views, with shares falling below a 42.71 buy point that they had cleared in late June. E-Trade (ETFC) shares gapped up to make a new 52-week high on Friday after the company scored an overall beat Thursday. Shares are now out of buy range.Chip-gear maker ASML (ASML) and wireless-communications chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) were the first major semiconductor industry players to report June-quarter earnings this year. ASML rose to record highs after posting better-than-expected sales and earnings during the second quarter. Qualcomm disappointed with its current-quarter profit outlook that came up short of views, even though it beat estimates for its fiscal Q3. Apple (AAPL) chip-supplier Skyworks (SWKS) reported better-than-expected fiscal Q3 sales and earnings and guided higher for the current period.Drug giants Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported better-than-expected earnings Tuesday. Dow component J&J reported adjusted income of $1.83 a share, topping views by 4 cents. But sales of $18.84 billion were light. Novartis' $1.22 a share, excluding various items on $12.24 billion in sales, topped analyst views.Both drug stocks rose during the week, but were both still in buy range as of Friday's close.Goldman Sachs' fixed-income trade revenue plunged 40% in Q2, the second straight quarter that the trading-heavy bank said it misread the market. Weaker trading and net-interest income also hurt Bank of America (BAC), though Fed rate hikes have helped the bank and it said it expected net-interest income to rise in Q3. Morgan Stanley (MS) reported that trading revenue fell, but less so than rivals. JPMorgan (JPM) and Citigroup (C) have also signaled caution amid slow loan growth and longer-term bond yields, which can indicate flagging confidence over the chances for long-term economic gains. Morgan Stanley cleared a buy point while Goldman undercut its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Check Point Software (CHKP) reported better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, but gave weak guidance for the current Q3. Check Point tumbled 7.2% that day, falling below its 50-day moving average. Check Point on Wednesday briefly topped a buy point but closed below that trigger. So did four other cybersecurity stocks that day. Those stocks, along with Proofpoint (PFPT), retreated modestly on Check Point's warning.United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday offered a disappointing third-quarter unit-revenue forecast as airline competition picks up heading further into the summer, sending its shares plunging 10.4%. Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL), which have remained bullish on the key metric, fell significantly as well. United said it could take at least several months out for plans — like expanded service to different parts of the U.S. and the rollout of cheaper ""basic economy"" fares — to pay off.The No. 1 U.S. health insurer's earnings per share rose 25.5%, topping forecasts. Revenue grew 8% to $50.05 billion, roughly in line, though it was the smallest gain in nine quarters.  UnitedHealth (UNH) has exited the ObamaCare exchanges, though it's a big player in Medicare and Medicaid coverage. The Optum services unit saw a 9.9% revenue rise. UnitedHealth now sees adjusted full-year profit of $9.75-$9.90 a share. Analysts had expected $9.81 before Q2's results.UnitedHealth rose 2.6%, with Republicans' health care struggles also influencing shares of insurers and hospitals.RELATED: UnitedHealth Raises Full-Year Target After Q2 Earnings Jump 25.5%Top U.S. rail companies topped quarterly forecasts, but CSX (CSX) said crude oil train shipments have fallen to zero and hinted that returns to shareholders may be more cautious. Union Pacific (UNP) predicted nearly flat volumes in Q3 as coal shipments stabilize, but it still sees second-half volumes improving over the first half. Kansas City Southern (KSU) benefited from auto production and energy market reforms in Mexico. CSX fell 6.2% for the week while Union Pacific lost 4.3%. Kansas City Southern edged up 0.4%.Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) stock rocketed 21% to an all-time high Wednesday on strong Phase 1 and 2 data in the trial of a cystic fibrosis treatment. The triple-drug combo aims to treat the genetic disease's underlying cause.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) easily topped analysts' second-quarter views Thursday with adjusted income of $5.95 per share on $756 million in sales. Shares of the maker of robot-surgical systems fell 3% Friday afternoon.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) shares tumbled 12.8% to a four-year low on reports that the fast-casual chain temporarily closed a restaurant in Virginia following reports that diners there had gotten sick. The once-trendy fast-casual burrito eatery has been trying to mend its reputation and sales after a food-borne illness scare that began in 2015.Harley-Davidson (HOG) cut its motorcycle shipment outlook to 241,000 to 246,000 units to dealers this year, a 6% to 8% drop, down from prior guidance for a flat to modest decline. The iconic motorcycle brand reported a 4.5% EPS decline but that was better than estimates for $1.37. Sales slid 5% to $1.77 billion. Retail sales of new motorcycles tumbled 9.3% amid ""weak industry conditions."" Shares fell 6.5%.

172,JNJ,"The Nasdaq rebounded off early-session lows to edge slightly higher in late-afternoon trading Thursday, paced by gains in software, medical device and biotech stocks. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued its fresh basing process, setting up a potential new breakout.X At 150.89, Apple shares were off fractionally and essentially keeping almost all of their 5.8% gain during a nine-day winning streak. The stock is also just 3% below an all-time high of 156.65. The correction within the current consolidation resembles either a shallow cup base or a flat base.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were virtually flat, despite a 4% sell-off in Dow Jones 30 component Home Depot (HD) as four other of the 30 components rose 1 point or more, including Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth (UNH) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Home Depot sank below its 50-day moving average, near 154, in heavy trading on June 23, triggering an important sell signal for recent buyers.Small caps had a slight edge over large-cap equities, with the Russell 2000 gaining more than 0.2% following a 1% rebound on Wednesday to all-time highs.Among IBD's 197 industry groups, hospital, diversified medical, biotech and computer hardware all rallied 1.3% or more. Shares of auto parts chains, department stores, clothing makers and diversified utilities also led the upside.Another piece of positive technical news on the market: On both the Nasdaq and the NYSE, winning issues led losing issues by a margin of 200 to 250 stocks. As noted in the latest Big Picture column, new highs continue top 200 on a combined basis in both main exchanges, symbolizing heavy institutional demand for equities. This statistic also points to the potential for more breakouts.Back to Apple, the iPhone and iPad maker is not giving up much ground, likely due to belief among institutional investors that the company will continue to deliver a sound turnaround on the top and bottom lines. This improvement, combined with the stock's tight action following an impressive run from a Jan. 6-9 breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point, are two reasons why further gains by Apple may help drive U.S. equities higher.The Street sees earnings in the just-ended fiscal third quarter rising 11% to $1.57 a share, then repeating that 11% gain in Q4 to $1.85 a share. Earnings had grown 2% and 11% in the prior two quarters, ending a three-quarter profit slump.Sales estimates are following a similar path, with Q3 revenue seen rising 6% to $44.92 billion and Q4 revenue up 7% to $49.94 billion.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Apple scores an 80 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. That's not great, but decent enough for a stock that is staging a turnaround. In the same Telecom-Consumer Products industry group, Apple is one of just three companies that show a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher, meaning they have done better than 80% of all companies in IBD's database in terms of 12-month price performance. However, the other two stocks, Voxx International (VOXX) and China Techfaith Wireless (CNTF), trade under 10 a share.On Jan. 6, Apple started its move past a 118.12 buy point in an excellent 12-week cup-with-handle base. That base was part of an initial-stage bottoming base pattern, a bullish development. From the base's high of 118.69 to the low of 104.08, Apple corrected merely 12.3%. The best cup bases tend to show mild declines in the range of 12% to upwards of 33%-35%.Notice, too, how the stock found buying support at the 200-day moving average as it built the bottom of its base. In an IBD chart or MarketSmith chart, the 200-day moving average is drawn in black and tracks the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 days. It signifies the long-term price tend of a stock.When a stock breaks out, ideally it should be trading above both the 50- and 200-day moving averages.One concern on Apple is the Accumulation/Distribution Rating, which is currently negative at D on a scale of A to E. It's preferable to see this proprietary rating at C+ or higher when a stock breaks out.While Apple has yet to break out of its current new base, watch to see if this rating improves. Big price gains in heavy volume over the past 13 weeks tend to trigger a higher Accumulation/Distribution Rating, as well as down days in heavy volume that grow more than 13 weeks old.Recent clues of accumulation by mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, insurers, banks and the like came on June 19 (the stock gained 2.9% in volume bulging 16% above average) and June 23 (up 0.5%, volume 25% above its 50-day average).RELATED:Which Way Will Equities Go From Here?

173,JNJ,"Celgene (CELG) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) stocks sustained downgrades Friday as rivals like Kite Pharma (KITE) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) look likely to chip away at their lead in immuno-oncology drugs.The duo is about a year ahead with a drug called bb2121, part of a class of treatments that aim to ""reprogram"" the immune system to fight cancer using what are known as CAR-T therapies. Their drug does this by targeting an antigen called BCMA.But the landscape of anti-BCMA CAR-T drugs is about to evolve, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote in a note to clients. Leone downgraded Celgene and Bluebird stocks to neutral from buy.""We think Bluebird has a good lead over the competition and is smart to quick-start a second-generation effort with bb2121, which will begin a Phase 1 study during the second half of 2017,"" he said. ""That said, competitive efforts will be ramping up.""Kite is beginning an anti-BCMA CAR-T therapy in humans in the third quarter. Juno began work in February on a bone marrow cancer drug. Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and GenMab started an anti-BCMA effort in May, and updates are expected soon from Novartis (NVS).RELATED: Which companies are outperforming 95% of stocks? It's all relative. Visit IBD Data Stories for the formula to correctly identify stock leaders.In Bluebird's case, Leone is more optimistic than most about a drug called LentiGlobin to treat two blood disorders. He expects the drug to generate a combined $870 million in both disorders by 2021.Still, ""the oncology shift may be divisive (among) investors, as the competitiveness within cell-based therapies for oncology is much more intense than areas within rare diseases,"" he said. ""But the early success with bb2121 is supportive of a broader effort in larger markets with better defined patient populations.""For Celgene, Leone cut his expectations for Crohn's disease drug mongersen to $80 million for 2020 vs. earlier views for $468 million and the consensus model for $432 million.He also expects Celgene's multiple-sclerosis drug known as ozanimod to penetrate less of the market. He cut his views for 2020 to $1 billion vs. earlier expectations for $1.4 billion, though that still tops broader Wall Street's model for $965 million.""We think that it may take longer than we expected for ozanimod to differentiate vs. the rest of the S1P class within multiple sclerosis, specifically siponimod,"" he said. The latter is a drug from Novartis.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Celgene lost dipped 1.4% to 129.87, as Bluebird fell 3% to 105.05.RELATED:The Cure For Cancer?

175,JNJ,"Today we'll feature another two large-cap ETFs that set up a new buy opportunity Wednesday on a rebound off the 50-day moving average.First Trust Large Cap Core AlphaDEX (FEX), which tracks the Nasdaq AlphaDEX Large Cap Core Index, has attracted $1.6 billion. The 10-year-old fund's biggest sector weightings are consumer cyclical and financial services at about 17% each, technology 15%, health care 13% and industrials 11%.XTop holdings skew toward tech with three chip stocks making the top five as of July 12: Nvidia (NVDA), Applied Materials (AMAT) and Lam Research (LRCX). All three have been big performers with year-to-date gains of 40% or higher. By comparison, the S&P 500 was up 9% and the Nasdaq composite 17% through Thursday's close.FEX has slightly outpaced the S&P 500 as of July 12, according to Morningstar Inc., with a 10.7% gain vs. a 10.3% advance for the benchmark index, including dividends reinvested. Its three-year average annual return of 8.1% trails the S&P 500's 9.8%, and the ETF's five-year and 10-year returns are in line with the S&P 500's.The fund first began rebounding off its 50-day average last week and is 2% above the support line, well within a potential buy zone. It has a 0.61% expense ratio.Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) closed 1% above its 50-day line on Thursday. The fund, which will mark its second anniversary in September, has gathered nearly $2.3 billion in assets.GSLC aims to invest in stocks that meet four performance metrics: good value, strong momentum, high quality and low volatility. It counts among its top holdings Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Technology accounted for its biggest sector weighting, at 21% of assets. Health care was next at 15%, followed by roughly 13% each in financial services and consumer cyclical, and 12% in consumer defensive.The ETF made a solid bounce off the 50-day line on Wednesday and is 1% above the support line. GSLC has returned 10.3% this year, in line with the S&P 500. It carries an expense ratio of 0.09%.Of Wednesday's picks, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) is still seeking support at its 50-day line, while Schwab U.S. Large-Cap (SCHX) remains in buy range from a rebound off its 50-day.RELATED:2 Big-Cap Plays Set Up Buy Opportunity As Market RalliesChance To Own These 4 Top Tech Stocks And Much, Much More?

176,JNJ,"Many U.S. diversified ETFs rose Wednesday as stocks rallied on Fed Chair Janet Yellen's dovish comments before Congress.Here are two large-cap plays that staged a rebound off their 50-day moving average lines, setting up a buy opportunity.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), which launched in May 2011, has attracted $6.7 billion in assets. After ranking the S&P 500 companies each quarter by their volatility, the fund invests in the 100 least volatile stocks.SPLV has slightly underperformed the  S&P 500 this year through July 11 with an 8.2% return vs. the benchmark index's 9.5% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. Its three-year average annual return of 10.4% outpaces the S&P 500's 9.5%, while its five-year return of 12.8% lags the S&P 500's 15%.The ETF bounced back above its 50-day line Wednesday, setting the stage for potential investors. The ideal buy point is as close to the support line as possible. Shares rose nearly 5% in one month from the last pullback to the 50-day line in May.The ETF's four biggest sector weightings as of July 11 were industrials with 20%, financial services with 18%, utilities with 16%, and consumer defensive with 14%. Top names included 3M (MMM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Waste Management (WM).SPLV carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Schwab U.S. Large-Cap (SCHX) also rebounded off its 50-day line. The $9.2 billion fund, which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Total Stock Market Index, turns eight in November.Technology accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of July 10, at nearly 20%, with Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB) among its top holdings. Financial services followed at 16%, health care at 14%, consumer cyclical at 11.5%, and industrials at 11%.SCHX's performance has been pretty closely aligned with the S&P 500. Its YTD gain vs. the benchmark index is 9.6% to 9.5%, over three years is 9.3% to 9.5%, and over five years is 14.9% to 15%. The ETF's expense ratio is 0.03%.Wednesday's picks, which also featured two large-cap ETFs, scored gap-up gains. Vanguard Large-Cap (VV) and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) each rose nearly 1%. Both remain in buy range from the 50-day line.Going back to the June 17 picks, KraneShares CSI China Internet (KWEB) rose more than 7% in two weeks after rebounding off its 10-week line. It made one more pullback to the line after that and is up 3% from the later bounce. KraneShares on July 10 announced that China International Capital Corp. agreed to take a 50.1% stake in Krane Funds Advisors.RELATED:Chance To Own These 4 Top Tech Stocks And Much, Much More?Here Are 4 Big Caps That Raise Their Dividend Every Year, And Are Beating The S&P 500

177,JNJ,"Who doesn't appreciate a company that not only pays a dividend but has a history of consistently raising the payout each year?Those are the types of stocks in which Tuesday's ETF picks aim to invest.XVanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), which tracks the Nasdaq Dividend Achievers Select Index, counts among its holdings highly profitable companies that have increased their dividend for at least 10 years in a row.Top holdings as of May 31 included Microsoft (MSFT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and 3M (MMM), according to Morningstar Inc. Microsoft didn't start paying dividends until 2010, but has boosted its payout each year since. The other three companies are all members of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividend payout for at least 25 straight years.While dividend stocks are often thought of as slow gainers, these four have all outpaced the S&P 500's 8% year-to-date return. Microsoft is up 13% through July 10, PepsiCo 9% and J&J 14%. 3M has rallied 18%.VIG is testing its 50-day moving average line and could set up a buy opportunity on a solid rebound. It offers an annualized yield of nearly 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average 1.9% payout. The $24.5 billion fund has a 10-year average annual return of 7.3%, in line with the S&P 500's 7%. Its expense ratio is 0.08%.ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) is showing similar action to VIG as it, too, seeks support at its 50-day line. As the name implies, the fund tracks the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.Johnson & Johnson and 3M are among its top 10 names. Other big YTD winners in the top 10 include McDonald's (MCD), up 28%, and Abbott Laboratories (ABT), up 26%. NOBL carries a 0.35% expense ratio and pays a 1.9% yield.The $3 billion fund, launched in October 2013, has returned nearly 8% for the year through July 7, according to Morningstar. That lags the S&P 500's 9.5% gain. NOBL has a three-year average annual return of 9.75% vs. the S&P 500's 7.3%.Going back to the June 30 picks, both SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) and iShares Russell 1000 (IWF) are still trading near their respective 50-day lines. A solid bounce could still put them in play.RELATED:2 Income Plays Near Buy Points Own This Big Dividend StockMarket Sell-Off Tough, But Could Offer Opportunities Like These

178,JNJ,"XTenet Healthcare (THC) and other hospitals led a broad advance in health care stocks on Thursday as Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of TrumpCare.The short takeaway, courtesy of Mizuho analyst Sheryl Skolnick, is that the Senate bill is ""Lots Less Worse Short-Term; Lots More Worse Long-Term,"" in comparison to the House version. In particular, Medicaid spending would suffer a smaller hit in the near term, but face even bigger long-term cuts.Among hospital groups, HCA Healthcare (HCA) rose 2.5%, Tenet Healthcare jumped 6.8% and Universal Health Services (UHS) gained 1.8%.The stock performance may have even taken management by surprise. Politico published a letter Tenet sent to employees asking them to rally opposition to TrumpCare.Investors have good reason to focus more on the intermediate term, because it's always possible that the big out-year cuts could be interrupted or delayed — if Democrats make a comeback, for example. On the other hand, the sharp eventual spending cuts relative to ObamaCare could threaten the support of moderate GOP senators. NBC News was reporting that three GOP senators planned to voice their opposition to the new legislation, enough to deny passage.Managed care companies also were solidly higher on Thursday. Centene (CNC) and Molina (MOH), both big players in the ObamaCare exchanges and its Medicaid expansion, were among the better performers. Centene climbed 3.6% and Molina 2.3%. Anthem (ANTM), the biggest ObamaCare exchange insurer, rose 0.65%. Anthem said on Wednesday that it's pulling out of the ObamaCare marketplaces in Indiana and Wisconsin.Centene is among the rare companies making a profit from the exchanges, but Medicaid is a big profit driver for the industry, including UnitedHealth Group (UNH), a Dow Jones industrial average component. All insurers would stand to benefit from the GOP plan to kill a tax on health insurance plans.UnitedHealth rose 0.7% to a record high, while Aetna (AET) gained 0.55% and Humana (HUM) advanced 0.3%.Skolnick's message to investors: ""Buy UNH and HCA.""Prospects of more modest health spending cuts than feared — assuming TrumpCare even passes — also lifted shares of drugmakers and biotechs. Among Dow components, Merck (MRK) rose 0.9%, Pfizer (PFE) 0.5% and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) 0.85%, with J&J notching a record high.Johnson & Johnson would also stand to benefit from the repeal of ObamaCare's tax on medical devices. Merck, which has been rallying on good news for immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, crossed an aggressive entry and neared a conventional buy point.

179,JNJ,"XMajor stock indexes showed modest gains in afternoon trading Thursday as Wall Street digested strong earnings from Oracle (ORCL). Health care stocks outperformed after the GOP released a new version of the ObamaCare repeal bill.In the stock market today, Oracle (ORCL) gapped up over a 47.09 flat-base entry, rising around 9%. Strong earnings were the catalyst. It's OK to buy a stock when it gaps up over a buy point, but it's important to buy as close to the open price as possible. Oracle opened at 51.61. Shares were recently trading around 50.57.The Nasdaq composite led the way, up 0.4%; the S&P 500 rallied 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average picked up 0.1%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.5%. Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly lower than Wednesday's levels.Health care-related industry groups outperformed while a few retail groups lagged. Outperformers in the Dow included UnitedHealth (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK).Meanwhile, China stocks were pressured after Chinese regulators asked Weibo (WB) to stop audio and video streaming services. Shares of Weibo lost 6% but were off session lows. The Chinese government has been stepping up its efforts to stop political speech on social media sites. Sina (SINA) and Alibaba (BABA) both have ownership stakes in Weibo. Shares of Sina were well off session lows but still fell 4%. Alibaba eased 0.5%.American Airlines (AAL) picked up 1%, but was well off session highs, on news Qatar Airlines is considering a 10% stake in the company. American is still in buy range from a 47.88 handle entry.Tesla (TSLA) gained 2% to an all-time high after the company reportedly reached an agreement with the city of Shanghai to explore building production facilities there.RELATED:Why Weibo, 3 IBD 50 Chinese Internet Stocks Are Selling OffUnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term CutsTesla Gets Closer To Big Manufacturing Expansion In China

180,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) diabetes drug, Invokana, cut down on cardiovascular events during a long-term study — but Eli Lilly (LLY) stands to benefit most as doctors steer clear of the medication on worries it increased the risk of amputation.The study, dubbed Canvas, was presented late Monday. In it, Dow stock Johnson & Johnson said Invokana reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, nonfatal heart attack and nonfatal stroke by 14% vs. a non-drug placebo.Additional analysis showed that Invokana lowered the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by 33%. Invokana also delayed the progression of albuminuria — the presence of a specific chemical in the urine indicating kidney disease.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro says the Canvas study is unlikely to reverse the negative trajectory of Invokana sales. In the first quarter, Invokana and Invokamet sales dropped 17% year over year. For 2017, Novarro forecasts a 6% dip in sales to $1.2 billion.Eli Lilly, on the other hand, will benefit from Johnson & Johnson's study as Merck (MRK) trails, analysts say. Lilly's Jardiance is a SGLT2 inhibitor, which works by helping the kidneys to lower blood glucose levels. Merck's Januvia is a DPP-4, which blocks glucagon release, triggering insulin secretion.""Validated cardiovascular benefits should boost the SGLT2 class,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote. In a similar study, Lilly's Jardiance also showed a 14% benefit on cardiovascular outcomes. Jardiance also cut the risk of cardiovascular death and all mortality.Even without the Canvas study, Lilly was poised to grab a chunk of Invokana's sales after the Food and Drug Administration required Johnson & Johnson to warn physicians of the potential for amputation associated with Invokana. Invokana doubled the risk of amputation in a recent study.Experts cited by Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez say the amputation worry could be the ""biggest differentiating factor"" in physicians' decision to prescribe Jardiance over Invokana, as both show a similar cardiovascular benefit in diabetes patients.At the close on the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock ticked up 0.2% to finish the regular trading session at 132.02. Lilly stock added 0.4% to 81.25 and shares of diabetes drugmaker Merck dipped 1% to end the day at 63.27.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 77, meaning it outperforms more than three-quarters of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. For more of IBD's ratings visit IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, the DPP-4 class of diabetes drugs, which includes Merck's Januvia, could face incremental pressure, Credit Suisse's Divan said.""Over time, however, we expect the enthusiastic response to the Canvas efficacy data driving use of the SGLT2 class earlier in the course of treatment, while concurrently pushing the DPP-4s further back,"" he said in a note to clients.Merck and Pfizer (PFE), a Dow stock, are jointly working on an SGLT2 inhibitor called ertugliflozin. Regulators could approve the drug in December, but it won't have data on cardiovascular outcomes for several years. Pfizer will take a chunk of those sales, meaning a shift from Januvia to ertugliflozin will be a net negative for Merck.RELATED:Lilly Could Grab Diabetes Share From Dow's J&J On Amputation WoesAbbVie Expects Rivals To Chip Away At Its Biggest Drug FranchiseDow's Pfizer Faces Challenges As Roche, J&J, Lilly Loom

181,JNJ,"A slew of biotechs and drugmakers might take a closer look at Epizyme (EPZM) after the small-cap biotech presented strong data in a lymphoma trial Wednesday in Switzerland, an analyst said Thursday.The findings at the International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma could attract the likes of Gilead Sciences (GILD), AbbVie (ABBV), Celgene (CELG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) or Roche (RHHBY), Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients.Epizyme is testing its drug, dubbed tazemetostat, in two forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Interim data show tazemetostat had a clinically meaningful benefit in all patients with what's called follicular lymphoma, a buildup on cells in the lymph nodes.Tumors shrunk in 92% of follicular lymphoma patients and in 29% of patients with an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and a specific genetic mutation. Tazemetostat proved safe across all patient populations.Leerink's Porges called the study a ""proof of principle."" He expects the drug to win accelerated approval at the Food and Drug Administration in follicular lymphoma. Accelerated approvals allow a drug to be marketed while still in clinical trials.""Few cancer drugs have a 90% response rate, or a 100% clinical benefit rate, in any disease,"" he said. ""And while investors might debate about how big that group of patients really is, and how long treatment duration will be, we would not be surprised to see Epizyme start to show up on potential takeout candidate lists.""Epizyme could be appealing to AbbVie, Celgene, J&J and Roche, Porges wrote.

182,JNJ,"X A strong start for the Nasdaq composite faded early Tuesday as the two-day Fed meeting got underway, but the index regrouped and was back near highs in afternoon trading.Western Digital (WDC), Tesla (TSLA) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) were among the best percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100, with gains of around 3%.The Nasdaq added 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 picked up 0.4% each. Volume on both exchanges was tracking significantly lower than Monday's levels.Western Digital gapped up after Aegis Capital initiated coverage with a buy rating and set a 130 price target. Shares jumped nearly 4% to 89.80 as the stock shows solid action around the 10-week moving average, a key support level. Separately, Japanese media outlets reported that Western Digital will raise its bid for Toshiba's chip unit to $18.2 billion from $14.5 billion. Broadcom (AVGO) is another interested bidder.Citigroup (C) added 1% even after CFO John Gerspach warned of a second-quarter slump in trading revenue. Other money centers like JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) also issued similar warnings.In the stock market today, a couple of high-profile health care names made headlines. Dow component Merck (MRK) gapped down and lost 1% on news the company is stopping the enrollment of new patients in two late-stage studies testing its immunotherapy drug, Keytruda, for multiple myeloma, in combination with other therapies.The news was better at Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) after the company presented strong data for its diabetes treatment Invokana. Shares were mostly unchanged on the news, but the stock has been performing well of late. It's still in buy range from 128.47 early flat-base entry.Sierra Wireless (SWIR) rebounded with a vengeance after two straight declines. Shares jumped 8% to 30.95. The small cap is a major player in the nascent Internet of Things market, where everyday devices are connected to the Internet.

183,JNJ,"Roche (RHHBY) could displace Dow's Pfizer (PFE) in one segment of the lung cancer market, an analyst said Wednesday after the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting highlighted ""additional challenges"" for Pfizer.But on the stock market today, Pfizer fell 0.2% to 32 and Roche 0.4% to 32.09. Late Tuesday, Roche presented data from a head-to-head trial of its drug Alecensa vs. Pfizer's Xalkori.Xalkori was approved in 2011 to treat patients with advanced lung cancer and a specific genetic defect. Alecensa was approved in 2015 for lung cancer patients who progressed on or are intolerant to Xalkori. Both belong to a class of drugs called ALK inhibitors.After 18 months of follow-up, patients treated with Alecensa survived a median 25.7 months without their disease progressing vs. 10.4 months for patients treated with Xalkori.The presenter called Roche's results ""remarkable"" and ""outstanding,"" and ""declared that Alecensa is now the optimal ALK inhibitor for the first-line setting,"" Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said in a note to clients. First-line treatments are the first defense against a disease.""One of the lung cancer doctors we had breakfast with yesterday also acknowledged that Xalkori is a relatively weak ALK inhibitor and she was likely to change her practice patterns based on (the trial),"" he wrote.Divan noted Pfizer is working on a next-generation ALK inhibitor that could help soften the blow of lost Xalkori sales. Also in lung cancer, Pfizer is developing a second-generation drug that targets a specific receptor, known as an EGFR inhibitor.IBD'S TAKE: Biogen (BIIB) spinoff Bioverativ (BIVV) could be nearing a stock breakout after announcing its plan to beef up its pipeline with the acquisition of True North Therapeutics. Head to IBD Stock Analysis for a closer look at Bioverativ's setup.But Pfizer is still struggling vs. newer therapies, particularly those that are considered immuno-oncology drugs. This class aims to block certain interactions involving proteins and enzymes in the immune system that would prevent an immune response.Pfizer's drug, Bavencio, is approved to treat a rare and aggressive skin cancer. Bavencio has shown strong results in liver cancer when combined with Inlyta, Pfizer's liver cancer drug. That should help slow the decline of revenue from Inlyta, Divan said.And though the class of breast cancer drugs known as CDK4/6 inhibitors is about to get more crowded, Pfizer's Ibrance will continue to dominate, Divan said. Though he acknowledged Novartis' (NVS) Kisqali and Eli Lilly's (LLY) abemaciclib have shown strong trial results.In prostate cancer, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga will put some pressure on Xtandi, a similar drug Pfizer acquired when it bought Medivation.RELATED:Will Regeneron's Cholesterol-Buster Get Booted In Amgen Battle?Tesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' DataHow Clovis, AstraZeneca Could 'Muddy' A Potential Deal For Tesaro

That suggested that institutional investors did not sell in massive quantities. Also, the negative reversals were not severe in scale.Senate Republicans unveiled their own version of legislation to replace ObamaCare, and investors seemed to like what it could mean for the health care sector. Medical software, drug wholesalers, managed care and several other medical-sector industry groups were among the day's best performing, rising 0.7% to 2.2%.HealthSouth (HLS) broke out of a base-on-base pattern, closing above the 47.99 buy point. Volume was below average, which dampened an otherwise bullish move. Shares rose 3%.Hologic (HOLX) broke out of a flat base, rising past a 46.15 buy point. But it also suffered from weak volume. The relative strength line is at a new high, which backs the breakout. Two days ago, the company said it won FDA approval for its Aptima herpes treatment.Bankrate (RATE) had better volume as it broke out of a pattern with a buy point at 12.05. Volume was about 70% above average as the stock added 1.7%.On the downside, Taylor Morrison Home (TMHC) gapped down to a loss of 3%.

It also said in the filing that average sales per community for the two months ended May 31 was 2.9 homes per month vs.  2.2 in the same period in 2016, up 31.8%. Net sales orders for the same two months rose 24.3% and it expects home closings for the quarter ending June 30 to be about 1,800.RELATED:UnitedHealth, HCA, Merck Rally As Senate TrumpCare Bill Pares Near-Term Cuts2 Key Stock Index Plays In Buy Range As Biotechs Surge Again

Sanofi stock edged up 0.3% to 44.63.RBC analyst Randal Stanicky sees Flexion as 40% likely to be taken out, he wrote in a research report. Sanofi makes sense given it sells Synvisc, an injection that supplements the fluid in a patient's knee to relieve osteoarthritis.Flexion is now working through the FDA approval process for Zilretta, a joint injection with an extended release formulation steroid for knee pain. Stanicky sees Zilretta as well positioned to take meaningful share from the existing steroid and hyaluronic acid markets.""Pre (FDA)-approval timing would allow Flexion to avoid sales force ramp (about 100 reps) and for Sanofi to allow it to participation in launch activities which, per Flexion, is expected to be $500,"" he wrote. The market is about 5.2 million people in the U.S. and worth $3 billion in size at branding marketing.Cantor analyst Chiara Russo sees Flexion as capable of launching Zilretta without help and says the rumored ""mid-30s"" per share takeover price — according to an unidentified source commenting to FiercePharma — is too low.""With significant changes in the competitive landscape over the past year giving Zilretta the sole new voice in the space, we see a mid-30s price as being a little low for a strategic buyer,"" Russo wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Flexion has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 58, meaning it underperforms more than four in 10 of all stocks. A better biotech bet would be Celgene with a best-possible CR of 99. Visit the Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest leaders.Russo maintained a 34 price target and maintain rating on Flexion stock. She expects Zilretta to take significant market share.RBC's Stanicky sees a $37-$38 per share takeover price as reasonable but notes ""we see support for a deal north of $35 and perhaps closer to $50."" Though, he added, specialty valuations have come down recently and the deal is pre-Zilretta approval.He has an outperform rating and 44 price target on Flexion stock.The rumored bid comes just three months after Sanofi lost out on a contentious battle for Swiss biotech Actelion. Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) scooped that deal. Before that, another member of the Dow Jones industrial average, Pfizer (PFE), beat out Sanofi to acquire Medivation.Sanofi has also been rumored to have considered deals with BioMarin Pharmaceutical (BMRN) and The Medicines Company (MDCO) in the aftermath of a judge's ban on its cholesterol drug, Praluent, with Regeneron (REGN). The ban has been stayed pending an appeal in the case against Amgen (AMGN).Both Flexion and Sanofi declined to comment to IBD.RELATED:Did Sanofi Just Bag This Biotech For $1 Billion?Johnson & Johnson In Exclusive Talks To Acquire Actelion After Sanofi FrayCould Sanofi Acquire BioMarin In Wake Of Amgen LDL Brouhaha?

193,JNJ,"Fat freezing, ear-pinning, breast-augmenting Allergan (AGN) isn't making expansion in the medical-aesthetics market easy for rivals like Hologic (HOLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), analysts say. Since 2006, Allergan has sunk north of $8 billion into M&A in the aesthetics space, adding skin creams, double-chin treatments and, most recently, a fat-freezing business.

194,JNJ,"Sales of Pacira Pharmaceuticals' (PCRX) non-opioid painkiller Exparel toppled 2% in February and will have to reaccelerate in March to meet one analyst's sub-Wall Street views for 2017.""Thus far, prescription data does not suggest management at Pacira has found a way to return Exparel to higher rates of growth,"" Janney analyst Ken Trbovich said in a note. He has a sell rating and a 38 price target on Pacira stock.According to health tracker Symphony Health, Exparel prescriptions fell 2% month over month in February after growing 5% in January. The unit volume for the first quarter is 3% below estimates.Exparel sales ""languished"" in the second half of 2016, after three quarters of low-to-mid-revenue growth between the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016, he wrote. In 2016, Exparel brought in $265.8 million in sales, up 11%.New data on surgery protocols for total knee replacement, and the potential to implement that data at a large hospital, could help Exparel in the long run. Exparel is often prescribed after a patient has undergone knee replacement.""But it will take time for these to show up in Exparel's performance,"" Trbovich said. He expects Pacira to pull in $309.6 million in total 2017 sales, lagging the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $309.9 million.Exparel accounted for 96% of Pacira's 2016 sales. For 2017, the company sees Exparel bringing in $290 million to $310 million. Pacira is planning to use its DepoFoam, a method of drug delivery, in a number of other drugs.IBD'S TAKE: Pacira has an IBD Composite Rating of 57, meaning it outperforms just about half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. But it's still far from top leaders like Celgene, which has a Composite Rating of 99 out of a best-possible 99. Visit the Stock Checkup for a look at how stocks in your portfolio are doing.Those DepoFoam-delivered drugs may ""contribute to growth, but are years away from the market,"" Trbovich said. Meanwhile, ""Exparel growth is plateauing even before entry of competition that may come next year.""Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler, on the other hand, is more bullish on Pacira stock and kept her buy rating Thursday, though she cut her price target to 54 from 59 due to dilution associated with a recent convertible-debt offering.Still, Koffler sees a number of potential 2017 catalysts that could boost a takeout thesis.In January, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) company DePuy Synthes signed a deal with Pacira to promote Exparel in orthopedics. Experts say Pacira hasn't generated any compelling data on Exparel, but DePuy's pressure on hospital payers could drive use.On the stock market today, Pacira stock toppled 2.5% to 46.95. But shares have traded well above their 50-day moving average since early January.RELATED:Pacira A Likely Takeout Candidate Despite Anesthesia Sales Dip: Mizuho

196,JNJ,"French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) is reportedly considering a bid for Tesaro (TSRO), but could face some competition from Gilead Sciences (GILD), whose frustrated hepatitis C franchise has left the massive biotech thirsty for an acquisition.At the close on the stock market today, Tesaro was up 2.8% to 142.67. Gilead stock popped 1.1% to close at 65.43. Sanofi stock, though, was down 1.3% to close at 47.57.According to insiders cited by StreetInsider, Sanofi is looking to put in a bid on Tesaro, which reportedly began seeking takeover bids last month following the approval and launch of its ovarian cancer drug, Zejula.Gilead is also likely in the running to buy Tesaro, according to reports. Gilead's two biggest drugs to treat hepatitis C, Sovaldi and Harvoni, saw sales dive in 2016 on high cure rates. Now, Gilead has said it's interested in making a deal, particularly one in oncology.But it won't be cheap. Insiders say it'll cost $10 billion (or $185 per share) to acquire the $7.6-billion-market-cap Tesaro. The winner will also get its hands on ovarian cancer drug Zejula, which launched earlier this year with a $118,000 per-year price tag.At that cost, Zejula is less expensive than AstraZeneca's (AZN) Lynparza and Clovis Oncology's (CLVS) Rubraca. And of the three, Zejula's label is broadest, allowing treatment of ovarian cancer patients regardless of specific genetics.IBD'S TAKE: Tesaro stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 52, meaning it outperforms just above half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. Visit IBD Stock Checkup for a look at better-rated stocks in the biotech sector.Analysts have speculated that the competitive landscape in what's known as PARP inhibitors — which includes Zejula, Lynparza, Rubraca and a non-approved drug from Pfizer (PFE) — could change as more data from rivals become available this year.Sanofi has struggled to make deals in recent history. Last year, it lost out to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a battle for Actelion Pharmaceuticals, and to Pfizer which got its hands on a PARP inhibitor by acquiring Medivation.Gilead, too, is in a position to hunt for deals. Its hepatitis C drugs fell in 2016, and the company said on its most recent earnings call that it will rely on deals for growth, with a special interest in oncology assets. Incyte (INCY) has also been on the radar as a rumored target.Representatives for Tesaro and Sanofi declined to comment to Investor's Business Daily. A representative of Gilead didn't immediately return a request for comment.RELATED:Did AstraZeneca Rival Just Launch A Potential Blockbuster Drug?Why Clovis' Advantage Might Squash Tesaro In Ovarian CancerTesaro Crashes Despite Beating AstraZeneca With 'Stronger' Data

197,JNJ,"AbbVie (ABBV) expects its biggest drug, Humira, to hit peak international sales in 2018 and then face erosion as cheaper biosimilars enter the market, an analyst said Tuesday.But UBS analyst Marc Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, which closed up 0.6% at 65.84 on the stock market today, back above its 50-day line.Humira is facing biosimilar competition outside the U.S. where price declines are about 2% per year, Goodman wrote in a note to clients. Outside the U.S. remains a volume-driven business whereas in the U.S. AbbVie has more pricing leeway.As competition erodes Humira sales outside the U.S., AbbVie plans to curtail sales and marketing spending in specific countries ""commensurate with sales erosion,"" Goodman said following a meeting with AbbVie executives during the UBS Global Healthcare Conference.After hitting peak outside-U.S. sales in 2018, AbbVie expects 15% sales erosion each year through 2020.IBD'S TAKE: First-quarter earnings just wrapped for a number of drugmakers, including AbbVie. Visit IBD's Technology page for a closer look at who outperformed and who fell behind.Meanwhile, it will push its mid- to late-stage pipeline including elagolix, which is being developed with Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX) to treat endometriosis and uterine fibroids. AbbVie is on track to file an application with the Food and Drug Administration for elagolix in endometriosis in the third quarter.AbbVie is also looking at its drug Venclexta in combinations with FDA-approved Rituxan and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pharmacyclics' (PCYC) Imbruvica in leukemia and lymphoma. Longer term, it has growth opportunities in other forms of lymphoma and leukemia, Goodman wrote in a note to clients. RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi Undercut Amgen, AbbVie In Rheumatoid ArthritisAbbVie Loses Key Humira Patent In Battle With Small-Cap Biotech

198,JNJ,"Sometimes a small prod is all it takes to make a hot investment idea go cold in no time — as small as a quarter-point bump in a benchmark rate in the case of low volatility and dividend stock ETFs.As the era of zero ends and interest rates rise, investors in exchange traded funds have turned away from certain high dividend and low volatility strategies this year. Instead, they favored more cyclical exposures that benefit from a tick up in rates — banks and transporters, for example.""Yet, thanks to product innovation, there are now strong smart-beta strategies that combine defensive and cyclical components,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, wrote in a March note. Smart beta ETFs seek to achieve better returns or lower risk vs. cap-weighted counterparts.As examples of ""next-generation products"" for a rising rate environment, Rosenbluth offered these two names:As relatively new products without a three-year history, both ETFs should be traded with care. However, Rosenbluth considers them worthy choices for large-cap stock exposure in light of the March rate hike and the Fed's signals of more gradual rate hikes this year.XRLV is the younger sibling of PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), an ETF that aims to give investors a smoother ride in the stock market. SPLV invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and surged in popularity during 2016's choppy markets. So did iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV).But this year through March 21, SPLV and USMV saw net outflow of $1.238 billion combined, according to FactSet data — a big chunk of their total assets, which now stand at roughly $19 billion.Hefty stakes in defensive, high-yielding sectors could be hurting them.Those equity sectors, such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities, are seen as ""bond proxies"" because of their higher yields. They have historically lagged the S&P 500 when bond yields are rising.As the Federal Reserve seems inclined to keep raising rates this year, more pain may lie in store for SPLV and USMV, in Rosenbluth's view.XRLV has little to fear in this context. It boots out the 100 most rate-sensitive stocks from the S&P 500 and so has virtually no exposure to utilities and real estate. Gas and electric companies such as Dominion Resources (D) and Southern Co. (SO), which belong in the older sibling's portfolio, are missing here.Instead, it skews heavily toward financials, technology and industrials, such as JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT). Those economically sensitive sectors tend to perform well amid rising interest rates.Basically, XRLV is defensive — but not too much.""It's a middle ground for investors who are expecting more choppiness in the marketplace but also wish to participate in an improving economy,"" said Rosenbluth.XRLV has gained 10.3% since the Nov. 8 election, roughly in line with the S&P 500 and outpacing the 9.2% advance of the low volatility heavyweights, SPLV and USMV.While the Fidelity dividend ETF also holds stocks that perform well when rates are rising, it avoids big sector bets.It is up 4.8% year to date and has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.05%.RELATED:The Best Lage-Cap Growth ETF For 10 Years, But Is It Best For You?

199,JNJ,"President Trump railed against ""outrageous"" drug prices Monday, sending biotech and pharma stocks reeling midday Tuesday, but it appears the GOP bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare doesn't touch pharmaceuticals.Although the newest iteration of the American Health Care Act doesn't mention how Trump plans to curb spiraling drug prices, his speech Monday sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group into a tailspin, dropping 3.4% to a two-month low.Among generic drugmakers, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (RDY) stock sank 6.4% on the stock market today, and Eagle Pharmaceuticals (EGRX) tumbled 7.1%, while Aclaris Therapeutics (ACRS) dipped 0.55% and Ani Pharmaceuticals (ANIP) lost 0.5%.IBD's 421-company Biomed/Biotech industry group crashed a collective 4.4% with La Jolla Pharmaceutical (LJPC), Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) and Kite Pharma (KITE) stocks down particularly hard, respectively losing 12.6%, 9.3% and 9.8%.Among specialty drugmakers, Endo Pharmaceuticals (ENDP) fell 1.5%, Mallinckrodt (MNK) dropped 5.1% and Depomed (DEPO) toppled 4.1%.Trump's unspecified plan calls for ""bringing down the cost of medicine by having a fair and competitive bidding process,"" the president said late Monday during a rally in Kentucky.""Medicine prices will be coming way down — way, way, way down — and that's going to happen fast,"" he said. ""We're just adding that to the bill. I said, 'We've got to add that to the bill.' ""He called the cost of medicine in the country ""outrageous,"" saying it's ""many times higher than in some countries in Europe and elsewhere.""IBD'S TAKE: Drug approvals slumped in 2016, but at least three companies added two new drugs to their wheelhouses.

He later commented that if drug prices aren't included in first version of the American Health Care Act, legislation addressing the drug issue will follow closely after.Trump has had a love-hate relationship with drugmakers. Early in his presidency, he called for drugmakers to lower their pricing. Later, in a meeting with CEOs from Celgene (CELG), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Novartis (NVS) and others, he pledged to cut FDA regulations to speed the drug approval process.Last week, Trump unveiled his ""Blueprint"" for 2018, which proposes increasing user fees collected by the FDA from drugmakers to more than $2 billion.

200,JNJ,"Stocks expanded their midday gains Wednesday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, hiked short-term interest rates by a quarter-point but hinted that it would continue to act prudently before engaging in further increases in the cost of money.Meanwhile, oil stocks got a much needed lift after getting slammed in recent days as crude oil futures rallied. West Texas Intermediate futures rose more than 2%, to $48.79 a barrel. Meanwhile, the metals, medical, heavy industrial and transport sectors also showed resilience.For instance, airline industry leader Southwest Air (LUV) is halting a seven-session losing streak and reversed off its lows, with a 2% gain, to 53.90, in fast turnover. Watch to see if the consumer- and business-spending play can climb back above its 50-day moving average. Shares are still up 8% year to date, better than the S&P 500's roughly 6% advance. Randgold Resources (GOLD) surged 3.3%, to 86.97, and is trying to retake its 50-day line. AngloGold Ashanti (AU) jumped 7.1%, to 10.54, but remains far depressed from its 52-week highs.Meanwhile, in the steel sector, Leaderboard name and industry top dog Nucor (NUE) rallied more than 3%, to 62.72, in low volume; watch to see if it can keep climbing and pierce through the top of its three-week handle with a 65.50 buy point.Nucor is seen growing Q1 profit by 230%, to 76 cents a share. Earnings have rebounded 28%, 43%, 144% and 63% vs. year-ago levels in the prior four quarters. A fifth sector, banking, is also regaining some lost ground; Bank of New York Mellon (BK) rose 0.6%, to 48.56, and is close to surpassing a 48.88 buy point within a nine-week cup-with-handle pattern.Small-cap issues are leading the stock market today with the Russell 2000 up 1.2%, vs. a 0.6% lift by the Nasdaq composite and 0.7% for the S&P 500.The Dow Jones industrials lagged, up 0.4%, but at least five of the 30 components rose at least 1 point or more, including Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and United Technologies (UTX).  J&J has cleared a 122.60 early buy point within its long saucer construction. The left-side high of 126.07 also offers an entry point at 10 cents above that price.J&J has now risen slightly more than 5% past the early buy point. Be sure not to chase breakout stocks more than 5% past the proper entry. The reason: often a stock will pull back and try to shake out weak holders as it test support at or near the proper entry. IBD founder Bill O'Neil's study of the greatest market winners found that rarely does a leading stock market winner fall more than 7%-8% below the proper buy point in a cup, double bottom, flat base or other bullish pattern before a stock charges to new highs.Notice how, on the weekly chart, in six straight prior up weeks, J&J rose in above-average turnover in five of those weeks. That bodes well for the diversified medical products giant as it indicates surging demand for shares by mutual funds, hedge funds, insurers, banks and the like. J&J's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is now a sprightly A-; the proprietary grade goes from E (heavy distribution) to A+ (heavy accumulation).J&J's 66 RS Rating on a scale of 1 to 99 relects the big cap's long basing action and is sharply improved from as low as 26 just eight weeks ago. Among small and mid-cap names, focus on those with RS ratings of 80 or higher before they break out.Even with the move by the Fed to increase the fed funds rate to a 0.75%-1% target range, observers applauded the U.S. central bank's decision to maintain a careful and gradual approach to ""normalizing"" the bond markets.""The weaker dollar itself is a reflection of the Fed's policy path,"" Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, told IBD. ""Markets see the Fed keeping a lid on the dollar and providing a bid for U.S. exporters, commodities and emerging markets.""The U.S. dollar fell against both the euro and the Japanese yen.In the meantime, keep an eye out for the reaction by European equity markets on Wednesday's Dutch elections, which are being perceived as a test of Europeans' tolerance of immigrants, particularly from the Middle East. The Dutch elections could also have ramifications for the future of the eurozone.

201,JNJ,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) stock plummeted to a nearly four-year low Tuesday after announcing that four executives are leaving only two months after Chief Executive Ludwig Hantson joined Alexion from Baxalta.At the close on the stock market today, Alexion stock was down 9.3% at 104.64 after earlier falling as much as 11.2% to a low last seen in October 2013.Of the four positions being vacated, only one has been filled. Brian Goff will succeed Chief Commercial Officer Carsten Thiel, who is leaving to pursue new opportunities on June 1. Goff's background includes time at Baxalta, Neurovance, Baxter International (BAX), Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson will resign at the end of August. Martin Mackay, executive vice president and head of research and development, will retire at the end of 2017. Clare Carmichael, executive vice president and chief human resources officer, will leave June 1 to seek new opportunities.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges notes that the leadership changes will completely wipe out the management team that built Alexion's Soliris franchise and presided over the ""value-destroying"" acquisition of Synageva in 2015. Soliris is an immunosuppressant approved for two rare disorders.IBD'S TAKE: Alexion stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 72, meaning it has outperformed 72% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. The biotech group is led by Corcept Therapeutics which has a CR of 97 out of a best-possible 99. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for the top-five-rated biotechs.""These changes are not a complete surprise, given the signals that have been coming from the new CEO, but will alarm many investors given the concern that there may be other 'shoes to drop' in terms of disclosure of additional underlying issues with the core business and operations,"" he said.In the past, Hantson has commented that he doesn't have much ""excitement"" for anything in Alexion's pipeline beyond ALXN-1210, a treatment for patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, an immune disorder that results in the destruction of a patient's red blood cells.Still, the departure of Anderson is surprising given that his position was permanent and he was expected to remain in place for at least one to two years amid the transition. Many of his goals of strengthening the financial reporting system and improving operating margins are still underway, Porges said.""Many of these initiatives will continue to be implemented, although the company's commitment to margin improvement goals would seem to now be in question,"" he wrote in a note to clients.Importantly, Alexion didn't see any turnover at the midlevel management or within the sales force, Porges noted. Hantson believes ""the morale and commitment to patient dedication are still there,"" he wrote. All are committed to absorbing the widespread change, the company says.Porges maintained his outperform rating on Alexion stock.RELATED:Amgen, Gilead, Biogen Won't Lead The Biotech Boom — So Who Will?Alexion Beats On First-Quarter Sales; Profits Top By 15 Cents

202,JNJ,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi's (SNY) rheumatoid arthritis drug is 15% to 30% cheaper than rival drugs from Amgen (AMGN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Roche (RHHBY), an analyst said Tuesday after the duo's Kevzara grabbed Food and Drug Administration approval.Kevzara's approval comes seven months after the FDA delayed its approval on issues with manufacturing at a French factory where the drug is filled. The approval is for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who don't respond to other anti-rheumatic drugs.""The approval came on time and with a label that more or less matches our expectations,"" Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note to clients. Kevzara can be prescribed alone or in combination with FDA-approved methotrexate. It is a self-administered injection.Like Roche's Actemra, which belongs to the same class of drugs, Kevzara is associated with an increased risk of serious and minor infections, liver issues and injection-site reactions. But it's also at a 15% discount to Actemra at $39,000 annually.""With discounts, (it) should offer a cost-effective treatment option for payers in this setting,"" Porges said. Kevzara costs 30% less than Amgen's Enbrel and AbbVie's Humira, which are widely prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis, though belong to a different drug class.IBD'S TAKE: Regeneron could be among those leading a biotech resurgence this year, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Amgen, Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) aren't expected to be at the forefront of the revitalization.Regeneron and Sanofi expect European approval to come later this year and see Kevzara hitting the market in the U.S. within a few weeks. But Porges sees the drug as a minimal driver and forecasts $37 million in sales this year, growing to $456 million in 2021.A number of drug classes address rheumatoid arthritis, he noted. The field is likely to become more crowded later this year when Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) adds its drug sirukimab to the lineup and as more in a class dubbed JAK inhibitors arrive in 2018-19.""Kevzara contributes approximately 11% of our expected sales of joint Sanofi-Regeneron products in 2018, but this falls to 5% long term as expected growth of (eczema drug) Dupixent and even (cholesterol-lowering drug) Praluent rapidly eclipse Kevzara's importance,"" Porges said.The consensus forecasts Kevzara sales at $56 million this year, growing to $705 million by 2020 and hitting $1.1 billion by 2025.On the stock market today, Regeneron stock rose 0.1% to 461.37, as Sanofi stock fell 0.2% to 49.07. Shares of rivals Amgen and AbbVie were up 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively, while Roche dipped 0.4%.RELATED:Will 'Comeback Kid' Regeneron Survive Amgen's Cholesterol Squeeze?Regeneron Pops On 'Better-Than-Feared' Eye, Cholesterol Drug Sales

204,JNJ,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie (ABBV) will benefit from Merck's (MRK) decision to take a $2.9 billion impairment charge on a hepatitis C drug as the market and prices shrink, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said Friday.Merck also cut its value estimate for uprifosbuvir, a hepatitis C drug acquired from Idenix Pharmaceuticals in 2014, to $240 million, based on its upcoming three-drug regimen and a change in its view on the whole hepatitis C market.Regulators say Merck must complete separate trials showing an added benefit with its triplet over its high-dose doublet regimen, Porges said. That complicates matters. The high-dose doublet is in phase 2 testing, behind the triplet.""This write-down also suggests that the remaining value of the 'rest of Idenix' is now very small,"" Porges wrote in a research report. Merck is also seemingly indicating ""significantly reduced value for its future participation in the market, which is consistent with a declining market overall.""IBD'S TAKE: Analysts projected the downfall in hepatitis C drug sales. What were the warning signs and are other markets at risk? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes.Gilead, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) compete in the hepatitis C market. Merck's charge signals the drugmaker expects to have lighter sales and a smaller share than initially forecast.Drugmakers are struggling with 2014-15 growing pains following a boom and subsequent bust in hepatitis C drug sales. Gilead is the poster child for the phenomenon. Sales of Sovaldi and Harvoni toppled in 2016. Now, Gilead is betting on its HIV drug, bictegravir.Merck, too, noted the changing patient population dynamics.""The company determined that recent changes to the product profile, as well as changes to its expectations for pricing and the market opportunity, taken together constituted a triggering event that required the company to evaluate the uprifosbuvir intangible asset for impairment,"" Merck wrote in its 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission late Thursday.In morning trading on the stock market today, Merck stock was up a fraction to 66.16 at the closing bell. Shares of AbbVie inched up to 62.09 while Gilead gained 0.8% to 69.94.RELATED:AbbVie Stronger Bet Than Gilead, Amgen — At Least Until 2020: LeerinkGilead, Glaxo Pitted In HIV Battle; Both Struggle Vs.

205,JNJ,"To satisfy the Trump administration's calls to deal with high U.S. drug costs, one industry leader is proposing that the president lead negotiations with drugmakers to restrain prices.Allergan (AGN) Chief Executive Brent Saunders cited tactics used by President John F. Kennedy decades ago to keep down steel prices. The administration also could waive federal antitrust rules that currently prohibit drugmakers from discussing pricing so they could put together guidelines to follow, he said.Voluntary agreements that restrain prices are ""a very practical solution that doesn't, in my view, do anything to impede innovation,"" Saunders said Wednesday in an interview at Bloomberg's headquarters in New York. Convincing fellow drugmakers to agree with him, however, could be a challenge.""It would be difficult,"" Saunders said.Big Pharma is under intense pressure to come up with ways to reduce prices after President Trump accused the companies of ""getting away with murder"" and threatened to use the government's buying power to force prices down.Saunders has been outspoken against excessive price hikes in his own industry. At Allergan, an $80 billion company whose products range from wrinkle treatment Botox to stomach and schizophrenia medicines, the CEO has implemented a ""social contract"" that caps increases at 10% annually.Trump ""could model something like that with the pharmaceutical industry — maybe that could look like something like our social contract,"" Saunders said. ""It's easy for me to suggest when we're already doing it, just to be transparent,"" he added. Asked about a targeted amount under restraint agreements, he said low single digits, or about the rate of inflation.Pharmaceutical giants including Novartis (NVS), Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical and AbbVie (ABBV) also have taken voluntary actions to cap price increases. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK) have taken steps to increase transparency about their prices.""The industry has moved quite a bit in three months, four months,"" Saunders said. ""But it would need another big push.""Under Saunders, Allergan has transformed itself into a specialty pharmaceutical behemoth after a series of acquisitions and the sale of its generics business. After an attempt to merge with Pfizer (PFE) Inc. in a $160 billion megadeal that was abandoned last year, Allergan has focused on smaller purchases.Allergan's shares are down compared with the rest of the industry. Over the last 12 months, they've lost 14%, compared with a 7.6% gain in the 25-company Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences Index, which includes Allergan.Rather than another transformational deal, Saunders is more interested in building up Allergan's main therapeutic areas, including medical aesthetics and dermatology, eye care, central nervous system and gastroenterology. In the past two months, he's made two acquisitions worth a combined $5 billion to add to Allergan's aesthetic-medicine and cosmetic-surgery lines.Hair restoration and skin quality are the next frontiers, he said. The company is currently doing research in both of those areas.""Those are huge unmet needs,"" he said.When asked about Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (VRX) whose assets include the Bausch & Lomb eye-care company that he once led, Saunders says he's not interested — not even ""in pieces.""Valeant didn't respond to a request seeking comment.

206,JNJ,"More high-growth companies issued sell signals on their daily and weekly charts Thursday as the Nasdaq composite lagged the NYSE indexes. The Russell 2000 lost 0.7%, cutting its year-to-date advance to 2.8%.Nvidia (NVDA), which initially showed signs of overheating back in the final week of December as it staged a climax run, dropped 9% and fell sharply below its key 50-day moving average for the first time since its huge run began with a cup-with-handle breakout at 33.16 in mid-March of 2016.A few analyst downgrades sparked the increased selling pressure.The chip designer and leader in graphic processors still hasn't fallen that much from its all-time peak of 119.93.At a little more than 16% below that former peak, the stock could end up forming a new base, but it would also be good to see Nvidia undercut its recent low of 99.11. Why? That would serve to reset the base count.According to IBD's proprietary Stock Checkup tool, Nvidia's RS Rating remains a nearly perfect 98 on a scale of 1 to 99, but don't use the RS rating as a selling gauge. This rating keys off action over the past 12 months; when you decide whether to hold a good stock or sell it, first assess the most immediate price-and-volume interaction on both the daily and weekly charts. Fellow tech InterDigital (IDCC), meanwhile, got trampled by sellers as the wireless technology expert gapped down and lost 13%. By day's end, the stock's volume exceeded 2.3 million shares, easily the highest so far this year.InterDigital also sliced through the 50-day moving average, triggering a major sell signal to take profits and cut losses. The weakness came after the company reported its second straight quarter of triple digit earnings and sales growth. Yet, the Street still sees a massive drop in earnings for 2017, down 62% to $3.30 a share.The Nasdaq composite, burdened by heavy selling in Chinese internet and semiconductor names pared a 1% intraday loss to 0.4%. As noted in today's Big Picture column, volume edged higher on the Nasdaq, translating into another mild day of distribution, or intense professional selling, on the tech-dominated market benchmark.The S&P 500 inched slightly higher and the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.2%.Some defensive sectors, including utilities, fared better; the Dow Jones utility average rose 1% for the day. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, gas distribution, water supply and electric power utilities helped pace the upside.Dow 30 components Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth (UNH) outperformed with gains of more than 1%, reflecting renewed demand within the medical sector.J&J has been forming a saucer-like base for nearly eight months with an early buy point of 122.60, 10 cents above the 122.50 spike in the middle of the base. The saucer is more clearly visible on a weekly chart.In the case of UnitedHealth, a very shallow flat base has emerged, furnishing a 164.10 entry point, a dime above the base's left-side peak of 164.Yet while more medical service and device companies have cropped up on IBD's screened new high list in recent weeks (see the latest list via the IBD Data Tables page on the ""Stock Lists"" section at the home page of Investors.com), biotechs are still lagging in general.Fast food chain Jack In The Box (JACK), meanwhile, kept slumping. The former market leader crumbled nearly 7% and slid below its 200-day moving average in fast trade, another key sell signal. Q4 earnings grew 27% on an adjusted basis but still missed the consensus forecast. On Wednesday, the burger and taco chain flashed an earlier sell signal by falling further below its 50-day line in heavy turnover.Q4 sales rose just 4% after a flat performance in the year-ago quarter.RELATED:When Did Nvidia Show Signs A Correction Is Imminent?Stock Market Today: Can Nvidia's Fundamentals Turn It Into The Next Apple?Where To Follow IBD's Tech CoverageHow To Sell Stocks: Why A Drop Below The 50-Day Line Matters

207,JNJ,"Two exchange traded funds that offer market-beating dividends are in new high ground and hovering near their buy points.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) climbed past a 90.02 flat-base buy point intraday Friday, before settling just below the entry. On Monday, it closed fractionally lower. The current three-month pattern began forming two weeks after a February breakout from a flat base. It advanced 2% between the two bases.X The $15.6 billion fund tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which comprises companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years.SDY is underperforming the broader market this year with a 5.5% return through June 2 vs. the S&P 500's 9.9% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF's five-year average annual return is 15.8%, closer to the S&P 500's 16.3%. But over a 10-year period, SDY has returned an average of 7.6%, just ahead of the S&P 500's 7%.The ETF's annualized dividend yield is 2.5%, ahead of the benchmark index's 1.9% payout. Top holdings in the fund include AT&T (T), Target (TGT) and AbbVie (ABBV). The three companies offer annualized dividend yields of 5%, 4.3% and 3.8% respectively. Also making SDY's top 10 is a longtime Warren Buffett favorite, Coca-Cola (KO), which is paying out an annualized 3.2% of its Friday stock price.WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN), which tracks the index of the same name, also owns Coca-Cola. It holds several other Buffett stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The underlying index is made up of large-cap stocks that are weighted by the value of the dividend the company is projected to pay the next year.The fund, launched in June 2006, has attracted $1.95 billion in assets. It's slightly underperformed the S&P 500 index with YTD, five-year and 10-year average annual returns of 6.9%, 14.5% and 6.15%, respectively. DLN's annualized yield is 2.4%.Shares cleared an 84.59 flat-base entry on Friday and closed Monday a penny below the buy point. The ETF gained 4% from its prior flat-base breakout in February to the start of the current pattern in March.Checking in on Monday's ETF picks, the four India-focused funds closed largely unchanged to remain in buy range from recent rebounds off their respective 50-day lines. They are: iShares MSCI India (INDA), PowerShares India Portfolio (PIN), VanEck Vectors India Small-Cap (SCIF) and WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI).RELATED:These 4 Plays Offer Chances To Ride India's Stock Market RallyMiss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits Highs2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Hold Buffett Dividend Stocks

208,JNJ,"Loxo Oncology (LOXO) stock defied a broad biotech dip Monday and spiked to a record high after showing its drug, larotrectinib, shrunk tumors in a number of different cancers.Shares of Loxo ended Monday's regular session catapulting higher by 43.2%, to 70.12, following the presentation Saturday during the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. Companies like Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Roche (RHHBY) were in attendance.Loxo's drug belongs to a class of immuno-oncology agents that aim to inhibit a family of proteins. Loxo is now setting up to begin a Phase 1 and 2 trial of larotrectinib after an adult with colon cancer and a child with a tissue tumor responded to treatment.But the big-cap names weren't the big winners on Wall Street. Instead, companies like Bluebird Bio (BLUE) surged. Bluebird stock got an 8.5% jump to 91.30 after it presented strong data for its drug, dubbed bb2121, for treating multiple myeloma.On Monday, Bluebird said all 15 patients in a trial of bb2121 responded to treatment with no relapses. The therapy was well-tolerated, Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt said in a report. He has an outperform rating on Bluebird stock.IBD'S TAKE: Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 97 out of a best-possible 99 based on key growth metrics. It leads IBD's 431-company Biomed/Biotech industry group. Keep tabs on the industry leaders with IBD Stock Checkup.And Puma Biotechnology (PBYI) stock lifted 2.1%, at 83.65, after rival Roche unveiled the results of a yearlong test of its drugs in a specific group of breast cancer patients. The results were on the ""low end of investors' expectations,"" RBC analyst Matthew Eckler said.This bodes well for Puma, which is working on a drug called neratinib that could address the same group of patients, Eckler said. Roche drugs Herceptin and Perjeta were tested as an adjuvant treatment — treatments that are added to decrease the risk of relapse.""We now assume adoption of neratinib will be largely unencumbered by the adjuvant use of Herceptin plus Perjeta,"" Eckler wrote in a note to clients. He kept his sector perform rating on Puma stock, but boosted his price target to 88 from 60.However, Puma Bio shares closed well off its intraday high of 92, their highest since November 2015.TG Therapeutics (TGTX) stock also cut a wide berth Monday. It rose as much as 10.8%, but gave those gains back to close down 6.1%, at 13. Earlier in the day, TG had positive results of a trial with AbbVie (ABBV) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a form of leukemia.RELATED:Dow's Merck 'Clearly Won' Vs.

209,JNJ,"Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance will likely benefit most after the Food and Drug Administration required Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to warn patients of leg and foot amputations associated with diabetes drug Invokana, an analyst said Tuesday.In a letter to physicians Tuesday, the FDA cited two large clinical trials and concluded that diabetes meds Invokana, Invokamet and Invokamet XR ""causes an increased risk of leg and foot amputations.""The FDA will now require Johnson & Johnson to add a boxed warning to its Invokana/Invokamet labels. The trials, dubbed Canvas and Canvas-R, showed that leg and foot amputations occurred twice as often in patients treated with Invokana vs. a placebo.""Amputations to the toe and middle of the foot were the most common, however, amputations involving the leg, below and above the knee also occurred,"" the FDA wrote. ""Some patients had more than one amputation, some involving both limbs.""Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez expects Lilly to benefit from an influx of Invokana patients transitioning to one of its diabetes meds, Jardiance. Invokana and Jardiance belong to a class of drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors.SGLT2 — sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 — is a protein that facilitates glucose reabsorption in the kidneys. These drugs block the reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys, increase glucose excretion and lower blood glucose levels.""The increasingly differentiated labels and data to date suggest that Lilly's Jardiance likely will be a near-term beneficiary of further and perhaps accelerated market share losses for Invokana,"" Fernandez wrote in a note to clients.IBD'S TAKE: Stay on top of the biotech and drug industry by bookmarking IBD's Biotech And Pharma Industry And Stock News page.Whether physicians move their patients off Invokana and onto Jardiance or AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga will likely depend on the full results of the Canvas and Canvas-R trials to be presented in June during the American Diabetes Association meeting.J&J's Janssen subsidiary began the Canvas trial in December 2009 to examine the potential cardiovascular benefit of Invokana. The Canvas-R trial began in October 2013. Researchers examined benefits of Invokana on the kidneys.Lilly's Jardiance was approved by the FDA in December to cut the risk of cardiovascular death in adults with Type 2 diabetes. Jardiance was the first Type 2 diabetes drug to get approval for cutting the risk of cardiovascular death.""We believe a dramatic impact on the class is unlikely in the wake of Jardiance's cardiovascular death claim and could be further mitigated by directionally positive results in Canvas/Canvas-R on efficacy/cardiovascular risk reduction,"" Fernandez wrote.Still, the entire SGLT2 needs to grow for Jardiance to meet or beat forecasts. Fernandez sees $665 million in U.S. Jardiance sales in 2017 and $1 billion in Invokana sales in 2017. He forecasts the entire class growing to $4 billion in 2021 from $2.1 billion this year.""So even if Jardiance were to capture 100% of Invokana's estimates sales of $1 billion in 2017 in the immediate future, a major slowdown in category growth likely would be a bigger issue relative to consensus estimates,"" he said.At the close on the stock market today, Lilly stock was down 1.6% to 78.99, after a Goldman Sachs analyst removed the stock from her conviction list. But shares of J&J, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, advanced 0.6%, near 127.77.RELATED:Dow's Pfizer, Eli Lilly Topple To 3-Month Lows On DowngradesCan Teva Hold Its Own In Bringing Migraine Drugs To Market?Drug Stocks Rally On Relief After GOP Health Bill Wins In House

Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR) is drawing near a 28.47 buy point of a flat base, which began forming one month after breaking out from a prior base. The young fund, which launched in September, has attracted $113.7 million in assets.It corresponds to the same-named index, which tracks mid- and large-cap dividend paying companies that are expected to keep paying and increasing their payouts and ""have a positive correlation of returns to increasing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields,"" according to Fidelity.com.This ETF could prove to be a timely bet, given that the Federal Reserve is poised to notch up interest rates. FDRR's top holdings as of May 30 read like a who's who of Dow stocks.

219,JNJ,"President Trump summoned some of America's most prominent corporate executives to the White House Thursday and told them he intends to put them to work restoring manufacturing jobs and U.S. dominance in trade.""They share our commitment to bring manufacturing back and to create jobs in this country,"" Trump said as he sat with the 24 business leaders, who included Dow Chemical (DOW) Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson, and Caterpillar (CAT) Chairman Doug Oberhelman.Trump used the public portion of the meeting to reiterate some of his campaign themes, blasting what he called ""unbelievably bad"" trade deals and singling out trade deficits with Mexico and China. He vowed to punish companies that move jobs outside the U.S. and promised to squeeze more money out of government contracts, citing his talks with Hewson, which he said cut the cost of Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet by more than $700 million.""She's tough, but it worked out well I think for everybody,"" Trump said of Hewson.Before meeting with Trump, the executives split into working groups to explore policy changes on topics such as taxes and trade, regulation, infrastructure and the future workforce. Joining them in the breakout sessions were administration officials, including Vice President Mike Pence; Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council; Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin; and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Campbell Soup (CPB) CEO Denise Morrison, Harris Corp. (HRS) CEO Bill Brown, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky and David Farr, CEO of Emerson Electric (EMR), were among those who took part in the working group sessions with administration officials, who also included budget director Mick Mulvaney.  In a meeting with Cohn and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, business leaders including Corning (GLW) CEO Wendell Weeks and Nucor (NUE) President John Ferriola discussed indexing gasoline taxes to provide more money for transportation projects.Thursday's meeting grew out of Trump's December announcement of an advisory panel on manufacturing.Dow Chemical's Liveris, who is leading the panel, said afterward that he and the other executives were ""very encouraged"" by the pro-business approach being taken by the administration.Taking part in a session on the workforce of the future, Liveris said there must be a ""systemic fix"" to address the shortage of workers prepared for jobs requiring skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.""We have supply-side issues today,"" he said, ""half a million open STEM jobs that we can't fill. We need to fill them with Americans.""He also said community colleges need to provide more vocational training for ""the noble trades,"" which had been a priority of the Obama administration.Lockheed's Hewson told reporters that Trump is ready to take quick action on streamlining rules for businesses. ""It's very important that we reduce regulations, that we eliminate those that are burdensome that are unnecessary,"" she said.Ahead of the meeting, Business Roundtable, the lobbying group for U.S. corporate executives, sent a letter to Cohn laying out 16 regulations of top concern to its members. The letter touches on everything from the Affordable Care Act to net neutrality to environmental regulations — but also hints at CEO concerns about the economic impacts of Trump immigration and trade policy.Topping the Business Roundtable list is a 2015 move by the Environmental Protection Agency to tighten national ambient air quality standards for ground-level ozone, as well as EPA limits on new coal-fired power plants and expanded jurisdiction over state waters. The list also includes overtime regulations; Dodd-Frank provisions including CEO pay ratio disclosure, conflict minerals disclosure rules and margin requirements for uncleared swaps; and employer reporting and tax requirements under the Affordable Care Act. In addition, the group is seeking expedited export controls and tightening eligibility and increasing exclusions for shareholder proposals.""While some of the listed regulations in isolation may not appear significant to growth, their cumulative effect has drained resources from innovation and job creation and directed them to non-value adding administrative and bureaucratic activities,"" said the letter, signed by Mark Costa, the chairman and CEO for Eastman Chemical (EMN) who leads Business Roundtable's smart regulation committee.At the same time, the letter said that as the administration ""considers new policies with regard to immigration or the expansion of 'Buy America' requirements, Business Roundtable stands ready to assist to prevent unintended consequences that would inhibit the ability for U.S. companies to drive economic growth and be globally competitive.""Trump has used previous meetings with companies to encourage corporate leaders to build their products in the U.S., offering tax breaks and lower regulation to bring down costs — and warning that he wants to raise tariffs on products produced overseas. The heads of labor organizations, automotive firms, national retail chains, drug companies, and airlines are all among the groups who have met with Trump in the West Wing in recent weeks.Neither Trump nor the CEOs indicated they had a detailed discussion of his plans to overhaul the tax code, which he has said he will deliver within weeks, or a border-adjustment tax proposal under consideration by House Republicans, which would shift the tax burden from exporters to importers.Republican leaders in the House, including Speaker Paul Ryan, argue a border-adjustment tax would benefit American manufacturing while providing revenue to make up for losses from reducing corporate tax rates. Several manufacturers, including Dow Chemical, are actively lobbying for the plan, which Trump has called ""too complicated."" Opponents, including net importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), oppose it and warn it will raise taxes on American consumers.

In a fourth-quarter survey of those investors, Schwab found 42% of them said they now feel bullish. That was a big jump up from the 34% who felt that way in Q4 a year earlier.""As a result of the election, clients saw an increased prospect for a reduction in personal and corporate tax rates, an increased likelihood of spending on infrastructure, and an increased likelihood of a reduction in regulatory burdens for some industries,"" said Myhanh Hoskin, a Schwab financial consultant, who is based in Seal Beach, Calif. ""The rate increase was a sign of growing strength in the economy.""Amid that widespread perception that the stock market had become increasingly worth investing in, Schwab investors did as much buying as selling in the quarter.The top five U.S. holdings among all Schwab stock mutual funds were Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as of Feb. 16, according to Morningstar Inc.Apple is up 17% year to date, while Microsoft is up 4%, Exxon is down 10%, Johnson & Johnson is up 3%, and JPMorgan is up 5%.In Schwab's survey of its clients, the general balance between buying and selling bodes well for the market in additional ways. ""It shows there isn't a sense of euphoria,"" Hoskin said. ""It shows caution by many investors. And that suggests that we're not seeing a market top. That is a good thing.

223,JNJ,"Ask Wall Street analysts to name possible catalysts for a rise in big-cap technology stocks like Apple (AAPL) and Cisco Systems (CSCO), and near the top on most lists would be Trump administration plans to allow companies to bring foreign profits into the U.S. at a reduced tax rate.Analysts say cash brought back could be a piggy bank for company stock repurchases or acquisitions. Problem is, President Trump's economic agenda has been stalled amid White House drama.The proposed changes on ""repatriated"" cash are part of a bigger Trump tax reform package. Randall Stephenson, AT&T's (T) CEO, says tax reform can make it through Congress.""A lot of people are getting pessimistic because of a lot of the noise in Washington right now that tax reform may not be achieved,"" Stephenson said at a JPMorgan tech conference on May 23. ""I am still optimistic something can still get done … bundling tax reform with an infrastructure bill would be big. I think it's achievable.""Even so, one worry is that the overseas ""tax holiday"" for tech firms may not turn out as the bonanza it's made out to be. That depends on whether legislation puts conditions on how money could be spent and creates enforcement mechanisms.Rather than see the money go toward company stock buybacks or acquisitions, Trump and Congress could steer money toward job creation and capital spending, says a UBS analyst.""If the (Trump administration) wants to really drive inward investments within the U.S. there might have to be some sort of mandated use of cash, maybe to spend it on (capital expenditures). As yet, we do not know,"" UBS analyst Geoff Robinson said in a report.There's reason to think Robinson might be on the right track.""There's trillions of dollars offshore. We want to get that back into America,"" Gary Cohn, Trump's chief economic advisor, said in a recent interview. ""We want the companies to bring the money back and put it back into the economy. We want them to create jobs.""Cash-rich tech companies like Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Cisco currently would pay a 35% tax on so-called ""repatriated earnings."" Rather than take the tax hit, they've kept the money overseas.President Trump has proposed a one-time tax of 10% on offshore earnings while the Republican-controlled House has proposed a lower 8.5% rate.The overseas tax-break that Congress passed in 2004 was called the American Jobs Creation Act, but didn't do much to stimulate the economy, analysts say. The AJCA taxed repatriated earnings at a 5.25% rate.The top five firms in bringing back cash in 2004 were drug companies Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK), as well as Hewlett-Packard, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and IBM (IBM). According to the IRS, $312 billion was brought back in all.However, only 10% of companies eligible to bring back cash in 2004 did so, says Richard Lane, an analyst at Moody's Investor Service. Many companies kept cash overseas because of AJCA requirements, he said.The AJCA required companies to reinvest tax savings in worker hiring and training, infrastructure, research and development and capital projects. According to UBS, however, ""Funds in 2004's repatriation may have been earmarked for capital investment but ultimately were spent in large part on share repurchases.""UBS says that happened because the AJCA did not include a ""tracking mechanism"" so the government could audit companies and gauge compliance. The Trump administration could put better enforcement mechanisms in place.S&P 500 companies have more than $2.6 trillion in overseas cash. Some of that may be needed to continue funding foreign operations.The companies currently with the most overseas cash are Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, Google and Oracle (ORCL), Moody's says.While Cisco has stated any cash brought back to the U.S. could be used for reducing debt on its books, analysts have other ideas.If a tax holiday is approved, BMO Capital Markets said in a report that it ""expects Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) to focus more on acquisitions, while Apple and smaller companies would likely lean more toward capital return.""In the case of Apple and Cisco, some analysts envision enough cash being brought back to fund ""transformative"" deals. Apple has about $250 billion in cash, growing at about $50 billion a year. About 90% of Apple's cash is overseas. A one-time, 10% repatriation tax would give Apple some $220 billion for acquisitions or buybacks, Citigroup analyst Jim Suva said in a report. Suva speculated that Apple could buy large companies such as Netflix (NFLX), Walt Disney (DIS) or Electronic Arts (EA).Cisco, meanwhile, could bring back up to $56 billion in cash from overseas, analysts say. In a report, Credit Suisse speculates that enterprise software providers ServiceNow (NOW), Splunk (SPLK), or computer security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW) could be on Cisco's shopping list. Pacific Crest Securities adds Red Hat (RHT) and Nutanix (NTNX) to the list of possible Cisco targets.Intel (INTC) is among semiconductor companies with a cash hoard overseas. Intel could bring back about $12 billion, says BMO Capital Markets. Nvidia (NVDA) and Qualcomm (QCOM) also have significant overseas cash. But, BMO Capital does not expect a Trump tax holiday to spur an acquisition spree among chipmakers.

224,JNJ,"Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) set up a potentially lackluster first quarter for the sector as orthopedic sales for the medtech bellwether lagged and the surgical unit was merely in line, though cardiovascular sales grew by double digits.J&J stock closed down 3.1% at 121.82 on the stock market today. Last month, shares broke out of a flat base that began in July, hitting a 126.17 buy point. The stock has since retreated below that point.For the first quarter, J&J reported 1.7% sales growth to $17.77 billion, below views for $18.04 billion. Drug sales advanced just 0.8%. But adjusted earnings rose 5.8% to $1.83 a share, beating the consensus by 6 cents.Despite the revenue miss and light pharma sales, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro remained bullish on J&J stock. He kept his outperform rating on shares noting ""underlying pharma trends remain solid despite (the first quarter) miss."" He had called J&J a stock to own heading into earnings.J&J's drug-making unit brought in $8.25 billion in the first quarter, missing Novarro's model by $200 million. Immunology, J&J's biggest pharma unit, came in at $2.93 billion, up 0.7%, in line with Novarro's view. Remicade sales topped by $97 million.Oncology sales were $600 million above Novarro's estimate. But cardiovascular drug sales missed by $232 million with Xarelto and Invokana/Invokamet declining 9.5% and 12.6%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. But underlying demand for those drugs looks strong, Novarro said.""The company noted pharmaceutical segment sales growth was negatively impacted by a lower adjustment of rebate accruals in (the first quarter of 2017) compared to the adjustments in (the first quarter of 2016),"" Novarro wrote in a note to clients.Medical devices pulled in $6.29 billion, growing 3% vs. the year-earlier period. The cardiovascular unit grew by 12.6%, but diabetes sales dipped 7%. Surgical sales grew 2% to $2.27 billion. Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar noted the results are a ""positive for general cardio utilization.""But in orthopedics, sales fell 0.7%, meaning ""trends seem to be decelerating and hints at softer utilization trends in (the first quarter)."" Kumar doesn't cover Johnson, but says results from the major medtech company can be read through for the entire sector.Including the estimated impact of its Actelion purchase for the first time, Johnson & Johnson now sees full-year EPS of $7-$7.15 on revenue of $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion. J&J had projected it will reach $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion in 2017 sales, up 4%-5%, with adjusted earnings expected to top $7 a share.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 70, meaning it outperforms all but 30% of stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

227,JNJ,"Coca-Cola (KO) earnings and sales fell less than feared in the first quarter, but sluggish soda and other products' shipment volume hit shares as investors hoped that the global giant would continue momentum.Earnings per share minus one-time items for the world's largest soft drinks maker fell 6% to 45 cents on a 3.5% revenue decline to $10.33 billion. Wall Street was looking for 44 cents EPS and $10.29 billion revenue.But beverage volume rose 2%, vs. 3% in the second half of 2015. Organic sales growth slowed to 2%.

Find out at IBD Stock CheckupCoke said that the number of cases shipped in Europe fell 1% in Q1 vs. a year earlier, but it rose 2% in North America and 1% in Latin America. Growth was flat in Eurasia and Africa.Currency fluctuations resulted in a 10 point headwind on comparable operating income and a 12 point headwind on EPS in the quarter. Like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals, Coca-Cola sees a smaller currency headwind going forward as the dollar weakens.Coca-Cola still sees organic, currency-neutral revenue growth of 4%-5% this year. PepsiCo (PEP) on Monday topped Q1 earnings views on improved productivity gains and lower costs, joining other packaged-food companies that managed earnings gains despite weaker revenue.  Pepsi reported a 7% rise in EPS  to 89 cents a share, topping forecasts by eight cents.

228,JNJ,"Surgical-robot maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) received multiple price target hikes from Wall Street, as its stock hit a new high Wednesday, following its Q1 earnings report late Tuesday.As IBD reported, Intuitive Surgical's Q1 earnings beat estimates, but what really interested analysts was the quarter's 17% procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical normally sells only about 100 of its pricey da Vinci robotic systems per quarter, so surgical procedures using the company's consumable accessories and services are key to steady revenue. Management raised procedure-growth guidance for the year to 12% to 14%, from the previous 9% to 12%.Operating expenses increased, and Intuitive Surgical's management also raised its opex guidance for the year to 12% to 15% of revenue, up from 9% to 13% previously. However, it likewise raised its gross-margin guidance to 69% to 70%, from 68% to 69.5%.Intuitive Surgical is on IBD's Big Cap 20. Who else makes the grade?""Intuitive Surgical's impressive Q1 procedure growth is consistent with our recent positive general surgeon checks,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Brandon Henry as he raised his price target to 640 from 610 while maintaining a sector perform rating. ""While Intuitive Surgical is accelerating operating expense spend, we believe these investments should drive increased future robotics adoption and help the company maintain its superior position in the robotics market, despite upcoming competition.""The company has no competitors at present, but Medtronic (MDT), TransEnterix (TRXC) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) partnering with Alphabet's (GOOGL) Verily division are all developing their own robotic surgery systems.Leerink analyst Richard Newitter lifted his Intuitive Surgical price target to 710 from 700 while maintaining an outperform rating.""A now stronger outlook for Urology/GYN and general surgery gave management confidence to raise '16 procedure guidance,"" Newitter wrote in his research note. ""Also, management seems to be talking more aggressively about da Vinci use in thoracic, a procedure area we think may be around the corner as an emerging growth driver.""Piper Jaffray analyst Matt O'Brien raised his price target to 610 from 550. He rates the stock neutral.Intuitive Surgical stock hit a record high of 654.88 early on the stock market today, pushing it up 20% for the year. In morning trading, shares were up 4.5% near 652.

231,JNJ,"With the Nasdaq 100 hitting record highs, it's no big surprise that the best year-to-date performance among U.S. large-cap diversified stock ETFs was turned in by those tracking the index.PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) came in at the top with a 17.1% year-to-date return through May 10, as well as the biggest one-month gain of 4.8%. A three-year average annual gain of 18.1% also leads the list. Like the benchmark Nasdaq 100 index, the $51 billion ETF is in new high ground.

"
232,JNJ,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock rocketed to an eight-month high and hovered around a breakout Thursday after the top 10 drugmaker reported first-quarter sales and profits that topped Wall Street's expectations.On the stock market today, AbbVie rose 1.6% to 66.07, closing below a 66.89 buy point of a flat base that began in mid-March. Shares rose as high as 67.50 intraday.For the first quarter ended March 31, AbbVie reported adjusted income of $1.28 a share on $6.54 billion in sales, up a respective 11.3% and 9.7% vs. the year-earlier period. Analysts had modeled $1.26 a share and $6.48 billion in sales.Sales of the immunosuppressant Humira, AbbVie's biggest moneymaking drug, grew 15.1% to $4.12 billion. Humira sales were 1% above consensus views for $4.092 billion and in line with Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges' $4.118 billion view.""The pricing and volume challenges noted by biopharma companies with immunology drugs do not seem to have impacted Humira to the same degree which suggests to us Humira's formulatory position has remained largely unchanged and reduces the risk of subsequent revenue misses in 2017,"" he said.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) first-quarter report was expected to have highlighted ""multiple issues"" for biotechs and drugmakers. But on Thursday, Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) also delivered across-the-board beats. Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on J&J's results.Porges kept a market perform rating on AbbVie stock.Imbruvica, a cancer drug, brought in $551 million in sales, up 44.7% on a year-over-year basis. In the U.S., Imbruvica brought in $457 million, in line with consensus views for $459 million, though 6% below Leerink's forecast, Porges wrote in a note to clients.AbbVie note the FDA accepted an application for Imbruvica as a treatment in graft-versus-host disease during the quarter. Graft-versus-host disease can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants. The drug is being developed with Johnson & Johnson.The company later confirmed its 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings of $5.44-$5.54 a share, up 13.9% at the midpoint of guidance.Also Thursday, Celgene (CELG) reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings, but sales came out short.

233,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) needs Swiss biotech Actelion Pharmaceuticals to help reaccelerate earnings growth after its patent on blockbuster immunosuppressant Remicade expires in 2018, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Friday.The deal is a win-win. J&J's Remicade, which brought in 58% of its pharmaceutical sales in 2016, is facing competition from Pfizer's (PFE) biosimilar Inflectra. Meanwhile, Actelion has been prepping for the loss of exclusivity of its pulmonary arterial hypertension drug.In the first nine months of 2016, Actelion's U.S. sales increased 23% when accounting for exchange rates, Novarro said. At the same time, sales of PAH drug Tracleer fell by 23%, offset by sales of fellow PAH drugs Opsumit and Uptravi.""With generic completion to Tracleer in the U.S. imminent, we believe sales would be flat for Actelion in 2017,"" Novarro wrote in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson had seven drugs approved 2012-16, tying with Pfizer. Head to IBD's Industry Themes to see which company had the most approvals over that period of time and in 2016, specifically.J&J early Thursday announced it had agreed to pay $280 per share of Actelion stock, valuing the company at $30 billion. The deal is expected to close in June and could help J&J tack on 8 cents earnings per share over six months. For 2018, Novarro sees the deal as 35 cents-accretive.He also expects Actelion sales to grow 7%-9% in 2017 on the J&J acquisition. That forecast could be conservative, he says, as J&J sees itself as having a big enough geographic footprint to help Actelion grow.Novarro has an outperform rating and 128 price target on Johnson & Johnson stock, which rose 1.4% to 113.38 on the stock market today, after falling 0.85% on Thursday.

235,JNJ,"After two months of talks, Johnson & Johnson announced early Thursday that it reached an agreement to pay $30 billion for Swiss biotech Actelion.""Actelion has established a leading franchise of differentiated, innovative products for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) that is highly complementary to the existing portfolio of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson,"" J&J said.As part of the deal, the Swiss drugmaker's R&D unit will be spun out into a separate company that will trade on the Swiss stock exchange. J&J will initially own 16% of that firm with rights to buy another 16%. It'll also have rights to a drug candidate being developed by the drug discovery unit.Johnson & Johnson will pay cash held outside the U.S. to pay for the deal.J&J initially acknowledged its efforts to buy Actelion back on Nov. 25. Talks broke down in early December, with France's Sanofi (SNY) in lead position.

236,JNJ,"Eli Lilly (LLY) heisted some of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Type 2 diabetes share in Q4, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said Wednesday, a day after Lilly stock outplayed a mixed quarter on a President Trump-related boost.Lilly stock ramped up 3.1% on Tuesday and continued in the black on Wednesday. At the closing bell on the stock market today, shares ended the regular session up 0.7% to 77.60, earlier touching a nearly three-month high of 78.57. Lilly stock reacted to a softer tone from Trump on Tuesday, who pledged to deregulate the industry and cut taxes.But Trump also called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in a meeting with executives from Celgene (CELG), Merck (MRK), Lilly, Novartis (NVS) and J&J. There, Trump reportedly backed off calls to revisit allowing the federal government to negotiate on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid.Fernandez, in a research note, said he was ""reluctant to call this first event a victory, but it was not as bad as prior commentary."" He kept his outperform rating and 91 price target on Lilly stock, noting the drugmaker's sales of diabetes drugs improved in Q4.Lilly's Q4 and 2016 sales topped estimates Tuesday, though earnings missed. Fernandez credited growth in diabetes products for sales performance. Sales of diabetes drugs Trulicity and Jardiance grew 200% and 421%, respectively, in 2016.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary may have sent drug stocks on a run Tuesday, but his immigration ban on Monday toppled airline stocks. Who's falling and who will survive? Read IBD's Industry Themes for a deeper look.Trulicity belongs to a class of drugs called GLP-1 receptor inhibitors where it has 32% of new-to-brand share, with 30% year-over-year growth in the space, Fernandez wrote. Jardiance has 35% new-to-therapy share with endocrinologists, exceeding J&J's Invokana.Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham is less bullish, though he boosted his price target on Lilly stock to 85 from 80 and kept his outperform rating. In the Trump-rattled drug industry, Meacham says investors will prefer product-driven companies like Lilly.""Given the difficulty in triangulating where the drug pricing debate will settle out, we continue to prefer product-driven stories like Lilly with relatively low reliance on price or revenue concentration risk,"" he wrote in a research report.Lilly, though, is likely to struggle in the emerging immuno-oncology market, he wrote. The company is partnering with Merck to combine I-O drug Keytruda and chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-small-cell lung cancer. The FDA looks likely to approve the combo, he wrote.""We anticipate that the approval of KN-021G (a Phase 3 study) for Keytruda along with the recent favorable patent ruling could drive a pickup in Alimta growth,"" Meacham said.Outside oncology, Meacham expects Lilly to add two drugs to its pipeline in 2018: baricitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and galcanezumab in the anti-CGRP migraine market. In the latter arena, Lilly competes with Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Alder Pharmaceuticals (ALDR) and Amgen (AMGN).RELATED:Eli Lilly, Novartis Challenge Pfizer's Potential $8 Billion Breast Cancer DrugPfizer Reports Lagging Q4 EPS; Rebounds On Trump CommentaryBiotechs 'Round-Trip' Trump-Inspired Rally; FDA Appointment Key

239,JNJ,"The dollar has been the not-so-jolly green giant for corporate America since mid-2014, cutting top- and bottom-line growth. But with the buck retreating, the negative impact for IBM (IBM) and other U.S. multinationals faded in Q1 results, with even more improvement expected going forward.The U.S. dollar index fell Tuesday to its lowest levels since last August's flash market crash. That continued a downtrend this year after a huge run from mid-2014 to late last year. S&P 500 companies with heavy overseas exposure already are seeing smaller FX losses and raising full-year guidance on currency trends.""About 50% of (Johnson & Johnson's) sales come from overseas,"" said Lindsey Bell, senior analyst at S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""That’s an encouraging sign.""The dollar index shot up 25% from June 2014 to November 2015. That made U.S. exports less competitive, while reducing the dollar value of overseas income and revenue.The strong buck also contributed to the huge sell-off in dollar-priced commodities, with crude oil falling as much as 75%, hurting energy companies and emerging markets, both of which hurt the industrial sector.The dollar rose in large part because the Federal Reserve was moving toward raising rates, which it finally did last December, while other central banks eased policy. But the Fed has turned more dovish this year amid sluggish economic growth and financial turmoil earlier this year. The Fed now indicates just two rate hikes this year, down from four previously, with markets seeing just one tightening step, perhaps not until September.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank pushed ahead with negative rate policies, but their currencies unexpectedly rallied on those moves.  Also, China's yuan recovered its early 2016 losses vs. the dollar.""The dollar index was up 14% (year over year) as of August 2015,"" said Robert Keiser, vice president at S&P Global Market Intelligence.The dollar is now down about 4% vs. a year earlier, suggesting that the FX impact will continue to fade or even start to turn positive. The weaker dollar also has helped U.S. crude prices rise back above $40 a barrel from the mid-$20s in January.A slew of corporate giants with huge international exposure likely will report less of a dollar impact in the next week or so. General Motors (GM) and Alphabet (GOOGL) report on Thursday, with McDonald's (MCD) and General Electric (GE) on Friday.  Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) are on tap next week.But ""less bad"" isn't quite the same as good. Apple is expected to post a rare sales decline. Overall S&P 500 Q1 earnings likely fell 7.6% while sales dipped 1.3%, according to analysts polled  by Thomson Reuters. Excluding energy, earnings are forecast to slip 2.3% with revenue up 1.7%.

240,JNJ,"Medical giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat Q1 estimates and raised guidance Tuesday morning, sending its stock to its fifth recent record high.J&J reported earnings of $1.68 a share, up 8% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 3 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales rose 0.6% to $17.48 billion, matching consensus. J&J said that the foreign-exchange impact knocked 6.6 percentage points off sales growth.Nonetheless, the forex headwinds finally seem to be abating. J&J cited the improved forex outlook as the reason it was raising full-year sales guidance by $400 million, to $71.2 billion to $71.9 billion. It also added 10 cents to EPS guidance, now $6.53 to $6.68.IBD's Take: Johnson & Johnson rated No. 1 in its group, but CR is iffy.""Our Pharmaceuticals business continues to deliver impressive levels of growth, we have steady improvement in our Consumer business, and we are seeing momentum in our Medical Devices businesses, all of which are fueling our optimism for the full-year ahead,"" J&J CEO Alex Gorsky said in a statement.J&J stock was up 2% in early trading on the stock market today, touching a record high of 113.60 intraday. The stock is up more than 10% for the year so far, and it is the first of three medical stocks that are hitting new highs and are reporting this week, the others being Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) this evening and Stryker (SYK) late Wednesday.""This morning, J&J continued the growth momentum the company has seen in recent quarters, again delivering organic sales growth acceleration and its second consecutive quarter of double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted, operational basis,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note.She noted that, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, M&A activity and shrinking sales of hepatitis C drug Olysio -- which was made obsolete when Gilead Sciences (GILD) released Harvoni in late 2014 -- sales rose 6.9%. Operating EPS growth was just above 10%.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan wrote that the pharma sales beat was driven by the immunology franchise -- Remicade, Simponi and Stelara -- as well as its stroke prevention treatment Xarelto.But another top seller, diabetes drug Invokana, missed consensus by 19%. Investors had been wondering if Invokana would take a hit from Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance, which last September proved that it could dramatically cut deaths from heart failure but didn't get a sales bump from this in Q4.

247,JNJ,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) stock was flat Wednesday even though the firm topped Wall Street's first-quarter sales and profit expectations following the acquisition of St. Jude Medical.Abbott shares had climbed, fallen and ultimately closed up 0.4% at 43.59 on the stock market today and have been forming a flat base since March 13 with a 45.94 buy point.For the first quarter, Abbott reported $6.3 billion in sales, growing 29.7% vs. the year-earlier period and beating the consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) for $6.15 billion. Abbott reported adjusted earnings of 48 cents a share, up 17% and topping views by 5 cents.""Our first-quarter results reflect a strong start to the year,"" Chief Executive Miles White said in a news release. ""The integration of St. Jude is going well and recently launched products are contributing to double-digit sales growth across several areas of our medical devices business.""RBC analyst Glenn Novarro noted what seemed to be a massive sales beat could be misleading. It's unclear whether the consensus' estimate included sales from Abbott Medical Optics, which it sold to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in February. That unit sold $175 million in the period.IBD'S TAKE: On Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson's results highlighted ""multiple issues"" for the medtech and pharma space. Those issues will likely trickle down throughout the sector, analysts say. Head to IBD's Technology page for a closer look.Total nutrition sales declined 1.7% during the quarter to $1.64 billion with pediatric sales taking the biggest hit, down 4.1%.Core laboratory sales, though, grew 3% vs. the year-earlier quarter to $1.16 billion. That topped Novarro's view by $20 million. Slow Venezuelan operations weighed on diagnostics sales, he noted in a research report.Established pharmaceuticals — which are outside the U.S. only — grew 7% in the first quarter to $950 million in sales. Key emerging markets include Brazil, Russia, India and China. Emerging pharma sales grew 15.2% to $730 million.Medical sales doubled to $2.395 billion in the quarter, driven by 207% growth in sales of cardiovascular devices and tools to stimulate the nervous system.Abbott also reaffirmed its 2017 guidance for adjusted earnings of $2.40-$2.50 a share, which would be up 11.4%.

248,JNJ,"XDrug and medical supplies distributor Cardinal Health (CAH) said it would buy the medical supply units of Medtronic (MDT) for $6.1 billion, mostly with debt. Along with weaker earnings guidance, Cardinal shares plunged early Tuesday.Cardinal Health is acquiring Medtronic's patient care, deep vein thrombosis and nutritional insufficiency units, including brands used. Combined, the units generated about $2.4 billion in revenue in the last four reported quarters, Medtronic said. They include 23 product categories across multiple market settings, including brands, such as Curity, Kendall, Dover, Argyle and Kangaroo, which are used in nearly every U.S. hospital.""This well-established product line is complementary to our medical consumables business and fits naturally into our customer offering. For this reason, this product portfolio has been on our radar for many years,"" said Cardinal Health Chairman and CEO George Barrett.IBD'S TAKE: Cardinal Health shares had been rebounding since the presidential election as investors believed Donald Trump would be less aggressive on drug prices than Hillary Clinton, despite some of his statements. But the stock tumbled through its 50-day moving average after finding support there in 2017.But Cardinal now sees fiscal 2017 earnings per share at the low end of earlier guidance of $5.35 to $5.50. It expects the deal to be boost non-GAAP EPS from continuing operations by more than 21 cents in 2018, but still sees EPS that year to be flat to down in the mid-single digits.Cardinal Health will finance the acquisition with cash and $4.5 billion in new debt. Standard & Poor's and Fitch both put Cardinal's credit rating at risk of a downgrade, citing increased ""leverage.""Cardinal Health shares tumbled 11.5% to 72.39 on the stock market today, gapping below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Medtronic dipped 3 cents to 80.33. Among Cardinal's fellow drug distributors, McKesson (MCK) sank 4.6% and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) 4.7%.In 2015, Cardinal Health paid about $2 billion for Cordis from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), adding a portfolio of devices, including catheters, filters and stents.Medtronic said the transaction will reduce 2018 EPS modestly.

250,JNJ,"President Trump called for drugmakers to manufacture in the U.S. in an effort to curb rising prices, during a meeting with Big Pharma executives at the White House mere weeks after he accused the industry of ""getting away with murder.""Trump also promised to cut regulations and appoint a ""fantastic person"" to lead the Food and Drug Administration. Tight regulations and a slow FDA often jam the approval process, drugmakers say. Last year, the FDA approved 19 new molecular entities, a nine-year low.His tenor was reportedly different from earlier calls to have the federal government negotiate prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid. The agencies cover millions of Americans and are among the biggest purchasers of health care products and services in the world.At the same meeting, Trump pledged to increase international competition, cut taxes on businesses and lure companies back to the U.S. Trump has pledged to put America first. In his inaugural speech, he said ""every decision ... will be made to benefit American workers and American families.""IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Trump has pledged to bring down rising drug prices.

251,JNJ,"Drug industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) toppled Tuesday after 2017 sales guidance lagged the Street by $1 billion and hepatitis C revenue slid to ""virtually zero"" — mirroring recent concerns around fellow drug giant Gilead Sciences (GILD).Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges characterized the overall picture as tepid. On the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock fell 1.9% to 111.76, sinking further below its 50-day moving average support line, where J&J had hovered for six weeks.For Q4, Johnson & Johnson reported $18.1 billion in sales and $1.58 earnings per share ex items, up 1.7% and 9.7%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter. Though EPS beat the consensus by 2 cents, sales missed analyst estimates of $18.26 billion.IBD'S TAKE: As drugmakers like Johnson & Johnson struggle in Q4, biotechs like Incyte are poised to jump. Incyte is digging into markets with potential blockbusters. Read on at The New America for more on those markets and ""Incyte"" into their opportunity.Johnson wrapped up 2016 with $71.9 billion in sales and $6.73 EPS minus items, up 2.6% and 8.5%, respectively.But 2017 guidance, in particular, disappointed. For 2017, Johnson sees $74.1 billion to $74.8 billion in sales. That would be up 3.5% vs. 2016, but lagged the consensus of 23 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $75.1 billion. EPS minus items guidance for $6.93-$7.08 missed the model for $7.11.As expected, Johnson's hepatitis C drug sales dipped to ""virtually zero,"" Porges wrote Tuesday in a research report. Gilead has been hammered over the past week on Wall Street views that prescriptions for Hep C drugs dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4. Gilead is set to report Q4 earnings on Feb. 7, after the close.J&J's neuroscience unit declined markedly, down 16% year over year in the U.S. Oncology sales, though, were a bright spot, rising 30% in the U.S. and 6.3% in other geographies.

252,JNJ,"Gilead Sciences' (GILD) newest HIV regimen topped a rival combo from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), in trial results released late Monday, but a doublet from GSK will keep ""intense competitive pressure"" on Gilead's HIV unit, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says.Porges' view followed Gilead's presentation during the annual Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections late Monday in Seattle. In a head-to-head comparison, Gilead's HIV drug, bictegravir, had a narrowly better response than GlaxoSmithKline's.The phase 2 trial examined combinations of bictegravir and FTC/TAF (emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), and Glaxo's dolutegravir plus FTC/TAF. FTC/TAF is Gilead's ""backbone"" combo in treatment-naive HIV patients, explained RBC analyst Michael Yee.On efficacy, 97% of patients in the bictegravir arm achieved the endpoint of HIV-1 RNA levels below 50 copies per milliliter at week 24. That compares with 94% of patients in the dolutegravir arm. The delta widened at week 48 with 97% and 91%, respectively, hitting the endpoint.Safety appears to be good, Yee wrote in a research report. One patient dropped out after week 24 due to urticaria (hives). Evercore analyst Mark Schoenebaum noted that the bictegravir combo appears to have a better safety profile.IBD'S TAKE: Gilead's hepatitis C unit has suffered as cure rates soar. Now, the No. 3 biotech is looking to pivot to potentially strong HIV drug sales. Could Gilead's hep C decline have been predicted? As it turns out, yes. Head to IBD'S Industry Themes for the clues that signaled the hep C crumble.Gilead has since moved the combination into four phase-three trials. Though Gilead's phase two results weren't strong enough to establish statistical superiority of bictegravir over dolutegravir, they were enough to explain Gilead's ""rush into expanded trials,"" Porges wrote in a research note.But ""investors are likely to remain cautious about the threat posed by Glaxo's dolutegravir-rilpivirine doublet program, which showed almost equally impressive results in two large phase 3 switching trials,"" he said.Also late Monday, Glaxo announced the results of phase three of its switching trial looking at a combination of dolutegravir and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) rilpivirine, which is marketed under the name Edurant.The combo achieved non-inferior viral suppression (HIV-1 RNA less than 50 copies per milliliter) by 48 weeks. Unlike Gilead's trial, GSK looked at patients who had already received treatment. The median prior treatment period for patients was four years.Glaxo's doublet of dolutegravir and rilpivirine is expected to be on the market by 2018, analysts for RBC and Leerink said. RBC's Yee notes that GSK could put pressure on Gilead by pricing its doublet at $17,000-$20,000 vs. other regimens at $30,000.But Glaxo's success will ultimately require persuading patients to switch from their three- or four-drug HIV regimens, Leerink's Porges said. GSK will most likely have to appeal to patients who have had adverse reactions or long-standing exposure to first-generation drugs.Most patients are likely to be switching from Gilead combinations anyway, meaning Gilead will likely recapture most of its share, Porges said.""We also consider the two drug approach to be an inherently more restricted proposition, given higher risks of resistance, and for that reason anticipate a relatively small share of the market being candidates for the doublet,"" he wrote.But in the stock market today, Gilead stock slipped a fraction to 67.55, while GlaxoSmithKline edged up 0.3% to 40.11. On Friday, Gilead stock touched its lowest price since April 2014, at 65.43.RELATED:Gilead Crashes On Hep C Sales Decline, 2017 Views; Q4, 2016 Metrics TopCan Gilead Swivel To HIV Amid Floundering Hep C Sales, GSK Rivalry?Gilead Stock Dives To 22-Month Low As Hep C Cure Drains Total Sales

254,JNJ,"The medical industry has a lot to prove in the upcoming Q1 earnings season, as the last round of earnings and guidance didn't do much to reassure investors who were already nervous for other reasons. However, some major stocks in the sector have been hitting new highs lately, especially on the hardware side of the group. Here are three such companies reporting earnings this week:• Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) takes its traditional place at the head of the line as it reports its earnings early Tuesday, the first of the big drug companies to report in this cycle. Its growth is expected to be modest, due to both its gigantic size and the foreign-exchange headwinds that have been dragging on global companies' earnings this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters estimate that Q1 revenue rose 0.7% over the year-earlier quarter to $17.5 billion. Earnings are estimated at $1.66 a share, up 6%.Despite its muted growth, Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high of 110.40 in trading Friday (closing the day at 110.18, up a fraction), and has maintained an IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 80s for the last six weeks.The mood on Wall Street going into the quarter seems bullish. Late Thursday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro raised his estimates based on his reading of drug-prescription and foreign-exchange trends.""IMS (IMS) script trends for several key drugs suggest another strong pharma quarter in 1Q (+9% year-over-year ex-FX and Olysio),"" Novarro wrote. (Olysio is a hepatitis C treatment.) ""Additionally, our analysis of currency movements since the beginning of the year suggests the negative FX impact on full-year results should be less than initially expected.""Novarro noted that one likely topic of conversation on the conference call will be this month's FDA approval of Pfizer’s (PFE) Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J's blockbuster immunology drug Remicade.• Robotic-surgery specialist Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is due to report after the close Tuesday. Analysts estimate that its Q1 earnings rose 21% over last year's Q1 to $4.33 a share, with sales up 11.5% to $593 million.Intuitive Surgical has also been a top-performing stock lately, as the company has been making a comeback financially with the rollout of its da Vinci Xi surgical system and improving procedure growth. Intuitive Surgical stock hit a new high of 630.67 on Wednesday, up more than 15% this year, and boasts an excellent IBD Composite Rating of 98. It closed Friday at 624.22.""Heading into 1Q, the key question for investors is whether the stock is baking in too much optimism or is this the start of a new product cycle,"" Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar wrote in an email to clients Friday. ""We expect procedure volumes to be healthy, with growth in general surgery leading the way (extra day from leap year should also help).""• Similar concerns about an over-optimistic market seem to be dogging orthopedics giant Stryker (SYK), which is due to report after the close Wednesday. The stock has also been on a roll, on Wednesday hitting a new high of 110.40 that was 19% above where it wound up last year. Shares closed Friday at 109.80.Stryker stock kept climbing last week even though Robert W. Baird downgraded it to neutral and Barclays resumed coverage at underweight. The latter wrote that Stryker's valuation appears to be full going into its Q1 and that it's facing more competition from a rejuvenated Zimmer Biomet (ZBH).Analysts covering Stryker estimate that sales rose 3.9% in the quarter to $2.47 billion, with earnings up 8% to $1.20 a share.

255,JNJ,"Drug stocks have long been favored by income investors for their relatively steady dividend payouts.Merck (MRK) currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.46 a share, or $1.84 for the full year, which works out to an annualized yield of nearly 3.3%. That's well above the 2.1% average payout of the S&P 500. The New Jersey-based company has paid a dividend every quarter since 1970. Its long-term dividend growth rate is 3%.The drug giant on Thursday announced positive results from a comparative trial of its Zepatier hepatitis C drug to Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Sovaldi. And on Wednesday, Merck said the FDA accepted for review its supplement Biologics License Application for Keytruda to treat patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer. It also said the FDA granted a priority review on Aug. 9.Merck's full-year profit grew 3% last year, its best in four years. Analysts expect a 4% gain this year and 2% the next. Shares are working on the right side of a 10-month consolidation and are 9% off their 52-week high.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), whose products include blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and prostate-cancer drug Zytiga, offers a 2.7% annualized yield. Analysts forecast Q1 EPS to rise 6% to $1.65 a share on 1% higher sales to $17.5 billion when J&J reports Tuesday before the open. The stock is near the top of a buy range from a 104.88 cup-with-handle buy point cleared Feb. 25.Amgen (AMGN), known for drugs such as Neupogen and Epogen, pays an annual dividend of 2.5%. It has a three-year earnings growth rate of 17%. Analysts expect a 4% increase this year and 12% the next. Shares of the biotech are nearing a 165.33 buy point of a cup-shaped base.Neither Amgen nor Johnson & Johnson show up in Dividend Leaders in Friday's IBD, due to space limitations. 
"
256,JNJ,"If there was any doubt that the osteoarthritis treatments offered by Anika Therapeutics (ANIK) are gaining traction, take a look at this week's earnings results from the Massachusetts-based biotech.First-quarter net income was 45 cents a share, up a whopping 96% from 23 cents a year ago and trouncing views of 28 cents from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Total revenue for the quarter grew 44% to $22.3 million, which also soundly beat analyst views, predicted at $19.3 million.Clearly, patients are seeking the injectable therapies that Anika offers -- known as hyaluronic acid viscosupplementation products -- even though some surgeons have raised questions about their effectiveness.""Surgeons get paid more to do a surgery than to do an injection,"" Joe Munda, analyst with First Analyst Securities Corp., told IBD. ""But you’re starting to see that rhetoric (about the efficacy of hyaluronic injections) cool.""Anika's treatments help both the active, aging baby boomer that suffers from osteoarthritis in the knee, as well as the overweight couch potato. They're designed to not only ease varying stages of pain, but also stave off expensive knee surgeries or replacements.The worldwide market for hyaluronic treatments is roughly $2 billion, says Anika Chief Executive Charles Sherwood. He adds it’s ""growing 5% to 8% per year.""Some private payers had stepped away from covering hyaluronic treatments. In 2013, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons revised its clinical practice guideline for treating knee arthritis. It said the medication was ""no longer recommended"" as a method of treatment for patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.But then some reinstituted reimbursement, Sherwood said in an interview with IBD, while other medical practitioners embraced hyaluronic therapy.""While studies of (hyaluronic) injections have occasionally yielded disappointing results, many doctors who treat osteoarthritis say that the weight of scientific evidence -- and their own clinical experience -- suggests that a shot in the knee (of hyaluronic) can produce significant relief for some patients,"" The Arthritis Foundation says in an article on its website.This past January, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine said it ""recommends the use of (hyaluronic) for appropriate patients with knee osteoarthritis."" It also said there are ""multiple trials indicating high-quality evidence"" that demonstrate the benefit of the therapy.""Anika is taking market share in the viscosupplementation market,"" Mike Petusky, an analyst with Barrington Research, told IBD. He rates the company’s stock ""outperform.""""We like the fundamentals of the company,"" Munda said, though he added he currently has an equal weight or market perform rating on the stock. ""We feel like the stock has moved very far, very fast.""Anika’s two hyaluronic products are Orthovisc and Monovisc -- its multi-injection and single-injection treatments for osteoarthritis. Anika’s competitors include French drug giant Sanofi (SNY), Italy's Fidia Farmaceutici S.p.a., Ferring Pharmaceuticals and Seikagaku Corp. of Tokyo.Carbylan Therapeutics (CBYL) of Palo Alto, Calif., was developing a hyaluronic injectable product, but it announced on April 15 that it has suspended further development of the product. It said it is ""actively pursuing a strategic transaction, including a merger or acquisition of the company.""Other competition could come from plasma and stem cell therapies, but Sherwood says those have yet to be proven effective.Anika also sells hyaluronic-based products for wound care. And it markets a filler for skin smoothing. But its development efforts are focused on using its proprietary formula in additional joints for pain and lubrication, and for regeneration therapies.“They’re not standing still; they’re continuing to innovate,” said Munda.It’s latest injectable, Cingal, is already approved for use in Canada and Europe.""It’s a single-shot injectable of viscosupplementation (or hyaluronic), but it also includes a corticosteroid to provide faster pain relief,"" said Sherwood. Anika has already run a Cingal trial in the U.S., which Sherwood said was ""highly successful.""""Approval (in the U.S.) is not a question of if, but when,"" Sherwood said on this week's earnings call with analysts. He noted Cingal is a combination of two already approved therapies.It’s just beginning an international clinical trial of Hyalofast, a cartilage regeneration therapy. Sherwood calls it a ""scaffold"" that’s made out of hyaluronic acid and is then soaked in stem cells. It entraps the cells to treat lesions in cartilage and regrow cartilage.U.S. trials, which are just starting, focus on the knee joint. So it will be a couple of years before a product makes it to market. European regulators move more quickly.""We’ve had European approval for Hyalofast for six or seven years, and it’s being used in knees and ankles, and a little in the hip,"" said Sherwood.With help from a partner, Anika also is pursuing approval in the U.S. for clinicians to use Monovisc, it’s single-shot hyaluronic injectable, to treat osteoarthritis in hips. DePuy Mitek, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the exclusive right to distribute Monovisc and Orthovisc in the U.S.""Johnson & Johnson is investing in the U.S. trial for using Monovisc in the hip,"" said Sherwood. ""We’re right at the beginning of that trial.""On the earnings call, Sherwood mentioned two new areas of exploration and development that would be further out. First, it wants to expand the use of hyaluronic injectables in the U.S. for use in rotator cuffs (shoulders), elbows (tennis elbow) and Achilles tendons. And it is also investigating developing ""synthetic bone graft"" therapies for ankles, knees and feet.He also said Anika is actively looking for acquisitions.""There are interesting targets out there, and we’re actively looking for the right fit,"" Sherwood said.

257,JNJ,"Pfizer (PFE) stock popped Thursday on a report the drugmaker is considering selling its consumer care business for $14 billion, less than two months after the firm opted against a long-rumored corporate breakup.Evercore analyst John Scotti expects the potential transaction to garner 7 cents earnings per share in 2018, at the midpoint of the forecast, assuming after-tax proceeds of the sale are used for share buybacks.The potential sale makes sense, Scotti wrote in a research report Thursday, as Pfizer reassesses its future. Pfizer walked away from a $160 billion merger with Ireland-based Allergan (AGN) in April, after lawmakers looked to crack down on tax-inversion deals, where U.S. companies were setting up their headquarters in lower-tax regions such as Ireland. Pfizer also had long mulled a corporate breakup, splitting up its innovative and essential health divisions, but scrapped that idea in September.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) bought Pfizer's then consumer care business in 2006. Pfizer built that unit back up with its 2009 acquisition of Wyeth. Later, Pfizer sold its nutrition business to Nestle and spun off its animal health business, Zoetis (ZTS).""Thus, the sale of the current portfolio of consumer products appears to be a logical next step that will allow Pfizer to focus on its core competency — developing and selling innovative drugs,"" Scotti wrote.IBD'S TAKE: How will Trump's presidency affect drug and biotech stocks? Get the full skinny on IBD's Industry Themes.Reuters first reported the potential customer care sale late Wednesday, citing anonymous sources. The unit pulls in $3.5 billion in sales annually. Scotti likened it to Bayer's $14.2 billion acquisition of Merck's (MRK) consumer care business, a $2 billion annual unit.On the stock market today, Pfizer stock climbed 4.3% to 33.49, above its 50-day line, ramping for a second consecutive day following the election of President-elect Donald Trump. Shares rose 7.1% on Wednesday.Drug and biotech stocks have rebounded on Trump's election. Trump is seen as less likely to challenge drug prices vs. Democrat Hillary Clinton, who unveiled a plan last year to cut the spiraling price tags on drugs.Trump, though, has promised to tackle the Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare), which investment bank RBC said Tuesday could cause a dip in biotech stocks on the uncertainty of new, not-yet-outlined national health care.Editor's Note: Corrects fourth graph to show Zoetis was a spinoff.RELATED:Pfizer Will Likely Overpay For M&A Post Allergan Breakup-Flop: JeffriesUnexpected Twist: Pfizer Scraps Breakup Following Dead Allergan Merger

259,JNJ,"Alkermes (ALKS) and Lundbeck are cannibalizing Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) anti-psychosis sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday, citing Johnson & Johnson's slower-than-expected Q3 schizophrenia drug sales.Last Tuesday, Johnson & Johnson reported 12.1% year-over-year growth for its three drugs to treat schizophrenia, Divan wrote in a research report. But growth for Invega Sustenna, Invega Trinza and Risperdol Consta lagged Divan's model for 14% growth.Total prescriptions show Invega Sustenna has half the depot injection market, but Denmark-based Lundbeck's Abilify Maintena and Alkermes' Aristada are swiping share from Johnson & Johnson's Risperdol Consta, Divan says. Abilify Maintena is co-commercialized with Otuska America Pharmaceutical, which holds the new drug application for Abilify.""We believe this is positive for Lundbeck as Abilify Maintena is one of its key growth drivers,"" he wrote. ""We currently estimate about $2 billion peak sales for Abilify Maintena.""IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson stock has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it underperforms more than half of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics.

Acacia Communications (ACIA) plunged nearly 12% in big volume. Its biggest customer, Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE, reported Q3 revenue below estimates.Acacia was the hottest stock in the hot fiber-optics industry in August, but since it broke below the 50-day moving average Oct. 10, the stock has been sinking.

261,JNJ,"XThe Dow Jones industrial average and the rest of the stock market gnawed at sharp early morning losses and small-cap names fought to get within arm's length of the breakeven point in late-afternoon trading Tuesday, an indication that investors are still hopeful for a strong Q1 reporting season.Stocks got pounded across the board and bond investors fled deeper into the forest of U.S. Treasuries after Goldman Sachs (GS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) shocked Wall Street with weaker-than-expected quarterly numbers. Yet the Dow Jones industrial average trimmed an early loss, of nearly 0.8%, down to 0.5% with roughly an hour left in the stock market session.The Nasdaq edged 0.2% lower. The S&P 500 was off 0.3%, while the small-cap S&P 600 was practically flat at 824.79. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was at 2.17%, down 9 basis points.Volume is sharply higher on both main exchanges vs. the same time Monday.Both Goldman, which reported weak revenue from fixed income and commodities trading, and Johnson & Johnson (hurt by lackluster consumer product and growth of ethical drug revenue), are down 3% to 4% in heavy turnover. The latter megacap name clipped its key 50-day moving average in heavy volume for the first time since early January.In February 2016, the Dow Jones 30 component had rallied out of a serpent-long saucer with handle at 105.59 and gained 19.4%, almost triggering IBD's key sell rule — of taking at least partial profits when a stock has gained 20% to 25% past a proper buy point, in a well-formed base pattern.On the upside, some newer IPOs fared nicely. New bull markets need dynamic new companies to attract large institutions that need to deploy capital into future growth stories of the economy.Jeld-Wen (JELD) rose for a third straight session, up 0.8% to 32.12.

262,JNJ,"Drug stocks toppled to a five-month low Tuesday after Dow component Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) reported first-quarter pharma sales that only advanced 0.8%, offering a weak harbinger for the sector.In late afternoon trading on the stock market today, IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group was down a fraction after earlier losing as much as 1.4%, touching a low not seen since November.Biotech stocks were less injured, but were still down 1.2% after collectively losing as much as 1.8% after J&J reported light first-quarter sales, despite a 6-cent beat on the bottom line.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says J&J's results highlight ""multiple Q1 issues for large biotechs."" Worldwide pharma sales of $8.25 billion grew just 1% vs. the year-earlier quarter and missed expectations by 1%.International drug sales beat by 2%, but U.S. pharma sales missed by 5%, Porges wrote in a research report. Oncology sales led growth while legacy products — Remicade, Stelara and Xarelto — offset volume declines or low growth with price hikes.Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), AbbVie (ABBV) and Celgene (CELG) — which derive a large portion of sales from international markets — should benefit if J&J's worldwide pharma growth is reflected across the sector. Porges has an outperform rating on Alexion stock and market perform ratings on AbbVie and Celgene stocks.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Ethical Drugs industry group is now ranked No. 161 out of 197 groups tracked, up from No. 182 just 13 weeks ago. But the biotech industry group is performing much better, ranked seventh this week. Head to IBD Stock Checkup for a list of the strongest stocks.But higher utilization of independent patient assistance programs, timing of Medicare Part D costs and higher drug access discounts will leave Celgene and Amgen (AMGN) vulnerable among biotechs, Porges said, citing commentary by J&J. He has a market perform rating on Amgen stock.""While pricing power appears to remain strong, J&J did report that lower prices in government managed care channels impacted annual comparisons,"" he wrote. ""We do not anticipate that these issues will be isolated to J&J alone, but should impact the broader biopharma industry.""For drugmakers, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat noted J&J's struggle in its diabetes unit — Invokana sales were down 17% year over year — could be reflected in Eli Lilly's (LLY) diabetes franchise. Though Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez earlier said the unit could help Lilly overcome struggles with its rheumatoid arthritis drug.Raffat noted pricing pressure for cardiovascular drug Xarelto could be reflected in Bristol-Myers Squibb's (BMY) Eliquis. Xarelto sales fell 9.5% vs. the year-earlier period.As a silver lining, J&J reported 56.7% year-over-year growth for Imbruvica, a cancer drug in partnership with AbbVie. The companies are now looking to have Imbruvica approved to treat patients suffering from graft-versus-host disease — which can occur when foreign tissue is introduced into the body via organ transplants.RELATED:Dow's Johnson & Johnson Sets Up Lackluster Results For SectorCan Lilly Survive Rheumatoid Arthritis Flop With Breast Cancer Drug?

265,JNJ,"XHere's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day.

"
266,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) are medtech stocks to own going into earnings season, but several others could be put on buy lists on pullbacks, an analyst says.RBC analyst Glenn Novarro said Wednesday that among large-cap medtech stocks, Johnson and Zimmer offer the best risk/reward into the first-quarter earnings season. Zimmer is the cheapest in its arena and Johnson has lagged the group.""While investor sentiment has turned more favorable for Johnson in recent weeks, we anticipate further multiple expansion on the back of strong first-quarter results, and consensus estimates moving higher throughout the year,"" he wrote in a research report.The consensus of analysts polled by Yahoo (YHOO) broadly expects Johnson to report $18.01 billion in sales, up 3% year over year, and $1.76 a share in adjusted earnings, dipping 1.7%.Johnson is also on the cusp of closing its acquisition of Actelion Pharmaceuticals in the second quarter. It and Sanofi (SNY) were locked in a battle late last year to take over the Swiss biotech. Johnson's $30 billion bid won it the company.For Zimmer, the company ""just has to hit consensus estimates for the stock to move higher,"" Novarro said. The consensus models 3% year-over-year sales growth to $1.96 billion and $2.11 adjusted earnings per share, up 4.5%.Novarro, however, says Abbott Laboratories (ABT), Boston Scientific (BSX), Edwards Lifesciences (EW) and Stryker (SYK) may be attractive on pullbacks. He sees all delivering solid results and reaffirming 2017 guidance. Investors will likely track ongoing litigation for Abbott with Alere (ALR), and heart-valve replacement sales for Edwards.Boston likely will comment on its voluntary recall of its Lotus heart-valve replacement. The company recalled the Lotus device after discovering a malfunction that resulted in the premature release of a pin during implantation.""Medtronic's (MDT) Onyx stent launch represents near-term challenges"" for Boston, but ""we still want to own Boston for 2018,"" Novarro said.In the small- and midsize-cap world, Novarro recommends NuVasive (NUVA), Wright Medical Group (WMGI) and K2M Group (KTWO). The potential for a takeout is likely baked into the stock prices for NuVasive and Wright, he said.IBD'S TAKE: This isn't the first time Edwards has been listed as a best ""stock to own."" Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive on why Edwards is holding strong.K2M remains his top pick in the small-and-midsize medtech group.""We expect K2M to play catch-up to the group as investor focus shifts to the company's impressive new product lineup and improving international sales growth after the company experienced some distributor issues in 2016,"" he wrote.Like Novarro, Needham analyst Mike Matson also prefers K2M and Zimmer, but also has strong buy ratings on shares of Inogen (INGN) and MiMedx (MDXG). He sees the cardiovascular and orthopedic markets as slowing while the diagnostic market improved in the quarter.Matson models cardiovascular market growth as decelerating to 6.3% from 7.3% in the fourth quarter, and the orthopedic market advancing by 3.5%, vs. 4% growth in the prior quarter. In diagnostics, sales likely grew 3.6% from 2.1%, he said.But there were some standouts, Matson said. He models the transcatheter aortic valve-replacement market — where Boston, Edwards and Medtronic operate — as having grown 23%. In orthopedics, Matson models 9% growth for the extremities market.RELATED:Medtronic Does Heart-Valve Study And Rivals Reap The BenefitsBoston Scientific Makes Acquisition To Battle Medtronic, Edwards

267,JNJ,"Cancer biotech Tesaro (TSRO) could fetch north of $200 per share in a rumored takeover, Credit Suisse and Leerink analysts suggested this week, as Tesaro stock bounded to record highs Wednesday and Thursday.But on Friday, Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez recommended Tesaro buyers hang out on the sidelines amid the potential M&A flurry. He downgraded Tesaro stock to a market perform rating from outperform, though he upped his price target to 186 from 152.In the stock market today, Tesaro stock fell 2.6% to 182.02, after touching a record high of 192 intraday Thursday.Tesaro stock jumped 167% in 2016, and has increased fivefold over the past eight months. Investors clearly value Tesaro's niraparib as the leading PARP inhibitor, Fernandez said. Tesaro's drug competes against FDA-approved drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS).""Barring a takeout, upside from current levels looks challenging given the competitive event path over the (next six) to 12 months,"" he wrote in a research note, ""although preclinical evidence suggests that niraparib may have better activity than AstraZeneca's Lynparza and Clovis' Rubraca.""IBD'S TAKE: Among biotechs, Incyte is a steady bet, analysts say. With a pipeline of potential blockbusters, Incyte could generate $2.5 billion to $3 billion in peak sales on its Jakafi alone. Dive into The New America for more on Incyte's catalysts.Niraparib is under priority review by the Food and Drug Administration to treat ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancers. Key trials are also being conducted in first-line and second-line breast and prostate cancer.Success in those trials could boost Tesaro's valuation as an M&A target, Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young said Thursday. She estimates $1 billion in unadjusted sales in 2020 and $4.3 billion in 2025 across ovarian and all indicated therapies. That's up from very little. The company, which made its IPO in 2012, has just started to generate revenue. It's expected to have ended 2016 with revenue of about $53 million. It hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings release.Young sees Tesaro grabbing a third of the first-line metastatic breast cancer market in patients with the BRCA mutation, and grabbing $500 million in the prostate cancer market in a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Fernandez views $1.6 billion in total 2021 sales, though others are more bullish with projections of $2.2 billion assuming ""dominance across the key registrational trials currently underway or completed in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer."" A takeover could top $220 per share, he said.All that is without taking into account Tesaro's immuno-oncology pipeline. It is currently testing checkpoint inhibitors include PD-1, LAG-3 and TIM-3. These drugs work by teaching the immune system to see, and destroy, cancer cells that often hide behind normal-looking proteins.Credit Suisse' Young puts a $2.5 billion sales estimate on Tesaro's I-O platform. Assuming success in niraparib across breast, ovarian and prostate cancers could mean a $169-$210 per share takeover price. That would jump to $197-$243 per share with I-O success, she said.""We wouldn't expect Tesaro to agree to a takeout without credit to this platform, which is our thesis over 2017 as well,"" she wrote in a research report.Young kept her outperform rating and 151 price target on Tesaro stock. News of Tesaro's potential acquisition interest wasn't a surprise, she said.""We ... think that an auction process for this company will be highly competitive, with most of the big global biotech and pharma companies coming to the table to talk,"" she said.RELATED:Tesaro Rockets To All-Time High On Rumored Takeout InterestTesaro, AstraZeneca Could Shrink Clovis' Ovarian Cancer Drug PoolBiotech Stocks Might Catalyze, Or Plunge, On 4 Key Sectors In 2017

270,JNJ,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10..... Watch for Brinker (EAT), Comerica (CMA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Harley Davidson (HDI), Kansas City Southern (KSU),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Take Good Care

272,JNJ,"So yesterday at about 3 pm EST the news hit the tape, the twitter sphere and the media outlets.....Headlines screamed:***BREAKING NEWS – SUNDAY APRIL 17, 2016 - ***Failure In Qatar - OPEC ministers unable to come to an agreement - oil mkts began to tremble - investors/traders now had to re-assess the reality of a fractured oil mkt......Oil which has rallied 18% from the early April lows and 30% off of the January lows and are now front and center as Asian mkts prepared to open - initial reactions saw oil plunge 6% as investors hit the sell button first only to ask questions later.....the headlines saturated the web.....who would be first to announce this failure and then the resulting mkt action? The headlines began...""Doha Summit Fails to Agree on Output Freeze""""Oil Freeze Talks End in Failure Amid Saud Demands Over Iran""""Oil Tumbles 5% on Doha Deal Disappointment""""Asia Stocks at Mercy of Post Doha Oil Moves""""Oil's Grand Bargain Falls Victim to Saudi Arabia's Iran Fixation""Futures around the globe plunged as day turned to night and the sun began to set in the US just as it began to rise across Asia….US futures were down 11 pts at 8 pm Sunday evening – while futures across Asia pointed in a similar direction as investors dealt with the fallout. News stories began detailing the talks that took place in Doha – the Qatari capital – which dragged on and on – going some 10 hrs past the original scheduled end time – as ""Howie Mandel"" shouted out –No Deal!Oil ministers from 16 nations, representing 50% of the world's production, gathered in the Qatari capital as they worked towards stabilizing the global mkt with artificial production quotas - the first real attempt at coordinating output among OPEC members and nations outside of the group since 2001. The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market. With Saudi Arabia fighting proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Syria/Iraq, it is understandable that they had little inclination to freeze their own production and make way for newly sanctions-free Iran to increase their market share.""So then what happened? Was there really a change in tone from the Saudi's? Did investors get this all wrong? Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

274,JNJ,"Each of the so-called FANG stocks – Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) – are baring their teeth as they move aggressively to expand market share in their core industries and enter new ones.But which of these tech titans is having the most success in generating continued growth?3-Year Sales GrowthDriven by Mark Zuckerberg’s successful pivot to mobile right as mobile advertising started to skyrocket, Facebook leads the pack in this metric, with a three-year annual sales growth rate of 54%. That’s followed by Netflix (24%), Amazon (22%) and Alphabet (14%).It’s worth noting here that CEO Jeff Bezos said growth in its Amazon Web Services cloud unit is outpacing its e-commerce business and could reach $10 billion in sales this year.3-Year EPS GrowthNetflix edges out Facebook for the top spot in this category with a 75% three-year annual earnings-per-share growth rate, compared to the social media giant’s 71% pace. Alphabet ranks a distant third with a 13% rate.Pre-Tax Profit MarginFacebook (55.6%) and Alphabet (33.1%) dominate the FANG family in terms of annual pre-tax profit margins, with Netflix (2.1%) and Amazon (1.5%) trailing far behind.That high level of profitability is what allows Facebook to make multi-billion dollar bets on Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus VR – as well as invest heavily in mobile advertising and new apps like Facebook Messenger.It also allows Google-parent Alphabet to explore its so-called ‘moon shot’ projects, including Verb Surgical, a joint venture between its Verily unit and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop advanced surgical robotics to compete with Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).Q4 Earnings And Sales GrowthAmazon bounced back with drones-a-blazing in Q4 to deliver a 122% gain in earnings, easily topping Facebook (46%), Alphabet (28%) and Netflix (-30%).On the sales side, Facebook defanged the competition with a 52% increase year-over-year. But Netflix (23%), Amazon (22%) and Alphabet (18%) each posted solid gains.Accumulation/Distribution RatingThe Accumulation/Distribution Rating shows if fund managers and other institutional investors have been heavily buying or selling a stock over the trailing 13 weeks.Netflix, with a B- rating that shows moderate institutional buying, is the only FANG stock that currently gets a passing grade. Facebook and Amazon both have the lowest-possible rating of E, which points to heavy selling over the last three months (i.e., 13 weeks). Alphabet is only a little better – and still gets a failing grade -- with its D+ rating.Composite RatingThe Composite Rating ranges from 1 (worst) to 99 (best) and provides an overall grade for each stock, showing how it stacks up in terms of both technical and fundamental strength against all other stocks on the market.Facebook and Alphabet both earning the highest-possible score of 99, meaning they’re outperforming 99% of other stocks. Amazon’s rating has been moving higher and now stands at 81. Netflix has a decidedly mediocre score of 52.Among Top 5 Stocks In Its Industry Group?IBD Stock Checkup shows the five top-rated stocks within each industry group. Among the FANG stocks, only Facebook (No. 1) and Alphabet (No. 2), both members of the Internet – Content group, earn that distinction.Amazon ranks No. 7 within its Retail – Internet group, with Stamps.com (STMP) and Alibaba (BABA) holding the No. 1 and No. 2 spots, respectively.Netflix comes in at No. 11 among its peers in the Leisure – Movies & Related industry group.Excerpt from IBD Extra Newsletter.Image provided by Shutterstock.

The CAC 40 in Paris and Frankfurt's DAX each traded down more than 2%, and the FTSE 100 in London showed a 1.4% loss in afternoon trading.U.S. markets will receive a dose of service sector data later this morning, when London-based researcher Markit releases its March service purchasing managers index at 9:45 a.m. ET.  At 10 a.m., the Institute for Supply Management delivers its March nonmanufacturing index and the Labor Department reports its  Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey for February.One early report showed the U.S. trade gap widened slightly in February, to $47.1 billion from an upwardly revised $45.9 billion in January, the Commerce Department reported.

276,JNJ,"The vast majority of billionaire Warren Buffett’s portfolio is invested in dividend-paying stocks with a long history of dividend increases.No surprise, then, that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a current holding, with 53 consecutive years of dividend increases.Last month, J&J declared a quarterly dividend of 75 cents share, giving it an annualized yield of around 3%. The next dividend is payable March 8 to shareholders of record as of next Tuesday.With a market capitalization of around $288 billion, J&J has a lot of different tentacles in the healthcare space. It’s a consumer health care company as well as a pharmaceutical and medical device firm.Popular consumer brands at its consumer segment include Neutrogena, Listerine, Tylenol and Visine.Meanwhile, the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of J&J are involved in oncology, immunology, neuroscience and infectious diseases, among other fields, with several products in late-stage trials.

277,JNJ,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59.

281,JNJ,"Amgen (AMGN) stock toppled in after-hours trading Wednesday after reporting first-quarter sales that missed by $100 million on increased competition for two key drugs in its arsenal — immunosuppressant Enbrel and bone marrow stimulant Neupogen.The biotech giant said sales of Enbrel and Neupogen fell 15% and 31%, respectively. Meanwhile, sales of anemia drug Epogen fell 10% due to declines in net selling price.But higher demand helped sales spike for several drugs including Repatha, Amgen's ""bad"" LDL cholesterol-buster. Repatha sales popped 206% year over year to $49 million worldwide despite competition from the likes of Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).For the quarter ended March 31, Amgen reported adjusted profit of $3.15 a share, up 9% vs. the year-earlier quarter and topping the consensus for $3. Sales dipped 1% to $5.5 billion and missed analysts' views for $5.6 billion.In after-hours trading Amgen stock was down 3.3%, after closing down a fraction, at 164.61, during the regular session.

See IBD's Technology page for how J&J's ""multiple issues"" could be a bleak harbinger for the sector.During the quarter, Amgen unveiled the results of a trial lasting more than two years, dubbed Fourier, of patients taking cholesterol-lowering medicine. Reducing ""bad"" LDL cholesterol in the blood led to a decrease in the risk of heart attacks and strokes, Amgen found.But analysts have said Amgen is facing some pushback from payers who don't want to reimburse the wholesale acquisition cost of $14,523 for Repatha. Regeneron, Sanofi and Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) are working in the same area.He added: ""With robust Repatha outcomes data, we are working with payers to improve access to this important therapy for patients at risk for heart attacks and strokes.""Key spikes in the quarter included sales of bone drugs Prolia and Xgeva, up a respective 21% and 6%. Revenue from multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis grew 23%. Blincyto, a second-line treatment for a chromosomal disorder and leukemia, saw sales grow 26%.Amgen boosted its guidance for 2017 adjusted profits to $12-$12.60 a share, but that lagged the consensus for $12.94. On a year-over-year basis, adjusted profits would be up 5.6% at the midpoint of guidance. Sales guidance for $22.3 billion to $23.1 billion was reiterated.RELATED:Will Amgen's Rivals Pop On Its Cholesterol-Busting Drug?

285,JNJ,"Dow Jones industrial average component UnitedHealth Group (UNH) trounced first-quarter earnings estimates, reporting a profit of $2.37 a share, up 31% from a year ago and 20 cents of ahead analyst expectations.Shares of the nation's top health insurer rose 0.8% to 168.59 on the stock market today. UnitedHealth rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Monday, after finding support at that key level in recent weeks.UnitedHealth's Q1 revenue grew 9.4% to $48.7 billion, topping estimates of $48.27 billion.

Previously, UnitedHealth projected revenue of $197 billion-$199 billion and adjusted EPS of $9.30-$9.60.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of UnitedHealth cleared a 10-week consolidation zone around 164 on only slightly above-average volume on Feb. 27. After weakening with the broader market, shares were closing in on their all-time high of 172.14 set on March 15. While the stock isn't over-extended, buyers should exercise extra caution and be quick to cut losses when the stock market uptrend is under pressure, as it is currently. Read IBD's The Big Picture each day to stay on top of the market's trend.UnitedHealth noted that first-quarter revenues were reduced by $1.6 billion due to the company's 2017 withdrawal from most ObamaCare exchange markets and the suspension by Congress of the health insurance tax that insurers pass on in the form of higher premiums.

293,JNJ,"Big pharma AbbVie (ABBV) said Monday that it was acquiring rights to two immunology drugs developed by German counterpart Boehringer Ingelheim, but its stock was flat as Goldman Sachs warned of increasing competition.AbbVie agreed to pay $595 million upfront plus undisclosed milestone payments and royalties for the right to commercialize BI 655066, a drug in late-stage testing for psoriasis, and in earlier testing for Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis and asthma. A phase-two trial comparing BI 655066 head to head with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade found that after nine months of treatment, 69% of patients on Boehringer's drug had clear or almost clear skin, compared with 30% in the Remicade arm.AbbVie also acquired rights to BI 655064, an earlier-stage drug that attacks the CD40 protein, which may be connected to lupus nephritis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. AbbVie said in its press release that it will decide whether to go forward with that drug ""after completion of certain undisclosed clinical achievements.""AbbVie said that its success in developing and commercializing Humira, currently the world's top-selling immunology drug, gives it the expertise to do the same with Boehringer's products. Humira is nearing the end of its patent life, leading to much speculation on Wall Street about when biosimilar competitors might launch and how much of an impact they might have.Goldman Sachs analyst Salveen Richter took a pessimistic view of the matter Monday, saying that the current political focus on lowering drug prices will probably encourage cheap Humira knock-offs.""We are not changing our 2016-2020 AbbVie forecasts and continue to believe that Humira will remain a durable asset free of U.S. biosimilars, at least until the end of the decade,"" Richter wrote as he removed AbbVie stock from his Conviction Buy list and cut his price target to 68 from 80.  ""However, we adjust our terminal value growth rate (from +1% to 0%) and model a faster decline curve post introduction of Humira biosimilars in the U.S. after 2020 through 2025.""AbbVie stock fell as much as 2.4% in early trading on the stock market today, but by midday it was flat, near 56.Meanwhile, Richter put BioMarin Pharmaceuticals (BMRN) on his Conviction Buy list in AbbVie's place, setting his price target at 129.BioMarin, Richter noted, has guided that it will go into the black next year even without a contribution of its recently FDA-rejected muscular-dystrophy drug Kyndrisa, ""showing opex restraint and a commitment to profitability."" He added that several data releases this year could bring upside for medications including BioMarin's gene therapy for hemophilia and treatments for the rare diseases achondroplasia and phenylketonuria.BioMarin stock was up 2.5% midday Monday, near 89.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Inphi is extended after a breakout over a 28.54 double-bottom buy point, but for those who missed the initial breakout, 32.42 is also a legitimate entry.Inside the IBD 50, Five Below (FIVE) was a big winner, rising 7%.

296,JNJ,"Eli Lilly (LLY), Pfizer (PFE) and Gilead Sciences (GILD) are chipping away at AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira sales, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan said Monday after AbbVie missed Q3 expectations Friday, primarily on declining Humira sales.Divan downgraded AbbVie stock to neutral and cut his price target to 60 from 70. He models immunosuppressant Humira pulling in $18.1 billion in 2018 sales, declining to $11.3 billion and $5.2 billion in 2022 and 2025, respectively.Humira accounted for 63% of AbbVie sales in Q3. The drug is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and irritable bowel disorder — markets where branded rivals are already on the market and biosimilars are pressuring AbbVie's patent on Humira.AbbVie is working to protect that patent, but Divan expects Amgen (AMGN) and others to have biosimilars on the market by 2022.""Whether it is in 2020, 2021, 2022 or some other year, at some point Humira will start to decline,"" Divan wrote in his research report. To cope with Humira's decline (it missed Q3 expectations by $100 million), AbbVie has eight late-stage drugs capable of bringing in $25 billion to $30 billion in combined sales.IBD'S TAKE: AbbVie's earnings have grown an average 20% over the past five quarters, but have also declined for the last three periods. Get the full scoop in IBD's Income Investor.Pfizer, Eli Lilly/Incyte (INCY) and Gilead are all working on a class of drugs called JAK inhibitors that could compete in arthritis.Celgene (CELG), Novartis (NVS) and Eli Lilly have IL-17 and IL-23 inhibitors for psoriasis, and all three expected to become blockbuster drugs within five years of their launches.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) already has a JAK inhibitor and is in the IL-23 field.

Shares touched a seven-month low Friday after AbbVie reported its Q3 earnings, which fell 6.2%. In the stock market today, AbbVie stock fell 3.2% to 55.78.Goodman kept his buy rating and 73 price target on AbbVie stock, though the company's 2017 earnings guidance for 13%-15% growth in 2017 implied $4.43-$5.53, which was lower than Wall Street's $5.62 view.Still, Goodman wrote that ""based on management's commentary on Humira volume and pricing, we think the concerns appear overdone.

300,JNJ,"XDividend stocks have a reputation for cushioning the blow during market corrections and bear markets, and ETF investors have a reason to put them on the watchlist again.The stock market has traded in a sideways range since March 1, with the Dow and the S&P 500 falling under key chart levels last week.And on Thursday, the VIX, known as the ""Fear Index"", closed above its 40-week moving average for the first time since the November presidential election, ending the week up more than 24%.In fact, global banker and investment manager Goldman Sachs (GS) is warning clients that the market's going lower, and so the best investment strategy may be to buy stocks with rising profit margins.One of the simplest, most cost-efficient ways to access such stocks may be the dividend-growth exchange traded fund.Funds such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity (SCHD) invest in large, profitable companies that have paid or grown dividends for at least 10 years. The steady or rising payouts are a sign of the firms' financial strength.The Vanguard fund's quality tilt has helped it shine during market downturns, writes Morningstar analyst Katie Rushkewicz Reichart. It lost 27% in 2008 vs. 37% for the S&P 500, landing in ""the top decile of the large-blend Morningstar Category in the rocky market environments of 2008 and 2011,"" she added.The sound investment methods and extremely low expense ratios of the Vanguard and Schwab dividend equity ETFs should help them outperform in the long run. Lately, though, some smaller, newer and less well-known rivals are faring better.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) invests in dividend-paying stocks that score solidly on measures such as return on equity and prospective earnings growth. Such fundamental metrics tend ""to be associated with a greater potential for future dividend growth,"" according to WisdomTree — even if the companies don't have a history of paying or raising dividends.One example in the fund's portfolio is tech giant Apple (AAPL).The iPhone maker is a dividend leader in the United States, in terms of both total dividends and dividend growth. Yet it's missing from indexes that employ backward-looking dividend screens, including those tracked by Vanguard Dividend Appreciation and Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETFs.The WisdomTree dividend fund is well-diversified, holding 293 stocks, with no more than 6% of its assets in any one stock. Its top three holdings besides Apple include Dow heavyweights Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Microsoft (MSFT).Year to date through April 13, DGRW was up 5.8% vs. 4.7% for VIG and 1.9% for SCHD. It produced an average annual gain of 11.1% over the past three years vs. 8.7% for VIG and 9.9% for SCHD.In terms of 12-month yield, the Schwab ETF comes out on top. It yields 2.89% vs. yields just north of 2% for its WisdomTree and Vanguard peers.Compared with similar funds, WisdomTree's DGRW exhibits greater volatility, charges a higher expense fee, and has a limited track record, according to Morningstar.The same can be said for First Trust Rising Dividend Achievers (RDVY) — another outperformer in this segment, up 5.5% so far this year.

304,JNJ,"Barclays analyst Geoff Meacham on Thursday said he expected Gilead Sciences' (GILD) 2017 outlook to be hindered on limited hepatitis C sales. He also sees Merck (MRK) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) issuing sluggish views, though he is more bullish on Biogen (BIIB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).RBC Capital on Wednesday said much the same about Gilead, and also was more bullish on Biogen as well as on Amgen (AMGN).Hepatitis C drug prescriptions dipped 6%-7% quarter over quarter in Q4, according to market tracker IMS. Gilead makes Sovaldi and Harvoni to combat hepatitis C.Merck and Alexion, meanwhile, will guide to declining metrics on heavier spending and new management, respectively, Meacham predicted. ""Though we'd argue this is widely anticipated,"" Meacham said in a research report.He sees Biogen offering upside guidance on its Spinraza launch with Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS), and Johnson leveraging cost controls to offer a better 2017 view.IBD'S TAKE: As hepatitis C sales fall, where will Gilead go? Check out IBD's Industry Themes for the full scoop on how biotech's five biggest are expected to do in Q4.Ahead of the Q4 pharma earnings season, which starts next week with reports from companies such as J&J, Stryker (SYK) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), Meacham boosted his price target on Incyte (INCY) stock, noting that company's phase three tumor efforts with Merck. The duo are testing immunotherapy Keytruda and epacadostat in four tumors.Meacham expects Incyte, in its Q4 earnings conference call, to give some color on Jakafi trials in graft vs. host disease, as well as its tumor efforts with Merck. He bumped his price target on Incyte stock to 135 from 105. Incycte hasn't yet set a date for its Q4 earnings report.Incyte stock, which last week touched a 14-month high just shy of 119, rallied 2% to close at 117.53 in the stock market today.For Q4, the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expects Incyte to report $324.8 million in sales and 14 cents earnings per share, up a third and down 52%, respectively, vs. the year-earlier quarter.Merck's spending is likely ramping on Keytruda which was granted priority review last week in combination with Eli Lilly's (LLY) chemotherapy Alimta to treat non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with a high expression of the PDL1 gene.Keytruda-plus-Alimta is in phase three testing. If data are strong, Merck could open itself up to a larger patient population vs. the 25%-30% of patients with a 50%-plus PDL1 expression. Keytruda is already approved as a monotherapy in high-expressing PDL1 patients with NSCLC.RELATED:Merck, Biogen, Lilly Top 2016 Approvals Despite FDA SlumpTrump's 'Disastrous' Pharma View Doesn't Rattle JPMorgan Drug ConferenceWill Trump Break With Republicans And Push Major Drug Reform?

305,JNJ,"Roche (RHHBY) CEO Severin Schwan shrugged off President Trump's crackdown on drug prices Wednesday, saying the Swiss drugmaker expects to reap the benefits of ""literally billions"" invested in the market.""We focus on truly differentiated medicines — medicines which make a real difference for patients,"" he said, according to CNBC. ""I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be continued demand for such solutions, and particularly the U.S., I'm convinced, will reward this kind of innovation.""The U.S. market is important to Roche. In 2016, nearly half of Roche's pharmaceutical sales — 47% — stemmed from the U.S., and 26% of its diagnostics tools were sold in North America. But on Tuesday, Trump reaffirmed his pledge to go after rising drug prices.""We have to get lower prices,"" he told a slew of pharma bigwigs, including the CEOs of Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Merck (MRK) and Novartis (NVS). A Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) executive also was reportedly in attendance. There, President Trump promised to deregulate the drug industry and cut taxes.Trump also abandoned his proposal to revisit the idea of allowing the federal government to negotiate drug prices on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid, which cover millions of Americans and are among the largest purchasers of drugs and health care services in the world.IBD'S TAKE: Trump's commentary momentarily boosted drug stocks on Tuesday, but a day earlier the president's ban on immigration took a bite out of airline stocks. Read IBD's Industry Themes column for more on a safer entry point in the travel sector.Drug stocks rose 1.5% on Tuesday following reports of Trump's softened stance on Big Pharma. IBD's 43-company Ethical Drugs industry group edged up a small fraction on the stock market today. Roche stock rose 0.47% to 30.10, touching a nearly three-month high.Schwan's commentary came as Roche reported 5% growth in 2016 sales to $50.98 billion. The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $51.57 billion. Core earnings per share rose 8%.Revenue from breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis drugs helped outplay a dip in sales of drugs to treat hepatitis B and C, pancreatic and non-small-cell lung cancer, and wet age-related macular degeneration, an eye disease.The hep C sector has suffered recently, with sales dipping 6%-7% from the third to fourth quarters, according to market researcher IHS. Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) and J&J have been under pressure recently on their hep C units. J&J's hep C sales dipped to ""virtually nothing"" in the fourth quarter.Swiss Roche saw a similarly painful decline. Sales of hep C drug Lucentis, which is only sold in the U.S., fell 10% in 2016 to $1.42 million. Offsetting that, sales of breast cancer drug Perjeta and rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra rose 26% and 16%, respectively.Roche also listed seven new launches, including oncology drug Tecentriq. Tecentriq is approved for previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer and previously treated advanced cancer of the urinary tract.

The carmaker had earlier canceled plans to build a new plant in Mexico. While Trump criticized Ford during the campaign for making cars there, the company said canceling the plant was due to lack of demand for small cars.Others at the meeting included CEOs of Tesla Motors (TSLA), Under Armour (UA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Arconic (ARNC), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and U.S. Steel (X).

315,JNJ,"A month that saw the stock market go basically nowhere was not without its fair share of drama for ETF investors. As any respectable drama should, it held triumphs, surprises and disappointments.Among commodity ETFs, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) dumped 5.3% in the month ended Oct. 12 as a hawkish Federal Reserve spooked gold bugs.Among sector equity ETFs, VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) charged 4.4% higher as investors uncovered growth in a weak market. Nvidia (NVDA), a top five holding in SMH, set a record high in early October after revealing a new artificial-intelligence supercomputer chip for self-driving cars.Among international equity ETFs, iShares MSCI Brazil Capped (EWZ) rumbled ahead 5.1% as the price of oil unexpectedly spiked to its best level in four months.All three exchange traded funds are among the best-performing ETFs of 2016 in their respective categories, with yearly gains ranging from 18.0% to 72.7%.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 6.5% so far this year through Oct. 12.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2016Investors find themselves at an interesting crossroads in this stage of a long bull run. They see potential for stocks to trend up again, in the glimmer of recovery for corporate profits and in policymakers' extreme caution about making a rate move that could unsettle the markets.Yet the stock market today is rife with uncertainty. In the short term, the November presidential election could create volatility. In the longer run, the global oil glut and the health of the European financial sector remain troubling.Many ETF investors find themselves wondering whether to play it safe with low-volatility and high-dividend ETFs as they did early in this year, or to move more aggressively into riskier trades.Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, suggests the latter may be worth considering.""A brighter oil price outlook, due to an unexpected OPEC plan to cut production and a surprisingly big drop in U.S. oil stockpiles, is positive for risk assets and supports the case for some reflation,"" he wrote in an Oct. 10 note.Higher oil prices would reinforce current market trends, he added.That means so-called haven investments such as utilities and low-volatility stocks could get hurt. Cyclical assets such as emerging markets would be helped.There are lessons to be learned, too, from how the big money managers are positioning their client portfolios.So IBD reached out to two pros for their stock market outlook and their best ideas on how to make money investing in ETFs.Here's what they said.Mark Diorio is chief investment officer at Brookstone Capital Management in Wheaton, Ill. The firm has $1.5 billion in assets under management and takes a risk-managed approach toward investing.Our monetary analysis leads us to three main areas of challenges and opportunities based on the level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve and a reasonable path for future interest rates. First, the nominal level of interest rates is low and conventional bonds with low, fixed coupons do not protect against inflation.Second, the shape of the yield curve (a graph plotting interest rates along the maturity schedule) is flattening. Simply, the interest-rate differentials between long-term bonds and short-term bonds have narrowed, leaving investors yield-starved for current income.Third, our base-case scenario for the reasonable path for future interest rates is for a series of one-quarter point (0.25%) rate hikes annually. This low-intensity path may promote stability in the stock and bond markets.IShares Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIP): Unlike traditional bonds, Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are designed to eliminate inflation risk by adjusting both the principal value and coupon payments to keep up with inflation.IShares Preferred Stock (PFF): For investors that desire current income, preferred stocks may offer an attractive alternative or complement to traditional income sources such as investment-grade or corporate bonds.Preferred stocks are income-generating securities that are somewhere in the middle of the risk spectrum between common stocks and traditional bonds. PFF had a 12-month yield of 5.74% as of Oct. 12.IShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM): In a scenario where future interest rates are on a low-intensity path, stocks may resume their uptrend and thrive.MTUM invests in well-performing stocks with the idea that stocks with higher relative performance may continue to produce strong performance in the near-term relative to stocks with weak performance. Top five holdings out of 121 include Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook, AT&T (T), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Home Depot (HD).Chris Cook is founder and CEO of Beacon Capital Management in Dayton, Ohio. With $2 billion in assets under management, the RIA firm helps investors capture stock market gains while limiting losses from market volatility.Since the market has many uncertainties today -- the presidential election in the United States, the question as to whether or not the Fed will raise the interest rates, or whether or not the Europeans will continue with negative rates -- a neutral, equal-weight sector allocation is appropriate for most investors.We prefer Vanguard's sector ETFs because they cover all 11 sectors of the S&P 500, have exposure to small- and midcap companies, and are extremely inexpensive. They generally have a 0.10% expense ratio ($10 in annual fees for every $10,000 invested) and allocate 25% of their assets to smaller stocks.No one sector is showing significant momentum, although energy and technology are showing early signs of strength. Interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as real estate and utilities are showing short-term price weakness, but not enough to offset their relatively high yields.Vanguard Technology (VGT): The tech sector is experiencing a lot of activity through mergers and acquisitions right now. Top holdings in VGT include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Intel (INTC).The largest of the technology companies are cash-heavy and not subject to interest-rate sensitivity, so they are well-positioned to acquire other notable tech firms, such as Twitter (TWTR) and Netflix (NFLX).Vanguard Energy (VDE): In the energy sector, profits are directly correlated to supply levels and it looks like the supply levels of energy may taper off in the coming months.The Mideast is working to cut back on supply levels with the expectation that crude prices will go back up to $50 a barrel, the breakeven point, potentially leading to more profit. Weather may have an impact on energy production in the U.S., making it difficult for drilling to take place in areas impacted by severe weather, further limiting supply levels and resulting in increased profits.Vanguard Financial (VFH): On the assumption that interest rates will be raised in December, the financial sector will benefit through increases in profit margins across the board. Lending institutions will generate greater spreads and margin on cash or money market accounts.RELATED:Which Of The Best ETF Investment Strategies Is Right For Your Portfolio?

317,JNJ,"""Wait and see"" is the mantra of ETF investors as Donald Trump assumes the reins of the highest office in the land. Will his ambitious campaign proposals translate to policy or get lost in translation?""The U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic 'buy the rumor' rally,"" built around Trump's promises, said David Haviland of Beaumont Capital, an expert at investing in exchange traded funds. ""The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell?""Haviland is one of two money managers who spoke to IBD recently about their stock market outlook as well as their best ETF investment ideas for the year ahead. For the moment, Haviland is making some bullish bets.One of Haviland's picks, O'Shares FTSE U.S. Quality Dividend (OUSA) holds stocks that could rocket if Trump delivers fiscal stimulus as promised and allows U.S. companies to bring home their offshore cash.Click Here For A List Of The Best-Performing ETFs Of 2017Henry Ma of Julex Capital, another investing pro, expects two postelection rotation trades — from bonds to equities and from high yield to growth — to continue. His ETF picks, too, reflect an overall optimism.Still, both Haviland and Ma have eyes wide open to downside risks. Like many other investors, they straddle hope and caution as the White House welcomes its newest resident.Here they are in their own words:David Haviland is managing partner and portfolio manager at Beaumont Capital Management, a Needham, Mass.-based asset manager offering ETF-based growth strategies with defensive capabilities since 2009; assets under management and advisement: $3.7 billion as of September 2016.After the Nov. 8 election, the U.S. equity markets have enjoyed a classic ""buy the rumor"" rally. The rally has focused on the promises made during the election and the prospects for beneficial change.Specifically, some of the key topics include a $1 trillion, 10-year Federal stimulus package to improve infrastructure, the reworking of the federal corporate tax system to make our tax code more competitive, the renegotiation of several trade agreements that currently induce the exportation of jobs, and the likelihood of large amounts of repatriation of U.S. multinational foreign profits.All of these items should serve to stimulate growth and reflation here in the U.S. The question is, what will be the news that causes the sell? Investors tend to buy the rumor and sell the news.Here are four ETFs that should do well in 2017. These ETFs are currently owned or could be purchased at any time within BCM strategies.In a low-interest-rate environment, the baby boomers need income from their portfolio to live off of. O'Shares has distilled the universe of large-cap equities down to a portfolio of 151 companies across all sectors that should provide better long-term, risk-adjusted returns.Examples of these portfolio companies with superior balance sheets include Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). (Editor's note: OUSA has a 2.32% 12-month yield.)To be included, at least 50% of a company's sales and revenue must come from the internet. The ETF also uses a more limited screening process for liquidity and size. The top holdings include the ""FANG"" stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and (Google parent) Alphabet (GOOGL).Over one-third of humanity currently lives without clean water. The infrastructure required for this most important resource will be massive here in the U.S. as well as across the globe in both developed and emerging markets.The ETF should benefit from Trump's infrastructure build here in the U.S. We do not currently own this ETF but we have in the past, and it could make its way back into the portfolio in 2017.Top positions in the fund include Danaher (DHR), London-based Wolseley, Switzerland-based Geberit and France-based Veolia Environmental, which illustrates the global reach.(Editor's note: While the ETF has relatively low average trading volume, a large asset manager like BCM can access the underlying liquidity of the stocks in the index through the create/redeem process.)In a rising-rate environment, Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) tend to perform better than regular bonds given their yield plus inflation construct — the principal rises with inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, while the yield is fixed.This ETF also uses a short duration, currently 2.4 years, as added protection against rising rates. It yields 0.89%.Henry Ma is president and chief investment officer at Julex Capital Management, an SEC-registered quantitative investment management firm based in Boston. The firm's tactical unconstrained investment solutions aim to limit downside risks while maximizing upside potential; total client assets as of September 2016: $358 million.As we enter 2017, we may be witnessing major shifts of economic policies, which could have significant impacts on financial markets. The new year is likely to see a continuing rise of protectionism, which is evidenced notably in the Brexit referendum and the U.S. presidential election.This trend could undermine global growth, but there will be winners and losers. The export-dependent sectors have the most to lose.After eight years of monetary stimulus, policymakers among the developed countries have realized that loose monetary policies are no longer effective and fiscal policies are needed to spur economic growth. In the U.S., President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to reduce taxes and spend $1 trillion on infrastructure.These potential fiscal expansion programs have improved growth prospects, fueling higher inflation expectations, pushing bond yields upward, and causing losses for bond holders. We will see more rotation from bonds to equities in this reflationary environment. Within the equity markets, the yield-seeking trade has run its course as investors rotate from high-yielding sectors to growth sectors. We expect these two rotation trades to continue, and recommend three ETFs that could outperform in 2017.The Fed is likely to raise interest rates to 1.25%-1.50% at the end of 2017. This higher rate will certainly boost the profit margin for financial stocks. The potential appeal or revision of financial regulations such as Dodd-Frank by the Trump administration will also help improve their profitability and earnings growth.As we expect the U.S. economy to grow above 3% in 2017, the tech sector will benefit from increasing demand and higher revenue growth. The valuation is still attractive as the sector is traded at a slightly lower forward PE ratio than the S&P 500 index.Potentially protectionist trade policies and fiscal expansion programs will generate more domestic demand for small companies' products. The trailing PE ratio of IWM is 21.4, which is close to the PE ratio of the S&P 500 Index (20.4). Better growth prospects will provide small-cap stocks with more upside potential.(Editor's note: These ETFs are currently owned/were recently owned by Julex Capital strategies and could be purchased at any time within their client portfolios.)RELATED:High Yield Strategy Uses 10 ETFs To Deliver All-Weather Income With Low Risks6 Best ETFs For When You're Both Bullish And Cautious About The Markets

318,JNJ,"As Medtronic (MDT) preps to dredge Edwards Lifesciences' (EW) share of the heart valve-replacement market, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Boston Scientific (BSX) and St. Jude Medical (STJ) are lining up in 2017 to gouge various pieces of Medtronic's business.Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences stocks rifted Tuesday on differing analyst views for 2017. In the stock market today, Medtronic stock fell 0.86% to 70.62, after a Morgan Stanley analyst downgraded the stock. Edwards stock rose 1.9% to a two-month high of 95.49.David Lewis, of Morgan Stanley, downgraded Medtronic stock to equal weight from overweight. He also cut his price target to 77 from 85. Shares closed 2016 down 7%, vastly below their 50-day moving average and will likely be muted on growth perspectives this year, Lewis said.Medtronic completed its $43 billion acquisition of Covidien, an Irish medical products and device maker, in January 2015 and margins disappeared in the aftermath of the acquisition, as expected, but ""organic growth served as a nice bridge,"" Lewis wrote in his research report.""But organic growth has decelerated each of the last two quarters,"" he wrote. ""We are not convinced we see a path to outperformance in light of topline headwinds until management can demonstrate more durable cost opportunities in fiscal 2019.""IBD'S TAKE: Late last year, Boston Scientific acquired Neovasc's tissue business in a deal that could hurt rivals Medtronic and Edwards Lifesciences. Check out how these Sector Leaders are battling it out in the medical products field.Medtronic's 2017 growth will hinge, in part, on traction of its MiniMed 670G, a hybrid closed loop diabetes management system, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of a large-valve indication for intermediate risk patients, expected in mid-2017.Lewis project 3%-4% organic growth if Medtronic's launches gain traction.Meanwhile, Medtronic will see increased competition in MRI safe launches from Boston. Boston and St. Jude are emerging rivals in deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's patients. Spectranetics will soon compete in drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatments, and J&J is getting into the minimally invasive procedure arena.Edwards stock, on the other hand, pulled in an upgrade Tuesday. Guggenheim analyst Chris Pasquale upgraded Edwards stock to a buy from neutral, and established a 120 price target. He says transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) expectations have ""come back down to Earth"" after a lackluster Q3.But there's still room for growth in the TAVR market, Pasquale wrote in his report. He estimates global TAVR sales for 2016 will come in at $2.545 billion, with Edwards bringing in $1.622 billion. Consensus estimates were 20% lower in January 2016, he noted.""It would have been hard to imagine this being considered a disappointing outcome a year ago, yet investor sentiment on both Edwards and the TAVR opportunity has soured somewhat in the wake of Q3 results that failed to show the kind of positive inflection many Street models forecast,"" he wrote.Analysts were exceptionally bullish after Edwards got an intermediate risk indication for TAVR patients in August, Pasquale noted. That, plus temporary capacity constraints at some centers and the natural ""ebb and flow"" of the market, likely led to the major Q3 disappointment.Pasquale estimates procedures still grew 40% year over year last quarter. He expects worldwide TAVR sales to double over the next five years — ""a trend that Edwards should be the primary beneficiary of even as competition increases,"" he said.RELATED:Edwards Heart-Valve Guidance Lags On Medtronic, Boston RivalryEdwards 2017 Guidance Likely Hinges On Rivalry With Medtronic, Boston

Nike's fiscal year ends in May.Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) jumped 2.5% after announcing it would launch a generic version of Pfizer's (PFE) Cerebyx injectable seizure treatment, as well as a generic tablet version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Concerta treatment for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.

320,JNJ,"DepoMed (DEPO) stock tumbled to a low Wednesday not seen since a year ago, after the company pre-released negative first-quarter guidance and saw its chief executive resign amid a management shake-up and a U.S. senator's probe into opioid marketing.At the closing bell on the stock market today, DepoMed shares fell 3.1% to 13.79, after earlier falling as much as 5%. Shares hit an intraday 12-month high in late September but are down nearly 50% since then.Late Tuesday, DepoMed guided to $95 million to $100 million in first-quarter sales, lagging analysts' broader views by $15 million. That guidance will be revised May 8, during the Q4 conference call.The company also announced a management shift that saw Arthur Higgins replace former CEO James Schoeneck. Gavin Molinelli and William McKee were also added to the board.Higgins, Molinelli and McKee are aligned with activist investor Starboard, which is known for its big stake in HP Enterprise (HPE). Following the shake-up, only three of the nine board members are legacy members, Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler noted in a report.DepoMed's board changes also followed reports earlier in the day that U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., is seeking marketing information, sales records and studies from manufacturers of top-selling opioids in the U.S.McCaskill says sales of prescription opioids have quadrupled since 1999. DepoMed was named the fifth top seller of opioids in a CNBC report. Other leaders listed include Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, Insys Therapeutics (INSY) and Mylan (MYL).IBD'S TAKE: DepoMed isn't the only company facing activist investors. Analysts say Bristol-Myers Squibb could be bought if pressure mounts from investors such as Carl Icahn. Who would bid on Bristol? Head to IBD's Technology page for a deeper dive.Still, DepoMed sold only $190 million in opioids in 2015 vs. the industry leader, Purdue, which made $1.5 billion off its OxyContin drug, a well-known painkiller, according to Janney analyst Ken Trbovich.Trbovich sees the investigation posing little risk to DepoMed, which didn't begin selling opioids until acquiring Lazanda in 2013 and Nucynta in 2015, ""at which time diversion and abuse of prescription opioid medications was decreasing.""Koffler, of Mizuho, sees DepoMed being taken out.""With Starboard remaining involved, we have raised the expected probability of takeout from 30% to 50%,"" she said. ""This generates a hypothetical $16 takeout value for the stock, and may still allow Starboard to record a modest gain on its initial investment.""Alone, DepoMed is worth 10 to 13 per share in a takeout due to lower sales estimates, she said. But Koffler cut her views for this scenario to 50% from 70%. She also trimmed her price target on DepoMed stock to 13 from 16, but kept her neutral rating.Janney's Trbovich has a buy rating on DepoMed stock.RELATED:DepoMed Downgraded On Weakness In Base Business, Stock Run-Up

321,JNJ,"Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN) stock rocketed to an 18-month high Thursday on rumors that it accepted a $1 billion offer from French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) to acquire it.Shares of Flexion closed up 33.4%, at 26.25, and rose another fraction in after-hours trading. Flexion stock has traded below 25 since September 2015. Sanofi stock, on the other hand, stood still in after-hours trading after closing down a fraction, at 44.51.One unidentified source said Sanofi put down a bid in the ""mid-30s"" per share, with a final price pending due diligence, FiercePharma reported. Sanofi had no comment. Representatives of Flexion didn't immediately return a request from IBD for comment.The rumored bid follows three months after Sanofi lost out on acquiring Swiss biotech Actelion in December following a contentious bidding process. Janney analyst Ken Trbovich says the potential offer wouldn't be a total surprise.""Sanofi represents a logical potential acquirer given its U.S. leadership in the single injection market for hydraulic acid-based products that are also used to treat osteoarthritis pain,"" he said in a research report. Flexion's pipeline is focused on musculoskeletal conditions including osteoarthritis.IBD'S TAKE: Flexion has a middling IBD Composite Rating of 54, meaning it ranks in the middle of all stocks in terms of key growth metrics. The biotech leader is Celgene with a CR of 99 out of a best-possible 99. Head to the Stock Checkup for a list of the top five.Last year, Sanofi had about $11.1 billion in cash and is set to receive an additional $5.1 billion in an agreement to swap assets with Boehringer Ingelheim.""Thus, Sanofi has the cash and has certainly shown an active interest in pursuing acquisitions after (Dow component) Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) successfully thwarted Sanofi's efforts to acquire Actelion last year,"" he said.

324,JNJ,"Spring forward with a peak energy program. Go beyond the routine workout:Charge ahead. Physical activity isn’t just for weight management. Savvy executives know exercise boosts their get-up-and-go, which influences professional performance.“The human body is business-relevant,” said Jack Groppel, co-founder of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) Human Performance Institute, a fitness consultancy.Amp up. A study by Wellness & Prevention, a Johnson & Johnson company, found that 93% of respondents were interested in improving their energy levels throughout the day.“If you ask: Do you want more energy? Everyone says yes,” Groppel told IBD.Rise and shine. Vitality gets drained by the same old problem: We sit too much. “Nothing in life is a straight line, except how we work,” Groppel said.The benefits of an exertion break are scientifically proved.After a 20-minute walk, an MRI shows this: “The brain just lights up,” Groppel said.Spread it out. Some check the fitness box with an early morning workout. But lack of activity the rest of the day can cause mental slog.“Even if you’re fit, the brain starts shutting down,” Groppel said.He recommends microbursts of activity -- jumping jacks or a brisk walk -- every 30 minutes.The influx of oxygen awakens the mind, and movement refreshes the muscles.“We also found it improves intrinsic motivation,” he said, which helps workers tune into the task at hand.Show them how. Peer pressure is often what keeps workers chained to their desks. Company leaders should model active and balanced behavior for subordinates.“They need permission,” Groppel said.Take care. A microburst doesn’t have to be physical. Similar energy spikes can come from an emotional, mental or spiritual timeout.For a lift, “call a loved one,” Groppel said.Incorporate it. Savvy execs weave healthy habits -- including physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual strategies -- into their office routines.“Because we spend a significant amount of our waking hours working, I encourage people to pay attention to improving their well-being at work.” So says Donna Hamilton, author of “Wellness Your Way: The Short and Sweet Guide to Creating Your Custom Plan for a Happier, Healthier Life.”Take small steps. Make your cubicle a fit place by using ergonomically sound office equipment, stocking healthy snacks, opting for the stairs, and parking farther away from the office.Make it personal. Keep a picture on your desk of someone or something that makes you smile, such as loved ones, pets and vacation photos.Stay grounded. Eating lunch in front of your computer? Take a moment for silent reflection or prayer before digging in.Excite the mind. Learning something new every day boosts your brain. Try mastering a different skill or studying a sector related to your industry.Get friendly. There’s good reason to strike up a conversation with a co-worker or participate in an office sports league.Employees report higher job satisfaction when there’s opportunity for friendships at work, according to a Journal of Business Psychology study.Put it down. If you can’t sleep because your mind is racing about business, take a moment to write down those thoughts.The act will purge and preserve those notions.A to-do list at the end of the day keeps you organized.

325,JNJ,"The son of a wealthy, self-made man dallies at a prestigious prep school and must repeat his junior year. He graduates somehow, starts college, quits and drifts from one low-level job to another.Sound like symptoms for a case of affluenza? Far from it.It was the unorthodox self-education of an unusual business titan, Robert Wood Johnson II, who built Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) into an international pharmaceutical giant and among the world’s most-admired companies.“He had a tremendous ability his whole life to generate really innovative ideas,” Margaret Gurowitz, chief historian for Johnson & Johnson, told IBD. “He started as a mill hand sweeping the floors, and he learned the business from the ground up.”Johnson (1893-1968) made something of his birth to privilege via his work ethic and attitude toward those who worked for him. He did indeed take a pass on college, but only for an education that mattered more to him.He worked in Johnson & Johnson manufacturing plants, moving from one job to another as soon as he learned all he could, earning the respect of co-workers and supervisors along the way.Years later, when he got his shot to the run the company, he was a practical visionary, who:Championed decentralized management long before it was standard practice.Designed manufacturing facilities to be efficient, attractive and pleasant places to work.Provided extensive employee benefits and good working conditions.Fought for a higher national minimum wage, following his practice of paying above-average wages.There’s no question Johnson came by his talent naturally. His father boasted his own story of innovation and success.Trained as an apothecary, Robert Wood I and his two brothers founded a medical manufacturing business in 1886 in New Brunswick, N.J. — Johnson & Johnson. They manufactured surgical dressings with antibacterial carbolic acid, a vast improvement over competitors’ products.Being the oldest son, Robert Wood II was expected to follow his father into the family business and eventually run it. Robert Sr. even took Bobby to business meetings as a teen.He started work at 16, and for his first years he pursued his unorthodox self-education of working many lower-level jobs. He joined the board of directors at 21 and was running his own factory at 22.He was aided in his rise because company leaders knew he would inherit the largest share of voting stock in the firm at age 25. But he proved himself at each step.Young Robert proved he could recover from a misstep. Enjoying drinking with his friends, he even showed up at work drunk once. His father had died unexpectedly in 1910, and Johnson’s uncle James took over as president of the firm. He threatened to sell the company if Johnson II kept up his carousing.“Bobby immediately changed his ways,” wrote Lawrence Foster in “Robert Wood Johnson: The Gentleman Rebel.” “Convinced that he had grown up, the board of directors made him one of its members on April 15, 1914. The youthful Bobby had become a sober and serious Robert Johnson II.”He may have been sober and serious, but he still had a restless drive that would define his life. In his late 20s, he convinced the board to move Johnson & Johnson into international markets over his uncle’s objections.Previously, the company sold products internationally but had no facilities overseas.“He was committed to establishing locally managed operating units around the world,” Gurowitz said. “He knew those units could understand and deal with local challenges far better than a centralized company.”At 26, Johnson served as mayor of Highland Park, N.J., where he lived at the time. One incident from his time in office illustrates the drive he brought to every endeavor.While hosting a formal dinner at his home, a local woman called complaining no one had picked up her garbage. So the mayor — in formal attire — drove to her house, collected her trash, took it to the dump and returned to his party.Uncle James served as president for 22 years, but for his last 12 years, his health was so precarious that leadership of Johnson & Johnson rested in a committee called the ""board of control.""By virtue of the stock he owned and his performance on the job, Johnson was the heir apparent, but the board of control advanced him slowly. It wanted him to mature.Johnson finally joined the board of control in 1927. He was just 33. The board promoted him to vice president and general manager in 1930 and to president following his uncle’s retirement in 1932.Johnson was a champion of workers’ rights and of women’s rights in particular. He continued his father’s practice of offering medical care, educational programs, plants with lounges and employee recreation activities.He pioneered building factories on a smaller scale and with appealing design outside and in.“He felt very strongly factories can be beautiful,” Gurowtiz said. “He believed Johnson & Johnson facilities should be an asset to the community.”In the Great Depression, Johnson paid workers more than mandated by the National Recovery Administration.During World War II, President Franklin Roosevelt commissioned him as a colonel in the Army and named him head of Smaller War Plants Corp., created so that smaller firms could get government contracts.Fighting the bureaucracy so frustrated Johnson, he left the position even after FDR advanced him to the rank of brigadier general to increase his clout. Afterward, he was always known as Gen. Johnson.Back at the company he loved, he continued international expansion, acquired other firms and product lines, and created what is now called the Johnson & Johnson Family of Cos. Today, 250 companies in 60 countries fall into three divisions — consumer health care, medical devices and pharmaceuticals.According to the J&J, it is the world’s fifth-largest pharmaceutical firm and sixth-largest consumer health company -- with sales of $70 billion in 2015 and a stock that has rocketed 1,000% since 1994.Johnson served as chairman of the board until his retirement in 1963, but he remained chairman of the company’s finance committee until his death at age 74.Northwestern University’s school for hospital administration was the first of its kind in the country and was founded by Johnson. He developed the concept of hospitals organizing by clinical department — a standard practice now.Among his most lasting creations was the $9.2 billion Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, funded with his $400 million estate.Johnson married three times, to Elizabeth Ross, Margaret Shea — with whom he had children Robert III and Sheila — and finally to Evelyne Vernon.During the Great Depression, in addition to paying workers a higher-than-required minimum wage, Johnson kept them working. He cut hours, reduced workweeks, took any steps to keep his people employed. Nationally, unemployment reached almost 25%. The number of people laid off at Johnson & Johnson? Zero. Raised in privilege, he passed on college, started at Johnson & Johnson sweeping floors, expanded it into an international giant and never forgot to take care of his workers.Overcame: Youthful wayward behavior.Lesson: Take care of your employees, and they will deliver value to your shareholders.“Why be difficult when, with a little more effort, you can be impossible?”

327,JNJ,"Despite turbulence in the stock market, a recession is unlikely this year, so putting more money into a combination of high- and low-grade debt could give investors ""near equity-like returns with significantly less historical volatility,"" bond giant Pimco said in a recent note.The advice comes after companies like Apple (AAPL), IBM (IBM), Exxon (XOM), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) raised tens of billions of dollars in debt last month, even though concerns persist about a recession and the ability of commodity-dependent firms to manage their debt.On Tuesday, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) joined the rush, selling $9 billion in debt. Investors couldn't get nearly enough as demand topped $34 billion.With the exception of the energy and metals space, many companies remain on solid ground, Pimco said. The firm also believes the U.S. economy's expansion is ""right around midcycle,"" mitigating the risk of defaults, and that the bond market stateside should become more popular this year.""Based on discussions with investors around the world,"" Pimco said, ""we expect that capital will move into the U.S. credit market throughout 2016, particularly if the U.S. economy can avoid a recession and continue to grow at its current pace.""Meanwhile, U.S. corporate giants have provided a robust supply of quality debt. Just in recent weeks, Apple issued $12 billion of bonds, IBM sold $5 billion, Exxon Mobile $12 billion, Johnson & Johnson $7.5 billion and Cisco $7 billion. A record pace of $274.5 billion in investment-grade debt has been issued in the U.S. so far this year, according to Dealogic.And many investors live in a world where some government bond returns are running into negative territory and monetary policy is ""losing effectiveness,"" Pimco said. But redirecting money into an easily overagitated stock market doesn't always seem like a much better option.The alternative? A combination of stable and higher-risk credit, Pimco said.""We think investors should consider better risk-adjusted alternatives: investment grade corporate bonds, select high yield bonds and select bank loans, which offer investors the potential to earn near equity-like returns with significantly less historical volatility than equities,"" Pimco said, though it didn't single out any particular corporate issuers.""Credit, in our opinion, is in the sweet spot intermediate zone between lower-risk (inner circle) sovereign assets, which tend to outperform leading into recession, and higher-risk (outer perimeter) assets such as equities, which tend to outperform during the initial phases of economic expansion and monetary policy stimulus,"" the firm added.Shares of Apple and IBM dipped 0.8% in the stock market today. Exxon lost 2.2%, Johnson & Johnson eased 0.5% and Cisco fell 0.3%.

331,JNJ,"Many parts of President Trump's federal government have yet to take shape, but a leaner and meaner Food and Drug Administration seems almost certain.The way agency watchers see it, Trump's ""blueprint"" for the nation's pharmaceutical gatekeeper points to a funding cut. His budget outline also suggests that the user fees charged to the industry, for processing approvals, could as much as double in 2018.Yet Trump also wants a speedier FDA that pushes through more generic drugs, boosting competition. He has derided ""astronomical"" and ""outrageous"" drug prices and called for a competitive and fair drug-approval process.Drugmakers and analysts say they're all for it. They're just not sure a leaner FDA can accomplish that.""If we can support the FDA to get more funding so they can approve generic drugs faster, it'll bring down drug costs,"" said John Maraganore, CEO at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY).Alnylam makes expensive specialty drugs to treat hemophilia and other rare ailments. He acknowledges that more competition in the generic market would help tug down rising drug prices.""That's a competitive, marketplace-based way of doing it that would preserve the market-based, time-limited award that's really needed for innovation,"" Maraganore told Investor's Business Daily.Irina Koffler, analyst at Mizuho, agrees. The FDA now faces a 4,000-drug backlog of generic applications, she told IBD.Before it can make a dent in that backlog, the agency needs more funding, more staff and legislation to clear out a thicket of laws and legal decisions that slow down drug approvals, Koffler says.""Generic submissions are sitting there languishing while there is not enough competition,"" Koffler said. ""There's some situations where you'll have a supply monopoly where one company is the only one manufacturing a certain generic drug and therefore charges a lot for it.""Biotech and drug stocks are touchy when it comes to Trump. A March 7 tweet from the president promising more drug competition sent IBD's 17-company Generic Drugs industry group down 1.2%.But generic drug companies actually favor more competition, says Chip Davis, chief executive for the Association for Accessible Medicines, an advocate for makers of generic drugs.Makers of generic and what are known as biosimilar drugs experience constant price deflation, he says. That backlog of 4,000 generic applications means drugs that could provide new revenue streams stay stuck on hold, awaiting FDA review or action.""The only way that over time our companies can be financially successful is if they are able to get approvals for new generics to help offset the continuing deflation that they see year over year, in their current mature portfolio,"" he told IBD. ""They fully recognize more competition creates downward pressure on pricing.""Prescription drug prices rose 11.3% in 2016, and they're projected to jump 11.6% this year for active employees and early retirees from the American workforce, according to advisory firm Segal Consulting. For retirees age 65 and older, prices are expected to rise 9.9% — a slowdown from 10.9% in 2016.It likely will take a congressional push to speed up FDA approvals. The most recent iteration of the American Health Care Act, the GOP bill that sought to replace ObamaCare, didn't touch pharmaceuticals, though Trump pledged March 20 in a Kentucky rally to work on legislation to bring down pricing.IBD'S TAKE: Since his swearing in, Trump has continued calls for drugmakers to lower their prices. What would this do to biotech and drug stocks? Read on in IBD's Industry Themes.Trump's 2018 budget blueprint hints at ""a package of administrative actions designed to achieve regulatory efficiency and speed the development of safe and effective medical products.""Trump could be on the same page with Alnylam's Maraganore, who imagines a system of FDA incentives to approve generics quickly.Congress could enact ""legislation where the FDA is incentivized to approve a second or third manufacturer for a generic drug faster,"" Maraganore said. ""You can imagine how that would help speed lowering of drug prices if the FDA has to prioritize the second and third drug approvals over other generic drug actions.""What Trump should not do is reduce drug testing for safety and effectiveness, Mizuho's Koffler says.She recalled the Thalidomide crisis of the 1950s and 1960s. Thalidomide was first marketed in Germany as an over-the-counter medication for nausea in pregnant women. In the ensuing years, some 100,000 children worldwide were born with phocomelia, or malformed limbs. About half survived.That was a turning point in the drug approval process, Koffler says. Thalidomide wasn't well-tested before being sold to a vulnerable population of pregnant women and resulted in unexpected side effects in newborns. Because of that, the FDA strengthened its drug review process.""With any drug you're taking, you have to assume what terrible things could happen: A child could take it, a pregnant woman could take it, a person who has bad kidneys or a bad heart will take it,"" she said. ""So you have to test these drugs in a more realistic and representative population of patients.""Trump's pick for FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, has talked about overhauling the FDA's process for generic complex drugs, which have allowed some branded drugs to create ""monopolies in perpetuity."" Generic complex drugs have more complex active ingredients, formulations, routes of delivery or drug-device combinations than typical generics.Gottlieb is an industry insider who formerly held positions at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. His nomination has drawn support across the aisle. Like Trump, Gottlieb supports more competition in the generic market while cutting down on branded monopolies.In a March 4 article in Forbes, Gottlieb noted that older generic drugs that should be sold cheaply are sometimes very costly. The prime example is Turing Pharmaceuticals' purchase of a decades-old HIV medicine in 2015. The company spiked the price to $750 a pill from $13.50 overnight.""This is often a result of failures in the way that FDA is regulating generic medicines,"" he said. ""The agency's long and costly approach to regulating generic drugs is reducing competition in the generic market and increasing the cost of manufacturing generic medicines.""Maraganore identifies more with the branded side of the aisle. He draws a distinction between generics and groundbreaking treatments. When the FDA approves a branded drug for a rare disease — like Biogen's (BIIB) Spinraza for spinal muscular atrophy — or even some of the new treatments coming out now that could actually cure cancer, the drugs receive patent protection for a number of years. Generics can't make copies in that period.Maraganore calls that the ""market-based, time-limited award needed for innovation.""The generic market ""is where there ought to be the greatest amount of competition,"" he said. ""As we address challenges in our system around drug prices and drug-approval processes, we need to be careful that reform that might look good or sound good is in fact good, to preserve the innovation engine we have in this country.""In January, Trump told execs from Celgene (CELG), Eli Lilly (LLY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Novartis (NVS) and Merck (MRK) that he would cut 75%-80% of regulations to smooth the FDA approval process.According to the Regulatory Affairs Professionals Society, Trump pledged to ""streamline the process so that from your standpoint, when you actually have a drug, you can actually get it approved instead of waiting many, many years.""Mizuho's Koffler notes that at least one law could be revised. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 stays a generic drug application for 30 months, allowing the patent holder time to litigate against the generic filer and protect its patent. That 30-month clock is in place regardless of how dire the need is for the drug.""If you could legislate that stay away — that mandatory 30 months — that would help expedite the litigation process between the branded and generic companies and create a lot more competition,"" she said.Davis, of the generic drug makers' advocacy group, argues that Congress ought to tackle a decade-old law that requires the makers and the FDA to take additional safety measures when a drug could have risky side effects if not properly administered.Branded companies are taking advantage of the 2007 Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies law to prevent generics from purchasing samples of the drugs, he says.Davis contends that some companies have used risk evaluation programs ""to create a limited distribution program that doesn't allow generic companies to legally purchase samples of those drugs, which they need to do the clinical testing so they can submit an application to the FDA to compete against the originator product,"" he said.""There needs to be legislation to make sure (risk evaluation) can only be used for its intended purpose and not to delay competition from generics or biosimilars going forward,"" he said. A bill in the House now would just study the matter ""and the reality is everyone has known for five years this is a problem.""Trump's budget blueprint offers the clearest view yet of how he wants to run the FDA, but it doesn't clear away all the smoke.Trump argues that ""industries that benefit from FDA's approvals can and should pay for their share"" in a ""constrained budget environment."" But the proposal doesn't detail a specific 2018 budget figure for the FDA.In 2016, the FDA budget grew 9% to $4.9 billion. This year, the FDA has asked for an 8% increase to $5.1 billion. The industry is bracing for a potential cut to agency funding in 2018, indicated by the proposed jump in user fees.Under the law, the FDA collects fees from drugmakers — branded, generic and biosimilar — to fund the drug-approval process. Trump's blueprint proposes a boost in those fees to $2 billion.The agreed-upon user fee between the industry and FDA for 2018 isn't publicly available, says Davis, so it's difficult to know how it will mesh with Trump's blueprint. Those deals were formed over ""months and months of dialogue"" and both generics and biosimilars came away satisfied, he says.Trump's $2 billion blueprint likely includes branded, generic and biosimilars, which are set to pay $1.2 billion in fees this year. It's unclear whether Trump's plan includes other types of user fees. In all, FDA user fees amounted to $2.1 billion in 2017.The Alliance for a Stronger FDA — a coalition of consumer/patient groups, health professionals and trade associations — called Trump's user-fee jump ""neither wise nor realistic"" in a March 16 statement.""Not wise because FDA's core responsibilities — safe and effective medical products and safe foods — need to be supported in large measure by the public, who is the primary beneficiary,"" the group said. ""Not realistic because the drug and device industries have recently completed user fee agreement negotiations with FDA.""

332,JNJ,"European biotech Actelion confirmed Wednesday it's in exclusive M&A talks with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a week after those discussions temporarily fizzled and rumors arose that Sanofi (SNY) had entered the fray.Johnson & Johnson initially confirmed its interest in Actelion on Nov. 25. Insiders said the firm upped its bid on Actelion to $250 per share, valuing Actelion north of $27 billion, in an attempt to secure the deal before Christmas.At the time, insiders said French Sanofi was mulling a bid and had informally let Actelion know of its interest. Actelion became engaged in talks with another unnamed party on Dec. 14 after Johnson & Johnson withdrew its bid.But Johnson & Johnson returned to the negotiating table on Wednesday, according to a release from Actelion which also noted, ""There can be no assurance any transaction will result from these discussions.""IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have nearly round-tripped a rally inspired by Donald Trump's election amid commentary from the president-elect that he would tackle rising drug prices.Sanofi stock jumped 1.5% to 39.50 on the stock market today. Johnson & Johnson stock dipped 0.3% to 115.31.RELATED:United Therapeutics Chilled On M&A Fever Amid Actelion, Bayer Rivalry

333,JNJ,"Regeneron (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY) could eye BioMarin (BMRN) and The Medicines Co. (MDCO) in the wake of a U.S. judge's ban on their Amgen (AMGN)-rivaling LDL-buster, RBC and Leerink analysts suggested Friday.Late Thursday, a district judge ruled that Regeneron and Sanofi's Praluent infringes on a pair of Amgen patents for Repatha, a PCSK9 inhibitor that lowers LDL, or ""bad,"" cholesterol in the blood. The decision sent Regeneron and Sanofi stocks into the red.In the stock market today, Regeneron stock fell 5.5% to 359.99, while Sanofi stock fell 2.7% to 40.37. Amgen, which had its patents reaffirmed, enjoyed a 2.5% gain, to 157.15.IBD'S TAKE: The biotech sector suffered a raucous election year in 2016, but five leaders ended the year with triple-digit gains. Were your stock picks on that list? Get the deep dive on IBD Industry Themes.BioMarin Pharmaceutical stock rose 0.65% to 86.85, and The Medicines Co. jumped 1.4% to 36.23, on the suggestion that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals or Sanofi could issue a bid on them to make up the $1 billion to $2 billion lost on the potential removal of Praluent from the U.S. market. BioMarin has a market cap near $15 billion, while The Medicines Co. has a cap near $2.5 billion.France-based Sanofi, which has a market cap near $104 billion, has been particularly vexed in recent years on M&A. It lost out on Medivation and its blockbuster cancer drug, Xtandi, in a battle with Pfizer (PFE) last year. Last month, Sanofi was said to be jockeying with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for Swiss biotech Actelion Pharmaceuticals.""The revenue loss may theoretically cause Sanofi to continue to increase its M&A activity and we have written BioMarin makes a good fit because of its pure play orphan franchises, which are synergistic with Sanofi's orphan franchises,"" RBC analyst Michael Yee said Friday in a research note.Yee estimates BioMarin as a $20 billion to $21 billion deal, slightly above Sanofi's acquisition price of Genzyme for $20 billion several years ago. He has an outperform rating and 125 price target on BioMarin stock.Leerink analyst Joseph Schwartz sees The Medicines Co. appealing to Regeneron, Sanofi or any parties interested in the PCSK9 space. The Medicines Co. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) have partnered on inclisiran, a drug aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol.Schwartz notes in the aftermath of the Praluent injunction, set to go into effect in 30 days, that inclisiran is ""second in line to come to market in the PCSK9 space."" A New England Journal of Medicine article describes inclisiran as an RNA interference therapeutic inhibitor of PCSK9.In November, The Medicines Co. and Alnylam delivered strong results for inclisiran in a phase two trial. Investors should expect more clarity on phase three testing in Q1, Schwartz wrote. He has an outperform rating on shares of The Medicines Co.RELATED:Regeneron, Sanofi LDL-Buster At Risk After Judge Upholds Amgen PatentsMedtronic Downgraded On Increased Boston, St. Jude, J&J Rivalries

334,JNJ,"While exchange traded funds are ideal for producing short- and long-term investment gains, many ETFs can be deployed to generate steady income from stock dividends and bond interest.ETF investment strategies for generating income fall into five main categories:The highest yielding U.S. bond ETF tracked by Morningstar Inc. right now is SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond (JNK). Its 12- month yield sits near 6%. It's followed by First Trust Tactical High Yield (HYLS) yielding 5.6% and SPDR Short-Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) yielding 5.5%.But seeing a fat yield on an ETF can be misleading. A big payout doesn't mean as much if the fund's total return is slipping. JNK has returned 11.31% year to date and an average annual 2.53% the past three years. That compares with 7.16% and 4.13% for HYLS and 10.8% and 1.64% for SJNK.Ranked by three-year returns, the top performer is Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury (ZROZ), up an average annual 18.39% the past three years and 20.44% year to date, and yielding just over 2%. It is followed by Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV), up 17.1% and 18.6% over the respective periods, and yielding 2.4%. Next is iShares 20 Year Treasury Bond, at 11.8% and 13.1%, and yielding 2.2%.Junk bonds and long-duration Treasury bonds are subject to bouts of heightened volatility, which investors looking for income often seek to avoid. So they're better off using ETFs that track these kinds of bonds as part of a diversified portfolio that contains steadier bonds.The benchmark for diversified bond portfolios is the Barclays Aggregate Bond index, which is made up of a broad array of investment-grade bonds. The index is tracked by iShares Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Fund (AGG), which has $190 billion in assets. It's up 5% year to date and an average annual 3.96% the past three years. It yields 2.3%.Those who prefer bonds need to be aware that anticipated interest-rate hikes could affect potential returns.In general, bond ETFs with higher durations will be more negatively impacted than those with shorter durations as expectations increase for higher rates. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of bond price to changes in interest rates. Duration is tied to a bond's maturity, or the date at which the bond's principal is repaid to lenders. Investors can check an ETF's website for the average duration.For example, if rates rise, a long-term ETF such as iShares 20 Year Treasury (TLT) incurs more interest rate risk than iShares 3-7 Year Treasury (IEI), notes Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF Research at S&P Global Market Intelligence.""In short, if rates trend higher over time, returns for bond ETFs will be negatively impacted, but not equally,"" he said. ""However, one rate hike by the Fed should not be that impactful.""The highest yielding ETFs can bring big payouts, but if the quality of their holdings declines, the total return could be sapped by declining prices in unfavorable markets. The top yielding dividend stock ETF is Global X SuperDividend Alternatives (ALTY), paying out 8.2% of its stock price annually. It's a small, young ETF with just $3 million in assets and without a three-year record. It's up almost 19% this year.Its older and bigger sibling, $807.4 million Global X SuperDividend (SDIV), yields 6.7% and has gained 12% this year and an average annual 11.27% the past three years.High-yield stock investors tend to prefer stocks whose declines are about over. In that way investors can reap big payouts for each dollar invested with the hopes of capital appreciation as the business turns around. Not all ETFs screens for stocks in this way. One that does is Global X SuperDividend U.S. ETF (DIV). Its index methodology screens for stocks that have exhibited low betas relative to the S&P 500 in an effort to produce low-volatility of returns. It's up 9% this year and has risen an average annual 6.8% the past three years. Top holdings include Cone Midstream Partners (CNNX) and Invesco Mortgage Capital (IVR).At the other end of the spectrum, lower yielding ETFs invest in companies that have a long history of increasing dividends. Only top quality companies can increase payouts year after year, and they tend to be in big demand by investors looking for steady capital appreciation. Their stock prices rarely get whacked to the point where they have big yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) tracks the Nasdaq U.S. Dividend Achievers Select Index. It holds 185 stocks, each of which has grown dividends annually for 10 years or more. It yields 2.1% vs. SPDR S&P 500's (SPY) 2%. Top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Microsoft (MSFT) and Pepsi (PEP)ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (NOBL) holds 50 stocks, a smaller list that reflects a higher barrier to entry -- each holding has raised dividends every year for 25 years or more. It yields 1.8%. Top holdings include Cintas (CTAS), W.W. Grainger (GWW) and S&P Global (SPGI).SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), which invests in dividend aristocrats from the S&P Composite 1500, has jumped 15% year to date. It yields 2.4%. Top holdings include property REIT HCP (HCP), People's United Financial (PBCT) and Caterpillar (CAT).Safe to say, MLPs are best left to the pros who know when to get in or out, or how to use them as portfolio diversifiers.Morningstar tracks 20 REIT ETFs. The top-performing one year to date is Global X SuperDividend REIT (SRET). It's up 27.4% this year and yields about 8%, the third-highest. The index it tracks, the Solactive Global SuperDividend REIT index, invests in 30 of the highest dividend-yielding REITs in the world with the least amount of volatility.Nearly all of the $33 million ETF's assets are invested in North America. Top holdings include mortgage REITs Annaly Capital Management (NLY), which yields 10.1%, and Chimera Investment (CIM), yielding nearly 12%, as well as property REIT Senior Housing Properties Trust (SNH) yielding 6.6%. The REIT was launched in March 2015.The biggest REIT ETF is $35.59 billion Vanguard REIT (VNQ). It's up 14% year to date and yields 3.3%. Its top holdings along with their year-to-date price performance include Simon Property (SPG), up 12%, Public Storage[ticker symb=PSA] down 7%, and Prologis (PLD) up 30%. They all yield about 3%.Convertible bonds are bonds that can be exchanged for a set number of the issuing company's common stock. They tend to carry lower interest than normal corporate bonds but have the potential for greater price appreciation.The top performing ETF in this area year to date is $471 million VanEck Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials (PFXF). It's up 12% and yields 5.6%. The largest is $17.86 billion iShares U.S. Preferred Stock (PFF). It's up 3.8% this year and yields 5.74%.RELATED:The Latest ETF News

335,JNJ,"Small biotech Lexicon Pharmaceuticals (LXRX) soared as much as 25% Friday after its diabetes drug succeeded in a late-stage trial.Lexicon's drug sotagliflozin significantly reduced A1C, a type of hemoglobin used to measure glucose levels in plasma, in patients with Type 1 diabetes.Sotagliflozin is a combination of an SGLT2 inhibitor similar to Eli Lilly's (LLY) Jardiance and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana, with an SGLT1 inhibitor that helps regulate glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract.The study did not see an increase in severe hypoglycemia, though there was a dose-related increase in diabetic ketoacidosis, reaching 3% in the higher-dose arm.IBD'S TAKE: Lexicon hit a new 52-week high, and it's always a good idea to check IBD's New Highs list. But hitting a new high isn't the be-all and end-all for a good stock, as our New Highs page explains.The Type 1 diabetes market is a fraction of the size of the Type 2 market, but Lexicon said it will start phase three trials in Type 2 this year in collaboration with French pharma Sanofi (SNY).""We think its dual mechanism of action as an SGLT-1/SGLT-2 inhibitor could differentiate it from marketed SGLT-2 inhibitors in Type 2 diabetes, and we assume peak sales could exceed $2 billion in this indication,"" wrote Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen in a research note last November. ""While Lexicon will now see smaller realized sales in Type 1 diabetes, in the form of double-digit royalties from Sanofi, this deal also opens up significant potential in Type 2 diabetes.""Lexicon stocked ended up 17% on the stock market today, at 17.85, a nearly three-year high. Sanofi stock, though, fell 2.2%, to 39.19.RELATED:Sanofi Rival To Mylan's EpiPen Had TroublesEli Lilly Upgraded On Pipeline Prospects

337,JNJ,"Medical behemoths Amgen (AMGN) and Biogen (BIIB) could square off to acquire muscle biologist Cytokinetics (CYTK), while more than a dozen potential players prep for an M&A donnybrook over small-cap Adamas Pharmaceuticals (ADMS), Needham analysts suggested Friday.Biotech M&A fodder heated up this week as Allergan (AGN) announced back-to-back deals to acquire Vitae Pharmaceuticals (VTAE) for $639 million and Tobira Therapeutics (TBRA) for $1.7 billion. The Tobira deal gives Allergan a leg up in the battle against nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), where Gilead (GILD) and Intercept (ICPT) Pharmaceuticals also compete.IBD's 420-company biotech industry group has climbed to No. 10 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 173 just 13 weeks ago. Collectively, the group has a $771 billion market cap, No. 11 among all groups. The group fell 0.7% Friday, its first decline in the past eight trading days. The group was up 3.8% for the week.Needham analysts reviewed R&D pipelines, business development areas of interest and M&A activity for 26 large companies to gauge how interested Big Pharma is in biotechs -- ""an important theme in the biotech space,"" they wrote in a research report.Since 2012, Allergan, Amgen, Bristol Myers-Squibb (BMY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Shire (SHPG) and Valeant (VRX) have been most acquisitive, buying (or prepping to buy) more than 100 companies, collectively. Shire has been most active, with 14 acquisitions.""We believe late-development-stage and commercial-stage biotech companies are particularly attractive acquisition targets,"" they wrote in a research report titled, ""What does Big Pharma want to buy?"" Peak areas of interest include oncology and cardiovascular, Needham research showed.But that may not be where Big Pharma takes its beaucoup bucks for M&A. Needham analysts suggested central nervous system (CNS) players Adamas and Acadia Pharmaceuticals, and liver disorder drugmaker Intercept could be of prime acquisition interest.Eight firms overlap in potential interest for Adamas and Acadia: AbbVie (ABBV), Allergan, Eli Lilly (LLY), Lundbeck, Merck, Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NVS), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) and Takeda Pharmaceutical.Needham lists 13 potential acquirers for Adamas, but Allergan makes particular sense considering the duo already partner on the next-generation formulation of memantine and the fixed-dose combination product Namzaric, both of which battle Alzheimer's.By year's end, Adamas plans to file a new drug application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for ADS-5102, a treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesia -- involuntary movements -- in Parkinson's disease patients and multiple sclerosis walking impairments, Needham wrote.Meanwhile, Acadia's 11 potential suitors could be interested in Nuplazid, a drug to ease psychosis associated with Parkinson's launched earlier this year. Needham suggests Acadia could be looking to expand the label for other uses.Similarly, Intercept could draw interest from nearly a dozen potential buyers including Gilead, No. 2 biotech by market cap. On Thursday, an RBC analyst posited Intercept would continue to lead Gilead and Allergan in the battle against NASH.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech stocks notched higher this week, up about 4% since last week.

338,JNJ,"Shares of diabetes giant Novo Nordisk (NVO) jumped Friday after the company said its drug Victoza reduced heart attacks and strokes.Novo released few details about the results of the study, which it's saving for the next American Diabetes Association meeting in June. However, it did say that there was a statistically significant reduction in all three of its metrics -- heart attack, stroke and death from all cardiovascular causes -- among the 9,000 patients taking the diabetes drug over five years, compared to the placebo group. The subjects were all over age 50 and either had cardiovascular disease or multiple risk factors.Novo Nordisk's stock was up about 8% in afternoon trading on the stock market today, near 57. It's the highest-rated stock in the low-rated Medical-Ethical Drugs group, with a Composite Rating of 82.The effect of diabetes drugs on cardiovascular health has been the subject of several studies lately, notably from Eli Lilly (LLY), whose drug Jardiance reduced deaths from heart failure by 32% in a similar large, long-term study reported last September. On the other hand, Merck's (MRK) Januvia showed no effect either good or bad in its outcomes trial reported a few months earlier.A similarly neutral result was reported for an outcomes trial of the Sanofi (SNY) drug lixisenatide, which is noteworthy because lixisenatide is in the same class as Victoza. Both are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, similar to Bydureon from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Lilly's Trulicity, while Jardiance is an sglt2 inhibitor, in the same class as Invokana from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Farxiga from AstraZeneca. Merck's Januvia belongs to another class, called DPP-4 inhibitors.On a conference call with analysts Friday, Novo's Chief Scientific Officer Mads Thomsen said that the different results may have come from subtle differences between the drugs, which he thinks extend to Victoza's planned successor, semaglutide.""It's not only the question of being a member of the given class of GLP-1 agonist,"" said Thomsen. ""It's also a part of the kinetics, dynamics, distribution, half-life, and so on. And as we got semaglutide, we have done rather detailed investigations. . . . There is nothing from the animal pharmacology to negate the notion that semaglutide should do at least as well on cardiovascular performance.""

339,JNJ,"The top five stocks held by institutional investors in the fourth quarter were Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CNBC said, citing eVestment data.The order for those five is unchanged from Q3, but the breadth of institutional fund ownership increased during Q4 for all five. That contrasts with top fund managers like Carl Icahn, who trimmed his stake in Apple by 7 million shares in Q4.The added institutional ownership of Apple also came amid reports that demand for the iPhone was cooling off.Meanwhile, the eVestment's top 20 for the first time included Facebook (FB), which debuted at No. 16.But reordering the top 20 by IBD Composite Rating yields a different mix. The highest five are Alphabet, Facebook, Verizon Communications (VZ), Home Depot (HD)] and Comcast (CMCSA).Alphabet has a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Google restructured last fall to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet, which includes a variety of advanced projects, sometimes far afield from Web search.Alphabet's Q4 results showed that core businesses like search were strong.

344,JNJ,"U.S. stock indexes kept to a recent tendency of small moves Thursday afternoon, a pattern that appeared headed for a fifth straight session.The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 fell slightly lower, while the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1%. The small-cap Russell 2000 also was flat. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq.Bulls and bears are both looking for a catalyst to drive the market either clearly north or clearly south. But so far, the stock market has failed to find the tipping point.Among widely held stocks, Apple (AAPL) staged a positive reversal.

345,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) CEO Alex Gorsky ""underwhelmed"" investors Tuesday after a meeting with President Trump reportedly fixated on tax and regulatory policies rather than drug pricing, Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said Wednesday.Gorsky was among a dozen business leaders Trump met with on his first full day in the White House, says Business Insider. Among them were Tesla Motors (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Ford Motor (F) CEO Mark Fields and Lockheed Martin (LMT) CEO Marillyn Hewson.But Trump didn't focus on drug pricing, Gorsky told analysts on the company's Q4 earnings conference call. Trump has called out Big Pharma in recent weeks, saying they're ""getting away with murder"" by raising prices. Some studies have shown pharmaceuticals raise their product prices by 10% annually, on average.Monday's meeting had a different tenor, Gorsky said. ""It really focused more on overall economic growth and, as we mentioned earlier, one of the things around tax, regulatory and other policies, and that those are really the major drivers of the conversation,"" he said on the call.IBD'S TAKE: Johnson & Johnson had seven drugs approved from 2012-16. How do other drugmakers and biotechs stack up? Read more at IBD Industry Themes.In a research note, Rubin says the commentary did little to ""quell investor nervousness"" on the issue. Drug and biotech stocks are largely down since Trump's pledge late last year to curb spiraling drug prices. Johnson & Johnson stock has lost 7% since Nov. 9.Although he sees not much upside in 2017 for Big Pharma, Rubin predicts a series of megamergers and smaller acquisitions. Johnson & Johnson is currently working to acquire European biotech Actelion. At one time, Sanofi (SNY) was reportedly interested in buying Actelion, but didn't issue a formal bid.On Tuesday, J&J executives wouldn't comment on the exclusive talks with Actelion. But comments on the call suggest J&J will pursue deals in 2017, RBC analyst Glenn Novarro wrote in his research report.""While our expectation of a deal announcement in conjunction with earnings did not materialize,"" said Novarro, ""management's comments on the call suggest that Johnson & Johnson will remain active on the M&A front in 2017.""He kept his outperform rating on J&J stock, but lowered his price target to 128 from 133.On the stock market today, Johnson & Johnson stock rose 0.9% to 112.80, after falling 1.9% on Tuesday.RELATED:J&J Hep C Sales Dip To 'Virtually Zero,' Mirroring Gilead; 2017 Views LagGilead, Merck, Alexion 2017 Views Hazy; Biogen May Surge: AnalystJohnson & Johnson In Exclusive Talks To Acquire Actelion After Sanofi Fray

346,JNJ,"The stock market started February smelling like a skunk and ended the month looking like a phoenix rising from the ashes -- and U.S. stock mutual funds followed suit.U.S. diversified stock mutual funds ended the month with a 0.15% decline on average, extending their 6.25% debacle recorded in January, according to Lipper Inc. To get to near break-even, the funds had to work through a stock market that shaved a 6% mid-month decline in the S&P 500 to a 0.14% loss by month's end.February's late-month rally was fueled by a surge in the price of oil. The U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude benchmark went from $26.05 per barrel on Feb. 11 to $33.40 on Feb. 29.Click Here To See List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month LeadersThe price rise began amid reports that Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Qatar were discussing a freeze in oil production levels.""But the market rally wasn't just because of oil,"" said David Joy, chief market strategist for Ameriprise Financial. ""We got an upward revision in the fourth-quarter GDP. Data on personal income and spending both moved higher. We got a stronger-than-expected durable goods order number.""The income and spending figures were especially welcome. They suggested that consumer spending -- the linchpin of economic growth -- is on the rise, Joy said.In addition, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released its personal consumption expenditure (PCE) deflator number, which showed an uptick in inflationary pressure. ""That fueled expectations of a Federal Reserve rate increase,"" Joy said.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category PerformanceAlso, bond yields rose in the back half of the month. ""That helped banks, and a lot of investors feel the market can't move higher unless financials participate and perhaps lead,"" Joy said.Still, ""aside from oil and other raw-material stocks, February's other leading sectors were defensive and bearish,"" said Rich Weiss, senior portfolio manager of American Century’s target-date One Choice Portfolios.Precious metals funds led sectors, soaring 30.99% last month. Commodities precious metals funds were next, jumping 7.08%. Basic materials funds vaulted 6.59%. Commodities base metals climbed 2.95%. Industrials rose 2.50%.February strength in those sectors suggested that global demand may have bottomed in January. Maybe, just maybe, it was stabilizing in February, Joy said.A 0.96% February gain made mid-cap value funds the best-performing category among all U.S. diversified stock funds in the month.Top large-cap growth managers included Will Danoff, whose Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) slid 1.18% last month.Foreign stock funds fared worse than U.S. funds. They lost 1.58% on average. Emerging markets, led by China, are ""in a clear (economic) deceleration mode,"" Weiss said.""In economic terms, we're doing better than Europe and Japan,"" Joy said.Taxable bond funds overall advanced 0.36% in February. U.S. Treasury funds led, gaining 1.66%.So what's next? Many investors want to see dramatic cuts in oil production. ""But I'll take a situation where all oil does is stabilize in the mid-30s range,"" Joy said. ""Keep in mind that low oil is also a benefit to consumers (as well as many manufacturers and other businesses). If the energy sector can stabilize, then maybe in the second half of the year, other sectors -- especially U.S.-oriented ones -- can do better and produce earnings gains.""Low oil prices already seem to have helped boost automotive sales, especially for gas-thirsty SUVs. Housing, restaurants and travel also seem to have benefited, Joy said. ""But not department stores. But consumer discipline also helps economic expansions in the long run.""Economic softness in Japan and Europe has recently forced Ameriprise strategists to question their late-2015 forecast that those regions can outperform the U.S., Joy said.""Emerging markets are worthy of underweights,"" he added. ""They're still buffeted by declining global trade, weak commodity prices and diverging central policies around the globe.""Joy continued, ""Developed markets are still the place to be, but whether the U.S. will outperform is an open question."" Still, the U.S. is outperforming Europe and Japan.As for China, ""at the beginning of the year and continuing through the Lunar New Year (beginning Feb. 8), investors had real concern about China devaluing its currency and getting a competitive advantage. But the value of the yuan vs. the U.S. dollar is actually a little stronger now, so fears of additional devaluation have receded -- not gone away, but receded.""American Century's Weiss has a relatively cautious outlook. He says U.S. consumer spending is the strongest part of the global economic jigsaw puzzle. ""And it just doesn't make sense that the fate of the entire global economy can rest solely on the U.S. consumer,"" he said. ""I can't think of a healthy recovery (being plausible) where the only bright spot is the U.S. consumer.""Still, he says U.S. companies generally look stronger going forward than European, Japanese and emerging market businesses.For the next one to two years, he expects current macro conditions to continue. ""My outlook is sideways with a lot of volatility,"" he said. ""I don't expect a nightmare for investors, just little if any returns, with a lot of volatility.""Weiss advises investors who rely on diversified strategies to tilt more into defensive sectors. ""We've already rotated into more defensive positions, not selling out of stocks and going into cash.""He added, ""You should move from high-beta, high-growth, FANG strategies, which have done well in recent years."" FANG refers to Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google.Weiss also urges investors to consider shifting assets from emerging markets and foreign stocks to equity income funds. The $9 billion American Century Equity Income Fund's (TWEAX) top holdings include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which has a strong 82 Composite Rating from IBD and a dividend yield of 2.8%.The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Strength ratings, with 99 being the highest. American Century Equity Income's top holdings also include Sysco (SYY), which has an 86 Comp Rating and a 2.8% dividend yield; and One Gas (OGS), which has a 94 Comp Rating and a dividend yield of 2.4%.Top new buys by the fund include Atmos Energy (ATO), which has a 92 Comp Rating and a 2.4% dividend yield.Weiss urges investors with even more risk tolerance to consider strategies like American Century Global Allocation (AGAVX). In addition to shifting more money into defensive-style assets, the fund has boosted weightings in VIX futures to hedge equity market risks, Weiss says.The four-year-old fund has $21.7 million in assets. It achieves its target global allocations by investing in other American Century funds. As of Nov. 30, the fund had 23.5% of its money in foreign stocks, 17.5% in U.S. stocks, 29% in bonds and 30% in alternatives. Alternatives included 7% in currencies, sector ETFs and volatility instruments.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Volume in the stock market today was running a bit higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. the previous session.Firearms stocks reversed lower despite good news on U.S. background-check data for February. The government reported 2.61 million checks in February, up 2.6% from January and up 40.5% vs. the year-earlier period. Last year, background checks rose 10.4%.Background checks are considered a rough estimate of industrywide sales.Firearms maker Smith & Wesson (SWHC) rose slightly at the open and then reversed to a 3% loss. Volume was running 70% above average in the morning but then slowed to less than 20% above average.Funds eased their collective exposure in Smith & Wesson about 5% in Q3 and then almost 13% in Q4.Gunmaker Sturm Ruger (RGR) rose 0.7% by late morning but then reversed to a 2% loss.

348,JNJ,"Shares of medical-device giant Medtronic (MDT) dipped sharply Tuesday after its fiscal Q3 sales missed estimates, though earnings and guidance were in line with expectations.Medtronic's earnings for the quarter ended Jan. 29 totaled $1.06 a share excluding one-time items, down 1% from the year-earlier quarter and matching the consensus number calculated by Thomson Reuters' survey of analysts. Sales jumped 61% to $6.93 billion, though adjusted for last year's buyout of Covidien, as well as foreign-exchange rates, sales increased just 6%. This was about $55 million below consensus.Medtronic affirmed its full-year guidance of $4.36 to $4.40 in EPS, which includes 45 to 50 cents of foreign-currency impact. It did not guide Q4 earnings but said sales should grow 5% to 5.5% excluding the foreign-currency impact, which it sees amounting to $180 million to $220 million.Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy wrote that the sales miss was largely due to higher-than-expected foreign-exchange headwinds, but there were a few signs of trouble.""U.S. sales growth did slow a bit, coming in at 4% growth vs. our 6% projection and representing a deceleration from the 6% growth seen in (fiscal) Q2 2016 and the 14% growth seen in (fiscal) Q1 2016,"" Antalffy wrote. ""This slowing growth is likely in large part attributable to increasingly difficult comparables and, to us, doesn't yet suggest an alarming signal of a broad-based slowdown.""Medtronic did deliver positive operating leverage quarter-over-quarter, with EBIT margins of 27.8% vs. 27.4% last quarter, but this improvement fell below guidance of 28.0%-28.5% and our 28.5% estimate. This now leaves the increasingly positive operating leverage story very much back-end-loaded, with Medtronic having to deliver Q4 operating margins of at least 33.5% to hit its prior guidance for 29%-31% as reported for full-year 2016.""Antalffy also noted that Medtronic's competitors similarly missed sales estimates in the most recent quarter -- among them St. Jude Medical (STJ), Boston Scientific (BSX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) -- making Medtronic's quarter look good in comparison.Medtronic stock was down almost 5% in late-morning trading on the stock market today, near 74.

351,JNJ,"After a typically slow stretch in late August, biotech news is bound to pick up as companies prepare for the fall season of conferences and investor days. Some of the most stock-moving events will likely be updates on key clinical trials, with several expected in September.• Celgene (CELG) is due to release long-awaited midstage trial results on GED-0301, or mongersen, a drug for Crohn's disease that it licensed in 2014 for $700 million. The drug initially sparked some excitement on Wall Street because of its strong two-week remission rate, which beat even the leading injected anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs, such as AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel. But the next data set will cover a full year and evaluate patients by endoscopy rather than just symptoms.Investors' confidence was somewhat shaken when Celgene refused to provide an interim analysis on the trial, which some interpreted as a lack of confidence in the numbers. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote that a close inspection of earlier data also raises red flags.""If the trial is consistent with the earlier phase I/II result (on which the original investment was made), the endoscopic remission rate would be in the 60-70% range, which is well above that seen with even the best biologicals or immunomodulators,"" Porges wrote in a July 25 research note. ""In fact, our assessment of the earlier results, and the lack of CRP (C-reactive protein) response, which is a biomarker of Crohn's disease inflammatory activity, suggests to us that the result could be materially lower than the anti-TNFs, with remission rates more likely to be in the 20-30% range.""He noted that since GED-0301 is oral rather than injected, it could still find a market niche, though it would not be the mega-blockbuster initially hoped for.IBD'S TAKE: The Medical-Biotech group has been on a roll lately, rising from No. 126 to No. 20 in IBD's Industry Group Rankings in the last eight weeks. To see what other industries are hot, follow our Industry Themes column.• Kite Pharma (KITE) is expected to release headline data from Zuma-1, a phase-two trial of its CAR-T cell therapy KTE-019 in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. CAR-T cells, or chimeric antigen receptor-T cells, are genetically engineered to attack cancerous cells. The trial results are crucial because Kite hopes to use them to file for FDA approval of the treatment, which could make it the first CAR-T therapy to hit the market next year.RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimated Friday that the study would yield a 60% to 70% overall response rate (percent of tumors that shrank) and perhaps a 40% complete response rate (tumor disappearance) based on earlier data. But in an initiation report Tuesday, BTIG analyst Dane Leone wrote that much depends on how the data stack up against results from competitors Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Novartis (NVS), which is as yet unknown.""Novartis may present pivotal data sets at ASH 2016 along with the potential for first data from J&J's CD19 bi‐specific antibody,"" wrote Leone, referring to the American Society for Hematology conference in December. ""Juno is also expected to present clinical updates from ongoing CD19 trials.""• Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) should provide a report on its ""triplet"" pills for cystic fibrosis, consisting of its already marketed drug, ivacaftor (Kalydeco), combined with experimental drug VX-661 and one of two additional drugs, VX-152 and VX-440.Another trial of ivacaftor and VX-661 alone recently failed, but it did present a clean safety profile and analysts have been expecting a triplet to be the next-generation treatment in any case.Also this month, the FDA is due to render a verdict on whether to expand the label on Vertex's already marketed CF drug Orkambi to children aged 6 to 11.RELATED:Is EpiPen's Price The FDA's Fault?

352,JNJ,"Pokemon Go has racked up some amazing numbers since its July 6 launch: nearly 55 million U.S. users in its first month, including a peak of about 21 million daily active users spending more than a half-hour a day playing the game that's free to download.The most impressive number of all may be the billions of calories burned by kids out to catch the Nintendo (NTDOY) anime creatures. Yet there's one number that's bound to underwhelm: its impact on GDP. And that's nothing new when it comes to today's breakthrough technologies and products.Technological innovation is making people richer, but not necessarily in ways that pay the bills. In terms of good-paying jobs, it's had a bite-size impact since the dot-com boom.A common feature of some of today's most transformative tech innovations is that the end users often don't have to pay anything. SocialFlow, a social media management company, estimated this spring that the free publicity that Donald Trump's presidential campaign got from social networks like Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR) and Snapchat was equal to $380 million in paid advertising.Among the reasons that the U.S. economy has been in a prolonged growth slump is because of the way GDP is measured. GDP excludes what is known as the consumer surplus, which is how much value people derive from something in excess of how much they have to pay.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook may not be generating many jobs by historical standards of innovative companies, but it's been lucrative for investors. The social networking giant broke out of a base with a 121.18 buy point in late July. The stock moved sideways until breaking out again from a short consolidation with a 128.43 entry point. Click here for Facebook stock chart analysis.While the consumer surplus is hard to quantify, some economic analysts think it's huge.""By our usual GDP measurements WhatsApp is worth nothing ... or perhaps $100 million (if measured in terms of the income of its engineers). And yet there's some 1 billion people getting some to all of their telecoms and communications needs from this service,"" wrote Forbes columnist Tim Worstall, a fellow at the London-based Adam Smith Institute.While millions of people are playing Pokemon Go for free, many others are spending money on in-app purchases to help speed their progress in the game. The most up-to-date stats reveal that the mobile game has grossed $440 million worldwide, meaning Pokemon Go has eclipsed the earnings of some summer blockbuster movies.That sounds pretty huge, but when you consider that 500 million people have downloaded Pokemon Go, and 30 million to 40 million have played the game for about a half-hour each day, the spending comes out to something less than 50 cents for an hour of play — roughly one-tenth of the cost of an hour at the movies.Although it's unclear whether the Pokemon Go craze contributed to the summer movie slump, it is clear that people are deriving a lot more in value from the game than they are paying out of pocket. Shortly after the game's launch, researchers Michael Farren and Adam Millsap at George Mason University's Mercatus Center figured that Pokemon Go players were easily getting more than $7 in value for every $1 spent — ""even if the average consumer surplus is only a measly dollar an hour.""It's worth considering that playing Pokemon Go requires the GPS capability that comes with every smartphone and that we all now take for granted. In his 2012 book,  ""Abundance: The Future Is Better Than You Think,"" XPrize founder Peter Diamandis offered a reminder of just how much we take for granted. Taking decades-old list prices for the GPS, videoconferencing, digital voice recorder, video camera, digital camera, encyclopedia, music player, video game console and everything else that comes included, he calculated that there's more than $900,000 worth of applications in every smartphone.The implication is that traditional measurements vastly understate the impact of recent technological innovation in boosting our quality of life. Yet, when it comes to the things most people think of when they think about financial well-being — the number of good-paying jobs and the size of the economic pie as defined by GDP — the current era of technological innovation has fallen short.Technology leaders such as Apple (AAPL), Facebook, Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) have transformed how we connect — to friends, politicians, businesses and information. So you'd expect to see a dramatic impact on employment and output.Yet in those terms, the companies don't compare to some older industries.Apple, Google and Facebook, three of the largest companies by market capitalization, combined, employed only about 185,000 worldwide at the end of their 2015 fiscal years. By contrast, General Motors (GM) had 653,000 U.S. workers at its 1979 peak.Facebook's 12,691 employees generated $17.9 billion in revenue in the latest fiscal year, or $1.4 million per employee. Alphabet, despite staffing up to pursue other bets that so far amount to less than 1% of its revenue, generated $1.2 million per worker.When Alphabet releases a Google Maps update, it can go to everyone with relative ease. When General Motors introduces a new model, it has to retool factories, make each car or truck individually, then transport them to far-flung dealerships for sale. All of that takes labor, often highly paid.Apple's $2.1 million per employee doesn't really compare, given its large contract-manufacturing workforce. Meanwhile, an average Microsoft (MSFT) employee generates a more moderate $800,000 in revenue.Outside the tech sector, revenue per employee is lower still. General Electric (GE) is at $350,000 and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at $550,000. General Motors is at $700,000, excluding its network of independent dealers.IBD'S TAKE: High revenue per worker generally translates into high profit margins. Look for companies whose margins are high relative to its competitors and either steady or growing. For a primer, read this Investor's Corner. IBD makes research easier with a proprietary SMR Rating that combines sales growth, profit margins and return on equity. Visit IBD Stock Checkup to see how your stocks rate.As for tech employment overall, the sector took 15 years to finally top its 2000 dot-com peak of 6.6 million jobs. After adding nearly 200,000 jobs in 2015, it now employs 6.7 million people, the Computing Technology Industry Association said earlier this year.The reason it took so long was the big shift in tech manufacturing out of the U.S., as the dot-com bust and China's emergence led to a wave of outsourcing. From the end of 2000 through 2015, the U.S. tech industry shed more than 800,000 factory jobs, or 44%. More than a half million of those jobs were gone by the end of 2003.In this context of slow economic growth, weak wage gains and anger over the lost factory jobs, Donald Trump has made it a campaign speech staple to pledge that if he's elected, Apple will make its iPhones in the U.S., not in China.The logistics of shifting production from China, where some 250,000 Foxconn workers assemble the iPhone, are daunting and would entail intensive training of U.S. workers. If it were feasible, it would substantially raise the cost of an iPhone — even if the U.S. workers made little more than the minimum wage.Instead of a tech job boom, jobs in health care, social assistance, leisure, hospitality, retail and government account for 99.5% of all net employment gains dating back to the end of 2000, Labor Department data show. Since mid-2007, those sectors minus government account for about 94% of net new nonfarm jobs.That helps explain why productivity gains have been so weak since the recession, says Lakshman Achuthan of the Economic Cycle Research Institute.""Economic growth, such as it is, has been skewed toward growth in the number of hours worked, largely in lower-wage service sector jobs, while capital investment has taken a huge hit"" in the aftermath of the Great Recession, Achuthan wrote.While companies outside the tech sector have bolstered tech employment internally, the surprising truth is that the latest wave of innovation has benefited relatively few workers directly, and the economywide impact also has been limited. Those facts help explain weak economic growth, weak wage growth and the rise of political populism.If productivity, a measure of output per worker hour, had continued to grow at its pre-2004 rate, the economy would be about 15% bigger, calculates University of Chicago economics professor Chad Syverson. That's another $2.7 trillion, or $21,900 per household. If that had been the case, one can imagine that the 2016 election cycle would sound a whole lot less angry.Instead, productivity growth has crawled at an average 0.5% a year over the past half-decade, Labor Department data show. That compares to 2.4% annual gains over the prior two decades.Even when you strip out the productivity drag from falling capital intensity, which is the amount of capital per worker, the modest lift from the tech sector is clear.Multifactor productivity is the component of productivity growth that serves as ""a measure of innovation's contribution to growth"" because it reflects efficiency gains that aren't directly explained by the capital and labor inputs, explains economist Robert Gordon, a professor at Northwestern University.The digital revolution did help produce a decade of rapid multifactor productivity growth from 1995 to 2004 — an average of 1.4% a year. But ""the acceleration died out quickly because most of the economy had already benefited from the Internet revolution,"" Gordon argues in ""The Rise and Fall of American Growth.""Despite the rise of cloud computing, the app economy and social media over the past decade, multifactor productivity growth slowed to 0.4% a year.As George Mason University economist Tyler Cowen writes, ""While information technology remains the most likely source of future breakthroughs, Silicon Valley has not saved us just yet.""But technology has given entrepreneurs a low-cost platform for innovation. That lets relatively few people do big things. It also helps individuals to connect with people who want what they have to offer — from a spare room (Airbnb) to their back seat (Uber) to a handyman (TaskRabbit).In fact, the augmented reality technology behind Pokemon Go that lets players see Pikachu in their offline environment, is viewed as one likely source of future productivity gains.""AR, despite the Pokemon Go hype, is actually primarily a business tool application that facilitates increased productivity among work groups,"" writes Tim Mulligan of Midia Research.An internal study by Boeing (BA) found that trainees assembling a wing were 30% faster and 90% more accurate on their initial attempt thanks to getting their instructions via augmented reality instead of a desktop computer.Productivity growth was sluggish in the decade after Steve Jobs introduced the Mac. But one innovation built upon another and gave way to the internet era, so it's too early to rule out another productivity boom.

353,JNJ,"Sellers came into the stock market Tuesday, and there was some conviction behind the selling, as U.S. indexes basically mirrored the performance of European stock indexes.Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS) was an earnings winner, but retail leaders Home Depot (HD) and TJX (TJX) succumbed to selling.The Nasdaq lost 0.5%, hurt in part by weakness in biotech techs. The S&P 500 also fell 0.5%, as did the Dow Jones industrial average, weighed down by weakness in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Microsoft (MSFT). Volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq was tracking slightly higher than Monday's levels.At the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude oil for September delivery rose for the fourth straight session to settle at $46.58 a barrel, up 1.8%.

354,JNJ,"Stocks staged a late rally Friday to lift the major market indexes to a positive finish. The Dow Jones industrial average extended its win streak to 11.The Nasdaq led with a 0.2% advance, the S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Dow eked out a fractional gain. Small caps underpeformed with the Russell 2000 slipping 0.1%. Volume was lighter across the board vs. Thursday, according to preliminary numbers.Oil, banks and gold miners led the downside in the stock market today, while department stores, apparel retailers and heavy construction stocks outperformed. West Texas intermediate crude futures slid nearly 1% to $54.03 a barrel.Wal-Mart (WMT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were the Dow's biggest winners, rising 1.5% apiece. Financials and energy lagged with Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM) each down nearly 1% or more.Apple (AAPL) fell nearly 1% early but pared its losses to close 0.1% higher. The iPhone maker's shares have rallied 16% since breaking out from a cup-with-handle buy point early last month with a 118.12 buy point.Nvidia (NVDA) also staged an upside reversal, gaining nearly 1%, after slumping as much as 5% early. Shares plunged 9% Thursday after several analysts cut their ratings and price targets, saying the graphics chipmaker was overvalued. But Mizuho Securities and UBS reiterated their buy ratings and called the pullback a buying opportunity.Universal Display (OLED) surged 20% to an all-time high after the company reported Q4 results that beat forecasts and initiated a dividend of 3 cents a share. Shares are now more than 20% extended from a 67.98 handle buy point, in profit-taking range.Nordstrom (JWN) popped 6% to reclaim its 50-day line in fast trade after announcing mixed Q4 results and weak earnings guidance after the close Thursday. The department store retailer shrugged off a price target cut from Telsey Advisory Group to 50 from 52.On the downside, Acacia Communications (ACIA) gapped down 15% to a seven-month low as it continues its descent from a September peak. Needham lowered its price target to 100 from 125. The fiber optics products maker's Q4 results topped views, but its Q1 earnings outlook disappointed.Mobileye (MBLY), down more than 2% in heavy volume, was one of the IBD 50's biggest losers. No sell signals were triggered; the stock is just 8% below its 52-week high. Shares slipped back into a buy range from a 45.03 handle entry. Short-seller Citron Research gave the driver assistance technology company, which on Wednesday beat Q4 earnings and sales estimates, a 35 price target.Economic data on tap for Monday include durable goods orders and the pending home sales index, both for January.

355,JNJ,"Celgene (CELG), the No. 3 biotech by market cap, could rival Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Galapagos (GLPS), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB) with a Crohn's disease drug that topped efficacy expectations, the company said Sunday — prompting a boost in shares on Monday.In the stock market today, Celgene stock lifted 1.2% to 99.64, after briefly slipping to a three-month low below 98. Shares are down 18% this year. RBC analyst Michael Yee says politics are tamping down biotech stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs were the worst-performing group last Wednesday, as Supernus Pharmaceuticals and Prothena stocks toppled. Keep tabs on Industry Themes for your best stock bets.But Yee is bullish on GED-0301, Celgene's drug to combat Crohn's. In a recent study of 52 patients, GED-0301 showed improvements in CDAI (Crohn's disease activity index) and in SES-CD (simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease).Wall Street's eyes were more tuned to the latter. By week 12 of the trial, 37% of patients showed at least a 25% reduction in SES-CS, which would be a clinically meaningful endoscopic improvement, says Yee. By the CDAI metric, 67% showed a response and 48% were in remission by week 12.""This 37% is good and higher than expected, as our doctor expert said before the data that 25% of patients achieving this would be good, particularly as a convenient oral drug,"" Yee wrote in a research report Monday.Gilead's and Galapagos' filgotinib is in Phase 3 testing. Phase 2 didn't look at the SES-CD endpoint, so it can't be compared with Celgene's GED-0301, Yee wrote. J&J's Stelara showed the same improvement in 48% of patients at week eight, but that study included a placebo.Biogen also has MT-1301, a drug to treat inflammatory bowel disorder, going into Phase 3 testing. Crohn's as well as ulcerative colitis are both major categories of inflammatory bowel disorder.Yee models GED-0301 adding $1 billion to $2 billion in sales over time for Celgene, as the world moves to pills to treat Crohn's. J&J's Stelara is an injection.""We believe Celgene's promising early endoscopic improvements will get better over time and GED-0301 could be the Otezla of Crohn's disease — meaning even if not the most potent drug, it can still be a $1 billion-plus drug for Celgene if well tolerated, good safety, convenient, and good efficacy,"" he wrote.Credit Suisse analyst Alethia Young models $2.3 billion in peak sales for GED-0301. She has a 140 price target and outperform rating on Celgene stock. The next catalyst for Celgene stock will likely be when the firm presents 52-week data in 2017, Young said.""This will provide important clues around sustainability of mucosal healing,"" she wrote in her research report. ""Though seeing effects early is positive.""Some have suggested mucosal healing should be a therapeutic endpoint of testing for Crohn's drugs. Mucosal healing, or endoscopic remission, is associated with increased rates of clinical remission, according to the National Library of Medicine.RELATED:Celgene Among Biotechs That Could Top 'Wall Of Worry'Trio Of New Celegene Drugs Could Bring $3 Billion-Plus

356,JNJ,"The major indexes continued to yo-yo back and forth with an hour left in Thursday's session. But small caps continued to sell off hard.The Russell 2000 dropped more than 1%, topping a 0.9% slide on Wednesday. In contrast, the Dow Jones industrials poked slightly lower despite solid gains by components such as IBM (IBM), DuPont (DD) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).DuPont, up 1.8% to 69.89, is approaching a cup with long handle entry at 71.19, which is not far below the cup's left-side high of 75.72.The S&P 500 was off a bit more than 0.1%. The Nasdaq fell 0.5%. But the S&P 100, which houses the 100 largest firms by market cap, was up slightly. Volume was running more than 10% higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time Wednesday.While real estate-related plays slumped in the stock market today, banks attracted more buying as the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bond rose to almost 1.85%. Higher interest rates generally enable lenders to expand their profit margins in loan products.Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM), another Dow 30 component, rose nearly 0.8% to 69.57 in dull volume. The stock continues to rise further past a 65.08 buy point in a narrow cup with handle pattern, built within a much larger base structure. An investor could have also bought shares when JPMorgan cleared a secondary handle at 66.58. From that second buy point, the 5% permissible buy zone extends up to 69.91.JPMorgan rival Morgan Stanley (MS) was up nearly 1% to 33.89, rising nearly 3% past a 32.47 entry in a bottoming-style cup with handle base.Super-regionals are also rallying. SunTrust (STI) of Atlanta rallied nearly 1% to 45.97, up more than 3% past a cup with long handle entry at 44.42, before easing some. The 5% chase zone goes up to 46.64.SunTrust, which last week reported another quarter of single-digit top and bottom-line growth, boasts ultrareliable profitability and a 2.3% annualized dividend, better than the S&P 500's 2.11% yield as of Wednesday's close.SunTrust scores an excellent three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 3 on a scale of zero (stable) to 99 (wild). Steady profits give corporate boards the confidence to raise or maintain cash payouts to shareholders.IBD's super-regional banking group is up 1.2% so far in the stock market today. Also pacing the upside were the ship transport, trucking, water supply utility, education and dairy products industry groups, each up 1% or more.IBD'S TAKE: The cup with handle base is one of the most important chart patterns that an investor can learn to time their buys of great stocks.

360,JNJ,"The broad market rallied in the week ended Jan. 28. The S&P 500 was up 1.32%. U.S. diversified stock funds rose 0.90% on average, ending a four-week pullback, according to Lipper Inc.The week saw a number of conventional U.S. diversified stock mutual funds notch advances.That was in contrast to the prior week, when not a single U.S. diversified stock fund with more than $100 million in assets and which does not rely heavily on shorting, other hedging tactics, borrowing or huge cash stakes gained ground.The latest week was good news for investors in general and especially for those paying attention to their retirement planning.The top performer among U.S. diversified stock funds in the week was $408 million Nuance Concentrated Value Fund (NCAVX), which had only 24 holdings as of Oct. 31. It rewarded its investors with a 4.58% jump in the latest week.Nuance Investments calls itself a classic value investment firm. Its Concentrated Value fund typically holds 15 to 35 stocks of various market capitalizations.The fund had 93% of its money at work in U.S. stocks, according to Morningstar Inc. Another 4% were in foreign stocks. The balance was in cash.The midcap value fund has about 34% of its portfolio in midcaps. Another 37% of the fund consists of small and micro-cap stocks. Large caps account for 9% of the portfolio, while giant-cap stocks make up another 19%.The fund's website shows that industrials were its largest sector, with about 24% of assets as of Dec. 31. Energy was next, with 19%. Financials edged out utilities for the third and fourth spots, with 14.3% and 14% of assets respectively.Corrections Corp. of America (CXW), a top-10 holding, is a REIT holding correctional and detention facilities for federal, state and local authorities in 19 states and the District of Columbia.Shares were up 2.6% in the week. The stock has a so-so 78 Composite Rating from IBD. The Composite Rating combines IBD’s five stock-performance ratings, including EPS and RS Ratings, with 99 being the highest.Cameron International (CAM), a maker of oil and gas machinery and equipment, rose 10% in the week. The energy stock has a Comp Rating of 68.Cameron was driven by the week's key driver of the overall market rally. Oil's price rose during the week amid talks among Russia, Saudi Arabia and OPEC about possible production cuts. That solid stock market news more than offset investors' concerns raised in midweek when the Federal Reserve gave a cautious assessment of the global economy. The central bank said U.S. growth has slowed.Diageo (DEO), a British booze maker, rose 2.7% in the week.Also a top holding, Diageo has a 79 Comp Rating.Among other holdings, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) jumped 6.6% in the week. Sporting a good 81 Comp Rating, the health care products maker posted 5% fourth-quarter earnings per share growth during the week. That was an improvement after three quarters of EPS declines.Q4 sales were down and shy of analysts' consensus expectations. But the adjusted EPS gain of $1.44 beat views by 2 cents per share.Equity income funds led all U.S. diversified stock fund categories, gaining 1.98% in the week.Natural resources topped sector categories with a 5.79% gain in the week.Japanese funds' 5.78% gain led foreign stock fund categories.Taxable bond funds gained 0.61% in the week. Investors showed some appetite for risk as emerging markets local currency funds were the top performing taxable bond-fund group, up 2.50%.

363,JNJ,"The spectacular rise and even more spectacular collapse of Valeant Pharmaceuticals had multiple causes, but at the heart of the story was how much the biotech company relied on big drug price increases for growth.Not only did those price hikes make Valeant (VRX) politically unpopular, but they also meant the business was ultimately unsustainable. Money managers prefer biotechs and pharmas that produce drugs with growing customer demand, as signaled by growth in sales volume.""As you would think, the preferable avenue for revenue growth is through volume, as significant price increases (like we have seen over the past two years) can only be repeated for a few years,"" Leonard Yaffe, health care portfolio manager at Kessef Capital, told IBD in an email. ""The more the revenue increase is due to volume, the more value is assigned to the drug.""If you're hunting for big growth stocks, and biotechs catch your eye, looking past the headline revenue numbers can help you see which companies might have more sustainable -- and even accelerating -- growth. If volume growth lags sales increases, the company is leaning on price, which might not last.Most price increases are far more moderate than Valeant's 525% and 212% price hikes for heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel, respectively. But many companies regularly lift their prices well past the inflation rate, which can prop up revenue but disguise actual demand.IBD'S TAKE: Big caps can deliver still deliver big gains, often with less volatility than smaller-cap stocks. That's also true in biotech, which has some strong big-cap companies. Amgen and Biogen are among current residents of the IBD Big Cap 20.Comparing volume and revenue is worthwhile for another reason: If volume growth was more than overall revenue growth, this signals that a company is having to rebate more of its list price than it did last year to move product, and/or is rolling out the drug in countries that extracted a lower price (as is often the case in Europe). Investors don't like this either, because it signals that insurers and other payors are putting the thumbscrews on the company.""Payor mix obviously is very critical as well, as large, consolidated payors which cover many many lives have negotiating power and can pick/choose/rationalize products based on price, efficacy, alternatives etc.,"" Thomas Vandeventer, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management, told IBD in an email.Second-quarter earnings reports and conference call comments revealed that while some biotech giants and hot stocks relied almost solely on price increases for growth, others expanded mostly on volume increases, and still others credited a mix of both.Amgen (AMGN) was a classic example of leaning on price: Q2 revenue rose 6%, but volume growth was zero.Much of this stems from the age of Amgen's leading drugs. Its top-seller, rheumatoid-arthritis drug Enbrel, is over a decade old, and its volume shrank 2% in the quarter. But it still contributed 10% growth thanks to pricing.Two drugs that are even older, Epogen and Neupogen, shrank in both price and volume because they're facing new biosimilar competition. Newer drugs Prolia and Xgeva made up the difference by growing on both fronts. But this is one reason why, despite the fact that it beat Q2 estimates and raised guidance, Amgen stock initially dropped after the earnings report.In contrast to Amgen, Celgene's (CELG) revenue rose 22% in Q2, and 16 of those percentage points came from volume growth, according to the company. It didn't break the percentages down by individual drug like Amgen did, but the company said demand was good across the board.Celgene also beat forecasts and raised guidance for future sales and profit, and its stock jumped 3% after the report.Medivation (MDVN) demonstrates the sneaky power of rebating. The list price of prostate-cancer drug Xtandi -- for now, Medivation's only marketed drug -- rose 6% during the second quarter. But while revenue overall rose 17% -- a bit less than analysts expected -- volume grew 18%.""The growth in underlying demand for Xtandi was partially offset by a lower net price for Xtandi due to a year-over-year increase in the gross-to-net rate,"" said CFO Jennifer Jarrett on the Q2 earnings conference call, gross-to-net being industry-speak for the rebate level.Xtandi has been in a tight competition with Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga in the prostate-cancer market, and J&J has been undercutting its price. CVS Health's (CVS) recently released 2017 drug formulary passed over Xtandi for Zytiga for this reason.Following their Q2 reports, here's a rundown of how the other big biotechs are faring on the price vs. volume question:""In the United States, the lion's share from a change (on a) year-over-year basis is price, and is pretty stable unit trends on Tecfidera, pretty stable unit trends on Tysabri and modest, gradual decline on the interferon franchise (which includes Avonex and Plegridy),"" Clancy said. ""Ex-United States, we are not seeing any pricing (increases) on a year-over-year basis, and all of the gains are attributable to volume and unit expansion.""Biogen's overall revenue rose 12% in the quarter, beating expectations.Lead drug Soliris provides the vast majority of revenue, and its volume rose 15% on a 10% hike in sales. The rest of the top line came from newly launched drugs that have no year-over-year comparison.Incyte's revenue jumped 51% year over year, beating expectations.RELATED:Are Biotechs Making A Comeback: 5 Stocks To WatchBiotechs Are Making A Case For Leadership, But Is It A Good One?

Would it help your game to know in which large-cap stocks Fidelity's approximately 200 stock and stock-plus-bond mutual funds made some of their biggest second-quarter adds to and sells from?Todd Rosenbluth, S&P Global Market Intelligence director of mutual fund research, pored through the newly released SEC holdings disclosure of the second-largest mutual fund manager and compared it with past filings by the Boston-based behemoth, which had $1.4 trillion in long-term assets as of June 30.The snapshot of Q2 trades gives insight into what stocks Fidelity managers thought were worth getting into and what they were willing to trim.Information technology remained the fund giant's largest sector, with 23% of its collective assets as of June 30. That was the case even though many Fidelity managers sold shares in two tech titans, Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), in the second quarter. Fidelity trimmed its Microsoft share count by 20% compared with its Q1 stake. It peeled Apple back by 6.9%.Microsoft's stock fell 7% in Q2, but has rallied 13% since June 30. No word yet on whether Fidelity resumed buying.Apple's shares sank 12% in Q2, but have rallied 14% since then.In contrast, Fidelity beefed up its shares in home entertainment software stock Activision Blizzard (ATVI) by 92%. ""In Feburary 2016, ATVI completed its purchase of King Digital and reported first and second quarter results ahead of the Capital IQ consensus,"" Rosenbluth reported to clients. On Thursday afternoon shares were about where they closed at the end of Q2.The stock ended June 17% higher than where it began the quarter. It's been about flat since then.In the health care sector, Fidelity was both a net buyer and seller.Fidelity liked the prognosis for biotech firm Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) enough to graft an additional 48% onto its existing share count. That turned out to be a good call. In July, Vertex got FDA approval for a new cystic fibrosis drug, Rosenbluth notes. Now shares are up 15% since the end of Q2.Going in the other director, Fidelity sliced 18% from its Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stake and 3.8% from its UnitedHealth Group (UNH) holding. Both are about where they ended Q2.In other sectors, Fidelity added to its stakes in cell-tower owner American Tower (AMT), cable provider Charter Communications (CHTR) and carmaker Tesla Motors (TSLA). Fidelity added 20% to its positions in each.American Tower is about where it was on June 30. Charter is up 11%. The stock is seeing solid earnings estimate revision activity from analysts, says Zacks Equity Research. Still, Charter's telecom services-integrated industry group is ranked 66, down from 43 four weeks ago.Tesla is up fractionally from where it closed Q2.Among stocks that Fidelity trimmed in Q2 were Amazon (AMZN), cut by 1.3%, and Visa (V), shaved by 1.9%.Fidelity's largest stock mutual funds continue to hold many of the largest megacap stocks, even those that the fund family as a group trimmed in Q2, Rosenbluth said. The $19.4 billion Blue Chip Growth (FBGRX) has top-10 holdings in Apple and Visa. Other top 10 stocks included Tesla, which the complex added to.Blue Chip Growth is up 1.96% this year going into Thursday, vs. 3.42% for its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and 8.29% for the S&P 500.The $7.5 billion Dividend Growth (FDGFX) held trim targets Apple, Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft. Dividend Growth is up 5.02% this year.In separate data, Morningstar Inc. highlights stocks that funds have added to recently. The $109 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), managed by Will Danoff since 1990, has interesting adds.Contrafund, which is among the largest stock mutual funds available, has added to B2Gold. The Canadian-based gold producer runs mines globally. As of midday Friday, shares were up 209% so far this year.Earnings per share grew 95%, 69%, 46% and 52% the past four quarters. But note that the shares are trading just above 4 and have never reached 5.Contrafund holds about a dozen mining stocks and has boosted its stakes recently in half of them.Itau Unibanco (ITUB) is another name in which Contrafund has raised its stake. The Brazilian bank holding company's ADRs are up 73% so far this year.EPS has declined for six quarters in a row, but analysts see expect a 4% gain in the current quarter and a 5% increase in 2017.The company has a so-so Composite Rating from IBD of 78. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Comp Rating. You should look for stocks whose rating is 95 or higher, which means that they've outperformed 95% of all other stocks in terms of their Composite Rating.IBD'S TAKE: Alan Elliot explains why a high Comp Rating is not always a buy signal.Itau also has IBD's SMR Rating of B. SMR Ratings of A and B are the best.And Contrafund opened a stake in Applied Materials (AMAT) as of its latest disclosure.EPS went from a 4% decline three quarters ago to 17% and 52% growth in the two most recent frames.That 52% EPS gain was reported for Q3 on Thursday and it topped Wall Street expectations.But Applied's Q3 revenue, up 13%, were slightly below analysts' consensus. The maker of chipmaking equipment posted revenue of $2.82 billion in the period, falling short of Street forecasts. Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $2.84 billion.For the current quarter ending in October, Applied Materials expects its per-share earnings to range from 61 cents to 69 cents.The stock gapped up 7% on huge volume Friday. The semiconductor equipment maker's shares are up 58% so far this year.

365,JNJ,"The Dow Jones industrial average hit an all-time high at 18,622 on July 20. Which are the blue chip index's blue chip performers in 2016?The top five Dow stock winners this year are a diverse group: UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Caterpillar (CAT), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and 3M (MMM).Health care products and services giant Johnson & Johnson continues to rise after reporting its third straight quarter of earnings growth on July 19. Consensus is for earnings per share to climb 11% for the current quarter to $1.66, which would be an acceleration from the mild 2% increase in Q2. The New Brunswick, N.J.-based company is growing organically and via acquisitions, and on July 18 concluded its $3.3 billion cash purchase of Vogue International, a privately-held salon-influenced maker of hair-care and other personal products. Johnson & Johnson stock was up 22.1% in 2016 as of Monday. J&J fell 0.4% in the stock market today.Shares of the nation's largest managed health-care provider rose 1.3% after it reported outstanding earnings and revenue growth. Over the past year UnitedHealth grew to serve more than 2.1 million people in domestic medical benefits markets, including 320,000 more people added in the second quarter.UnitedHealth was relatively conservative about entering the ObamaCare exchange markets, and has said it will exit most of those states in 2017. Some of its peers have announced similar withdrawals.UnitedHealth was up 22% year-to-date as of Monday, falling just 0.2% Tuesday.IBD'S TAKE: J&J and UnitedHealth are the top performers on the Dow this year, bulling ahead to a 22% gain so far. To see what other medical stocks are top performers this year go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Sales for the largest maker of mining and construction equipment were weak last year and into early 2016 amid low prices for metals, while Caterpillar continues to sell construction equipment to the slowly recovering housing industry. RBC Capital Markets raised its price target on Caterpillar on July 26 based on the success of its restructuring so far.Although its position seems to be improving, it's not out of the deep mine shaft yet. On Tuesday, July 26, Caterpillar reported a drop in Q2 EPS and revenue, as EPS beat estimates while revenue missed. Caterpillar shares rose 20.6% as of Monday, dipping 0.9% Tuesday.The world's biggest retailer continues to hold its own against upstarts like Amazon.com (AMZN), which is growing fast but still just a fourth of Wal-Mart's size in revenue. Wal-Mart is scrambling to add features to entice shoppers and on July 6 announced that Walmart Pay, its card swipe technology, is now available at all 4,600-plus Walmart superstores nationwide. Walmart Pay works with Apple (AAPL) iPhone or any Alphabet-owned (GOOGL) Google Android device. Wal-Mart stock has climbed 20.4% this year through Monday, but fell 0.9% Tuesday.The nation's largest tapes and adhesives maker, and a purveyor of medical supplies, office equipment, surveillance and communications devices and other products, like Caterpillar entered a buy zone last week and continues to trade there after it reported health care sales rose nearly 5% last quarter, leading it to beat estimates and raise guidance on July 26.However, shares fell after it said that electronics and energy sector sales plunged 9.1% for the quarter. 3M rose 18.4% this year through Monday, and rose 7 cents to 178.36 on Tuesday.

369,JNJ,"When the economy is entering a recession, stocks in consumer staples, health care and telecoms ""are the best places to hide,"" said Barclays' Jonathan Glionna, who names tobacco giants Philip Morris International (PM) and Reynolds American (RAI) and drug giants Merck (MRK) and Pfizer (PFE).Meanwhile, he includes General Electric (GE) among the stocks to buy for a recovery.He doesn't see a recession in the near term, but there are red flags such as the collapse of oil prices, the 10% retreat in the S&P 500 so far this year and slowing growth in global No. 2 economy China.In a report Monday, Glionna joined a growing number of analysts providing lists of recession-resistant stocks. But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday.

371,JNJ,"When health care behemoth Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) decided last year to use Veeva Systems' (VEEV) software for gathering data from clinical trials needed to get a new drug approved, Veeva's rivals took notice.For good reason. Thanks to J&J, it wasn't long before Veeva's content management application turned the heads of its potential customers as well.""They (J&J) said we're going to standardize this globally, and within 12 months we had 6 customers (among the 20 biggest drugmakers) do the exact same thing,"" Veeva Chief Financial Officer Timothy Cabral told a Stifel technology conference in June.In this case, though, imitation wasn't just the sincerest form of flattery; it was pretty much according to plan. The cloud-based software company's insiders call it ""the Veeva way.""By that, they mean rapidly developing industry-specific applications with functionality that is miles ahead of the legacy offerings. Then they use positive customer outcomes to take the market by storm.When Chief Executive Peter Gassner left Salesforce.com (CRM) to start Veeva in 2007, he launched the company with one primary goal in mind -- replace biopharma companies' legacy systems with cloud-based software designed to make their painstaking regulatory requirements a lot less painful.Veeva's first product was a customer relationship management offering for pharma sales reps. Then it started targeting the research and development side of the business with its clinical trial content management application. Now, after a rapid six-month development period, it's launching a new application to track quality control processes for drug manufacturing.Veeva's drug and biotech customers ""are in a race against time -- in two directions,"" Gassner told Investor's Business Daily. On one hand, they need to expedite regulatory approval to bring their cures to market and keep people from suffering or dying. Then there are the business-driven reasons for fully capitalizing on a market opportunity before patents expire.That race has become even more critical over time. The cost of developing a new drug has soared to $2.6 billion, up from about $1 billion in 2000 in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Because the stakes are so high, more large drug developers have decided in rapid succession to junk their prior technology investments and embrace Veeva as a critical ally in their race against the clock.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is ramping up adoption of Veeva's customer relationship management product among all its 20,000-plus drug sales team members. Most customer relationship deployments aren't yet global in scale, but most big drug and biotech companies are now Veeva customers.The company has about 16% of what is roughly a $2 billion market providing customer relationship solutions to 450,000 global sales reps. Those reps are tasked with teaching 20 million doctors how and when to prescribe their drugs effectively. If all its customers embrace Veeva across their sales geographies, the company's market share could approach 70%.One relatively new customer relationship feature from Veeva is called Approved Email, which allows drug sales reps to send marketing and educational materials to doctors by email. That had been rare because of regulatory concerns until Veeva provided templates that let the communication happen in a compliant way.As dominant as Veeva's customer relationship product looks on track to become, management thinks the company's Vault content management platform has an even bigger advantage over the competition.A pharmaceutical giant might have 10,000 people, both inside and outside the company, collaborating on clinical trials for 20 different drug candidates at a time. Sharing, commenting on, updating and record-keeping of all the actions involved in a trial and drug application used to involve couriers, multiple file-sharing systems and document repositories.Those were hard for some participants to access. Now, Vault makes it possible to have a central hub in the cloud where everyone can connect in a way that streamlines regulatory compliance.Vault launched in 2013, generating $9 million in subscription revenue in 2014. This year, Vault should generate $52 million in subscription revenue, doubling to $104 million in 2017, according to William Blair analysts Bhavan Suri and Alper Tuken.""They're winning because of better usability,"" Suri told IBD. He noted that Vault revenues are growing so fast that the Veeva may continue to see revenue growth accelerate a little.Overall revenue rose 33% from a year ago to $119.8 million in the first quarter, Veeva announced in May. About 80% of revenue now comes from ongoing subscriptions. Adjusted earnings rose 23% to $21.2 million. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to 15 cents a share from 12 cents.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Veeva Systems surged on its May 27 earnings news, breaking above a long basing pattern, though they remain below levels hit just after the 2013 IPO. Shares are still close enough to a buy point to merit consideration. For a closer look at the right timing for buying a stock after a breakout, see this Investor's Corner.""We are more confident than ever that we are on track to achieve our stated revenue run rate target of $1 billion in 2020, selling just our current solutions within life sciences alone,"" Gassner told analysts on Veeva's first-quarter earnings call, according to a Seeking Alpha transcript.Shares broke out well past 30 in late May, built a base and then surged again to eclipse the 35 mark in early July. At the close Monday, shares were up incrementally to 38.27.The key to Veeva's success is that it has brought together enterprise software expertise with industry-specific expertise. That expertise and their applications don't just permit regulatory compliance with the FDA but with regulatory bodies around the world. About 45% of Veeva revenue comes from outside the U.S. Now the company is just beginning to expand its industry expertise beyond life sciences.""We have a tremendous platform involved and we can build applications on it rapidly as we've done with QMS (Veeva's drug manufacturing quality management application), and many of those applications are applicable outside of life sciences,"" Gassner said.Gassner announced on the latest earnings call that Veeva has a small team now dedicated to selling Vault to other industries.""We plan to undertake this new effort in the Veeva way with growth, profit and customer success,"" he said.Because Veeva's strong suit is ease of use in a heavily regulated industry, a lot of investors think it may have a future providing cloud-based applications to the financial services industry, including the brokerage business, Needham & Co. analyst Scott Berg told IBD.But Berg sees more near-term potential in industries ""the FDA actually works with,"" namely food manufacturing, which is vulnerable to costly and reputation-damaging recalls. He mentioned Hormel Foods (HRL) and Cargill as two possibilities.Suri sees Johnson & Johnson, because of its existing relationship with Veeva, as a candidate to adopt its Vault platform for managing quality in other regulated industries. Baby food manufacturers such as Nestle also would be a natural market for Vault to penetrate, Suri said.

372,JNJ,"Stocks showed mild action Friday, but the Dow snapped a four-week winning run. In general, the market maintained a positive bent amid a week jam-packed with earnings reports and a data showing weaker-than-expected growth in the U.S. economy.But the Q2 advance GDP report didn't seem that horrible beyond the headline number. While the overall 1.2% gain far missed the Econoday consensus forecast for an increase of 2.6%, the government also revised the figure for Q1 of 2015 sharply higher from 0.6% growth to 2.0%.Plus, in the latest reading, consumer spending jumped 4.2%, strongly reflecting the positive impact of relatively high employment and lower gas prices in the world No. 1 economy.The Dow Jones industrial average slipped less than 0.1%, lagging gains of nearly 0.3% for both the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500. The latter hit a new all-time high, rising as high as 2,177.09 during the stock market today.The Dow's 0.1% loss for the week pales in comparison with gains of 3.2%, 1.1%, 2% and 0.3% in the prior four weeks, respectively. The Nasdaq rallied 1.2% for the week -- a fifth straight weekly advance. The S&P 500 edged lower by fewer than 2 points, or less than 0.1%.Which stocks are performing best in the Dow?One way to view this is by comparing the Relative Strength Rating, which measures a stock's performance over the past 12 months vs. the rest of the stock market. Action over the past three months carries a higher weighting. On that score, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) lead the Dow's 30 components with RS ratings of 83 and 81, respectively.J&J rose 0.6% to 125.23, padding its impressive gains since clearing a long saucer with handle near 105. Even with that large advance, J&J's annualized dividend yield of 2.6% still exceeds the S&P 500's 2% payout.J&J continues to rise after recently posting a third quarter in a row of modest earnings growth. Q3 earnings are seen rising 11% to $1.66 a share, which would be an acceleration from the 2% increase which the medical and personal care products titan saw in the second quarter.For the year, J&J's earnings per share are seen rising 8% on a 3% pick-up in revenue to $72.07 billion.UnitedHealth has had a masterful performance since it broke out of a shallow double-bottom base at 121.19 in late February. The managed care behemoth rose 0.3% to 143.20, up 18% from that proper pivot point.Ranking third in RS Rating among the Dow components is DuPont (DD). The chemicals giant is cozying up to the 70 price level, where it's had trouble piercing higher. Earlier this week, DuPont marked a 14% jump in Q2 earnings, the best result in 10 quarters. Sales slid 8%, however.Investors who seek companies with faster growth need to look at IBD's various high-growth screens, including today's IPO Leaders column. This screen looks for outstanding performers in each aspect of IBD's CAN SLIM investment paradigm. The latest story highlights China's Yirendai (YRD) (EPS seen rising 65% in 2016), Veeva Systems (VEEV) (EPS seen up 12% in 2016 after a 38% gain in 2015) and IBD 50 stock LGI Homes (LGIH) (EPS seen rising 36% in 2016).IBD'S TAKE: The IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight and Sector Leaders columns, located inside IBD Stock Lists at Investors.com, all hunt for companies with above-average fundamentals.

373,JNJ,"Type 2 diabetes is battled by some of the best-selling drugs from some of the world's biggest drugmakers, but these companies are eyeing even bigger sales with a new generation of treatments.While changes in this field have proved more evolutionary than revolutionary, several events in the next few months -- starting as soon as Monday -- could eventually move billions of dollars, make compliance with treatment easier, and even prevent death from heart disease.Diabetes drugs provide the single best-selling products for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Merck (MRK), while almost all of Novo Nordisk's (NVO) $16 billion in annual revenue comes from diabetes treatments. Health care research firm GlobalData says diabetes treatments will bring in nearly $60 billion by 2025.""We're getting better and better at managing diabetes in general,"" said Les Funtleyder, health care portfolio manager with E Squared Asset Management. ""We have more options. ... The next phase is going to be getting people to adhere to regimens that work.""For diabetes patients -- and Type 2 diabetes is one of the world's most common diseases -- sticking to their treatments can be difficult because the medication routine gets increasingly complicated as the disease progresses.If diet and exercise fail, patients go on oral drugs, starting with cheap generics such as metformin. If that proves insufficient, doctors can add newer, branded oral medicines, which come in two classes: DPP4 inhibitors, led by Merck's Januvia, and the more recent SGLT2 inhibitors, led by J&J's Invokana. The two classes work by different mechanisms but are sometimes combined.If yet further intervention is required, patients move to injectable drugs. Nowadays, the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs are usually the first line of attack, a class including Novo Nordisk's Victoza and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Trulicity.IBD'S TAKE: Eli Lilly stock had a nice five-year run that ended about a year ago. Now, it sports weak Composite and Relative Strength Ratings of 34 and 39, respectively, and shouldn't get much of your stock-picking attention. But the company aims to rebound, as the CEO told IBD in an exclusive Q&A this year.After that comes the most familiar treatment for diabetes: insulin. Modern insulins come in different varieties, including long-acting versions like Sanofi's (SNY) Lantus and Novo's Tresiba, which need to be injected only once a day, and faster-acting ones for use at mealtimes, such as Lilly's Humalog and Novo's NovoLog.With this pile-up of meds, patients can have trouble keeping up. So one approach to simplifying the routine is creating combination drugs, as was done successfully with the HIV market.Both Sanofi and Novo Nordisk are awaiting FDA decisions on their combinations of insulins and GLP-1s, after back-to-back FDA advisory panels in May recommended approval. Novo's Xultophy won unanimous support, while Sanofi's LixiLan had a couple of dissenters due to safety issues related to the pen injector used to administer the drug.The FDA's deadline for deciding on Xultophy is Monday. The Sanofi decision is due next month, but it hasn't revealed the specific deadline.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez sees blockbuster potential in both drugs, though he expects they'll take 10 years to hit peak sales.""As we have seen with other recent major primary-care launches such as PCSK9s (Sanofi/Regeneron (REGN)/ Amgen (AMGN)), Entresto (Novartis (NVS)), and Breo Ellipta (GlaxoSmithKline (GSK)), we expect a slow initial launch of this class in the first few years,"" Fernandez wrote in a May 26 research note.""In our view, Novo's Xultophy could have a slight upper hand in the drug/device profile and positioning in the treatment algorithm that could lead to better physician acceptance and market uptake,"" he said. ""In our overall diabetes model, we forecast $5 billion peak sales for Xultophy and $1.5 billion to $2 billion peak sales for LixiLan.""Another FDA decision much anticipated on Wall Street is on an already approved drug, Lilly's SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance. Last year, Lilly stunned the industry when a large, five-year trial showed that Jardiance significantly extended the lifespans of diabetes patients, reducing the death rate by 32% and death from cardiovascular causes by 38%. It also sharply reduced hospitalizations for heart failure.Some analysts said Jardiance should see an instant uptick in sales, so spectacular were the results. When that didn't happen, Lilly closely studied the issue, says Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly Diabetes.""For us to realize that potential, two things need to happen,"" Conterno told IBD. ""The first is that we need the data on our label. And the second is we need new treatment guidelines to be established.""Canada's already made changes in the relevant medical societies' treatment guidelines, Conterno says, and he expects the same in the U.S. early next year.Getting the label changed means that Lilly's sales reps will be able to talk about the cardiovascular benefits to customers, which is important since the primary-care doctors who write most of the diabetes prescriptions aren't always up on the specialist research.Lilly has applied to expand the label to include that information, or at least put the clinical-trial results in the packaging.Approval, however, isn't quite the slam-dunk one might expect from the trial results. That's because of the way Lilly designed the trial. Its primary endpoint, which is normally the most important one to the FDA, was a composite of different measurements of cardiovascular health, and that produced mixed results. The specific findings in heart failure and overall deaths were ""exploratory"" endpoints.Thus, the FDA advisory panel only narrowly recommended changing the label when it met on June 28. Changing the label on the basis of a secondary endpoint would set a precedent, so it remains so unclear what the FDA will do that one analyst compared it to a coin flip.""We view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" wrote Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum in an email on June 29. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label.""It also remains to be seen how the competition will shape up.Last month, Novo Nordisk reported that its GLP-1, called Victoza, also reduced cardiovascular death, though not quite as much as Jardiance. Since Jardiance is oral and Victoza is injectable, they occupy slightly different positions in the treatment regimen.But Jardiance's most direct competitor, J&J's Invokana, is also the subject of a cardiovascular outcomes trial due for completion in February, with initial results possibly coming out earlier.Because of all these different variables, the companies that will do best in diabetes are those with the broadest portfolios, Funtleyder says. He cites Lilly and Novo Nordisk has having particularly comprehensive programs.""That gives them some advantages on a salesforce leverage basis -- the same sales guy can sample multiple drugs,"" he said. ""They have some benefits with payers (because) they can bundle the drugs together (on) one big bill instead of PBMs (pharmacy benefit managers) having to negotiate separate pills.""Eli Lilly shares rose 1.5% on the stock market today to their best levels since late January. Novo Nordisk climbed 1.1%. J&J dipped 0.1%.

374,JNJ,"Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), a maker of robotic-surgery systems, late Tuesday posted Q2 earnings and revenue that handily beat Wall Street expectations, sending shares rising after hours.Earnings per share minus items rose 23% from the year-earlier quarter, to $5.62, while sales rose 14%, to $670 million.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected $4.97 and $640.7 million.The maker of da Vinci surgical systems, for minimally invasive surgery, didn't provide guidance in its earnings release. Analysts expect EPS ex items this quarter of $5.16, down 1.5%, on sales of $647.5 million, up 10%.Intuitive Surgical stock was up nearly 5% in after-hours trading, after the company released its results. Shares rose a fraction in Tuesday's regular session, to 671.90. Intuitive stock hit an all-time high of 681.59 on July 11, after moving out of a flat base at a 654.98 buy point on June 23. So, shares remain within buy range.Da Vinci's success has spawned more competition. Alphabet's (GOOGL) Verily unit, formerly Google Life Sciences, has teamed with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) on advanced surgical robots. Early Tuesday, J&J posted a Q2 earnings beat, and Johnson & Johnson stock hit a record high Tuesday, closing up 1.7% at 125.25. Medtronic (MDT) made a big move into this field with its acquisition last year of Covidien.The company said the number of da Vinci procedures rose nearly 16% in Q2 vs. Q2 2015, while it shipped 130 da Vinci systems vs. 118 in Q2 2015.In a pre-earnings research note, Leerink analyst Richard Newitter said Intuitive was increasingly benefiting from the ""next leg of growth"" for its da Vinci Xi system, launched in 2014.
"
375,JNJ,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world.The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots. That news followed a September 2014 announcement that Google life-science spinoff Calico had entered a 10-year collaboration with North Chicago, Ill.-based pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) to research age-related diseases.Verily has another partner, too. Medical device firm Dexcom linked up in Q3 with Verily to create a new class of disposable 24/7 glucose monitoring systems that are faster, cheaper and smaller than the products that are currently available.Johnson & Johnson and Verily announced last year that they had created Verb Surgical to develop a new surgical robotics device that's smaller and less expensive than the Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) da Vinci system, which now controls that minimally invasive surgery segment.Others looking to join forces across the health-tech divide include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with Big Data solutions provider IBM (IBM) Watson Health to analyze the waves of information gleaned by diabetes insulin pumps.Data Vs. DiseasesAlphabet is not the only tech heavyweight seeking to blend medical altruism with Big Data and big moneymaking plans. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others are also using their deep technology expertise to create medical-related products and services.This year, Apple introduced health-tracking tools that monitor users' footsteps, heart rates and sleep activities. Microsoft and Samsung already offer a number of so-called wearable devices that also allow people to monitor their daily movements.Advances in mobile computing, artificial intelligence and new analytics software are driving their efforts.""In recent years, there has been increased interest in health care applications from companies that traditionally are seen to be consumer-focused companies,"" said Iain Simpson, a drug delivery specialist at Cambridge Consultants. ""Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have built consumer-focused businesses based on the creation of a compelling and sustainable user experience.""Now, Simpson said, various tech companies are heading into health, driven ""by the increasing relevance of these capabilities in a market which creates new high-value business opportunities for them, particularly when they work in collaboration with established health care players such as pharma and medical device companies.""With U.S. health care spending weighing in at $3.2 trillion in 2015 and projected to reach $5.1 trillion by 2023, according to the California Health Care Foundation, profit potential is an obvious incentive.But other factors are also at work. Part of the reason behind Alphabet's focus on moving the needle on Parkinson's treatment is personal.Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Sergey Brin's mother Eugenia has Parkinson's, and Brin himself was diagnosed in 2006 as carrying a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which has been associated with higher rates of the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.""Generally the pace of medical research is glacial compared to what I'm used to in the Internet,"" Brin told Wired in a 2010 interview about how Google could amplify the process. ""We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information. And if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere.""Legislative changes are another factor that has helped open the door for tech firms to put their massive computing muscle into health care.Data-driven medicine is a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in President Barack Obama's health care reforms and is a major force at the center of the boom in new health technology.The law provides major financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to prove their care is effective. Those ""value-based"" payment rules are sparking demand for new software that can track and analyze patient data, says Lynne Dunbrack, research vice president at IDC Health Insights.Patients Prescribed SoftwareFor example, Dunbrack said, ""some hospitals are finding it cheaper to send Medicare patients who have congestive heart failure home with a weight scale, an electronic tablet and a connected app rather than risk too many readmissions within 30 days of discharge, which would result in the hospitals getting federal reimbursement rate cuts.""""There have been some real financial incentives for health care organizations to purchase and use these technologies, which is then helping to drive demand, and is why companies are now seeing new opportunities,"" Dunbrack said.Along with the shift to value-based care, other top areas of focus for the health care industry include sequencing the human genome and digitizing health care data, said Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge in a September report about Alphabet's health care strategy.All three of those health care trends ""are not occurring in a vacuum, but are being accommodated by technology advances in areas such as social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing. These are all areas of Google's expertise,"" Blackledge said.The swirl of changes and tech advances is also helping fuel medical ambitions of tech heavyweight Apple.At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2014, Apple introduced a new HealthKit app, which monitors users' heart rates, sleep, weight and blood pressure, among other health-related measurements, and lets home health devices such as heart monitors and fitness monitors exchange data. HealthKit will allow clinicians at the Mayo Clinic to send that health information to a user's app, which can in turn transmit the data to a user's physician.HealthKit is ""a logical extension to Apple's existing products and digital ecosystem keeping users engaged and increasing Apple's App Store business,"" while also keeping ""Apple's products and services relevant in a growing but increasingly competitive consumer health market,"" said Simpson, of Cambridge Consultants.Another Apple tech framework, ResearchKit, lets people who want to remotely participate in clinical medical trials do so using specially-designed apps on their iPhone instead of having to show up in person.In March, Apple displayed apps that it says helps diagnose a range of conditions, from diabetes to heart disease. Apple says it won't see the data transmitted and people can opt out of sharing with researchers if they want. ResearchKit can help address a few problems with medical research in its current state, such as limited patient participation and infrequent data sampling, Apple's Jeff Williams, now chief operating officer, said at the time.About 11,000 people signed up for a single medical study at Stanford University in the first 24 hours after the release of ResearchKit, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in March.""To put that in perspective, Stanford has told us that it would have taken normally 50 medical centers an entire year to sign up that many participants. So ResearchKit is an absolute game changer,"" said Cook on the call. ""Discovering and curing some of these diseases will push our life expectancy much longer than it currently is.""Alphabet's Google has its own initiative, called ""Fit,"" which includes developer tools and an online platform for collecting data.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook.

379,JNJ,"Stocks were mixed in late-afternoon trading Tuesday.

A distribution day was taking shape on the Nasdaq. If it holds, it would be the tech index's first since the S&P 500 confirmed a new uptrend on June 30.

380,JNJ,"Stocks opened with minor losses Tuesday, despite a strong read on June housing activity.Dow industrials fell 0.1% while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq eased 0.2%.Some big earnings reports rolled out late Monday and early Tuesday, led by Netflix (NFLX), Goldman Sachs (GS), IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The stock market is so far enjoying a healthy July.

Among small caps, the Russell 2000 has a 4.9% gain for the month -- also its best since March. If the market pauses or pulls back, however, a few telling factors could clue in investors to where institutional investors might be headed next.The Commerce Department said June housing starts rose almost 5%, to an annualized rate of 1.189 million vs. a 1.135 million tally for May that was revised downward.  Economists had projected a rate of 1.17 million.Building permits, a guide to future activity, rose more than 1% to 1.153 million on an annualized basis.

381,JNJ,"The drug industry's Q2 earnings season launches this week with three of its biggest names: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) , Novartis (NVS) and Biogen (BIIB). Their broad portfolios could give investors a preview of how the business in general is doing.The big kahuna, Johnson & Johnson, on Tuesday morning is expected to report 1% year-over-year sales growth, but a modest decline in EPS to $1.68 a share. The stock hit a record high intraday Friday and is up 20% for the year. Credit ""strong pharma trends, and flight to safety and yield,"" wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro in his July 8 preview note.Analysts are expecting another good quarter for J&J's pharma business; Novarro wrote that based on prescription data from IMS Health (IMS), four of J&J's biggest drugs -- Remicade, Imbruvica, Invokana and Xarelto -- will beat consensus. Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan, in his July 10 preview, lowered his estimates for Invokana while raising them for Remicade and Xarelto. But he said he was concerned about the entry of cheaper biosimilar versions of Remicade later this year. Pfizer's (PFE) Remicade biosimilar was approved by the FDA in April.IBD'S TAKE: Most drug stocks have taken a pounding this year, but J&J has proved to be the exception. Last month our Stock Market Today column highlighted it as one of three standout defensive Dow stocks, and it's only gone higher since then.Biosimilars will also probably be a topic of discussion on Novartis' Q2 conference call, also Tuesday morning. On Wednesday, the Swiss drug giant's biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel won unanimous backing from an FDA advisory panel, making it likely to be Novartis' second biosimilar launch after its version of Amgen's Neupogen entered the market last year.Investors will also likely be interested in the performance of Novartis' two newest potential blockbuster drugs, Cosentyx for psoriasis and Entresto for heart failure. Both are first-in-class drugs that were approved in the U.S. last year, though Entresto so far has missed expectations while Cosentyx has enjoyed stronger uptake.Cosentyx also faced new competition in Q2, however, as Eli Lilly (LLY) launched a drug in the same class called Taltz.On Monday, Credit Suisse analysts cut their Q2 EPS estimate by 4% because the launches of the two drugs appear to be costing more than they'd expected. However, they wrote that the long-term outlook for the drugs look good, estimating $5 billion in peak annual Entresto sales. Peak Cosentyx estimates have been running about the same.Analysts expect that, as in Q1, Novartis' Q2 financials will suffer from the loss of patent protection for its leukemia drug Gleevec. Sales are seen falling 3% to $12.3 billion, with earnings down 6% to $1.18 a share.Novartis' stock is slowly recovering from a long slide from its July 20, 2015, peak of 106.84 to its April 1 low of 69.90. Shares found support at the 50-day line and in recent weeks has moved just above their 200-day, closing Friday at 81.61.On Thursday before the open, Biogen is expected to report a quarter of stronger growth but lower expectations, as its multiple-sclerosis franchise has missed expectations over the last several reports.Nonetheless, RBC analyst Michael Yee sees potential upside for its MS drug Tecfidera, and he expects Biogen to raise its 2016 EPS guidance ""from current $18.30-18.60 EPS up more toward consensus around $19, depending on expense cuts."" That would represent a significant improvement over last year's $17.01.For Q2, analysts estimate that earnings grew 11% to $4.69 a share, while revenue gained 8% to $2.8 billion.Biogen stock, after crashing last July, has been trading above and below its still-sliding 50-day line for most of the months since. Biogen did close above its 50-day line on Friday. Aside from a brief late May-early June stint, Biogen has not been above its 200-day for nearly a year.
"
382,JNJ,"Stocks gave up some gains in early afternoon trading Thursday. Hunger for blue chips seemed to increase as the Dow Jones industrial average paced the gains among the popular indexes.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 0.6%, adding to its 2.7% advance claimed over the prior four sessions. The 30-component blue chip index is now up 6% year to date. The Nasdaq composite, up 0.4% Thursday afternoon, has climbed 3.5%.Oil, steel, banking, fertilizer, railroad and semiconductor stocks helped hoist the S&P 500 0.3% higher. Volume is running higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE.The Dow Jones industrial average seemed to relish its role as a perennial laggard since the market's bottom in October of 2011. While the index posted an impressive gain of 76% to a peak of 18,288 in March 2015, it paled vs. the Nasdaq composite's 128% run over roughly the same period of time.However, the individual action among stocks in the Dow continues to get better. Take the health care sector. Pfizer (PFE) is acting like a big-cap leader lately. The Big Pharma play rose 1% to 36.67, up 3% from a 10-month saucer with handle.Notice how in the three-week-long handle, which began on June 10, the stock pulls back lightly and volume dries up in most of the sessions. That's ideal action as a stock sets up a potential breakout, which in Pfizer's case took place on July 1. While volume was quiet on the breakout, IBD research has found that in some cases, volume may come in strong a few weeks into the move toward new highs.Wall Street seems convinced that Pfizer has returned to a growth track, as Q2 profit is seeing rising nearly 11% to 62 cents a share on a 9% pickup in sales to $12.94 billion. This week, the ethical drug giant reportedly closed a deal to sell medicines in the Russian market and also got a label extension for its Prevnar vaccine for pneumonia. Doctors may now prescribe the vaccine to adults under 50 years old.Also in the Dow, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and insurer UnitedHealth Group (UNH) are acting well after recent breakouts. The former is flat at 123, extended from a recent breakout past a 115.10 buy point. Its Relative Price Strength line has been rising since June, indicating that J&J has been outperforming the S&P 500.UnitedHealth is down 0.6% intraday, but at 140.60 the stock remains above a 135.21 flat-base entry. In a flat base, the decline from head to toe must not exceed 15%. UnitedHealth's five-week flat base features a very mild 5% drop, indicating a reluctance among institutional investors to sell shares.The 5% buy zone extends up to 141.97 for UnitedHealth. The company earns a respectable 89 Composite Rating out of a maximum 99 on IBD Stock Checkup, second only to managed care industry peer Centene (CNC).Johnson & Johnson and United Health report earnings next week.Fellow Dow stock JPMorgan Chase (JPM) gapped up, leading the money center banks with a 1.7% gain to 64.21. Volume is running more than double normal levels. The Wall Street bank posted a 1% rise in Q2 profit, beating analysts' consensus view, as revenue lifted 5% to $26.8 billion. CEO Jamie Dimon earlier this week announced plans to raise minimum pay for a large number of the bank's employees.The stock still needs work on building the right side of a potential new base. JPMorgan's 44 RS Rating lags those of Pfizer (73), UnitedHealth (81) and J&J (86).Among IBD 50 names in the stock market today, data center operator CoreSite Realty (COR) cooled off for a third day in a row, down 1.5% to 84.55, as investors appeared to cash in more gains in dividend-paying REITs.

Reports say Verizon (VZ) may announce a Yahoo buyout deal within a few days.Intel (INTC), Qualcomm (QCOM) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) reported mixed earnings. Intel's $13.5 billion and 59 cents earnings per share ex items for Q2 edged and topped the consensus, respectively. But Intel shares fell from an 18-month high on weaker-than-expected data center sales, though they closed the week down just 1.2%.

Southwest (LUV) forecast a Q3 unit revenue decline, which would be its first this year. The carrier also missed Q2 estimates, and, like Spirit Airlines (SAVE), indicated that heavy lower-fare competition persists -- good for customers, but bad for airlines' financial results. American Airlines (AAL) reported a Q2 profit drop that wasn't as bad as expected. American also said the Brexit may help, not hurt, global carriers.The Q2 season kicked off with three solid reports from big-cap drugmakers. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat estimates and raised guidance, driven by the strength of its pharma division. Novartis (NVS) also beat Q2 estimates, but its stock fell as it warned of rising expenses related to new drug launches, and also said the FDA had rejected its biosimilar version of Amgen (AMGN) drug Neulasta.

389,JNJ,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) said second-quarter profit topped analysts' estimates on rising demand across all four of its business segments, with medical devices, a recent underperformer, leading the way.Earnings excluding one-time items were 55 cents a share, beating the 53-cent average of analysts' estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. Profit from continuing operations fell to $599 million, or 40 cents a share, from $786 million, or 52 cents, a year ago, the Abbott Park, Ill.-based company said in a statement.Abbott Labs, which sat out the merger frenzy that swept the health care industry last year, has since made up time, agreeing to buy Alere (ALR) for $5.8 billion in February -- a deal that has turned contentious -- and striking a $25 billion deal for St. Jude Medical (STJ) in April.St. Jude, based in St. Paul, Minn., also reported earnings Thursday, with second-quarter adjusted profit excluding some items of $1.06 a share that matched the average estimate of analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue gained 11% to $1.56 billion from a year earlier.Reported revenue increased 3.2 percent to $5.33 billion. Abbott's medical device unit led its sales performance, helped by the settlement of an issue surrounding royalty revenues from a previous year and demand for MitraClip, a device used to repair damaged mitral valves in the heart. The company's endovascular business also posted strong results, led by sales of stents used to treat blocked blood vessels in the legs and devices used to close puncture wounds.IBD's TAKE: Abbott hasn't proved to be a particularly resilient stock with a Composite Rating of 32. It's one of two stocks in IBD's ""Medical-Diversified"" group, which has been carried for the most part by its sole companion in the group, Dow 30 stock Johnson & Johnson. For more information on JNJ, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.Abbott maintained its adjusted earnings forecast of $2.14 to $2.24 a share for 2016.Shares ended trading up more than 2% to 42.65 at the close Wednesday.

390,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) increased its full-year profit and sales forecast after second-quarter profit topped analysts' estimates, driven by growth in the pharmaceutical division, which is home to blockbuster products such as arthritis treatment Remicade.Johnson & Johnson stock was up more than 1.5%, at a record high near 125, in early trading Tuesday, after its earnings release.J&J relies on prescription medicines like Remicade and psoriasis drug Stelara to drive sales and stem a slowdown from the medical devices division. Remicade accounted for about 20% of drug revenue for the New Brunswick, N.J.-based company last quarter.The world's biggest maker of health care products raised its earnings forecast to $6.63 to $6.73 a share excluding items, from $6.53 to $6.68 previously. Analysts anticipated $6.61.In the second quarter, earnings were $1.74 a share ex items, compared with the $1.68 average of 20 predictions compiled by Bloomberg. Drug sales increased 8.9% during the period, helping offset a decline in consumer products, while revenue from medical devices were little changed.Sales rose 3.9%, to $18.5 billion. Analysts anticipated $18 billion. Net income declined 11% to $4 billion, or $1.43 a share, from $4.52 billion, or $1.61 a share.Remicade's $1.78 billion in revenue edged estimates of $1.71 billion.Sales at the consumer business -- which includes Johnson's baby-care products, Neutrogena and Listerine -- fell 1.8%.J&J's shares have almost doubled since the start of 2010, and the company has topped earnings estimates every period since the fourth quarter of 2010.
"
391,JNJ,"Alphabet, the world's Internet search leader, is prospecting beyond its core business to strike success in the health care world. The company's glucose monitoring contact lens for diabetics is inching closer to drugstore shelves, while sales of its $200 self-stabilizing spoon, designed to help people with uncontrollable hand tremors eat comfortably, topped 1,000 in the first six months.Google — which restructured last year to become the largest operating unit within a new parent, Alphabet (GOOGL) — bought biotech company Lift Labs in 2014, just a few months after the health-focused startup began product sales.Pointing to its broadening emphasis on that and other health and medical advancements, Alphabet last month renamed its Google Life Sciences division Verily Life Sciences. The division brings together clinicians and scientists and is focused on understanding and improving chronic conditions that impact massive numbers of people — health issues including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, neurodegenerative disease and mental health.""This is a development in health care that I think is far-reaching and will be long-lasting because we are seeing a period of convergence between the technology companies and the health care companies,"" California Life Sciences Association trade group CEO Sara Radcliffe told IBD.She said changes driving health care and tech firms into partnerships include ""the explosion of Big Data"" and the resulting demand for ways to manage all that patient information.Growth of access to data via the Internet cloud and mobile technologies such as Fitbit (FIT) wearables are ""shifting health care to maintaining and tracking health, rather than simply treating disease,"" she said.Companies Teaming UpRecent notable health-tech partnerships include Alphabet's Verily division teaming up last month with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to develop surgical robots. That news followed a September 2014 announcement that Google life-science spinoff Calico had entered a 10-year collaboration with North Chicago, Ill.-based pharmaceutical firm AbbVie (ABBV) to research age-related diseases.Verily has another partner, too. Medical device firm Dexcom linked up in Q3 with Verily to create a new class of disposable 24/7 glucose monitoring systems that are faster, cheaper and smaller than the products that are currently available.Johnson & Johnson and Verily announced last year that they had created Verb Surgical to develop a new surgical robotics device that's smaller and less expensive than the Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) da Vinci system, which now controls that minimally invasive surgery segment.Others looking to join forces across the health-tech divide include medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with Big Data solutions provider IBM (IBM) Watson Health to analyze the waves of information gleaned by diabetes insulin pumps.Data Vs. DiseasesAlphabet is not the only tech heavyweight seeking to blend medical altruism with Big Data and big moneymaking plans. Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and others are also using their deep technology expertise to create medical-related products and services.This year, Apple introduced health-tracking tools that monitor users' footsteps, heart rates and sleep activities. Microsoft and Samsung already offer a number of so-called wearable devices that also allow people to monitor their daily movements.Advances in mobile computing, artificial intelligence and new analytics software are driving their efforts.""In recent years, there has been increased interest in health care applications from companies that traditionally are seen to be consumer-focused companies,"" said Iain Simpson, a drug delivery specialist at Cambridge Consultants. ""Companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook (FB) and Amazon.com (AMZN) have built consumer-focused businesses based on the creation of a compelling and sustainable user experience.""Now, Simpson said, various tech companies are heading into health, driven ""by the increasing relevance of these capabilities in a market which creates new high-value business opportunities for them, particularly when they work in collaboration with established health care players such as pharma and medical device companies.""With U.S. health care spending weighing in at $3.2 trillion in 2015 and projected to reach $5.1 trillion by 2023, according to the California Health Care Foundation, profit potential is an obvious incentive.But other factors are also at work. Part of the reason behind Alphabet's focus on moving the needle on Parkinson's treatment is personal.Google co-founder and now Alphabet president Sergey Brin's mother Eugenia has Parkinson's, and Brin himself was diagnosed in 2006 as carrying a mutation of the LRRK2 gene, which has been associated with higher rates of the degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.""Generally the pace of medical research is glacial compared to what I'm used to in the Internet,"" Brin told Wired in a 2010 interview about how Google could amplify the process. ""We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information. And if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere.""Legislative changes are another factor that has helped open the door for tech firms to put their massive computing muscle into health care.Data-driven medicine is a key element of the Affordable Care Act, the federal law that ushered in President Barack Obama's health care reforms and is a major force at the center of the boom in new health technology.The law provides major financial incentives for doctors and hospitals to prove their care is effective. Those ""value-based"" payment rules are sparking demand for new software that can track and analyze patient data, says Lynne Dunbrack, research vice president at IDC Health Insights.Patients Prescribed SoftwareFor example, Dunbrack said, ""some hospitals are finding it cheaper to send Medicare patients who have congestive heart failure home with a weight scale, an electronic tablet and a connected app rather than risk too many readmissions within 30 days of discharge, which would result in the hospitals getting federal reimbursement rate cuts.""""There have been some real financial incentives for health care organizations to purchase and use these technologies, which is then helping to drive demand, and is why companies are now seeing new opportunities,"" Dunbrack said.Along with the shift to value-based care, other top areas of focus for the health care industry include sequencing the human genome and digitizing health care data, said Cowen and Co. analyst John Blackledge in a September report about Alphabet's health care strategy.All three of those health care trends ""are not occurring in a vacuum, but are being accommodated by technology advances in areas such as social, mobile, analytics and cloud computing. These are all areas of Google's expertise,"" Blackledge said.The swirl of changes and tech advances is also helping fuel medical ambitions of tech heavyweight Apple.At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June 2014, Apple introduced a new HealthKit app, which monitors users' heart rates, sleep, weight and blood pressure, among other health-related measurements, and lets home health devices such as heart monitors and fitness monitors exchange data. HealthKit will allow clinicians at the Mayo Clinic to send that health information to a user's app, which can in turn transmit the data to a user's physician.HealthKit is ""a logical extension to Apple's existing products and digital ecosystem keeping users engaged and increasing Apple's App Store business,"" while also keeping ""Apple's products and services relevant in a growing but increasingly competitive consumer health market,"" said Simpson, of Cambridge Consultants.Another Apple tech framework, ResearchKit, lets people who want to remotely participate in clinical medical trials do so using specially-designed apps on their iPhone instead of having to show up in person.In March, Apple displayed apps that it says helps diagnose a range of conditions, from diabetes to heart disease. Apple says it won't see the data transmitted and people can opt out of sharing with researchers if they want. ResearchKit can help address a few problems with medical research in its current state, such as limited patient participation and infrequent data sampling, Apple's Jeff Williams, now chief operating officer, said at the time.About 11,000 people signed up for a single medical study at Stanford University in the first 24 hours after the release of ResearchKit, Apple CEO Tim Cook told CNBC in March.""To put that in perspective, Stanford has told us that it would have taken normally 50 medical centers an entire year to sign up that many participants. So ResearchKit is an absolute game changer,"" said Cook on the call. ""Discovering and curing some of these diseases will push our life expectancy much longer than it currently is.""Alphabet's Google has its own initiative, called ""Fit,"" which includes developer tools and an online platform for collecting data.Connect with Michele Chandler on Twitter @IBD_MChandler and Facebook.

The stock has been working to retake its 50-day moving average, and ended Thursday 3% below an 81.59 cup-base buy point.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) climbed almost 2% after finally inking a deal to be taken private by a group of investors led by company chairman Zhou Hongyi for $9.3 billion. Zhou had proposed the deal earlier in the year, before markets in China slumped into a serious correction.Oil prices slipped — West Texas Intermediate crude shed more than 1% to below $35 a barrel and down just over 3% for the week. Brent crude was a fraction lower, just below $37 and down almost 3% on the week. Gold rose a fraction, still standing tight near the $1,055 per ounce level. Copper futures popped 3%, leaving prices effectively level for the week.Overseas, markets were broadly lower Friday but trading higher for the week. Japan's Nikkei 225 in Tokyo toppled 1.9%, leaving the index with a 1.3% loss for the week. The Shanghai Composite ended flat Friday and up 4.2% on the week.

411,JNJ,"What's the best holiday gift for an income investor? Stocks that keep paying dividends year after year. Four of the Dividend Leaders in Wednesday's issue are S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats — companies that have paid dividends each year for at least the past 25 years. The stocks making the list below also boast yields bigger than the S&P 500's average payout of 2.02%.McDonald's (MCD) has raised its dividend every year since its first payout in 1976. On Nov. 10, it raised its quarterly dividend by 5% to 89 cents a share, or $3.56 for the full year. That works out to a 3.1% yield.The stock is an outperformer, up more than 20% this year. Shares jumped 8% on Oct. 22 after the fast-food giant reported Q3 results that topped views and U.S. same-stores sales that rose for the first time in two years.The Golden Arches is in the midst of a turnaround effort. It began offering breakfast all day in October and is testing out custom burgers and table service in some Southern California restaurants.Coca-Cola (KO), which is served at McDonald's, has been paying dividends since 1920 and has hiked the payout in each of the last 50 years. It pays a quarterly 33 cents a share for a 3.1% annualized yield. The stock is just above a 42.35 buy point first cleared Oct. 20. It's up less than 2% year to date.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has boosted its dividend for 53 consecutive years. Its current quarterly payout of 75 cents a share, or $3 for the full year, yields 2.9%. Barclays on Tuesday upgraded the health care giant to overweight from equal weight and boosted its price target to 115 from 101. J&J has been basing for a year and is less than 7% off its high.AT&T (T), which offers the biggest yield of the four Aristocrat stocks at 5.6%, has raised its payout each year since 1986. The Warren Buffett-owned stock, featured in Wednesday's column, is trying to regain its 200-day moving average and is 7% off its 52-week high.

412,JNJ,"Big pharmas Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were trading up Tuesday after getting upgrades from Barclays, while AbbVie (ABBV) seesawed on a downgrade.Analyst Geoff Meacham assumed coverage of a newly combined U.S. Pharmaceuticals sector in Barclays' coverage, and while he left most ratings the same he made a few tweaks. Lilly was upgraded to overweight from equal weight, and its price target lifted to 95 from 75, based on the promising pipeline and management's commitment to lowering expenses. Meacham said that Lilly could be building a ""major autoimmune disease franchise"" with its late-stage drug candidates ixekizumab (for psoriasis) and baricitinib, a rheumatoid-arthritis drug it's developing with Incyte (INCY).""Based on the solid Phase 3 data, we view baricitinib as having significant market share potential in rheumatoid arthritis,"" Meacham wrote. ""Our model conservatively projects 2025 risk-adjusted sales of $1.2 billion vs. peak sales of $1.5 billion for (Pfizer 's (PFE) Xeljanz.""Meacham called diabetes drug Jardiance Lilly's ""most important commercial asset over the intermediate term"" since its recent study results showed it sharply reduced deaths from heart failure . He admitted that this has been an overhang for Merck, as it derives a lot of its revenue from competing drug Jardiance, but argued that the stock has overreacted.""While we acknowledge there are multiple headwinds and risks that make Merck a 'show me' story, we think even under most potential negative scenarios that there is too much underlying value to ignore,"" Meacham wrote as he raised Merck's rating to overweight from equal weight and hiked its price target to 66 from 65. ""Even if pipeline assets aren't blockbusters, they add up and are nearly free at the current valuation.""Lilly stock was up almost 5% near 86 in afternoon trading on the stock market today, while Merck stock was up 2% near 54.Meacham also raised J&J to overweight from equal weight, with the price target rising $14 to 155. As with Merck, he felt that the market is undervaluing J&J.""J&J has underperformed the S&P 500 and DRG over the past 12 months due to concerns about the impact of biosimilars on Remicade, low near-term earnings growth, and a lack of significant near-term pipeline catalysts,"" Meacham wrote. ""This has led to calls to break up the conglomerate, but we believe this to be premature.""In Meacham's view, J&J would be better off acquiring growth assets, especially in pharma.J&J stock was up 1% in afternoon trading, near 102.Meanwhile Meacham downgraded AbbVie to equal weight from overweight and trimmed the price target to 72 from 73. Like many analysts, he thought that AbbVie's projections for recently acquired blood-cancer drug Imbruvica and similar drugs in the pipeline — some $20 billion a year at peak — are too high.""Imbruvica and other oncology assets likely to succeed, but the field is highly competitive,"" Meacham wrote.AbbVie stock initially dropped almost 2% in Tuesday's trading, but by afternoon was up about 1.5% near 59.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

413,JNJ,"The most heavily traded ETFs rallied steadily higher last month, but it's been more of a mixed bag so far this month. PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) has held up the best in the past month, followed by SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Unlike those large-cap peers, iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) has returned to where it was a month ago.Small-cap ETFs found their way into investors' ETF strategies as the dollar marched steadily higher at the start of the year. That currency move was expected to act as a headwind for large caps and to benefit small caps, which are less reliant on international revenues.Only one half of that equation has borne out so far.Despite more mixed action for the greenback lately,Coca-Cola (KO),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and other large U.S. companies report that relative dollar strength continues to take a bite out of revenues and profits.But the expected boost for small caps has yet to materialize. Why is that?Small caps are more sensitive to changes in monetary policy, Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote Nov. 8.""While small caps do have less exposure to international sales, they have proved more vulnerable to rising real interest rates (the interest rate after inflation) and investor anticipation of monetary tightening,"" he said.""Historically, small cap relative performance has been strongest when short-term rates — those controlled by the Fed — are falling,"" he added.The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, released today, show that many policymakers are leaning toward a rate liftoff in December.Koesterich expects the small-cap segment to benefit if the Fed decides to wait. Overall, he advises investors to stay neutral as far as size bias in U.S. stock investing goes.IWM holds nearly 2,000 small-cap stocks including more volatile microcaps. Highly rated IBD 50 stocks in the portfolio include enterprise software firm Manhattan Associates (MANH) and the regional Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK).The ETF has $27.34 billion in assets and a 0.20% expense ratio.It has an average daily dollar volume of more than $4 billion — ahead of QQQ but far behind SPY's $25 billion.The average market cap is $1.49 billion — about half the typical fund in this category, says Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson.He notes that the ETF isn't top-heavy — the 10 largest holdings account for just 3% of assets.But he adds that it's far from the cheapest ETF in its category. Schwab U.S. Small-Cap (SCHA) charges 0.08% in expenses.IWM has given up 3.2% year to date through Tuesday vs. an 8.6% gain for QQQ and 1.4% for SPY.Over a much longer time horizon, it's a different story. IWM produced an average annual 12.8% gain in the past 15 years vs. 3.5% for QQQ and 4.7% for SPY.Small-cap ETFs diversify investment portfolios and are tried-and-tested strategies for successful investing.Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter @IBD_ANarayanan.

414,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) announced after the market close Tuesday that it was dropping out of the bidding for Actelion Pharmaceuticals, leaving France's Sanofi (SNY) as the most likely potential bidder for the Swiss drugmaker.J&J said in a statement: ""Johnson & Johnson today confirmed it has ended discussions with Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd. regarding a potential transaction. Johnson & Johnson was not able to reach an agreement that it believed would create adequate value for its shareholders.""Lung disease drug specialist Actelion quickly followed that it's in talks with an unnamed suitor about a ""strategic transaction."" That possible partner is likely Sanofi, previously cited as interested in Actelion. Sanofi is that company, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.IBD'S TAKE: Drug stocks initially rallied on relief that Hillary Clinton wasn't elected president. But that's turned to worry amid signs that Donald Trump will push to lower drug prices.Actelion, which closed Tuesday with a market cap of $22.2 billion, reportedly is looking for a $30 billion valuation. It's unclear if Actelion is open to a takeover or some other transaction.J&J shares rose 0.5% to 115.89 on the stock market today, before announcing its exit from the Actelion hunt. J&J retook its 50-day moving average but closed just below its 200-day. Sanofi's U.S. shares rose 0.8% to 40.92.RELATED:Sanofi May Battle Johnson & Johnson For European Biotech Actelion

415,JNJ,"Biotech stocks have nearly ""round-tripped"" their Donald Trump-inspired rally, but RBC analyst Michael Yee sees an upcoming U.S. Food and Drug Administration appointment, and data from Roche (RHHBY) and Biogen (BIIB) acting as catalysts.The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB) and SPDR S&P Biotech (XBI) exchange-traded funds are down 6.6% and 3.1% following a rally on Trump's election. On Wednesday, Trump dumped water on analysts' theory he would be less likely to go after spiraling drug prices.""I'm going to bring down drug prices,"" he told Time Magazine. ""I don't like what has happened with drug prices.""Trump's commentary sent biotech stocks tumbling on Wednesday. IBD's 421-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group closed down 3.1%. The iShares and S&P Biotech ETFs ended the day down 2.9% and 4%, respectively.After sinking more on Thursday, biotech stocks managed to climb out of the hole on the stock market today, IBD's 421-company biotech group was up fractionally as were the ETFs.IBD'S TAKE: Can biotechs recover from Trump's pledge to curb drug prices? Get the deep dive on IBD's Industry Themes.Yee noted Trump's effect extends far beyond his commentary. Trump has appointed Georgia Rep. Tom Price as his Health and Human Services secretary. Price has said he favors a major overhaul of the Medicare system, and has advocated against the Affordable Care Act.His next appointment, though, could light a fire under biotech stocks, Yee wrote. On deck, Trump is prepping to announce his next commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Media reports target Jim O'Neill and Scott Gottlieb as leading candidates.O'Neill is a former venture capitalist and managing director at Peter Theil's Mithril Capital. He has advocated for relaxing FDA regulations for drug approvals. Gottlieb is a VC partner and practicing physician who has served at the FDA and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.The decision will follow Congress' approval late Wednesday of a bill to speed up FDA processes.And Trump? His commentary on drug pricing is far from set in stone, Yee wrote in a research note. He notes the Republican Congress next year is unlikely to break from conservative dogma to work on easing drug prices.""Despite the worries about Trump mentioning drug pricing, we'd remind investors that he has said a lot of things over the past year and seems to negotiate in the public eye but hasn't necessarily been truly perceived to actually want to do a lot of them,"" Yee wrote.Outside Trump, biotechs have suffered industry-specific injuries including Eli Lilly (LLY) missing key Alzheimer's data, and lagging Q3 metrics from Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA) and Medtronic (MDT), Yee wrote. But Biogen and Roche have upcoming data that could help the industry.Biogen has phase 1 and 2 data for Alzheimer's drug aducanumab due Friday. Roche's phase 3 hemophilia data is due ""imminently,"" Yee said. The Prescription Drug Free User (PDUFA) is due Dec. 28 for Roche's multiple sclerosis drug ocrelizumab. And Regeneron (REGN) rival Ophthotech (OPHT) has phase 3 data coming soon.Meanwhile, M&A looks imminent for the sector. Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is in talks to buy European biotech Actelion. Sanofi (SNY) is rumored to have informal interest in Actelion, insiders say. M&A could pull generalist investors back into the space, Yee wrote.There's a ""perception of no major near-term catalysts in biotech other than 'it's cheap' and we need much more M&A to get the stocks rallying again,"" he wrote.RELATEDCould Trump Tax Cut Plans, Republican Congress Spur Biotech M&A?Could Trump 'Make Drug Development Great Again'?

416,JNJ,"Stocks are rallying sharply and the Dow Jones industrials are leading the way, surging 1.3% in late afternoon trading on Wednesday.The Nasdaq composite had lagged after President-elect Donald Trump's vow to hold drug prices down boosted skittishness among biotech and ethical-drug investors, but has now quickly joined the broad market advance.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) helped lead a big flurry of gainers within the Dow Jones industrials; as of 2:30pm in New York, at least 17 of the Dow 30 components rose 1 point or more.Apple rose nearly 0.8% to 110.78, getting back above a 110.33 original buy point in a long bottoming base pattern. It's been nearly three months since Apple's Sept. 14 breakout took shares above that proper entry within a cup with handle en route to a nearly 8% gain, so some would argue that that buy point is irrelevant.However, a continued rise past 110.33 and a rebound back above its slightly downward sloping 50-day moving average would go a long way in helping the former tech leader complete a new base and potentially break out again.Watch for potential new breakouts by fellow large caps, including IBM (IBM) (164.76 cup with handle buy point) and AutoZone (AZO) (809.88 entry in a new double bottom with handle).Amgen (AMGN) dropped 3%, hitting its lowest price levels in more than three weeks. Former big winner Biogen (BIIB) slid 2.1% and briefly fell below the ever important 200-day moving average.Yet the sell-off in biotech and ethical drug firms is failing to hamper the Nasdaq composite as the tech-rich index has rebounded into a solid gain of 0.9% with just more than an hour left in the trading session.The NYSE composite is now just slightly ahead, rising almost 1%. The Russell 2000 is up nearly 0.7%.Perhaps helping buoy the U.S. equities market is a strong finish for European equities even after Italy voted a resounding no on former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's proposal to enact structural reforms by bypassing the country's Senate. The German DAX 100 soared 2%, London's FTSE 100 gained 1.8%, and the French CAC 40 advanced 1.4%.Volume has accelerated and is running sharply higher so far on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time on Tuesday.In the U.S. stock market today, top industry-group gainers included steel alloys, consumer-electronics retailing, solar, airlines, agricultural chemicals and chip equipment, all up well more than 1%.In the airline space, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) has done well since clearing a 49.84 handle buy point within a long, deep, bottoming base structure. The stock, up more than 2% for the week, has gained 16% since its Nov. 10 breakout, two days after the historic U.S. elections.The handle in Spirit is derived by adding 10 cents to the handle's intraday high of 49.74, set on Oct. 25.Notice how on a daily chart the handle showed tight, downward-slanting price action in mostly dull volume, the right way for a handle to form.Alaska Air (ALK) — fresh from gaining government approval, with conditions, to acquire rival airline Virgin America — gained 1.7% to 86.20. The stock has seen nice up days in heavy volume in recent weeks and has now surpassed an 83.36 double-bottom buy point.RELATED:What Is The Bottoming Base Pattern, And How Can Investors Profit From It?The Case For a New Secular Bull MarketHow To Master Stock Chart Reading: Use IBD's 2-Minute Tip VideosWhen Did Apple Break Out This Year?

420,JNJ,"Brexit fallout continued Monday as U.S. stocks again followed European bourses sharply lower, with steep declines by American Express (AXP) and JPMorgan  (JPM).The major indexes closed off their intraday lows, but they still finished well in the bottom half of their session ranges. The Nasdaq sank 2.4%, the S&P 500 shed 1.8%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gave up 1.5%, with the latter two breaching their 200-day moving average lines for the first time since March.Volume was slightly lower across the board vs. Friday, according to preliminary figures, but it was still intense overall. Banks and oil stocks were among the hardest hit in the stock market today. West Texas Intermediate crude slid 2% to $46.74 a barrel, while gold prices climbed 0.5% to $1,328.90 an ounce.American Express led the Dow's decline with a 4% drop, adding to its 5% plunge in heavy volume Friday. Shares are now near four-month lows and are 29% off their 52-week high. JPMorgan fell 3%, bringing its two-session loss to 10%.Only two blue chips managed to avoid the downdraft: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Verizon Communications (VZ). J&J is just off a record high, while Verizon climbed past a 54.59 cup-base buy point in busy trade.The few industry groups managing small gains were all defensive in nature: utilities, food and beverage, and soap. On the IBD 50, electric utility WEC Energy Group (WEC), Dollar General (DG) and B&G Foods (BGS) eked out gains of 1% or more each.But Acuity Brands (AYI), chip designer MaxLinear (MXL) and Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) each lost about 6%, while BroadSoft (BSFT), GrubHub (GRUB) and LifeLock (LOCK) shed nearly 5% apiece.Britain's credit rating suffered downgrades following last week's Brexit vote. Standard & Poor's on Monday lowered its U.K. credit rating by two notches to AA. Fitch also cut its rating to AA.Economic data slated for Tuesday include first-quarter GDP, the S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for April, and the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index for June.

421,JNJ,"Stock indexes staggered lower Monday afternoon as former support lines proved useless.The Nasdaq skidded 2.4%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 chopped off 3%. The Dow Jones utility average, though, rose 1.3% as dividends began to look like safer bets.Volume was running below Friday's pace on both major exchanges.The S&P 500 sliced under its 200-day line and then began a test of the 2000 area. The Nasdaq began the day already below its 200-day line and then slid under a recent low at 4678 to test the 4600 level.The bulls were faced with a good news/bad news situation.The good news is that while the chart action on the indexes is ugly, investors saw similar action at the start of the year and in August. In both cases, the market rebounded, doing especially well in the February-April bounce.The bad news is this: In the previous two instances, the Nasdaq declined about 18% off its high. This sell-off has pulled the Nasdaq down 8%, which means there could be more losses ahead.In this situation, individual investors are understandably looking for defensive names. In the Dow, three stocks have stayed cool under the current market pressure: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Verizon Communications (VZ) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Johnson & Johnson probably sports the best-looking chart. The stock broke out in late February and has advanced steadily since then. It is above its 50-day and 200-day support lines and is only 1% off its 52-week high.Verizon Communications is 1% off its high. The stock is trying to clear a cup base. However, much of Verizon's base was built under the 50-day line, which is a flaw. (Verizon rival AT&T, a former Dow stock, also is holding up. AT&T is trading 1% below its all-time high, set Friday morning.)Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) hasn't reacted to the market sell-off. However, the stock is far off a high marked in January 2015.Growth stocks, especially those with European exposure, are suffering in this sell-off. In the IBD 50, losers were leading winners by a 9-to-1 ratio Monday afternoon.One statistic that has been looking encouraging is the Divisia M4 money supply, which is the broadest gauge of the money supply. In May, the needle jumped 5.2%, up 4% or more for the fifth consecutive month.Coming up Tuesday: The final reading on first-quarter GDP will be released before the market's open. Wall Street's consensus figure is for growth of 1%.

There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

434,JNJ,"French drugmaker Sanofi (SNY) is mulling a bid for Switzerland's Actelion Pharmaceuticals, which already has an offer on the table from U.S. drug giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), sources told Bloomberg on Tuesday.Actelion confirmed Johnson & Johnson's bid on Nov. 25. Sanofi and other potential bidders are feeling the heat from J&J's push to get an agreement by Christmas. J&J reportedly boosted its bid to $250 a share, valuing Actelion north of $27 billion.Sanofi hasn't offered an official bid, but has made its interest known informally, Bloomberg said, citing people familiar with the matter. J&J and possibly Sanofi soon might also have to compete against Roche (RHHBY) and Pfizer (PFE), which reportedly have been approached to make bids on Switzerland's biggest biotech.Novartis (NVS), though, is out of the running, according to an interview with its CEO, Joe Jimenez, published Sunday in the Swiss German-language newspaper SonntagsBlick.IBD'S TAKE: Biotech M&A could see a boost under Donald Trump. Are your biotechs on the lookout?Representatives of Actelion, Sanofi and Pfizer didn't immediately return requests for comment. Roche spokesperson Dr. Ulrike Engels-Lange says the company does ""not comment on rumors and speculation.""Johnson & Johnson referred back to the Nov. 25 announcement which says it ""does not intend to make any additional comments regarding these discussions unless and until it is appropriate to do so, or a formal agreement has been reached.""At the close on the stock market today, J&J stock was up a fraction to 112.06, while Sanofi stock was down 0.6% to 40.66.

435,JNJ,"Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN) and Roche (RHHBY) will pressure Merck (MRK) in 2018 with a slew of lung cancer drugs designed to chip at Keytruda's share, Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said Monday, as he downgraded Merck stock.On the stock market today, Merck fell 2.1% to 61.14, while Bristol-Myers Squibb climbed 1.4% to 59.43. Merck and Bristol-Myers are locked in a battle over the non-small cell lung cancer market with drugs that leverage a patient's immune system to battle the cancer.Holford downgraded Merck stock to underperform, with a 48 price target. He expects strong Keytruda performance in 2017, followed by pressure in 2018 as rival drugs from Bristol, AstraZeneca and Roche chip away at Keytruda's market.IBD'S TAKE: Next year will be marked by a new presidency. What path will Donald Trump take on drug prices?""Merck screens poorly on many valuation metrics to us, and we have downgraded the shares to underperform,"" Holford wrote in a research report. In the same note, he upgraded Bristol stock to a buy, with a 69 price target.Holford expects two Opdivo trials to secure Bristol's future in 2017.More broadly, he prefers AbbVie (ABBV) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks in the U.S. and AstraZeneca and Novartis (NVS) stocks in Europe.He sees Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck, Sanofi (SNY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) as the least preferred stocks.RELATED:Gilead Must Pay Merck $2.5 BillionFor Hep C Patent; Agios Stock Anemic

On Monday, the Financial Times reported the parties were talking about a deal that would give New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&J partial ownership.Actelion stock rose 10% in the Swiss exchange Tuesday. It jumped 17% on Friday after Actelion and J&J, reacting to reports, confirmed that they were in negotiations. Actelion rose 3% on Monday. It now has a market cap near $21 billion.Johnson & Johnson stock ended trading Tuesday down 0.6% to 112.48 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: M&A action in the drug industry could heat up more after Donald Trump takes office, analysts say, because he's expected to ease regulatory hurdles. Companies such as Amgen and Celgene could be among those on the lookout.Bloomberg has reported that drugmakers Novartis (NVS), which is also based in Switzerland, and France-based Sanofi (SNY) also could bid for Actelion. Both, unlike Actelion, are traded in the U.S. Sanofi was up 2% in early afternoon trading Tuesday, while Novartis was up a small fraction.Actelion is developing two potential blockbuster — $1 billion-plus annual sales — lung treatments, Opsumit and Uptravi.

437,JNJ,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped Wednesday as Wall Street analysts weighed the results of a narrow Food and Drug Administration advisory panel vote late Tuesday.The panel met to decide whether it's a good idea to expand the label of Lilly's diabetes drug Jardiance to include reduced death from cardiovascular causes, based on a large clinical trial called Empa-Reg. The committee voted 12 to 11 in favor of the change. Such a close vote leaves it less than clear just what decision the FDA will ultimately make.""The most cited reason for a 'No' vote was that the bar for a new claim to be granted based on a SINGLE study is very high, and panelists would like to see a second trial to 'confirm' the CV death finding,"" Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote in a research note. ""Many panelists who voted 'Yes' also shared that concern, but they found the CV death benefit compelling and convincing enough to tip the balance for them.""Fernandez nonetheless liked the odds of approval, noting that ""most of the senior members of the panel, including two biostatisticians, and ALL five cardiologists, voted in favor of the new indication.""Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan is also betting in favor of a change, adding that this could read across to similar products in the SGLT-2 inhibitor class.""Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana remains the market leader in the SGLT-2 space, with its CANVAS outcome study scheduled to be completed in February 2017,"" Divan wrote in a research note. ""Assuming the FDA agrees with including the EMPA-REG OUTCOME CV death data into the Jardiance label, we could see some share shift from Invokana to Jardiance until CANVAS is completed, with longer-term implications dependent on the CANVAS results.""Results from outcome studies for AstraZeneca's (AZN) Forxiga and Merck (MRK)/Pfizer's (PFE) ertugliflozin are expected later in the decade,"" Divan said.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum was more cautious.""Despite the slight overall majority of votes in favor of the new CV indication, we view approval for an actual CV death indication as having coin-flip odds, given the unprecedented nature/results of the trial,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""That said, we also feel that there's a better chance the FDA would allow this data to be added to the label instead (no indication statement).""Lilly stock rose 4% to 78.13 on the stock market today, near 77, once again above its 50-day moving average. Lilly closed just below its 200-day line, where it's been for the past five months.Johnson & Johnson stock closed up 0.9% at 119.33, a fresh record high.

438,JNJ,"Big- and mega-cap stocks continued to rally broadly at lunchtime Tuesday, while utility stocks declined. With 8 of the 30 components rising at least 1%, the Dow Jones industrial average struck an all-time high.The Dow rose 0.7% after hitting an intraday high of 18,363.72, eclipsing the prior all-time peak of 18,351.36 set on May 19, 2015. The Dow, up more than 5% since Jan. 1, has now rallied 184% from its February 2009 low of 6469.89.Financial and commodity-related stocks helped lead the Dow. Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) each rallied more than 1%. Both stocks have been struggling to reassert their leadership amid stale top- and bottom-line results. In Goldman's case, Q2 profit is forecast to shrink 36% to $3.02 a share.JPMorgan, which issues results Thursday, is expected to see only a 7% EPS decline as it continues to benefit from strength in consumer-oriented lending. Research from S&P Global Market Intelligence notes that industrial companies within the S&P 500 are expected to grow profits in the second quarter by 6.5%, second only to the consumer discretionary sector (+9.4%).The Nasdaq composite rallied 0.7%, helped by tech giant Apple (AAPL), which rose 0.4%. The S&P 500 rose 0.8%, while the small-cap S&P 600 jumped 1.4%. The Dow utility average slipped nearly 1%, but it was still up more than 22% since Jan. 1.In terms of Tuesday's gains, DuPont de Nemours (DD) led the blue chips in the Dow, rising more than 3% to 66.26 and rebounding back above its 200-day moving average in heavy volume.

439,JNJ,"Despite the Brexit volatility, sparked by the U.K.'s June 24 vote to withdraw from the European Union, U.S. diversified stock mutual funds eked out a 1.79% gain on average in the second quarter, even as they lost 0.52% in June alone, according to Lipper Inc.The S&P 500 tacked on 2.46% in Q2, after inching up 0.26% in June.That's it for the good news. Stock fund managers are seeking durable-growth stocks as a hedge against the uncertainty, volatility and slowdown in corporate earnings that several told IBD they see in the months -- or longer -- ahead.Click Here To See A List Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""Before Brexit, the (investment) world was almost back to normal,"" said Matthew Ward, co-manager of Schroder U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy, which is run as a separate account. The Federal Reserve was edging toward an interest rate increase. First-quarter panic over the pace and sustainability of China's growth was subsiding. U.S. economic indicators were OK, with jobs and wages growing, home values inching up and consumers feeling confidence.""Then, Brexit,"" Ward said. ""We're back to uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty.""As a result, going forward Ward says the stocks he wants are in a narrow group that have shown an ability to grow earnings regardless of the macro environment.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""Our biggest overweight is in consumer discretionary,"" he said. ""It reflects our confidence in consumers. And in some durable secular trends. Amazon (AMZN) is at the top of our list.""Similarly, James Abate, sole manager of $156 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX) and of $53 million Multi-Asset Real Return (DHMUX), sees the best prospects for growth increasingly concentrated within an elite group. ""We're concentrating in names that somehow can buck the trend in terms of economic malaise,"" said Abate, who is also Centre's chief investment officer. ""The names in the new Nifty 50 bucket include Amazon, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Nvidia (NVDA) and General Mills (GIS).""Jim Swanson, lead manager of $3.4 billion MFS Diversified Income (DIFAX) and chief investment strategist of MFS Investment Management, was already bearish on stocks pre-Brexit.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance The outlook was already dim for corporate earnings growth, he said. He added that companies globally had already lost purchasing power. U.S. selling and general administrative costs, as well as labor costs, are rising. Productivity here, in Europe and in China is falling.Post-Brexit, the dollar is up vs. the Chinese yuan, which will hurt U.S. exports and U.S. multinationals' earnings, he said. A global movement toward trade protectionism, if realized, would also hurt earnings.""Brexit or not, we need to see excess capacity come out of the world manufacturing system and the return of some inflation so that companies can pass along price increases,"" Swanson said.Despite the threats to U.S. corporate earnings, Swanson is overweight in U.S. stocks vs. their Japanese and European peers, which have growth outlooks that look even dimmer to him. And he is underweight in stocks vs. bonds and cash.""U.S. corporate bonds are the place to be,"" he said. He's favoring a mix of high-grade and high-yield debt.Small-cap growth funds led market-capitalization and style groups among U.S. diversified stock funds in Q2, gaining 3.85%.World equity mutual funds barely advanced in Q2, edging up 0.27% while losing 0.64% in June. Latin American funds led all foreign regions, advancing 8.72% in Q2 and 10.72% in June.Up 26.16% year to date, Latin American funds have benefited primarily from a rebound from an excessive sell-off last year, as well as a rebound in the Brazilian real vs. the U.S. dollar and a bounce for oil and other commodities, according to Peter Taylor, a manager of $7.4 billion Aberdeen Emerging Markets (ABEAX) and $3.5 million Latin American Equity Fund (ALEAX). Brazilian stocks have also benefited from the ouster, at least temporarily, of President Dilma Rousseff and in market-friendly fiscal reforms, he says.The quarter's volatility enabled precious metals funds to lead sectors by soaring 40.63% in Q2, more than half of that in June.Going forward, Swanson feels best about the technology sector among U.S. stocks. ""Its free cash flow is the highest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors,"" he said. ""Despite talk of bubbles, the sector is trading cheaper than utilities in Ohio. Yet tech companies change the world.""Software is due to benefit from an overdue upgrade cycle, he says.His second-favorite sector is health care. ""Health care spending keeps rising as a portion of U.S. GDP,"" he said. ""It's priced fairly, not cheaply. It has the best profit outlook after tech.""Consumer discretionary is his third-favorite sector. ""Forward price-earnings ratios are high, but we're seeing year-over-year profit growth that's almost as good as tech's,"" he said.Among tech stocks, Facebook (FB) is one that Ward likes. ""They have exceptional top-line growth,"" he said. ""And they're growing their opportunities."" For one, viewers are tolerating a tripling of videos being shown by advertisers, which allows Facebook to triple the number of ads it inserts among videos.In health care, Ward says share prices have been beaten down, largely by investor concerns that drug pricing will draw additional regulatory scrutiny. But he still likes individual stocks in the sector, including Amgen (AMGN).""It is the cheapest with pharmaceuticals,"" he said. And it is creating market opportunities with a number of biosimilars, which are harder than previous generation treatments for rivals to replicate.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Ward likes Amazon because of top-line growth and its use of Prime to draw new site users. He also likes Amazon's use of its warehouse for storing inventory without the expense of purchasing it.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is another consumer discretionary name he likes. It caters to customers whose income is double the national average and who pursue a rural lifestyle, he says. Its sales are triple its next six competitors combined. Its scale enables Tractor Supply to customize inventory for different regions.In staples, he likes Monster Beverage (MNST). Its new carbonated drink, Mutant, and its distribution arrangement with partner Coca-Cola (KO) should keep growth in the high single digits or low double digits, he says. Wall Street expects low single digits, which makes the stock attractively valued, he says.David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments and lead manager of two of its funds -- $125 million U.S. Low Volatility Equity (LVOLX) and $11 million Small Cap Low Volatility (LVSMX) -- says that amid volatility he likes stocks with stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.One trait shared by stocks he likes is stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.Another trait is low two-year beta. Each one's beta is below 1.0, which means each is less volatile than the overall stock market.

440,JNJ,"The sale of Allergan's (AGN) generic-drug business to Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (TEVA) cleared another hurdle Tuesday when Impax Laboratories (IPXL) announced that it's paying $586 million to acquire 19 products the two firms were required to divest for competitive reasons.Impax wasn't allowed to name the products until the June 30 deal closing, apart from Teva's portion of a generic version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) attention deficit drug Concerta, which the two firms have been developing in partnership. Allergan already has its own generic Concerta on the market, so it had been expected that one of them would have to go after Teva and Allergan announced their $40 billion deal last July.The remaining products Impax acquired include 15 that are already on the market, one approved in two strengths but not yet launched, one awaiting approval and one in development. There's also a drug that's a different strength of an existing product awaiting approval, Impax said.Together, the products generated $150 million in sales and $100 million in gross profit last year. Impax said the acquisitions will add $80 million to its top line in the second half of this year, and would double full-year earnings growth to 20%. Impax also hiked its full-year interest-expense guidance to 20% from 12%, and slightly increased its gross-profit guidance to the low 50% range.Impax CEO Fred Wilkinson said on a conference call with analysts that the timing is highly opportune, since Impax was facing a difficult second half financially. The last two quarters brought triple-digit earnings growth, thanks to the company's anti-inflammatory diclofenac sodium gel, but new competition was expected to shrink bottom-line growth to single digits in Q2 and Q3 and to move it into the red in Q4.Wilkinson said the Federal Trade Commission had marked the unnamed products for divestiture because they face limited competition or because of manufacturing difficulties, intellectual property barriers or difficulties meeting bioequivalence standards. The last issue had torpedoed the in-house version of Concerta that Impax had developed in 2014, when as it was under FDA review. Then, the agency updated its bioequivalence guidelines in a way that excluded Impax's drug, as well as Mallinckrodt's (MNK) already marketed product. Impax and Teva came by the current drug through an acquisition.Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry, however, doesn't like what the guidance implies about the base business.""Absent the acquisition, new guidance implies 8% downside relative to the current FactSet consensus sales forecast,"" Gerberry wrote in a research note. ""The guidance revision to the base biz is due to increasing competition to high margin generics relative to the 1Q16 update.""He added that getting full rights to Concerta should help, but that still has more than a year to go to get to market.The market seemed to agree with his assessment. Impax stock tumbled by 11.5% to 28.31 at the close on the stock market today, near 28. Teva stock lost 1.9%to 50.98, while Allergan gave back 1.6% to 231.55.

Down just 5 cents on Monday to 122.83, the video streaming giant is still above an aggressive entry point near 120, according to IBD Leaderboard. The standard buy point is 129.39.In the energy sector, numerous oil and gas explorers struggled to hold big opening gains in the wake of another surprise agreement among non-OPEC oil-producing nations to join in the body's historic decision to cut overall production starting in January.Britain's integrated oil major BP (BP) rallied more than 1% to 36.51, at one point getting as high as 36.96, or just a few cents above a 36.93 cup buy point. The eight-week cup sits within a much longer and deeper bottoming base pattern. Halliburton (HAL) ran up to a session high of 56.08 before sinking back to 54.49, up just 0.5%. The oilfield services giant, however, has climbed more than 16% since clearing a 47 flat-base buy point in early October.At one point, Halliburton pulled back below the 47 entry to an intraday low of 45.08, but that 4% drop was not enough to trigger the 8% loss-cutting sell rule following a good breakout.Wall Street sees Halliburton reversing from a net loss of 5 cents a share in 2016 to a net profit of $1.03 a share in 2017.The week features only a sliver of companies reporting quarterly results, but they include two major big-cap software names, Oracle (ORCL) and Adobe Systems (ADBE). The latter is expected to grow fourth-quarter profit 39% to 86 cents a share. Over the prior six quarters, earnings have grown on average 53.2%.In August, Adobe pushed past a 100.66 flat-base entry point and rallied more than 10% before fading. Yet in its most recent correction, the stock found bullish support at the long-term 200-day moving average. Watch to see if the stock can hurdle its 50-day moving average, which would boost the odds of a fresh breakout.Besides the upcoming Federal Reserve decision on interest rates on Wednesday, keep an eye out for the November report on producer level prices.

444,JNJ,"Contact-lens maker The Cooper Companies (COO) reversed lower on the stock market Friday despite its Q2 earnings and full-year guidance surpassing expectations late Thursday.Jefferies analyst Anthony Petrone raised his price target on the stock to 190 from 175 and affirmed a buy rating, saying that his survey suggested the redesign of Cooper's Clariti disposable contacts drove results.For the quarter ended April 30, Cooper's earnings rose 19% over the year-earlier quarter to $2.05 a share, excluding one-time items, beating analysts' consensus by 14 cents. Sales increased 11% to $483.8 million, about $20 million above consensus.Cooper added 20 cents to its full-year EPS guidance range, now $8.20 to $8.50 vs. $7.44 last year. Its sales guidance of $1.93 billion to $1.96 billion is $60 million higher than previously and up from $1.8 billion last year.Cooper stock jumped as much as 3.6% but closed down 1.2% on the stock market today. The stock, which has been forming a long cup base since April of last year, holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 91.The coming launch of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) new silicon hydrogel monthly lens in July came up several times during Cooper's earnings conference call with analysts, though J&J's contact-lens division performed fairly weakly in Q1.""In the guidance, there's a modest deceleration compared to what we had previously forecasted to anticipate, if you will, some impact of the J&J rollout,"" Cooper CEO Bob Weiss said on the call.Wall Street has questioned whether J&J's decision in April to abandon its unilateral pricing policy on its contacts will put pricing pressure on the whole field, but Weiss downplayed its importance.""I know that some vendors may have -- or retailers may have -- altered J&J prices,"" Weiss said. ""But by and large, the market continues to drive itself the way it has in the past. Pricing is not really a factor. It's all about trading up and shelf space.""

445,JNJ,"Don't let the name of ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs (SDOG) fool you.The exchange traded fund hit a record high this past week and has been a remarkably steady performer. Excluding the Aug. 24, 2015, flash crash, the ETF's deepest decline has been 17%, from November 2015 to January 2016. Nearly all other declines since its inception four years ago were 10% or less. Shares broke out of a flat base last Monday past a 40.38 buy point.With a primary focus on large-cap dividend stocks, the ETF serves for smooth long-term sailing rather than momentum plays.The fund is designed around the Dogs of the Dow strategy, which basically seeks the 10 components of the Dow Jones industrial average with the highest dividend yields. The thinking is that those ""dogs"" are just temporarily out of favor and their share price will eventually catch up with the yield performance.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs takes that premise and applies it to a larger universe, namely the S&P 500. It finds the S&P 500 stocks with the highest dividend yield in their respective sectors, so it always has exposure to the 10 broad sectors of the index.Those selected have a nearly equal weighting in the ETF. The 50 stocks range in weighting from 1.3% to 3.1%, according to the ALPS website.Most of the 50 components have been rebounding this year, even as some are forming price consolidations right now.A pair of health care stocks, Baxter (BAX) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been some of the best-performing components in 2016. Baxter, which makes hospital and renal-disease products, is up about 10% from a breakout past a 40.66 buy point. J&J has advanced about 11% from its 104.88 buy point.Insurance firm Cincinnati Financial (CINF) has rallied about 13% since breaking out Feb. 12.The ETF pays a quarterly dividend of about 35 cents a share. That's good for an annualized yield of about 3%.                 The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

448,JNJ,"Exxon Mobil (XOM) hiked its quarterly dividend Wednesday to 75 cents from 73 cents a day after Standard & Poor's stripped the oil giant of its AAA credit rating.S&P cited low commodity prices, high reinvestment requirements and continued large dividend payments.Exxon held the best-possible rating for nearly 50 years, since 1967, according to Dow Jones. Now that S&P has cut it to AA+, just two U.S. companies still hold the prized AAA rating, Microsoft (MSFT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Standard & Poor's Rating Service noted that Exxon's debt level had more than doubled in recent years and added that it expects Exxon's costs to rise as the oil and gas major tries to maintain production and increase reserves. ""As a result, we expect leverage to remain weaker than levels consistent with a 'AAA' rating, and we believe that lowering ratings to 'AA+' is appropriate.""Furthermore, we believe the company may return cash to shareholders rather than building cash or reducing debt, limiting improvement in our projected credit measures when commodity prices improve.""Investors like to receive returns in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Exxon has been committed to maintaining dividend payments even as it accumulated debt.S&P put Exxon on CreditWatch in February, with negative implications, signaling that it was considering a downgrade. S&P said in its report Tuesday that it was removing Exxon from CreditWatch after the ratings downgrade on the company's corporate credit and long-term debt.Exxon shares closed up 1% in the stock market today as crude prices continued to rally.

450,JNJ,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) said Monday that its experimental antibody for arthritis pain succeeded in a mid-stage trial, but shares were flat in early trading as the results were expected.The study enrolled 421 sufferers of moderate-to-severe hip and knee pain who'd been unsuccessful with standard painkillers. After 16 weeks of treatment, the group taking Regeneron's fasinumab had improved by more than 3 points on a 10-point pain scale, significantly better than the placebo group.About 17% of the group taking fasinumab experienced adverse events, Regeneron said, including non-inflammatory joint pain, prickling and burning sensations in the skin, numbness and swelling.The investigators also did extensive imaging of the subjects, because the class of medicines to which fasinumab belongs -- nerve growth factor (NGF) antibodies -- has been associated with joint damage. They wound up excluding 2% of subjects due to imaging results, and five patients among the remainder suffered subchondral insufficiency fractures, or stress fractures on abnormal bones.Regeneron stock was near 377 in early trading on the stock market today. Shares touched an 18-month below 349 in late March, and Regeneron stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 47, putting it among the lower half of all stocks on the basis of key metrics such as earnings and sales growth.Regeneron had already signaled that the trial was going well earlier this year by starting a large phase-three trial of the drug, so the results weren't especially surprising to analysts. It also lost a potential competitor in late March, when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stopped development of its own NGF antibody fulranumab, which was in late-stage trials for arthritis pain. RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt wrote at the time that J&J's decision was based on pipeline prioritization, not on any problems with the drug itself.On Monday, Butt praised the effectiveness of fasinumab in the trial but wrote that the safety ""bears watching.""""Overall, should this program succeed, it could be another blockbuster candidate, which unlike others could be an upside driver since it comes with regulatory and mechanistic safety concerns, hence is not a major focus for investors at this time, aside from a development cost and timeline standpoint,"" Butt wrote in his research note.

451,JNJ,"The long-awaited entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the 3D printer market began Tuesday, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and BMW.The new printer line, called HP Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution, “revolutionizes design, prototyping and manufacturing, and for the first time, delivers superior quality physical parts up to 10 times faster and at half the cost of current 3D print systems,” HP said in its press release.HP will compete with 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), the two largest providers of 3D printers, among others.HP is offering two 3D printers. They are the HP Jet Fusion 3D 3200 printer, designed for prototyping, and the Jet Fusion 3D 4200 printer, designed for prototyping and short-run manufacturing needs. Pricing on the 4200 model starts at $155,000 and will be delivered in late 2016.

452,JNJ,"Two giants in cardiac devices agreed to merge Thursday, as Abbott Laboratories (ABT) announced an agreement to acquire St. Jude Medical (STJ) in a deal worth $25 billion.Abbott agreed to pay $46.75 plus 0.8708 Abbott share for every St. Jude share. Based on Abbott's five-day average share price, the deal valued St. Jude shares at $85 apiece. St. Jude stock was up more than 25% in morning trading on the stock market today, near 78, while Abbott stock was down more than 7%, below 41.Abbott said that the deal will add 21 cents to its EPS next year and 28 cents the following year. It expects to save $500 million in costs from the combination by 2020. Abbott will also assume or refinance St. Jude's $5.7 billion in debt.The move will greatly enlarge Abbott's cardiovascular device business, which now represents 19% of its revenue.""St. Jude Medical's strong positions in heart failure devices, atrial fibrillation and cardiac rhythm management complement Abbott's leading positions in coronary intervention and transcatheter mitral repair,"" said Abbott's press release. ""Together, the company will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market and hold the No. 1 or 2 positions across large and high-growth cardiovascular device markets.""Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy agreed. St. Jude's flat-to-negative sales growth over the last few years picked up to 8% in Q1, and she wrote in a research note that it's set up to continue, while Abbott looked to be growing only in the low single digits.Antalffy also wrote that a competing bid is unlikely.""The most logical buyer beyond Abbott in our view would be Johnson & Johnson (JNJ),"" Antalffy wrote. ""In our meetings with J&J in mid-2015, management emphasized that the company is not interested in what they deemed 'value' markets within MedTech, specifically calling out cardiac rhythm management (nearly 30% of St. Jude's total sales) and drug-eluting stents.""The deal announcement came on a busy day for M&A in medical field. Biotech Medivation (MDVN) confirmed that it had received an unsolicited $9.3 billion bid from big pharma Sanofi (SNY), while AbbVie (ABBV), which used to be Abbott's biopharma division before it was spun out, agreed to buy another cancer-focused biotech, Stemcentrx, for $5.8 billion.

453,JNJ,"Shares of medical-product maker Baxter International (BAX) hit an all-time high Tuesday after the company beat Q1 estimates and raised its guidance.Baxter's earnings, excluding one-time items, rose 6% over the year-earlier quarter to 36 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by seven cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Sales declined 1% to $2.38 billion, beating Wall Street's number by about $22 million. Excluding the foreign-exchange impact, sales rose 4%.Baxter added 13 cents to its full-year EPS guidance, now $1.59 to $1.67, up from $1.36 last year. The company said that its constant-currency sales growth should be 3%; it had previously guided 2% to 3%.For the second quarter, Baxter forecast earnings of 38 to 40 cents a share, topping analysts' average estimate of 35 cents. It said that sales should grow 2% -- even including the FX impact -- where the Street had expected a slight decline.Baxter stock hit a new high of 44.75 in early trading on the stock market today. In afternoon trading, shares were up less than 1%, near 44.Baxter's products, which include IV systems, dialysis machines and surgical equipment, are sold mainly to the hospital market, which has been looking strong this earnings season, according to Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy.""This -- now the third consecutive growth quarter in the U.S. after two consecutive quarters of low-single-digit declines -- could serve as another encouraging data point, in addition to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), St. Jude Medical (STJ) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT) (Q1 reports) last week, that supports a potential trend for improving U.S. procedure volumes overall,"" Antalffy wrote in a research note.The fortunes of hospital stocks supports her view: The Medical-Hospitals group has been among the fastest-rising of IBD's 197 industry groups, leaping from No. 191 to six weeks ago to No. 39 at present.
"
454,JNJ,"Big pharma Eli Lilly (LLY) issued mixed first-quarter earnings and guidance Tuesday, sending its stock down in early trading.Lilly's earnings, excluding one-time items, shrank 5% from the year-earlier quarter to 83 cents a share, missing analysts' consensus by 2 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue rose 5% to $4.87 billion, beating consensus by $45 million.Lilly added 5 cents to its 2016 EPS guidance range, now $2.68 to $2.78. It also raised its sales guidance slightly to $20.6 billion to $21.1 billion. At the same time, it shaved a percentage point off its gross-margin guidance, now 76%, as it also lifted its guidance for R&D and sales, general and administrative spending.Lilly stock was down nearly 2% in morning trading on the stock market today, below 77.Improved foreign-exchange rates were responsible for much of the upside, along with a 5-cent-a-share tax benefit in Q1. At the same time, the bottom line was hit by rising R&D expenses, including a $55 million milestone payment to biotech partner Incyte (INCY) upon the submission for approval of their jointly developed drug baricitinib.On the level of individual products, diabetes drug Humalog provided the biggest surprise, with its $606 million in Q1 sales falling 11% from the prior year and missing consensus by $100 million, according to Evercore ISI. Lilly said demand for the drug had actually increased, but so had rebates and discounts that Lilly negotiated with payers. Lilly said it does not expect the downtrend to continue the rest of the year.Revenue from a newer diabetes drug, Jardiance, doubled compared with last year, though since Lilly splits the take with partner Boehringer Ingelheim, it only received $38 million in Q1. U.S. sales beat expectations, and Lilly said it's taking more share of the growing SGLT2 class of diabetes drugs, perhaps accounting for the underperformance of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) SGLT2 drug Invokana, as shown in J&J's Q1 report last week.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez wrote that while there were various upsides and downsides to the report, ""we expect a limited impact as investor concerns about a significant Q1 miss diminish, and the focus shifts to abemaciclib data at ASCO (the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June) and the conclusion of Expedition 3 (trial of solanezumab in Alzheimer's disease) in Q4 2016,"" he wrote in his research note.

"
459,JNJ,"Amgen lifted its full-year guidance, though compared with the Q3 beat it implied that Q4 may underperform. It added $200 million to $300 million to its revenue guidance, now $21.4 billion to $21.6 billion. It raised its EPS guidance by about 35 cents, now $9.95 to $10.10. Both were above Wall Street's estimate.

The FDA approved its melanoma drug Imlygic the day before the earnings report, and its potential blockbuster cholesterol drug Repatha in August.Amgen stock rose 0.4% in regular trade to 162.67.

472,JNJ,"ETF investors have lately been seeking out safe, sound and stable stocks as the market turned more volatile. Stocks likely to make the whiz-bang moves are getting a lot less love.A deterioration in credit market conditions is contributing to choppiness in the stock market, Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote in a Nov. 9 report.""We continue to favor a tilt toward quality,"" he added. ""While momentum has been an effective style over the past several years as markets generally marched upward, it has struggled since volatility began to rise in the late summer.""IShares MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) gained 1.7% in the past three months through Nov. 11 vs. 0.8% for iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM).On a year-to-date basis, the momentum ETF has outperformed the quality ETF. It also came out tops in 2014.QUAL, the quality ETF, homes in on profitable companies for successful investing.It tracks an index that targets large- and midcap U.S. stocks with high returns on equity, low debt burdens and more consistent earnings over the previous five years.Stocks are weighted based on both the degree to which they exhibit these characteristics and their market capitalization.""This skews the portfolio toward stocks with durable competitive advantages,"" Morningstar analyst Alex Bryan wrote in a recent report. ""The fund is better positioned than many of its peers for market downturns.""But expect it to underperform its momentum peer when the stock market's rallying strongly.This exchange traded fund holds 125 stocks. Microsoft (MSFT) is its largest holding, with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Apple (AAPL), Gilead (GILD) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) rounding out the top five.MTUM, the momentum ETF, focuses on winning stocks.It follows an index of large- and midcap stocks with strong risk-adjusted price momentum.Assessing price movements through the prism of risk could pay off. It may allow this ETF investment strategy to hold stock winners whose recent performance is likely to persist, says Bryan.""The fund's focus on risk-adjusted momentum may help reduce volatility and turnover,"" he added. On the flip side, this ETF investment strategy may offer a diluted momentum effect because it rebalances only twice a year.It also holds 125 stocks.

"
474,JNJ,"Midcap drugmakers Jazz Pharmaceuticals, Halozyme Therapeutics and Depomed were moving in the stock market Tuesday after they reported Q3 earnings late Monday, rounding out a mixed earnings season for the beleaguered sector.Jazz Pharmaceuticals (JAZZ) got a downgrade and several price-target cuts after its lead drug, Xyrem, declined sequentially for the first time ever, leading to a quarterly miss. Sales rose 11% over the year-earlier quarter to $340.9 million, missing analysts' consensus by more than $7 million. Earnings gained 10% to $2.52 a share, 4 cents shy of consensus.Jazz narrowed its full-year guidance in a way that lowered the midpoint on both revenue and EPS. It now expects earnings of $9.45 to $9.60 a share vs. $8.35 last year. Revenue was guided at $1.32 billion to $1.34 billion vs. $1.17 billion in 2014.Jazz also said on its earnings conference call with analysts Monday that there had been disruptions in production of Xyrem, a narcolepsy treatment. Because Xyrem is classified as a potentially addictive substance, it's distributed from one central pharmacy under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). A new REMS went into effect in late August, bringing different forms and procedures that temporarily snarled up the works, Jazz executives said.Executives also said Jazz's drug candidate Leukotac had failed a late-stage trial in graft vs. host disease, and they would halt development of the drug.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler downgraded Jazz to neutral from outperform, partly on revised valuation methodology but also on a soft outlook.""We model below consensus 2016 EPS and can no longer support a buy rating in spite of our cautiously optimistic outlook on a 2016 Xyrem generic settlement,"" Koffler wrote.Canaccord Genuity cut its price target to 170 from 215, Piper Jaffray cut it to 186 from 208 and Leerink cut it to 187 from 220. All three investment banks, though, maintained buy or equivalent ratings on Jazz stock.""Both (the Xyrem miss and the Leukotac failure) are one-time events that shouldn't affect Jazz's ongoing fundamentals,"" wrote Canaccord analyst Corey Davis. ""With respect to valuation, since the specialty pharma sector is in a period of significant volatility, we are increasing the discount rate in our DCF (discount cash flow) analysis from 10% to 12% to account for the risks associated with the market.""Jazz plunged 9% in early trading in the stock market today, but in afternoon trading it was down 4%, near 135.Depomed Hikes OutlookSpecialty drug maker Depomed (DEPO) was heading in the opposite direction after it beat estimates and raised its guidance. Revenue more than doubled to $104.9 million, beating Wall Street's average estimate by $3 million, while earnings jumped all the way from 3 cents to 33 cents a share, excluding one-time items, topping consensus by 14 cents.Depomed added $12 million to its full-year product-sales guidance range, now $336 million to $348 million. It did not guide EPS, but said total earnings should be $58 million to $66 million, up $17 million from its previous range.Depomed CEO James Schoeneck credited the growth to pain medicine Nucynta, which the company relaunched in June after acquiring it from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). Schoeneck reiterated his opposition to Horizon Pharma's (HZNP) unsolicited all-stock bid for Depomed, and noted that Depomed has filed a confidentiality suit against Horizon, which is due for a hearing on Nov. 19.Depomed stock popped almost 9% in early trading Tuesday. It was up 5% in afternoon trading, near 21.Halozyme Falls ShortBiotech Halozyme Therapeutics (HALO) was down 11% Tuesday afternoon, near 16, after its Q3 results missed expectations, though it affirmed its guidance. Halozyme's revenue climbed 42% over the year-earlier quarter to $20.8 million, missing consensus by more than $3 million. It lost 19 cents a share, 3 cents more than the Street expected.Halozyme maintained its full-year revenue guidance of $110 million to $115 million, up from $75 million last year. It did not guide EPS, but said operating expenses will be $160 million to $170 million, burning through $20 million to $30 million of cash.JPMorgan analyst Jessica Fye wrote that the more consequential news from the Q3 call was the description of Halozyme's phase three trial of its sole product PEGPH20, which aids in the delivery of injectable drugs, in combination with Celgene's (CELG) cancer drug Abraxane and the generic drug gemcitabine in newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer.""The study has an adaptive design, with both PFS (progression-free survival) and OS (overall survival) as primary endpoints, and includes an interim look once PFS is reached which, depending on the magnitude of benefit, could potentially support registration at that point,"" Fye wrote in her research note. ""Net-net, we remain positive on the opportunity for PEGPH20 in first-line high-hyaluronan pancreatic cancer as well as the potential to broaden into additional tumor types.""Halozyme stock touched an all-time high above 25 in July, but Halozyme and the biomed/biotech group in general were hit hard by the stock market's late summer downturn. IBD's 406-company Medical-Biomed/Biotech industry group is down 20% since touching a record high July 20, and now ranks No. 49 out of 197 groups tracked.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

486,JNJ,"Specialty drugmaker Mallinckrodt (MNK) offered fiscal 2016 guidance Tuesday following the sale of one of its imaging units, with revenue growth solid and EPS on the light side. The stock briefly rallied before being dragged down in another drug-stock sell-off.Mallinckrodt said that in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 it expects to make $7.70 to $8.20 a share, bracketing analysts' consensus of $8.00 but with the midpoint a bit below, according to Thomson Reuters. The company didn't give a revenue range but said it expects net sales growth of at least 10%, excluding the foreign-currency impact. Analysts had forecast total revenue of $3.63 billion, up 2% from the last fiscal year, but their estimates typically include FX impact.Mallinckrodt also provided some guidance on the business segments. It said the branded drug business should grow at least 30%, driven by its pricey immunology drug Achthar and injectable pain medicine Ofirmev. Generic drug sales, still suffering from the FDA's revocation of its ""bioequivalence"" designation for Mallinckrodt's generic version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Concerta, are expected to fall 15% to 20%. What remains of the imaging business after the $270 million sale of the Contrast Media and Delivery Systems (CMDS) business to France's Guerbet is seen shrinking 5% to 10%.UBS analyst Marc Goodman wrote that the consensus numbers may or may not include the CMDS business, so it's hard to tell exactly what was expected, but ""management's apples-to-apples analysis of the sell-side numbers suggests 10-11% top-line growth and an EPS of $8.02-8.05."" Goodman added that his own EPS estimate was above the guidance, ""largely because we have not yet incorporated the newly issued debt, which hits EPS by 30 cents. We will be reviewing our estimates but overall we are good with the guidance.""Nomura analyst Shibani Malhotra wrote that the guidance was basically what she expected, though the growth in branded drugs was an upside. On the other hand, the generic shrinkage was even worse than she'd thought.Mallinckrodt stock rose as much as 8% in early trading on the stock market today, but midday it headed south along with the rest of the market. In afternoon trading it was up nearly 2%.The stock is some 55% off the high it hit back in March, hurt both by the general drug-stock sell-off and by its missing sales estimates in its last quarterly report. Nonetheless, it retains a very strong EPS Rank of 95.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and on Facebook.

"
542,JNJ,"Stocks finished the week with small gains, and while volume was lighter and interest felt like it was waning - the mkt did end the week at the best closing levels in over a month.
"
543,JNJ,"The strength that we saw last week is most likely attributable to traders/investors continued celebration of the latest release of the FOMC mins.....Those mins - released last week showed that Fed members remain concerned about global growth and the risk it poses to our economy...... (Never mind all the talk about how ready the US economy is for the normalization process to begin.) In the end - the bottom line is that there does not appear to be any rate hike on the calendar anytime soon. Over the weekend - Paul Ashworth, Chief U.S. Economist at Capital Economics, had this to say -
"
544,JNJ,"""Admittedly, there are still two employment reports scheduled for release before the FOMC meets in December......But at this stage we think it would take a major turnaround in payroll growth, to well above 200,000 per month, to persuade officials to support a December rate hike.""
"
545,JNJ,"And then on Sunday - While 'vacationing' at the IMF Policy meeting in Lima, Peru - Stanley Fischer had this to say to Reuters - who then ran with the following headline story.....
"
546,JNJ,"""Fed's Fischer says 2015 US rate rise is 'an expectation, not a commitment"" (Oh BOY!)...
"
547,JNJ,"In it he says that: ""US Federal Reserve policymakers are still likely to raise interest rates this year, BUT that is 'an expectation, not a commitment"" and could change if the global economy pushes the US economy further off course.....Both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent adjustments to the federal funds rate target will depend critical on future developments in the economy....""
"
548,JNJ,"He went onto say that 'he felt the economy was still generating enough jobs to continue making progress towards the FED's goal of maximum employment and that inflation would eventually rise' - keeping the US central bank on track to raise rates this year.... and then he quickly protected himself by saying that ""the US is now more exposed than ever to international events and that developments in China and elsewhere had already influenced the FED to delay a widely expected rate increase in September"".
"
549,JNJ,"And this morning's WSJ has many of the IMF officials urging the FED to 'get on with it'....FED FATIGUE is now taking hold....all of the talk back and forth does nothing but cause more instability and anxiety in global mkts.....and so they all got together and said -Stop the madness - suggesting that they would prefer some sense of certainty vs. the 'agony of waiting'.....
"
550,JNJ,"""delaying the increase would not solve the situation....if it is a case that the emerging mkts have taken on too much debt, then there will a day of reckoning, Delaying an interest rate hike does not necessarily address that issue""
"
551,JNJ,"Now fatigue with the FED is like the fatigue that we all felt during the 2009 Presidential race, when Hillary announced 20 months prior to the election.....trying to work the crowd only to find that the crowd tired of all the back and forth....and what happened? She lost credibility, people grew exhausted of the Hillary show and started to re-focus their energies etc....and the world moved on.....so - is the world now tiring of the FED playing both sides of the fence? Feels like it is....
"
552,JNJ,"Now look - the rally seen over the last 9 sessions, has lifted the S&P (and all the major indexes) back above their 50 dma-, removing near term resistance. Does this mean that this rally will continue to take prices up? Sure, But not so fast.....There are daily calls for the 'coming recession'....analysts and strategists screaming about how the world is coming to an end (which could be just what we need to break out!) ......but could we be in the early stages of a bear market. - sure. Remember that part of the reality of bear markets is that they have strong 'short-covering' rallies the mkt tries to find fair value.....Take a look at the S&P......is a new and lower sideways channel building?
"
553,JNJ,"Notice the 8 month sideways channel that the S&P traded in before this summer. (2040/2130).....Now notice the break in August - taking us well outside of the lower band....only to bounce back to test the down trending 50 dma in mid-September. Then in late September, the S&P fell back down to test the August lows only to once again move up and test the down trending 50 dma - but this time - it moved up and thru it - seemingly breaking out.... - Well the next resistance is at 2045 (100 dma) and then 2060 (200 dma) - but if you look at the action - you can clearly see what looks like a new sideways channel developing right below the old sideways channel. (1850/2000). Now if this is true, then just maybe the mkt is in a short term overbought condition.....which means that we could see another down leg at anytime....Is that down leg now during earnings season? We are about to find out....
"
554,JNJ,"This week brings us a slew of macro data - Retail Sales - exp of 0.2%, ex autos and gas at 0.3%, PPI of -0.2%, ex food and energy of 0.1%.......In addition we get Empire state manufacturing of -8 and CPI of -0.2%,. ex food and energy of 0.1%. On the earnings front it is a BIG week.....JPM due out tomorrow after the bell, followed by BAC, WFC, C and GS later in the week. Throw in JNJ, INTC, BLK, CSX, and NFLX and it is sure to be an interesting week. Remember it is NOT so much about the actual earnings - they are history - it is about profit margins and future outlook. What role will China play in that outlook? Will China be the black swan?
"
555,JNJ,"This morning US futures are flat - It is Columbus Day here in the states, banks and the bond mkts are closed.....do not expect much action today as the investors await data later in the week.
"
556,JNJ,"That being said - look for more action in EMC.......This morning we did learn that all the chatter about DELL and EMC is true......Dell announces a plan to acquire EMC for $67 bil......The deal is worth about $33/sh ($24 in cash and $9 in VMWare) - which is 28% above Oct 7th closing price - when the rumors started......but clearly some people knew about this possibility at the end of September when the stock was trading at $23/share and started to break out for no reason.....

560,JNJ,"Shares of Eli Lilly (LLY) jumped to a more than 14-year high Thursday as the company presented more evidence that its diabetes drug Jardiance reduces death from heart failure.At the annual European Association for the Study of Diabetes, Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim presented details on the massive Empa-Reg Outcome Trial studying the long-term cardiovascular effects of Jardiance, which they first headlined last month. Lilly and Ingelheim reported that Jardiance reduced death by cardiovascular causes by 38% — although oddly enough, it did not reduce the risk of nonfatal heart attack and stroke. All-cause mortality was cut by 32%, while hospitalizations for heart failure were down 35%.Lilly noted that Jardiance was the first diabetes drug to show this kind of effect.""Addressing the burden of cardiovascular events, including death, is at the core of diabetes care, and until now no single diabetes medication has been associated with a reduction in mortality,"" lead investigator Bernard Zinman said in a statement.Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum reported that the slides from the study generated applause at the meeting. He also noted that it has larger implications in the field of diabetes care. Jardiance is an SGLT2 inhibitor, the same class of drug as Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Invokana and AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga.On the other hand, Merck's (MRK) similar outcomes study of its Januvia, a drug in a different class called DPP4 inhibitors, did not find a cardiovascular benefit, though it didn't do any harm either.""Based on these data, I think the SGLT2 class is likely to be bigger than the DPP4 class in 3-6 years,"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients. ""Remember, every $1 billion (per year) in additional sales adds $0.25 to Lilly EPS. Peak sales estimates are currently under $2 billion. Merck sells $6 billion of Januvia today. These could invert.""Schoenebaum added that J&J and AstraZeneca are also conducting outcomes studies on the SGLT2 inhibitors — with results due in 2017 and 2019, respectively — that should give a clearer idea of whether this is a class effect.The new data were announced just before noon ET Thursday, sending Lilly stock up nearly 7% to above 90 later Thursday afternoon. Merck stock was down more than 1% in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.

562,JNJ,"Vanguard continues to lure ETF investors. Fourteen of its exchange traded funds absorbed more than $2 billion each in new investor money in the past year. Year to date through Aug. 31, Vanguard ETFs saw $49.2 billion in net inflow — more than any other rival.Vanguard was followed by iShares with $46.8 billion in net inflow, WisdomTree (WETF) with $20.8 billion, Deutsche X-trackers with $15.9 billion and First Trust with $9.2 billion, according to independent research firm ETFGI.A focus on low costs has made Vanguard ETFs a popular choice for successful investing. On average, their ETFs cost 76% less than those from other companies.

608,JNJ,"Halozyme Therapeutics has been one of 2015's hotter biotech stocks, but it's not exactly because of developing a drug. Halozyme's (HALO) one marketed product, Hylenex, aids in the delivery of injectable drugs.
"
609,JNJ,"Halozyme has also licensed Enhanze for the same purpose to such drug companies as Pfizer (PFE), Roche (RHHBY), Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen division, AbbVie (ABBV) and Baxalta (BXLT) for the development of injectable products.
"
610,JNJ,"San Diego-based Halozyme is also testing a product called PEGPH20 in combination with other drugs as a treatment for various cancers.
"
611,JNJ,"Analysts don't expect these efforts to yield steady annual earnings until 2017, but even after the recent biotech stock selloff, Halozyme is trading at double where it was at the start of the year.
"
612,JNJ,"In a recent interview with IBD, Halozyme CEO Helen Torley explained the company's business model and why it's catching Wall Street's attention.
"
613,JNJ,"IBD: You have two drug-delivery products, Hylenex and Enhanze, that seem similar. What is the difference between them?
"
614,JNJ,"Torley: Our one marketed product is Hylenex, and that is the basic rHuPH20 enzyme which degrades hyaluronan, which is a sugar that is present under your skin. If you've ever had a subcutaneous injection, as they're injecting it you probably get sore because they're coming up against some resistance. That resistance is caused by the hyaluronan that's under the skin.
"
615,JNJ,"Our product, which is rHuPH20, in Hylenex and also in Enhanze, temporarily breaks down the hyaluronan, which releases the water molecules that are attached to the hyaluronan, and allows the creation of passages underneath the skin that allow whatever you're injecting there to have a bigger surface area for absorption into the bloodstream or the lymphatics.
"
616,JNJ,"Hylenex is the product that Halozyme went and got approved, and it's promoted by a small field force that we have in the U.S.
"
617,JNJ,"It basically is the rHuPH20 that is used for the dispersion of fluids that can be given under the skin and also with some drugs as well. That is a modest part of our business in terms of generating some revenue.
"
618,JNJ,"Now we also have the part of the business that we call the Enhanze platform. And that's where we allow partners like Pfizer, Roche, Janssen, AbbVie and Baxalta to license the use of our enzyme, which, in most of those cases, they combine with their molecule.
"
619,JNJ,"I'll use Roche's Herceptin and MabThera (Rituxan in the U.S.) as two examples. They created a new product that was a mixture of Herceptin and our enzyme, and went through a different regulatory path to get approved. So when that new product, which is called Herceptin SC, is injected, our enzyme works to allow the herceptin to be absorbed underneath the skin because it's breaking down that hyaluronan barrier and allowing there to be a bigger surface area for absorption. So instead of Herceptin having to be given into the vein, as an IV, when it's co-administered with our drug you can give it as a subcutaneous injection.
"
620,JNJ,"It's the same base sugar. It's just that when it's licensed, it's called Enhanze, and when it's our product, it's called Hylenex.
"
621,JNJ,"IBD: And the drug you're developing for cancer treatment is also based on the same substance?
"
622,JNJ,"Torley: When we give Hylenex in the marketplace today, we give it subcutaneously. If we were to give it into the vein, it would be digested in the liver very rapidly. So it wouldn't have a big effect if it were given into the vein.
"
623,JNJ,"(So) we pegylated it. (Pegylating) is a not-uncommon approach taken to have drugs have a longer time that they can circulate in your body before they get digested and degraded by the liver. The PEGPH20 is basically a pegylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme. We can give it into the vein and it will last in the body for several days, so it can exert its effects for several days.
"
624,JNJ,"Some examples would be Amgen's (AMGN) Neupogen, which is given pretty frequently for patients who have low white (blood) cells from receiving chemotherapy. They peglyated it and created Neulasta, which only had to be injected every couple of weeks, which was obviously a better convenience for patients.
"
625,JNJ,"That's exactly what we're trying to do here: have the drug last longer so it doesn't have to be given as frequently.
"
626,JNJ,"IBD: So is it necessarily combined with another drug, or does it do anything by itself?
"
627,JNJ,"Torley: PEGPH20 has some modest anti-cancer effect. But for the type of effects that we believe are important for patients, it needs to be used with another therapy.
"
628,JNJ,"I'll give an example of the data we just presented in late May, a study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These are patients who generally have a life expectancy of about six months after they're diagnosed.
"
629,JNJ,"We are looking at PEGPH20 in addition to one of the current best-available therapies, which is a combination of Abraxane, Celgene's (CELG) drug, and gemcitabine, which is a generic drug. What we did was look at PEGPH20 on top of Abraxane and gemcitabine vs. Abraxane and gemcitabine alone.
"
630,JNJ,"The theory as to why PEGPH20 is working is that for patients who are at a high level of this sugar hyaluronan in and around their tumor, it acts as a barrier to the cancer therapies' ability to get to the tumor where they need to work. And it does that by binding water molecules, creating high pressure in and around the tumor that compresses the blood vessels, so that when you get an injection of Abraxane, for example, the theory is the Abraxane cannot get into the tumor where it needs to work because there's low blood flow in the tumor.
"
631,JNJ,"We administer our PEG0H20, it breaks down the hyaluronan, opens up the blood vessels, opens up the blood flow. And so if after you give PEGPH20 you give Abraxane and gemcitabine, there's a much higher concentration of the chemotherapies that get into the tumor where they need to work.
"
632,JNJ,"Early data from our phase two study (showed) patients who received PEGPH20 before they got the gemcitabine and Abraxane had a doubling of their progression-free survival (and) a doubling of their response rate, and we saw an interesting early trend toward an improvement in survival — in the patients who had high levels of hyaluronan. (We) estimate that about 40% to 60% of pancreatic-cancer patients have high levels of this sugar.
"
633,JNJ,"Today with Abraxane and gemcitabine, which is one of the best standards of care, the median survival is just about eight months. What we're hoping to do for these patients of high levels of hyaluronan is to get a good improvement over and above that.

That resistance is caused by the hyaluronan that's under the skin.Our product, which is rHuPH20, in Hylenex and also in Enhanze, temporarily breaks down the hyaluronan, which releases the water molecules that are attached to the hyaluronan, and allows the creation of passages underneath the skin that allow whatever you're injecting there to have a bigger surface area for absorption into the bloodstream or the lymphatics.Hylenex is the product that Halozyme went and got approved, and it's promoted by a small field force that we have in the U.S.It basically is the rHuPH20 that is used for the dispersion of fluids that can be given under the skin and also with some drugs as well. That is a modest part of our business in terms of generating some revenue.Now we also have the part of the business that we call the Enhanze platform. And that's where we allow partners like Pfizer, Roche, Janssen, AbbVie and Baxalta to license the use of our enzyme, which, in most of those cases, they combine with their molecule.I'll use Roche's Herceptin and MabThera (Rituxan in the U.S.) as two examples. They created a new product that was a mixture of Herceptin and our enzyme, and went through a different regulatory path to get approved. So when that new product, which is called Herceptin SC, is injected, our enzyme works to allow the herceptin to be absorbed underneath the skin because it's breaking down that hyaluronan barrier and allowing there to be a bigger surface area for absorption. So instead of Herceptin having to be given into the vein, as an IV, when it's co-administered with our drug you can give it as a subcutaneous injection.It's the same base sugar. It's just that when it's licensed, it's called Enhanze, and when it's our product, it's called Hylenex.IBD: And the drug you're developing for cancer treatment is also based on the same substance?Torley: When we give Hylenex in the marketplace today, we give it subcutaneously. If we were to give it into the vein, it would be digested in the liver very rapidly. So it wouldn't have a big effect if it were given into the vein.(So) we pegylated it. (Pegylating) is a not-uncommon approach taken to have drugs have a longer time that they can circulate in your body before they get digested and degraded by the liver. The PEGPH20 is basically a pegylated version of the rHuPH20 enzyme. We can give it into the vein and it will last in the body for several days, so it can exert its effects for several days.Some examples would be Amgen's (AMGN) Neupogen, which is given pretty frequently for patients who have low white (blood) cells from receiving chemotherapy. They peglyated it and created Neulasta, which only had to be injected every couple of weeks, which was obviously a better convenience for patients.That's exactly what we're trying to do here: have the drug last longer so it doesn't have to be given as frequently.IBD: So is it necessarily combined with another drug, or does it do anything by itself?Torley: PEGPH20 has some modest anti-cancer effect. But for the type of effects that we believe are important for patients, it needs to be used with another therapy.I'll give an example of the data we just presented in late May, a study of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. These are patients who generally have a life expectancy of about six months after they're diagnosed.We are looking at PEGPH20 in addition to one of the current best-available therapies, which is a combination of Abraxane, Celgene's (CELG) drug, and gemcitabine, which is a generic drug. What we did was look at PEGPH20 on top of Abraxane and gemcitabine vs. Abraxane and gemcitabine alone.The theory as to why PEGPH20 is working is that for patients who are at a high level of this sugar hyaluronan in and around their tumor, it acts as a barrier to the cancer therapies' ability to get to the tumor where they need to work. And it does that by binding water molecules, creating high pressure in and around the tumor that compresses the blood vessels, so that when you get an injection of Abraxane, for example, the theory is the Abraxane cannot get into the tumor where it needs to work because there's low blood flow in the tumor.We administer our PEG0H20, it breaks down the hyaluronan, opens up the blood vessels, opens up the blood flow. And so if after you give PEGPH20 you give Abraxane and gemcitabine, there's a much higher concentration of the chemotherapies that get into the tumor where they need to work.Early data from our phase two study (showed) patients who received PEGPH20 before they got the gemcitabine and Abraxane had a doubling of their progression-free survival (and) a doubling of their response rate, and we saw an interesting early trend toward an improvement in survival — in the patients who had high levels of hyaluronan. (We) estimate that about 40% to 60% of pancreatic-cancer patients have high levels of this sugar.Today with Abraxane and gemcitabine, which is one of the best standards of care, the median survival is just about eight months. What we're hoping to do for these patients of high levels of hyaluronan is to get a good improvement over and above that.Connect with Amy Reeves: @IBD_Areeves and Facebook.

640,JNJ,"IBM's financials continue to show a company deep in transition, with first-quarter earnings beating expectations and revenue falling but meeting views. Big Blue also maintained its outlook for 2015.IBM (IBM) late Monday reported earnings per share minus items of $2.91, up 8.6% from the year-earlier period and well above the analyst consensus estimate of $2.80 as profit margins improved and expenses fell. The news reversed two straight quarters of EPS declines.Revenue from continuing operations fell 12% to $19.6 billion. Adjusting for the impact of currency exchange rates and excluding the businesses that the firm is divesting, growth was flat with a year ago, IBM said.It was the 12th quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue declines. The company has been shedding hardware units and realigning its workforce to cut costs as it focuses on growth areas that include cloud computing, Big Data analytics, mobile computing, security and social networking. The company also has been hit by currency exchange woes, as IBM derives a majority of its revenue from offshore markets.""Our results reflect the transformation in our business and the continued momentum from our imperatives,"" IBM CFO Martin Schroeter said in a conference call with analysts. ""We view this as another proof point our strategy is right, that our actions to reinvent and innovate our hardware and software business is starting to pay off.""IBM expects full-year earnings per share of $15.75 to $16.50, minus items. Analyst consensus is $15.85, below the midpoint.IBM stock was up a fraction in after-hours trading Monday after the company released results and after rising 3.4% in the regular session to a six-month high above 166.""Our strategic imperatives growth rate accelerated, demonstrating the power of our offerings in these new opportunities and contributing to improved revenue performance,"" CEO Ginni Rometty said in IBM's earnings release.Revenue from the firm's Software segment fell 8% to $5.2 billion (down 2%, adjusted for currency) from the year-earlier period.Revenue from its Systems Hardware business plunged 23% to $1.7 billion, but IBM said that it rose 30% when adjusted for currency and the impact of the System X sale. IBM completed the $2.1 billion sale of its x86 low-end server business to China's Lenovo Group in October. IBM also is in the process of turning over its semiconductor operations to GlobalFoundries.Global Services revenue fell 12% (2% when adjusted for currency and divested businesses) to $12.2 billion.""IBM is back to being a software and services company, with software a swing factor this year,"" wrote UBS analyst Steven Milunovich in a research report last week. ""We are not in the ultrabearish camp, but it seems early in the transformation to forecast much recovery, with currency and emerging markets still dragging.""IBM has announced several partnerships as part of its transition into cloud computing. In one, IBM has teamed with Twitter (TWTR) to integrate Twitter data with IBM analytics services in the cloud.Last week, IBM unveiled a new Watson Health business unit with several big-name partners and announced two small acquisitions as it expands the health care uses for its artificial intelligence computer. IBM said that it would work with Apple (AAPL) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) to ""help optimize consumer and medical devices for data collection, analysis and feedback.""Big Blue has also said it will plow $3 billion over the next four years into its Internet of Things unit.

"
690,JNJ,"Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.Medical giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) beat Wall Street's Q2 estimates and lifted its guidance Tuesday, but the stock was off a fraction in early trading as revenue declined.Earnings excluding special items shrank 4% from the year-earlier quarter to $1.71 a share, beating analysts' consensus by 4 cents, according to Thomson Reuters. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, profit rose 6.7%.Revenue fell 8.8% to $17.8 billion, in line with consensus. Excluding the FX impact, sales fell 1%.J&J lifted its full-year guidance to $6.10-$6.20 a share from its previous $6.04-$6.19.The sales decline came from a mixture of divestitures and the hepatitis C drug Olysio, whose sales have shrunk dramatically since competing products from Gilead Sciences (GILD) and AbbVie (ABBV) came out late last year. J&J said that excluding those two factors along with FX, sales rose 5%.""In our view, this bodes well for J&J's ability in the near-to-medium term to weather this significant headwind as Olysio — which represents 4% of total sales and contributed over $1 billion in operating margin, net of incremental investments, in 2014, based on our estimates — is likely to face meaningful sales declines in the coming quarters,"" wrote Leerink analyst Danielle Antalffy in a research note. ""Still-strong performances from other key drugs — notably Xarelto, Imbruvica and Invokana, to name a few — are clearly helping to offset at least in part this major headwind.""Imbruvica, a new blood-cancer drug, is marketed by J&J in a profit-sharing deal with Pharmacyclics, which AbbVie acquired in May. Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum calculated that J&J's take of $89 million from the drug in Q2 means a total of $238 million for AbbVie (which hasn't reported its Q2 yet).""This number appears roughly in line with what IMS (IMS) prescriptions appear to be tracking for the 2Q as well as current consensus (caveat that we don't have a clear consensus for 2Q due to AbbVie/Pharmacyclics transaction),"" Schoenebaum wrote in an email to clients.AbbVie stock was up more than 1% in early trading on the stock market today.On the other hand, RBC Capital Markets analyst Glenn Novarro noted that the device business missed expectations, continuing a trend from the past several quarters. He deduced that the company is losing market share in the spinal business to upstarts such as Globus Medical (GMED) and share of the atrial-fibrillation market to Medtronic (MDT) and St. Jude Medical (STJ).On the other hand, J&J seemed to be taking share from Medtronic in surgical products.Medtronic stock was up 1% in early trading Tuesday, while St. Jude stock was up a fraction.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

691,JNJ,"The world looked a bit flat from a market standpoint early Tuesday, with global markets and commodities largely unmoved and stock futures steering the U.S. market toward a mixed open.Dow futures were down 65.4 points, with IBM (IBM) pulling hard to the downside. S&P 500 futures were off a fraction. Nasdaq 100 futures were up 5.4 points.The focal point of the stock market today. Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo (YHOO) and Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) also report after the close, as do a number of leading stocks, including Blackhawk Network (HAWK), Illumina (ILMN) and GoPro (GPRO).The economic calendar is blank Tuesday, but big names in motion after early earnings reports included Verizon (VZ) (down 2%), Travelers (TRV) (up 2%), Lockheed Martin (LMT) (unchanged) and United Technologies (UTX) (down 4%).IBM dragged 5% lower after reporting its Q2 earnings beat but revenue fell slightly more than analysts had expected. It was the tech giant's 13th straight quarter of declining revenue, and profit margins in its software division — the source of about half the company's profit — narrowed during the quarter. IBM shares have been in a gradual uptrend since January, fighting to climb out of a 10-month consolidation.Tesla Motors (TSLA) slumped nearly 4% ahead of the open. The stock may have been nicked by a UBS downgrade to sell, in a note that reportedly questioned the company's battery storage and auto delivery targets. Shares rose almost 3% in strong trade Monday. The stock is extended after a rebound from 10-week support and above a 258.85 cup-with-handle buy point.India-based software engineer Infosys (INFY) surged 12%. The country's second largest software developer reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings and raised its full-year revenue guidance above consensus expectations.Management said the company signed six contracts during the quarter with a total value of $688 million. Infosys has been consolidating sine February and battling to retake its 10-week line of support for the past five weeks.The dollar was mixed and commodities were generally flat. Mining stocks, which had dragged hard on the S&P 500 on Monday, were rebounding, with Agnico Eagle (AEM), Barrick Gold (ABX), Yamana Gold (AUY) and Newmont Mining (NEM) posting solid premarket gains.

707,JNJ,"Five drug companies including NewLink Genetics (NLNK), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Intrexon (XON) reported quarterly results after the close on Monday, but some investors seemed to be more focused on the companies' development updates than their actual earnings.Depomed MissesDepomed (DEPO) widened its loss to an adjusted 13 cents a share from last year's 1-cent loss. Analysts were expecting earnings of a penny. Revenue fell 58% to $32.2 million, short of estimates for $33.8 million.Shares of the neurology pharmaceutical firm dived 9.8% after closing the regular session up 2.6% to 24.41.Depomed said it completed its $1.05 billion acquisition of U.S. rights to the Nucynta pain relief franchise from Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Janssen Pharmaceuticals unit on April 2, and began fulfilling and shipping orders on April 6.

711,JNJ,"Stocks on Monday failed to hold onto the early gains — as worries over the macro data, dollar strength and earnings once again weighed on traders' minds. All of the averages pulled back to end the day in negative territory. In my opinion — the action was more about profit taking after the move higher late last week and yesterday morning - all ahead of what could be more volatility and weakness in the days ahead. Will reports play on the strong dollar as a reason for the weakened earnings? Will they blame the consumer? Will it be global economic weakness? I mean estimates have already been slashed for all of these reasons — so will it just be more of the same?
"
712,JNJ,"Today brings us JPMorgan Chase (JPM) & Wells Fargo (WFC) — later in the week they will be joined by Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) …. in what will the 1st qtr look like for the financials.

With credit tight once again — will it bring the country to a grinding halt? Look — lending can be a risky business and with the global economy still struggling, along with the exposure created by the collapsing oil mkt, coupled with the threat of rising US interest rates — the future is anything but clear. But remember — investment bankers are keen to play with the numbers - they are well known for redefining common accounting practices...but hey.....it works for them and the regulators don't seem to mind.....……so what rabbit will they pull out of the hat? I do not expect them to 'miss the numbers' JPM announces early - and earnings are expected to +8% at $1.39/sh on revenues of $24.4 bil or a 2% increase yoy, WFC on the other hand is due to report a bit weaker numbers... 98 cents/sh - a 7% decline on revenues of $21.2 bil.

"
731,JNJ,"This morning global investors are waking up to the headlines:
"
732,JNJ,"""Tsipras Capitulates to Creditor's Demands to Keep Greece in the Euro""
"
733,JNJ,"""Greece and Eurozone Thrash out Rescue Deal""
"
734,JNJ,"""Agreekment! Overnight Talks Result in Aid-for-Reform Deal""
"
735,JNJ,"This is like a sequel to the 1994 comedy - ""Dumb and Dumber"" Only this one stars Alexis Tsipras and the whole Greek Parliament...I mean have you ever seen anything so breathtakingly stupid? Alexis Tsipras was elected on the platform of ""Screw the European Union"" - Remember - he was the one that claimed that he would not accept one more ounce of austerity, or cuts, or tax increases (not that anyone in Greece pays taxes - so what difference does that make?)
"
736,JNJ,"Following months of ranting and raving against Germany and the Troika (IMF, ECB and EU) - He rejected plan after plan then forced a referendum vote in his country, campaigned for his citizens to vote 'NO' - and when they 'overwhelmingly agreed' that last week's deal was a bad one - he then sold them down the river! He made such a dramatic reversal that it's almost laughable.....and to make it more ridiculous - the latest 'final offer' is far worse than ones he had turned down! We now have a new word that is sure to light up the Twitter sphere - ""Gridiot"".
"
737,JNJ,"Paul Krugman - an American Economist and Professor of Economic and Int'l Affairs at Princeton University - summed it up this way:
"
738,JNJ,"""This goes beyond harsh into pure vindictiveness, complete destruction of national sovereignty, and no hope of relief. It is, presumably, meant to be an offer Greece can't accept; but even so, it's a grotesque betrayal of everything the European project was supposed to stand for.""
"
739,JNJ,"Global markets, now all relieved (at least for today), have moved into positive territory. Beginning in Asia - markets there sensing relief on the Greek front caused investors and traders to review recent market action. Add in some positive economic data across the region and it was Risk On. China - which has been the focus of late - reported trade figures showing that exports rose 2.8%, substantially beating the expectation of +0.2%.....on a side note - Gov't officials tried to temper the mood saying that 'exports are likely to face relatively big pressure in the coming months'. (Because - How long can they keep up this façade?)
"
740,JNJ,"China ended the day up 2.4% extending Friday's gain of better than 6%. Clearly the market has been boosted by the recent 'reforms' instituted by Beijing….Brokerages were told in 'no uncertain terms' on Sunday to use real names and national identification numbers on all trades - Imagine that - no more imaginary brokerage accounts! Who would have thought of using real names? Over the weekend - Xinhua - the state owned news outlet - reported that some brokerage houses were 'suspected of manipulating futures prices and other malicious practices. Like I said last week - China is not a free market and while the measures recently imposed have caused the markets to rally - what happens once they are removed? Are foreign investors really feeling any better? Not so much….
"
741,JNJ,"In Japan - money poured into the Yen - as the safe haven trade. Equities also moved higher as investors got the 'all clear' sign on a Greek deal while the GPIF (Gov't Pension Investment Fund) released performance figures showing a 12% return in the 12 months ended March 31st. Shoji Hirakawa, Chief equity strategist at Oksan Securities, did say that the fund looks like they still have another 4 or 5 trillion Yen left to put to work in the Japanese stock market - Ah…Hello??? 5 Trillion more Yen going into stocks....Anyone want to stand in front of that train?
"
742,JNJ,"In Europe this morning - as you can imagine - markets there are on a tear….FTSE + 0.61%, CAC 40 + 1.78%, DAX +1.32%, EUROSTOXX +1.64%, SPAIN +1.25% and ITALY +1.26%. Good for today - but if Tsipras can't deliver - then expect it to all fall apart mid-week. Even if he does deliver - and that is a big ""IF"" - will he be able to hold onto his position as PM? Relief- sure.....Greece now has 72 hours to vote in the reforms. There is already trouble brewing in Parliament - you can imagine the rage among those that supported Tsipras in his efforts and now feel like he turned his back on them.
"
743,JNJ,"German Chancellor Merkel had this to say: ""Trust has to be rebuilt, the Greek authorities have to take on responsibility for what they agreed to, It now hinges on step-by-step implementation of what we agreed.""
"
744,JNJ,"And that agreement is for more spending cuts, pension cuts, and tax increases - everything that the country voted against.....Are you beginning to see the Dumb and Dumber reference?
"
745,JNJ,"U.S. futures are soaring - currently up 14 points - at this rate we will be banging our heads on S&P 500 2100 before lunch. There are no economic reports for today but later in the week we get a slew of data points - Retail Sales, PPI, Empire State Manufacturing, Industrial Prod, and Capacity Utilization......
"
746,JNJ,"We are now well into earnings season...Tomorrow starts the beauty pageant....JPMorgan (JPM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Wells Fargo (WFC) - later in the week - we get US Bancorp (USB), Bank of America (BAC), CSX (CSX), Yum Brands (YUM) to name just a few.....The focus now will turn to the earnings and future guidance.....The Greek-think is a bit exhausting....but will remain simmering on the back burner.
"
747,JNJ,"Look for the S&P 500 to test both the 100 and 50 DMA's (2095 & 2099). Those will be tough resistance points for the market to breach....that is where the economic data and earnings will play their part....Investors want to know if we are finally really making headway - Any perceived failure will cause markets to find support once again at 2056....
"
748,JNJ,"This week also features an annual event - Semicon West (July 14-15th) - a 'must see' event - a two-day innovation conference at the Moscone Center in San Francisco - featuring startups/investor and research forums.... Look for presentations from some of the big boys - IntelINTC, OracleORCL, IBMIBM, Texas InstrumentsTXN, San DiskSNDK along with some new and exciting startups - The market is sure to be getting all kinds of positive data and presentations coming out of this conference so expect positive market action in the publicly-traded names.

802,JNJ,"With two blockbuster hepatitis C drugs powering sales and profits, Gilead Sciences has become one of the drug industry's hit stocks. Gilead (GILD) stock has soared nearly 150% over the last two years, 19% since a new run-up began May 8. At $178 billion, Gilead's market capitalization is now higher than drug giant Merck's  (MRK), even though its revenue…
"
803,JNJ,"Tuesday's announcement that Celgene (CELG) agreed to acquire Receptos (RCPT) pleased investors in those two stocks, but for investors in Gilead Sciences (GILD), which was rumored to be interested in Receptos, it means waiting on the edges of their seats.""Literally the only question I'm getting on Gilead is, 'When and who are they going to buy?'"" said Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum Monday in a video recorded for clients. ""The stock has moved because of broker meetings a month or two ago where they said, 'We're ready to do a deal.'""It's a crucial question for Gilead's future, because signs are that its blockbuster hepatitis C franchise is already hitting the ceiling in the U.S. after a record launch 18 months ago. However, that launch did give Gilead an enormous pile of cash to buy its next major drug line, which has set Wall Street's collective imagination into overdrive about what the target could be.Here are some of the most prominent suggestions that have come out in the last few months: Incyte (INCY): This was suggested on Tuesday by Nomura analyst Ian Somaiya in a note mainly about the Celgene-Receptos deal. Incyte's drug Jakafi treats a rare form of bone-marrow cancer as well as a blood disease called polycythemia vera. Gilead recently entered the blood-cancer market with Zydelig, which launched just shy of a year ago for chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two kinds of lymphoma. Somaiya noted that Incyte also has a promising pipeline that includes drugs for solid tumors.Incyte's 12-month revenue totaled $581 million, mostly from Jakafi, but the company has had inconsistent quarters on the bottom line. Analysts expect it to record its first annual profit next year, however, and grow rapidly after that. The stock has reflected these bullish expectations, with a Relative Strength Rating of 98 and an accumulation/distribution grade of B+. Incyte stock hit a new high of 121.70 early on the stock market today before retreating back near yesterday's close. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX): Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges caused a minor commotion when he endorsed this combination back in April. Vertex, whose own hepatitis C blockbuster was stomped out of existence by Gilead, is positioning itself as the dominant player in cystic fibrosis, as it's the only company that's proven to have a disease-altering treatment for the devastating condition. Porges pointed out that Gilead already sells a product to this market called Cayston, so it has its foot in the door.Gilead ""needs the promise or high probability of an incremental $5 billion to $7 billion of revenue to reassure investors about their future outlook,"" Porges wrote at the time, and in fact $5 billion a year is what many predict Vertex's CF drugs are going to do eventually. However, some other analysts doubted whether such a deal would happen, on the grounds that Vertex is expensive (market cap is hovering near $33 billion, and Porges' suggested price was $45 billion) and Gilead prefers to buy development-stage assets that it can then launch itself.Vertex's stock has been in a flat base since Porges floated his idea. Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN): Buying Achillion would be going in the opposite direction in terms of size, as Achillion is a startup whose market cap is just over $1 billion. However, it has been the subject of speculation, given that it has a promising hepatitis C drug candidate of its own, which could potentially help Gilead extend its franchise through the coming next generation of treatments.In November, after Achillion's candidate ACH-3102 yielded excellent six-week results in a clinical trial when combined with Gilead's Sovaldi, FBR Capital analyst Andrew Berens argued that buying Achillion could get Gilead onto ""(the) expected trend in HCV intervention towards shortened treatment durations from the currently available eight-week and 12-week courses."" Then in May, a Twitter-storm of speculation erupted when Achillion abruptly pulled out of an investor conference, suggesting that it was about to announce something big. As it turned out, it was: Achillion had actually signed a licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which diminished the chances of a Gilead buyout. Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY): What, a biotech buying a big pharma? Well, actually Gilead is bigger than Bristol now — it did almost $25 billion in sales last year, vs. Bristol's $16 billion — and Bristol's hottest new drugs are biologics, like its cancer drug Opdivo. Which was what TheStreet.com's Adam Feuerstein was thinking when he proposed the idea back in January: ""I'm not sure exactly which company Gilead will buy, but the acquisition focus will be oncology, and it will be transformative, just as Pharmasset was for its hepatitis C business.""The potential is certainly vast, given that Opdivo alone is expected to pass $6.5 billion in annual sales by 2020. However, the price would be even more staggering than Vertex's, and Bristol's market value has continued to go up since Feuerstein's prediction; it's now over $115 billion. The stock hit a new 14-year high of 70.42 Wednesday before closing down more than 1%.Follow Amy Reeves on Twitter: @IBD_Areeves.

812,JNJ,"Big-cap biotech Biogen Idec said that it's moving its drug candidate for Alzheimer's disease into late-stage testing after early results that offered some patients hope for treatment and sent Biogen stock up 6.4% to 328.27.
"
813,JNJ,"At Tuesday's BioFEST conference in Boston, Biogen (BIIB) research and development head Douglas Williams said that an interim analysis of a 194-patient phase one trial for BIIB-037, which it is jointly developing with Japan's Eisai drug firm, was good enough to push it straight into phase three. The numbers won't be formally reported until the spring, but Williams said that a statistically significant improvement in cognition appeared after 54 weeks of treatment.
"
814,JNJ,"Aggressively Preparing
"
815,JNJ,"""The study's not done yet — there are still patients where we're doing some additional dose exploration,"" said Williams. ""But ... we're actually planning very aggressively to start the phase three program, based on what we've seen so far.""

Beta amyloid is a toxic form of the normally benign protein amyloid, which attacks neurons in Alzheimer's sufferers.

837,JNJ,"Top-rated biotech Medivation (MDVN) reported another round of successful trial results for its prostate-cancer drug Xtandi Thursday, giving the stock a brief bump in early trading.Medivation and its partner Astellas said that a midstage trial comparing Xtandi head-to-head with bicalutamide, better known as AstraZeneca's (AZN) Casodex, showed a considerable survival benefit for the former in castration-resistant prostate cancer. The median progression-free survival for the group taking Xtandi was 19.4 months, compared with 5.7 months for the bicalutamide group. The rate of serious adverse events was about the same.Xtandi is approved only for metastatic prostate cancer, but the study included both metastatic and non-metastatic patients who had been castrated or hormonally treated but who hadn't received chemotherapy. RBC Capital Markets analyst Simos Simeonidis wrote that this should help bring Xtandi to earlier-stage patients.""We believe these data will help the drug get additional penetration in the pre-chemo(therapy) setting, where we believe it will have the upper hand over (Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Zytiga, mainly due to convenience,"" Simeonidis wrote in a research note. ""However, we believe that significant adoption in the earlier stages of the disease will require Phase III data, which will take many years to read out.""Xtandi's strong ramp since its 2012 launch has turned Medivation into a top-performing biotech, with an IBD Composite Rating of 98 and a near-big-cap valuation of $9.81 billion.Medivation stock jumped 3% out of the gate on the stock market today to above 129, but in early trading was up less than 1%, near 126.

872,JNJ,"When the FDA last month approved the first biosimilar drug, the U.S. took its first step into a lucrative but potentially disruptive field of medicine.Pfizer (PFE), which is moving big into biosimilars with its $17 billion Hospira (HSP) acquisition, has estimated that global biosimilar sales could hit $17 billion to $20 billion per year by 2020. Sales are just $1 billion yearly now, mainly in the European Union.With the March 5 approval of Zarxio, Novartis' (NVS) biosimilar version of Amgen's (AMGN) aging blockbuster Neupogen, the U.S. market cracked open.""As the FDA becomes more comfortable ... we're going to see biosimilars get through a lot more easily,"" predicted Jitendra Malik, an attorney with Alston & Bird who specializes in intellectual-property and drug-approval issues. ""The first one's always the hardest to get through, because the FDA is more cautious — it's uncharted territory.""For years, the biotech revolution not only brought life-saving new medicines, but also profit-saving protections against competitors. While traditional pharmaceuticals can be assembled by machines from different chemical ingredients, biologic drugs are formed by biological processes, like a high-tech version of fermentation. Many of these processes are trade secrets that, unlike patents, have no expiration date.Reverse EngineeringAs more companies became familiar with biotech manufacturing, however, they were able to reverse-engineer the process to create biosimilar drugs — not identical to the originals, but close enough. Novartis' Sandoz unit, historically devoted to traditional generic drugs, has been a pioneer in the field, already selling biosimilar versions of Neupogen and its sister drug Epogen in Europe.Many others are lined up at the U.S. border with their own products. Hospira and Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) have launched their own versions of Neupogen in Europe. Some companies are working on biosimilar versions of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster immunology drug Humira, including Sandoz, Hospira, Pfizer (prior to acquiring Hospira), Amgen and German pharma giant Boehringer Ingelheim.When AbbVie announced its richly priced acquisition of Pharmacyclics (PCYC) in March, some analysts figured it was driven by the need for another blockbuster in the face of Humira competitors.Key Biologics Face RivalsOther drugs with biosimilar versions in late-stage testing include Biogen's (BIIB) cancer drug Rituxan, Roche's (RHHBY) breast-cancer treatment Herceptin, and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade. And Merck (MRK) is developing a biosimilar version of Sanofi's (SNY) popular diabetes drug Lantus.Hospira's biosimilar version of Remicade already has been approved in Europe and was expected to be OK'd in the U.S. in Q1. But in February, the FDA delayed its advisory-panel meeting on the product ""due to information requests pending with the sponsor of the application.""Analysts are closely watching the biosimilar's rollout in Europe. Remicade is approved for a variety of ailments, from psoriasis to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to rheumatoid arthritis, and will provide a test case for how willing the different specialists are to use the knockoff without independent studies.""B(iosimilar)-Remicade was approved without gastroenterology studies, which account for 50% of Remicade sales,"" wrote Leerink analyst Jason Gerberry in a December research report. ""Some gastroenterology specialists we've spoken with do not plan to use b-Remicade for IBD indications until clinical studies report out in late 2015 or 2016.""In Europe, biosimilar versions of Neupogen have taken about 30% of the market. Analysts generally expect the same for the U.S., but much depends on where the drugs are priced.Generic pharmaceuticals generally go for a fraction of the original drug's price, driving the retail value down so much that the original developers stop marketing the products (though they do keep manufacturing them). Biosimilars are more difficult and expensive to develop, so there are fewer players and less pricing competition.Novartis still hasn't launched Zarxio and is keeping mum about its price. Company spokeswoman Geena Wardaki told Investor's Business Daily in an email, ""For biosimilars in general, we typically expect discounts to be in the range of 10% to 30% below the reference biologic. However, this depends on therapeutic area, market, channel, number of competitors and reimbursement situation.""CMS Vs. FDA On BiosimilarsOn Tuesday, the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that physicians prescribing Medicare Part B drugs would be reimbursed for biosimilars in the same way as for the original drugs — average selling price plus 6%. Pharmacies dispensing part D drugs can exclude the original from their lists of preferred drugs in favor of the biosimilar if they wish, so long as they provide a transitional supply of the original for patients already taking it.That implies that CMS is treating biosimilars as effectively interchangeable with the originals, further muddying an issue that's already unclear. The FDA ruled that although Zarxio can be used for all five of the uses approved for Neupogen — boosting blood cells in various kinds of cancer patients — it's not technically interchangeable. That means that if a doctor prescribes the original drug, a pharmacy can't fill it with the biosimilar.That doesn't matter so much for Zarxio, since the drug is administered via hospitals and clinics rather than retail pharmacies. Nonetheless, some drugmakers might find it worthwhile to file separately for an interchangeability approval, which will likely involve studies of patients switching between products, say experts in the matter.""That would be a deterrent to a second person coming in,"" said Malik. ""If I can show that my product is interchangeable, that doesn't necessarily mean that another applicant down the road can do the same thing just by piggybacking on me. In a lot of cases, the structure (of the original drug) is not perfectly known, and you do have to spend time convincing people that it's the same.""Yet another question is how aggressive the payers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will be in pushing biosimilars ahead of the original drugs to save costs. In a March 29 report, analyst Gerberry wrote that two unnamed ""payer specialists"" had told him that payers will probably leave a grace period of six to 12 months for doctors to get used to biosimilars, but then start to lean harder.""Specialists expect policies to grandfather stable patients receiving anti-TNF therapy (e.g., Remicade) at same reimbursement, but new patients or new switches would likely be required to go through a prior authorization requiring patients use biosimilar first,"" he wrote.Gillian Woollett, senior vice president at the consulting firm Avalere Health, says another issue is naming. When a company develops a new drug, it gets a generic (also called nonproprietary) name and a brand name, and the generic name (filgrastim, in the case of Neupogen) is used by all generic drugmakers when the patents expire.What's In A Name?Many biologics approved by the FDA, even when they have never been compared, also share nonproprietary names because this is simply the name of the active ingredient and not the name of the product. Biosimilars in most other markets share the nonproprietary name of their reference product too, but in the U.S., with the first approval, the FDA assigned makers a ""placeholder nonproprietary name,"" in this case filgrastim-sndz.""The naming thing is an important space to watch,"" Woollett told Investor's Business Daily. ""I think these are all going to be branded products, and all biosimilars, like most originator biologics, will have brand names — again, the generic-drug situation is totally different, as most generics do not have brand names.""

873,JNJ,"Big pharma AbbVie's $21 billion deal to acquire hot biotech Pharmacyclics was met with widespread skepticism by AbbVie investors Thursday, sending AbbVie's stock falling 5.7% Thursday.AbbVie (ABBV) announced the cash-and-stock acquisition late Wednesday after rumors had been swirling all afternoon that Novartis (NVS) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) were engaged in a bidding war for Pharmacyclics (PCYC). It surprised Wall Street that AbbVie turned out to be the buyer, especially since J&J already has a partnership with Pharmacyclics to market its blood-cancer drug Imbruvica.""What doesn't really make sense to us is AbbVie prevailing over PCYC's partner and natural buyer, JNJ, to secure PCYC, and paying the price that they did for the asset,"" Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a research note Thursday. ""We believed that JNJ was the only buyer able to secure the operational advantage of full control by buying out their partner, and JNJ, more than any other buyer, would have been able to maximize the synergies by reducing the product's support to a single commercial organization.""The cash-and-stock deal values Pharmacyclics at 261 a share. Its stock rose 10% Thursday to 254.22. The stock traded at 122 at the start of the year.In a conference call with analysts early Thursday, AbbVie CEO Richard Gonzalez affirmed that the bidding war had come down to three contestants, which he didn't name. He justified the price by citing the enormous market potential for Imbruvica, which launched in late 2013 and brought Pharmacyclics $548 million last year. By AbbVie's reckoning, Imbruvica will bring the firm $7 billion a year at peak — and that's with no change to the existing deal that splits the profits with J&J.Evercore ISI says this assumes total worldwide sales of $11.5 billion to $12 billion, which would make Imbruvica the biggest-selling cancer drug in history, says analyst Mark Schoenebaum. Analysts' consensus sales estimates are bullish but not that bullish: For 2025, the latest year available, the average estimate is $8.3 billion.On the call, Gonzalez broke down the assumptions behind that number. About 25% of the growth would come from expansion in Imbruvica's currently approved uses, as a second-line treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and mantle-cell lymphoma, as well as an anytime treatment for the less common conditions of CLL with 17p deletion and Waldenstrom's macroglobulemia.An additional 30% would come from expansion into first-line treatment for CLL and lymphoma, which Gonzalez says has a ""very high probability of success,"" given the clinical-trial data.The rest would come from unspecified amounts accounting for approval in other cancers of the B cells, and a more speculative assumption that the product will also work on solid tumors.""We did see the data on solid tumors, and we were impressed,"" Gonzalez said.Many analysts viewed AbbVie's late-stage blood-cancer candidate ABT-199 as a potential competitor to Imbruvica. Chief Scientific Officer Michael Severino said the two drugs can potentially work in combination, and he expects to launch clinical trials to prove it.In general, executives said the acquisition should boost AbbVie's entire cancer business by as much as $15 billion or $20 billion by the 2020s. That would be a change of focus for AbbVie, which made its fortune in immunology with the blockbuster drug Humira. However, Humira will likely get biosimilar competition from Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE) and others after its patent expires in 2018. On the call, Gonzalez affirmed AbbVie's commitment to Humira, both by defending its patents in court and by developing new-and-improved versions of the drug, and said this had nothing to do with the price paid for Pharmacyclics.Analyst Porges, however, said that ""the premium here may be explained by AbbVie's desperation.""

907,JNJ,"With interest rates at record lows in the past several years, ETFs that invest in dividend-paying stocks have been a popular income alternative for some investors. But will they remain advantageous now that the Federal Reserve is seriously considering hiking rates?It depends on the specific investment objectives of each fund, according to Michael Rawson, research analyst at Morningstar Inc.""When you look at stocks with a high dividend payout, they typically underperform when the economy is doing well,"" he says. ""Those companies usually invest less in future growth (utilities, REITs, consumer staples), therefore they don't participate as much when the economy is growing very rapidly.""Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VYM) has over $10 billion in assets and a 12-month yield (net of fees) of 2.72%. However, it is tilted toward value stocks, notes Rawson, so it is not the most favorable to be in when the economy is growing.So what should an investor look at when considering a dividend ETF?Value Stock Tilt?Rawson says it's important to consider whether an ETF ""is tilting toward higher-yielding dividend-paying stocks, which tend to be value stocks, or does it tilt toward stocks which might grow their dividend in the future?""Companies that are able to increase their dividends consistently are usually companies with very strong brand names or very strong market positions,"" he notes. An example is Apple (AAPL), which yields 1.5%, though its dividend hasn't been steady.Dividend growth is one of the reasons he likes $21 billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG). It looks for companies that have raised their dividends for 10 straight years. It has a lower yield at 1.91%, but focuses on quality stocks, thus having a slightly bigger exposure to growth companies.In addition, it has a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.10%. It has returned an average annual 14.15% in the past three years vs. the S&P 500's 16.57% advance. Top holdings are Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""If the Fed were likely to raise rates, I think Vanguard High Dividend Yield might get hurt more than Vanguard Dividend Appreciation,"" Rawson said.Another element to consider is the fund's tilt toward size: whether it's in large-cap or small-cap stocks.IShares Select Dividend (DVY) is one of the highest-yielding ETFs with a 3.03% yield. But the $15 billion fund is tilted toward midcap deep-value stocks, which can make it more volatile. In addition, its 0.39% expense ratio makes it one of the more expensive dividend ETFs, notes Morningstar analyst Abby Woodham in her report.When the Fed raises rates, investors might consider shifting out of stocks and more toward bonds, said Rawson. The reasons people usually hold bonds is for income, diversification and stability. The reason why dividend ETFs are not always a good substitute for bond ETFs is that they don't have the stability of bonds, he said.Investors also need to be mindful of expenses. If those are high, they tend to eat into the yield of the ETF.Cheapest ETF AvailableSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is the cheapest among all dividend ETFs, with an expense ratio of just 0.07%. With nearly $3 billion in assets, it has a pretty attractive yield of 2.58%, while still maintaining the focus on quality stocks.It looks at companies that have paid dividends in the past 10 years and selects those that do well on fundamental metrics such cash flow/debt, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. It's returned an average annual 15.93% in the past three years. Top holdings are Pfizer (PFE), Verizon Communications (VZ), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).International funds tend to provide higher yields, but investors need to be able to stomach higher volatility due to currency fluctuations. The dollar's recent strength has hit the returns of nonhedged ETFs such as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DEM) and iShares International Select Dividend (IDV).

914,JNJ,"Some investors building equity income portfolios seek out ETFs holding big dividend payers. Others focus on exchange traded funds that consistently grow dividends. But what's more important than high yields or dividend growth?A stable income stream, says a leading ETF expert.""After all, investors looking to these funds as a source of cash flow would be disappointed to find that their income stream is volatile,"" said Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar.Johnson recently studied 11 dividend ETF strategies that focus on U.S. large caps.Of these, the five that screened stocks for steadily paying or growing dividends also generated stable income vs. their peers. Their ""dividend drawdown"" — the year-on-year decline in annual dividend payment — was relatively muted even in 2009, post-financial crisis.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG), the $20.71 billion bellwether ETF, counts IBM (IBM) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) among its top three holdings. The stocks are classic income plays. J&J earns the most stable possible IBD Dividend Stability Factor: 0. IBM has a DSF of 1. The score shows how stable a firm's dividend history is over a five-year period. A lower number means a more stable history.First Trust Value Line Dividend (FVD), with $1.2 billion in assets, holds furniture maker Leggett & Platt (LEG). The stock has a DSF of 0.PowerShares Dividend Achievers (PFM) has $343.5 million in assets and big stakes in J&J and IBM, as well as Altria Group (MO). The tobacco firm has a DSF of 1.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY), with $13.62 billion in assets, holds Johnson & Johnson, Leggett & Platt and Kimberly-Clark (KMB) among its top 25 holdings. The Huggies maker has a DSF of 1.The 12-month yield of these four ETFs ranges from 1.95% for PFM to 2.25% for SDY. But when comparing dividend funds, investors who look at yield in isolation may be running a risk.Yield can be volatile over time. WisdomTree Equity Income (DHS) yielded roughly 10.3% in February 2008. It yields 2.9% today.""Some ETPs (exchange traded products) are clearly taking on more risk than others when they go about building an income-oriented portfolio,"" Johnson said.For less volatile yields, he said, ""It's important to look for funds that track benchmarks which incorporate some sort of (dividend) sustainability screen.""He added: ""Investors should place a premium on income stability, particularly in bear markets .""Dividend Yield Vs. GrowthDividend growth provides a historical context for yields. Investors in ETFs with growing dividends have a better shot at a cash stream that beats the rate of inflation over time.VIG screens for stocks that have increased their dividend for at least 10 consecutive years. It has an 0.1% expense ratio, the lowest among dividend-focused ETFs.SDY looks for stocks that have raised their dividends for the past 20 consecutive years. It has a 0.35% expense ratio, or $35 in fees for every $10,000 invested.VIG was up 1.4% year to date as of Wednesday.

917,JNJ,"Sometimes, drug launches take a while to get off the ground. Incyte's only approved drug, Jakafi, has been on the market three years, but it's really only just getting started.Jakafi, sold in some markets as Jakavi, is approved for a rare bone-marrow cancer called myelofibrosis (MF). Thanks to that indication, Incyte's (INCY) revenue is expected to pass $530 million this year, compared with just $94 million in 2011, the year Jakafi launched.It's the other indications in the pipeline, however, that could really push the drug into blockbuster territory.The first of these, expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by Dec. 5, is for polycythemia vera (PV), a similar but somewhat milder disease, which has a potentially larger market.Meanwhile, clinical trials are going on for the really big-name cancers: pancreatic, breast, lung and colon.Current consensus estimates have Jakafi's annual sales in the U.S. hitting $1.3 billion by 2020. Abroad, where Incyte splits the take with marketing partner Novartis (NVS), sales are expected to pass $900 million by that year.""Incyte is based on the idea that research in cancer is a good investment,"" CEO Herve Hoppenot told IBD in an interview.Opportunity SeizedJakafi is a Janus associated kinase (JAK) inhibitor, regulating the signaling mechanisms in cells that play an important role in cell growth and immune response.Jakafi was the first JAK inhibitor on the market and so far the only one approved to fight cancer. Pfizer's (PFE) Xeljanz, approved in 2012, is also a JAK inhibitor but is used against rheumatoid arthritis.Hoppenot says that Incyte was originally aiming at the big cancers first, but the MF opportunity unexpectedly came up when scientists found that the JAK signaling played an important role in the disease.""At that point, the company decided to move the development program very quickly to myelofibrosis and try to prove that the JAK pathway was having an impact on the outcome for these patients,"" he said. ""We were able to get the pivotal studies done and the approval for myelofibrosis in a very rapid way.""Another advantage that the MF market brought to the firm was a small patient pool that had no other treatment options, so Incyte has been able to market it domestically without bringing in a big-pharma partner. It can thus keep all the domestic revenues for itself.Pursuing PV was the next logical step, Hoppenot says, because the diseases are so similar. Both of them are myeloproliferative disorders, which means that excess cells are produced in the bone marrow.PV, however, is much milder and can sometimes have no symptoms at all. Hoppenot estimates that only about 25% of the roughly 100,000 PV patients in the U.S. are eligible for Jakafi. He expects the liftoff to be fairly slow, because treating PV isn't as urgent as treating more malignant cancers.But the eventual market could be larger than that of MF, which has fewer than 14,000 sufferers, according to Leerink's estimate.These two diseases should bring Incyte its first annual profit next year, according to a consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Incyte turned a profit of 33 cents a share in the most recently reported quarter, but only because of two milestone payments that Incyte collected from Novartis on winning reimbursement for Jakafi in Europe and marketing approval in Japan.Starting in the second half of next year, analysts expect Incyte to start turning an operating profit in a more consistent way.Rivalry In The WingsThe year after that, however, new competition could threaten Jakafi. Gilead Sciences' (GILD) JAK inhibitor momelotinib is in a late-stage trial for MF, designed to compare momelotinib with Jakafi head to head. The results are expected to come out sometime next year.A couple of smaller players, CTI BioPharma (CTIC) and Geron (GERN), also have competitors in late-stage testing. On Nov. 13, the latter licensed its candidate, imetelstat, to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for development in multiple diseases, under a deal potentially worth $935 million if all the milestones are realized.Although only the data will tell how competitive these products will be, Incyte has other tools in its garage.INCB24360, a candidate from another drug class called IDO1 inhibitors, is being tested in combination with some of the most anticipated cancer drugs in the pipeline, the PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. Incyte has partnered with all four of the leading contenders in the field — Bristol-Myers (BMY), AstraZeneca (AZN), Roche (RHHBY), and Merck (MRK) — to test their drugs together for a variety of cancers.These are not licensing deals, says Hoppenot. But they do mean that if and when the drugs are approved, the companies can recommend a successful combination on the drugs' labels.INCB24360 also garnered some attention at this summer's American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, when it performed well in a trial combining it with a different though related Bristol-Myers drug, Yervoy, to treat melanoma.Leerink analyst Michael Schmidt wrote at the time that while the combo didn't appear to be as effective as Yervoy combined with Bristol's in-house anti-PD-1 Opdivo, it did suggest promise for combinations of INCB24360 with other anti-PD-1s.This news, along with a better-than-expected third quarter report last month, induced Goldman Sachs analyst Navdeep Singh to lift his rating on Incyte to neutral from sell and nearly double his price target to 62.""Our sell thesis was based on our more cautious view on Jakafi's launch for myelofibrosis (MF) given safety and competition, but this call has not worked as the narrative has shifted to INCY's pipeline,"" Singh wrote in his Oct. 31 research note. He added that following the newly out Q3 results and ASCO 2014, ""we are more encouraged by: (1) strong underlying growth for Jakafi in MF and (2) early data and partnership interest for IDO1 inhibitor.""

939,JNJ,"IBM introduced Watson to the world on the game show ""Jeopardy"" in 2011, when the highly intelligent computer outsmarted two of the best contestants that game show had ever seen.
"
940,JNJ,"Watson was just a toddler then, but oh how it's grown.
"
941,JNJ,"Rather than compete in trivia games, IBM (IBM) Watson is helping solve complex issues in the field of health care, sifting through complex data to help doctors and institutions find answers to tough questions.
"
942,JNJ,"And that's just a start.
"
943,JNJ,"Watson is engaged with more than 100 universities and 20 industries to advance and develop its humanlike capabilities.
"
944,JNJ,"Watson is helping the oil and gas industry boost production. It's helping create better building materials. It's helping chefs create new recipes. And it's a health coach for consumers and a travel agent.
"
945,JNJ,"If you have a question, Watson has an answer. It might not always be the best answer, but it's surely a step in the right direction. One thing's for sure, says IBM: Watson represents a new era of computing.
"
946,JNJ,"""We are just on the initial cusp of this new era,"" said John Gordon, vice president of the IBM Watson Group. He says the cognitive computing that Watson represents will be bigger than the Internet in terms of how we communicate and process data.
"
947,JNJ,"""Fundamentally, the Internet connected us to information faster than ever before and opened up new opportunities,"" Gordon said. ""Watson is taking on a new challenge, not about how to connect but how to process information in new ways. It will allow for a new era of human innovation.""
"
948,JNJ,"Cognitive computing also goes by names such as artificial intelligence, augmented intelligence and machine learning. Decades of research and development have gone into a technology that's drawn the interest of the tech elite.
"
949,JNJ,"Companies is this field include Google (GOOGL). Last year it paid $400 million to acquire DeepMind, which specializes in machine learning and advanced algorithms. Google has used deep learning to enhance its search results, improve Android's voice recognition and derive more data from images and video.
"
950,JNJ,"Microsoft (MSFT) has also invested heavily in the field, as has Facebook (FB). Microsoft is using machine learning technology to enhance the features and performance in its Office 365 software. Facebook is using artificial intelligence to make its News Feed feature more relevant to users of the social network.
"
951,JNJ,"It's all about diving deeper into the immense power of new computing technologies, using parallel processing and neural networks along with the explosion of Big Data analytics and advancements in computer software.
"
952,JNJ,"Watson processes information more like a human than a computer. It does work that required thousands of computers a decade ago.
"
953,JNJ,"Rather than being programmed to anticipate every answer or action needed to perform tasks, cognitive computing systems are trained using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to sense, predict and infer.
"
954,JNJ,"The system gets more intelligent over time as more information is fed into its memory banks and it has more interactions with users, which aids its imaging and speech recognition.
"
955,JNJ,"""IBM is a leader in this field, a field that allows computers to learn without having to be programmed,"" said David Schubmehl, a research director at market research firm IDC. ""We'll see computer systems that learn over time in the way humans do.""
"
956,JNJ,"Each Watson computer is different, depending on who's working with it and the kinds of information they feed into its memory banks.
"
957,JNJ,"Watson is also available in the cloud. Companies essentially can rent their own personal portion of the Watson platform.
"
958,JNJ,"IBM doesn't sell Watson, based on the company's line of Power Systems computers, though it does provide the computer to business partners.
"
959,JNJ,"IBM derives revenue from the sale of Watson services. It also takes a share of revenue from partners who successfully introduce and market Watson-based apps. IBM says it has hundreds of commercial partners, supported by thousands of developers and entrepreneurs who are developing thousands of apps.
"
960,JNJ,"""We're betting on a share of their success,"" Gordon said, ""and I expect a lot of them to be successful.""
"
961,JNJ,"IBM established the IBM Watson Group in January 2014. IBM is investing $1 billion into the group for research and development that, in collaboration with research institutions and businesses, will help commercialize Watson. IBM also has a $100 million fund to invest in startups and others that want to build a business on top of Watson.
"
962,JNJ,"IBM's investments include San Diego-based Pathway Genomics, which in the past six years has received about $90 million in financing from a variety of investors. Pathway, founded in 2008, provides genetic testing services used by large hospitals and physicians.
"
963,JNJ,"A year ago, Michael Nova, Pathway's chief innovation officer, called the IBM Watson group with an idea. He wanted to know if IBM and Watson could help Pathway develop a fitness and diet tracking app.
"
964,JNJ,"By feeding Pathway's enormous collection of health and medical data into Watson, it will help users with answers to health-related questions. The Pathway app is also expected to connect with wearable health-tracking devices such as Fitbit, pulling in a person's vitals, such as blood pressure, weight and pulse. Users can log in on their smartphone and ask a health question such as ""How much exercise should I do today?"" Or ""What food should I stop eating?"" Nova expects the app to be available in the fourth quarter.
"
965,JNJ,"""Health care is the hardest data problem there is,"" Nova said. ""We needed Watson on board. It's a huge advantage for us to be linked up with them.""
"
966,JNJ,"Among its other investments, IBM was part of a $5 million funding round in WayBlazer, a travel search and discovery company with a goal to redefine how consumers plan, personalize and purchase travel.
"
967,JNJ,"Health care was the first market for Watson, and it's where IBM has spent the most time and money.
"
968,JNJ,"""We started on health intentionally, figuring if there are going to be problems to solve that would be meaningful, it was the right place to start,"" Gordon said. ""The amount of information produced in that field is exploding.""
"
969,JNJ,"In April, IBM unveiled its Watson Health Cloud unit, which it says provides a secure and open platform for physicians, researchers, insurers and other companies focused on health and wellness.
"
970,JNJ,"Its partners include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which will work with IBM to develop ""intelligent virtual coaching solutions"" to help prepare patients for surgery, then deal with its after effects.
"
971,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson will also leverage IBM's relationship with Apple (AAPL) to deliver new iPhone and iPad applications. Apple is working with IBM to integrate Watson-based apps into its HealthKit and ResearchKit tool systems for developers.
"
972,JNJ,"Another partner is medical device giant Medtronic (MDT), which is collaborating with IBM around delivery of personalized care for people with diabetes, analyzing patient info and data from Medtronic devices.
"
973,JNJ,"IBM also has Watson partnerships with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas, the Mayo Clinic and the New York Genome Center.

"
978,JNJ,"Shares of Gilead Sciences (GILD) hit a new high near 113 in the stock market today as the biotech prepared to deliver its Q3 report after the close Tuesday, while an analyst noted that a couple of its potential competitors seemed to be faltering.
"
979,JNJ,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to report earnings of $1.92 a share, up 269% from the year-earlier quarter. Sales were estimated at just under $6 billion, up 115% from last year's third quarter.
"
980,JNJ,"The massive year-over-year increase is due to hepatitis C drug Sovaldi, which launched in December, but analysts expect a decline in sales on a sequential basis as doctors delayed treating patients before this month's launch of Harvoni, Gilead's next-generation HCV pill.
"
981,JNJ,"With Sovaldi fading and Harvoni just launched, there isn't a particular number that analysts are champing at the bit to see Tuesday. ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum wrote in his ""earnings prep pack"" for clients that conference-call questions will probably revolve around the Harvoni launch dynamics, the HCV pipeline, potential acquisitions and the possible impact of the closing of the ""double Irish"" tax loophole, whose effect on Gilead is still unclear.
"
982,JNJ,"Also on Monday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee noted two events that bode well for Gilead's longer-term competitive position.
"
983,JNJ,"One was that Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) drug simeprevir, called Olysio in the U.S. and Sovriad elsewhere, required a label change in Japan after three patients using it died. On J&J's Q3 earnings report, management's comments that the firm planned to stay competitive in HCV even after Harvoni's launch led to a minor panic among Gilead investors, who feared a price war. But Yee wrote that that seems even less likely now.
"
984,JNJ,"""JNJ may soon get an FDA label that allows use of Olysio with GILD's Sovaldi,"" he wrote. ""We don't expect much, if any, use with this combo anymore despite the theoretical positive label update because GILD already has a combo that replaces that regimen and the price of Olysio ($50,000) makes this not feasible in our view.""
"
985,JNJ,"To give an idea of how much the price would have to be cut, a 12-week round of Harvoni costs $10,500 more than a round of Sovaldi alone.
"
986,JNJ,"Yee also wrote that Merck (MRK) was sounding less confident about its own HCV pipeline on its conference call discussing its Q3 earnings on Monday morning. The company confirmed that it will report on its trial of a four-week HCV therapy at the Liver Meeting next month, but ""the commentary was less bullish than previous conference calls suggesting the data would help bookend the various treatment durations that are feasible and that 4 weeks of treatment is not necessarily relevant as long as regimens in general are competitive.""
"
987,JNJ,"Merck, whose earnings modestly beat estimates but whose top line came in a bit light, was down more than 2% by late afternoon Monday.

1016,JNJ,"Big-cap biotech Celgene made its name as a cancer fighter, but now it's branching out into diseases of the immune system. And one of the biggest tests of this new strategy comes this weekend.At the United European Gastroenterology Week in Vienna, which runs Saturday to Oct. 22, Celgene (CELG) is set to present phase-two data on GED-0301, a treatment for Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the GI tract. Celgene licensed the drug in April from privately held Nogra Pharma for an upfront payment of $710 million, with up to $815 million in regulatory and development milestone payments and up to $1.05 billion in sales milestone payments, should the drug launch.The price raised eyebrows on Wall Street. Few had heard of Nogra Pharma, and $710 million was the most that Celgene had ever paid upfront in a licensing deal. And the only information that had been publicly released was from a phase-one trial, which had only 15 subjects and was not placebo-controlled.Celgene, however, said that it already knew the phase-two data and that it was worth the price.""GED-0301 is a potentially transformative therapy that demonstrated striking clinical activity in a phase-two trial for Crohn's disease,"" Scott Smith, Celgene's global head of inflammation and immunology, said in a press release at the time.As the date of GED-0301's release nears, Wall Street's curiosity — and optimism — has been building.According to RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, about 20% to 30% of the combined $17 billion in sales of the world's two leading immunology drugs — AbbVie's (ABBV) Humira and Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) Remicade — comes from the treatment of Crohn's disease.The cause of the disease is still mysterious, and treatment is more about management than cure. According to Yee, about a third of patients don't respond to the drugs, and for those that do relapses are frequent.So it's a potentially huge opportunity if Celgene's drug works.Still, the drug has taken a while to get much attention. As recently as Aug. 26, Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas could assert that GED-0301 was not modeled into Wall Street's consensus numbers and therefore brought a huge potential for upside.Since then, the bandwagon has gotten more crowded.On Sept. 22, Nomura Securities analyst Ian Somaiya reported on an interview with an investigator who participated in the clinical trial. Although the study was doubled-blinded so he didn't know which patients got GED-0301 and which got the placebo, the investigator reported that three out of seven patients went into clinical remission, and the response time was less than half the usual two weeks that Humira takes. Somaiya also observed no safety problems.'Strong Efficacy' Expected""We believe the full phase-two data will reflect this clinical site's findings, confirming strong efficacy seen in phase-one trial, with rapid benefit and durable remission and a clean safety profile,"" Somaiya wrote in his research note. ""We estimate GED-0301 could reach $2.2 billion in peak worldwide sales and drive upside of $7 to CELG shares.""Anticipation of the drug may have boosted Celgene's stock, which was trading near record highs before this week's market crash.Evidence that GED-0301 might be driving Celgene's rise came on Sept. 11, when the stock dropped 5% over three trading days. There wasn't any apparent reason except a short note put out late on Sept. 10 by ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum, who reported from a meeting that he'd had with Celgene's management.""New Crohn's disease drug is unlikely to be 'once daily' product,"" Schoenebaum wrote. ""This is due to theoretical risk of fibrotic changes with long-term exposure. However, company very interested in studying re-treatment and/or intermittent dosing (e.g., 3 months on/3 months off).""Fibrosis, or a hardening and thickening of the bowel wall, is a common symptom of Crohn's disease. The idea that long-term exposure to GED-0301 might make it worse seems to have spooked investors.Schoenebaum apparently blamed himself for the stock's drop, because the next day he put out a clarification emphasizing the word ""theoretical"" in his note and noted that no such problems had been reported from the trials.If all goes well, GED-0301 is expected to launch around 2017.It would be Celgene's second immunology drug after its first, Otezla, hit the market in March for psoriatic arthritis. On Sept. 23, it was also approved for psoriasis, a larger market. The Street estimates that peak annual sales of Otezla could pass $2 billion.

1024,JNJ,"Robert Wood Johnson was a medical product whiz.He was the leader of three brothers who founded Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and put it on a path to becoming the giant that amassed $71 billion in sales last year.Along the way, R.W. made sure J&J flourish through advertising.It helped that Johnson (1845-1910) and marketing master J. Walter Thompson were pals. They met in the 1870s as young professionals in New York.Johnson had a desk job in a medical product brokerage. Thompson was a bookkeeper in an ad agency that was doing so badly, he later bought it for $500.Years later, Johnson tapped Thompson to develop breakthrough ads of Johnson & Johnson's game-changing health care products.The J. Walter Thompson agency handled media for J&J's first consumer product, a toothpaste called Zonweiss, in 1886.Johnson learned early that paying attention to people and working hard could produce top ideas.His industriousness may have owed a lot to his parents' influence. In 1861, when he was 16, his parents feared he would join his two older brothers in the Union Army. So they apprenticed him to a pharmacist cousin of his mother.LearningJohnson attended a prep school near his family's home in Carbondale, Pa., before his apprenticeship. But he was largely self-taught.At the pharmacy, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Johnson spent long hours learning the trade and preparing the medicinal plasters, a forerunner of today's externally applied medical patches. He viewed his lot as being in a healing profession in which customers appreciated efforts to make them well.Meanwhile, he figured out how plasters were made and the kinds of remedies they dispensed.""Johnson was a very outgoing person,"" Margaret Gurowitz, chief historian of Johnson & Johnson, told IBD. That trait, with his inquisitiveness, led him to leave his relative to seek bigger opportunities in New York City when he was 19.In New York, Johnson sold drug and medical products for a decade. Then he formed a partnership with George Seabury, also a broker, said Gurowitz.Working with Seabury gave Johnson a much-needed outlet for his new product development skills.""In 1874 he organized the firm of Seabury & Johnson and started out making plasters in an India rubber combination,"" said Ian Ellis, of the Today In Science History website. ""Many older druggists tell how they saw him from day to day in an old loft, bare-armed and clothed in jumpers, struggling with whitewash brush and a pail of mush spreading the first 'Benzine' plasters. He succeeded in producing all the plasters of the (standard medical formula) with a rubber base, with the effect of relegating all other forms out of use and creating a new era in plaster-making and uses.""Seabury & Johnson cruised to a prize for its products at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia. Johnson attended the expo, but for reasons other than the award.He wanted to hear a speech by Joseph Lister. The British surgeon was stumping in America for evidence-backed antiseptic surgery.His message was that many more patients survived going under the knife when instruments, supplies and clothing were sterilized.Surgery in America tended to be unsanitary. Many doctors did not believe the germ theory of disease involving things they couldn't see — and some of the physicians wanted to trash his ideas at the expo, says Gurowitz.To the notion of washing hands before surgery, ""they would say doctors are gentlemen, and gentlemen's hands are clean,"" Gurowitz said. ""They took great offense at Lister's ideas.""Not Johnson. He recalled his brothers' stories of brutal wounds and field surgeries in the Civil War and was won over by Lister.""Inspired by Lord Lister, he wanted to mass-produce aseptic surgery gauze and dressings for physicians to use in sterile surgery,"" said Gurowitz. ""Seabury wanted to concentrate on expanding the company's existing medical plaster business instead.""This split in direction of the business was just one point of contention. Johnson and Seabury were both opinionated, and differences often accelerated into arguments. Disagreements involved even mundane issues such as how minutes of board meetings were recorded.In 1876, Seabury figured family would help him and brought his brother into the firm. Johnson one-upped him by hiring two of his brothers.In 1884, Seabury and Johnson found their differences irreconcilable and broke up the company.Johnson's two brothers, James and Edward, left S&J around the same time and set up their own medical product business: J&J in New Brunswick, N.J. They hired their first 14 employees from the old Seabury & Johnson.All In The FamilyRobert was barred from joining them by a noncompete agreement with Seabury. When Seabury reneged on the agreement by not making required payments to Robert, the latter joined his brothers at Johnson & Johnson.The founding of the firm in 1886 opened the way for the Johnsons to make and sell America's first mass-produced surgical dressings.While continuing to make plasters, they sold the sterile dressings mainly through retail pharmacies.Johnson did much of his own market research by channel checks: going to drugstores, meeting with the owners, talking about what they wanted and needed.While on those rounds, he met Fred Kilmer, owner of a pharmacy in New Brunswick. Kilmer, who shared Johnson's strong interest in sterilized medical products and procedures, became J&J's scientific director in 1889. ""As a small-businessman, Kilmer was always looking for creative new ways of building his business and interacting with the public,"" said Gurowitz.Kilmer sold tickets to Rutgers University sports and theater events from his shop as a way to draw more people to the store.Kilmer was a persuasive writer, and he put the skill the good use trying to generate demand among doctors for sterile products.Getting The Word OutSome physicians who ""did want to try antiseptic surgery often lacked the resources and technical knowledge,"" Gurowitz said. ""What was needed was a how-to manual that also laid out the case for antiseptic surgery.""So in 1888, Johnson & Johnson published ""Modern Methods of Antiseptic Wound Treatment"" and gave it away free to medical professionals. Kilmer wrote the parts of the book that deal with the case for sterile technique — leading to a higher patient survival rate — and general practice principles. It also includes surgical case studies from leading antiseptic surgeons.The book became a leading handbook for antiseptic surgery. ""The combination of the company's ready-to-use, mass-produced sterile surgical products plus the manual put antiseptic surgery within reach of most doctors and hospitals for the first time,"" Gurowitz said.Another crucial Johnson move came and involved first aid kits.While on a train to Colorado in 1888, he chatted with another passenger who turned out to be the chief surgeon for the Colorado & Rio Grande Railway.Work on railroads was so dangerous, the lines had surgeons on hand to treat injuries to construction workers and engineers. The chief surgeon hated that when workers were hurt, medical help often was too far away to do much good.Johnson was sure that having sterile bandages and other supplies accessible to workers would help them treat and stabilize an injured person. But he needed to do his market research.He ""wrote to railway surgeons, telling them the company was planning to make first aid kits, asking them what they needed in the kits,"" Gurowitz said.With data in hand, Johnson & Johnson quickly produced a kit for railroads as well as a general purpose kit the same year as Robert's Colorado sojourn.From a startup firm with 14 employees occupying one floor of a factory building in 1886, Johnson & Johnson grew into an operation of several thousand workers in what was the largest factory space in the world when Johnson died at 64.Today, J&J produces an array of health care products ranging from prescription drugs and surgical devices to Band-Aids.J&J went public in 1944. According to the company, an investor buying $375 worth of shares back then would have JNJ stock worth more than $10 million now.Since 1970 alone, the stock has rocketed 10,000%.

1038,JNJ,"When employees suffer, so do companies. How leaders find ways to elevate them:• Face it. A Journal of the American Medical Association study found that depressed workers cost employers $44 billion a year due to health-related productivity losses. One contributing factor? Presenteeism, or being at work but barely working.""The loss in productivity caused by depression is extremely difficult to track because it manifests via poor performance,"" says Graeme Cowan, author of ""Back from the Brink: True Stories and Practical Help for Overcoming Depression and Bipolar Disorder.""• Bring it forward. Cowan knows the lowest lows. Once a senior executive with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and consulting firm A.T. Kearney, he grappled with depression for 20 years and attempted suicide four times. While writing of his experience, he researched mental health issues. One of his findings: 86% of those struggling with depression would rather suffer in silence.""That's very bad news for employers, who may have a big portion of their workforce struggling along at reduced capacity,"" he told IBD.• Pick up signals.  Managers should watch for these harbingers of a problem: a dip in performance, calling in sick often, missing deadlines or meetings, and looking tired or overwhelmed.• Ask. To help someone, Cowan recommends a four-step process. ""Simply ask: Are you OK? Next, listen without judgment. Then encourage action. And finally, follow up,"" he said.• Extend a lifeline. Employers can encourage employees to get help by putting resources in front of them.A mental health policy, a wellness program and educational materials get the ball rolling.""A big regret for depressed individuals is that they didn't get an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan earlier,"" said Cowan.• Get them moving.  Companies that encourage exercise, which elevates workers' outlooks, reap rewards. ""Employees with a positive mood are 31% more productive, sell 37% more and are 300% more creative,"" Cowan said.• Confront frustration.  Sometimes it's not depression but a feeling of disengagement that gnaws at professionals. That was the case for Bob Epperly, author of ""Growing Up After 50.""The former Exxon (XOM) executive took an all-too-common corporate hit after 29 years with the company. The C-suite cut his department in half and outplaced Epperly.His response? ""I stuffed my feelings and moved ahead,"" he said.• Explore. Over the next years, while working for startups, Epperly stopped stuffing his feelings and pursued inner goals. He delved into yoga, improved his diet and exercise habits, and attended seminars on personal growth.• Enhance.

1040,JNJ,"Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts (ESRX) said U.S. prescription-drug spending rose more last year than it had since 2003, according to its annual review. According to the 2014 Drug Trend Report, spending on drugs among the commercially insured rose 13.1% to $980 per member last year. Medicare spending rose 13.8% to $2,987 per member, while Medicaid spending climbed 10.2% to $882.
"
1041,JNJ,"The report said that spending on hepatitis C drugs accounted for more than half of the increase, which was not a big surprise: Before 2014 the disease was still treated mainly with generic drugs, but in 2014 Gilead Sciences' (GILD) premium-priced Sovaldi, often prescribed in tandem with Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) also-pricey Olysio, took over the market. In October, Gilead launched Harvoni, which rendered Olysio obsolete but cost more than Sovaldi.
"
1042,JNJ,"Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefits management leader, was one of the earliest and loudest critics of Sovaldi's price, which amounted to $84,000 for a standard 12-week treatment. In its press release accompanying the report, the PBM bragged about how it had taken a bite out of Gilead by making an exclusive deal with AbbVie (ABBV), when it came out with Gilead's first serious competitor in the form of Viekira Pak near year's end. Express claimed that this would save clients $1 billion this year.
"
1043,JNJ,"It's not clear, however, how well this is working out for AbbVie. Analysts tracking prescription data estimate that it only has about 10% market share, although the data are incomplete and won't be fully known until AbbVie's Q1 report. Another caveat is that Express' price data does not include rebates, which are a significant part of the picture, especially in the hepatitis C market lately.
"
1044,JNJ,"When Gilead reported its Q4 last month, investors had a minor freak out after company executives guided the gross-to-net adjustment — i.e. the rebate level — on the hepatitis C franchise at 46%.
"
1045,JNJ,"Express Scripts' release also echoed comments made by its CEO at January's JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, where he indicated the next price war target would be PCSK9 inhibitors, a new class of cholesterol drugs expected to come to market this year with two offerings from Amgen (AMGN) and the team of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) and Sanofi (SNY).

In a press release, J&J touted Alios' drug candidate for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a major cause of lung infection that has no current treatment. The drug, AL-8176, is in midstage clinical testing.

"
1084,JNJ,"Gilead's megablockbuster Sovaldi was the first nucleotide drug for HCV to hit the market, back in December. And this year, Merck (MRK) shelled out $3.85 billion to buy Idenix Pharmaceuticals because it also has ""nukes"" in development.

1088,JNJ,"""We clearly think the long-term 'call option' upside here is the Alios nukes ... if those can show a four-log (99.99%) reduction in HCV virus and have a good safety profile,"" Yee wrote. ""Of course, that is not a layup, as we know development of nukes can be extremely difficult and the bar for continued progression is very high. As a reminder, Vertex (VRTX) was partnered on two prior Alios nukes and dropped development of both due to a narrow therapeutic window (one weak efficacy, one had signs of liver toxicity).""

1114,JNJ,"Meanwhile, a few large-cap names in the group are back above their 10-week moving averages as they consolidate gains, including Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Alexion (ALXN) .IBD's Medical-Biomed/Biotech group was a big gainer in 2014, up around 41%, and the group is showing no signs of letting up.Headed into Thursday, it was the No. 1-ranked group in IBD's database, based on six-month price performance.On Thursday, it was among the top-performing groups after AbbVie (ABBV) announced plans to buy Pharmacyclics (PCYC) for $21 billion in cash and stock.It looked like the group was ready to roll over in early February when it lost around 7% over four straight sessions, but it found support at its 50-day moving average and resumed its uptrend.Pharmacyclics is one of several biotechs that have shown big sales growth in recent quarters. Its blood cancer drug Imbruvica is a blockbuster. The Food and Drug Administration first approved Imbruvica in November 2013 to treat mantle cell lymphoma. The drug has been approved for other indications in recent months.Twenty-one stocks in the biotech group recently had Composite Ratings of 90 or higher. It's a good bet that the group will see more M&A activity in coming months as big players scoop up smaller ones with compelling pipelines.Isis Pharmaceuticals (ISIS) isn't profitable yet, but two straight quarters of accelerating sales growth, solid mutual-fund sponsorship and an $8.5 billion market capitalization are worth noting.Isis' pipeline consists of 34 drugs to treat a wide variety of diseases with an emphasis on cardiovascular, metabolic, severe and rare diseases, including neurological disorders and cancer.In January, the company inked a potentially lucrative licensing deal with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). J&J's Janssen Biotech unit agreed to pay $35 million up front and up to $800 million in milestone payments to develop drugs for autoimmune disorders of the gastrointestinal tract using Isis' RNA-targeting platform.Last month, Isis received a $5 million milestone payment from Biogen Idec (BIIB). Isis is in a multiyear collaboration with Biogen to advance the treatment of neurological diseases.Isis is in the eighth week of a consolidation that shows a buy point of 75.34. At one point Thursday, it was only 4% off its 52-week high.Elsewhere in the group, small-cap NewLink Genetics (NLNK) has been busy on the partnership front. In 2014, NewLink partnered with Roche (RHHBY) subsidiary Genentech on an early-stage cancer program. NewLink received an upfront payment of $150 million from Genentech, along with more than $1 billion in potential milestones.In infectious diseases, NewLink is working with Merck (MRK) on an Ebola vaccine candidate.NewLink recently cleared a base with a 44.10 buy point, and it's closing in on its all-time high of 53.48.Meanwhile, a few large-cap names in the group are back above their 10-week moving averages as they consolidate gains, including Amgen (AMGN), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Alexion (ALXN) .

1115,JNJ,"Specialty drugmaker Depomed (DEPO) popped nearly 10% to a new high and got an upgrade from Roth Friday after it inked a deal to acquire a new pain drug for $1.05 billion.Late Thursday, Depomed agreed to buy the Nucynta franchise from the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) Janssen Pharmaceuticals division. The franchise includes a tablet, an extended-release tablet and an oral solution that has yet to be launched. Nucynta had been drawing $166 million a year for Janssen. Given that Depomed's current 12-month sales are running at $236 million, that's a significant revenue stream.""Nucynta deal transforms Depomed,"" wrote analyst Scott Henry of Roth Capital Partners in a note upgrading Depomed to buy. ""With price increases and fine tuning, the product could soon approach $250 million... . We believe that a $500 million revenue run rate is achievable for this product.""Depomed stock was already moving up and had achieved an IBD Relative Strength Rating in the 90s before the latest move brought shares to an all-time high of 19.53 in the stock market today.

1191,JNJ,"Companies always look for an edge. One way to get one: create trust among your team by operating with integrity and a big purpose while serving others, says Larry Julian, author of ""God Is My CEO."" This approach helps motivate people and drives them to succeed.Here's how to do it:• Form bonds.  Bring the organization together around a sense of purpose, says Diane Swanson, a Kansas State University ethics professor. Come up with a common mission, such as serving customers and shareholders, that the entire group can rally around.She points to Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ) credo of putting the health of patients and clients first. ""Executives with integrity will be guided by a sense of purpose,"" Swanson told IBD.• Give incentives.  Publicly reward employees who follow the firm's mission. Recognize their work toward employee safety or outstanding service — and back it with action. ""If you're not hiring and promoting people based on integrity, then it's not going to work,"" Swanson said.• See the big picture.  Succeed over the long term by focusing on the group's mission, says Julian, a Minneapolis-based executive coach. ""I know you need to be making money,"" he said. ""But it's also important to have a purpose that transcends the bottom line. That goes to the aspect of people.""• Show the results. Bill George, former CEO of medical device maker Medtronic (MDT), every Christmas brought in people whose lives were changed because of the firm's products. He showed employees how big a difference their efforts made, Julian says. Such a display helped turn around a Medtronic unit that made drug pumps for cerebral palsy patients.• Back it up.  Match your actions to your beliefs. It doesn't do any good to preach the importance of safety yet cut costs on measures that help protect workers.""Watch what (bosses) budget for and who they hire,"" Swanson said. ""Employees are watching for signals that matter.""• Take the blame. Buck the trend and push the credit down to others, but take responsibility for problems. Many managers do the reverse. ""It's important to be able to put yourself in the shoes of other employees,"" Swanson said.• Make it count. Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen (PLKI), shifted the restaurant operator's focus from serving investors to meeting the needs of franchisees.""That was a tremendous success story,"" Julian said. ""Not only did she help franchisees make money, but that also increased profit.""• Share the wealth. Put power in the hands of your people, Swanson says. They'll take their cues from you to keep the culture in place.""If the CEO is going to model integrity and purpose, there have to be employees watching and learning,"" she said.• Build character. Tony Dungy started his head-coaching career in the National Football League by changing a losing culture when he took over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1996. He went to the team's senior leaders and told them they had to help the young players become the best they could be. He brought in assistant coaches who shared his values: accountability, trust and teamwork.""He said if you want to win championships, you have to focus first on building champions,"" Julian said. ""Then the championships will come."" Three years later, his Bucs had a division title.He then took over the Indianapolis Colts and coached them to win the Super Bowl for the 2006 season.

1245,JNJ,"In the midst of a rip-roaring market, many investors tend to seek out fast growth over slow and steady income stocks.But there is an argument to be made for companies that provide stable earnings and reasonable sales growth, as well as a dividend payout. The market's recent volatility could boost the appeal of sectors that are defensive in nature, such as certain medical plays.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is a classic income stock. The New Brunswick, N.J.-based health care giant makes everything from household-name products such as Band-Aids, Splenda and Tylenol to medical devices and prescription drugs.With such a wide range of products, it's recently been looking to slim down its portfolio by selling off some slower-growing units. Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson said it received a $4.5 billion binding offer from the Carlyle Group for its Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business.J&J currently pays 66 cents a share on a quarterly basis, or $2.64 annually. That works out to a dividend yield of about 2.9% vs. the S&P 500's 2%.It has delivered dividends to shareholders for more than 50 years, and has grown adjusted earnings for 29 years in a row. Analysts expect the company to lift profit 6% this year and 8% the next. Its five-year earnings growth rate is 4%, and its Earnings Stability Factor is 1, on a scale of 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable).J&J makes the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which tracks companies that have increased their dividends each year for the past 25 consecutive years.The stock rose 31% last year, just ahead of the S&P 500's 30% gain. It's corrected along with the market this year, and sits nearly 6% below its 52-week high. It sliced through its 10-week moving average last week and is nearing its 40-week line, a level where it typically finds support.

1246,JNJ,"Embattled specialty drugmaker Allergan on Wednesday beat Wall Street's first-quarter earnings estimates and raised its guidance, but the company's stock slid 0.3% to close at 165.87 as its future remained in doubt.Allergan (AGN) reported earnings of $1.18 a share, up 20% from the year-earlier quarter and beating analysts' consensus by 5 cents. Sales rose 13% to $1.62 billion, in line with estimates.Guidance followed a similar pattern. For the full year, the company set a sales range of $6.78 billion to $7 billion, bracketing consensus, while the EPS range of $5.64 to $5.73 topped the Street's $5.47. Last year, the company made $4.77 a share on sales of $6.3 billion.For the second quarter, the firm guided sales of $1.73 billion to $1.8 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago and again meeting views. Allergan guided EPS above consensus at $1.41 to $1.44 vs. $1.22 last year.The announcement came as Allergan's shareholders were still weighing Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) $47 billion hostile-takeover attempt, launched on April 22. On Tuesday, Allergan co-founder Gavin Herbert slammed the takeover bid at the annual shareholders' meeting, warning that Valeant would decimate Allergan's research-and-development budget.Allergan CEO David Pyott refused to take questions on the Valeant drama on Wednesday's conference call to discuss results. Instead he focused on the company's continued growth and market-share gains in its chief markets: ophthalmology, dermatology and aesthetics. Sales of its lead product Botox grew 10% to $502 million, and the company forecast full-year Botox sales of $2.18 billion to $2.28 billion, up from $1.98 billion last year.Botox retains 76% market share, with Valeant's Dysport taking up most of the remainder. In a research note Wednesday, Morningstar analyst Michael Waterhouse pointed out that the company will benefit from Johnson & Johnson 's (JNJ) decision last month to halt development of PurTox, a potential competitor to Botox.Sales of eye drop Restasis climbed 12% to $232 million, and Allergan estimates that they will crack $1 billion this year. The facial-aesthetics category jumped 33% to $147 million, helped by the launch of skin-firming injectable Juvederm Voluma.The breast-aesthetics product line grew 11% to $100 million, even though it was stagnant last year. On the call, Pyott said unit growth is still flat but that the company has succeeded in shifting to higher-end products, like the Seri Surgical Scaffold for tissue reconstruction.Several times during the call Pyott suggested that Allergan will unveil a new strategy in the near future, both in response to the Valeant approach and to shareholder pressure to lower spending. Sales, general and administrative expenses totaled 40.4% of revenue in the quarter, a slight decline from last year, but Pyott acknowledged that investors had ""been asking when we'll get it down to the mid-30s. We've been slow to go there.""Pyott said the board had started talking about the issue some nine months ago, but is holding off on a final decision until the Valeant situation is resolved.""Management would simply have to run the business more aggressively but not necessarily forfeit traditional methods of pharmaceutical value creation of internal and purchased R&D,"" Cowen analyst Ken Cacciatore wrote in a note Wednesday. ""However, they would have to plausibly convince the current shareholders that it makes more sense to be buying AGN stock at $165 rather than selling.""

1269,JNJ,"Focused, appreciated and energetic employees outperform the rest. Tips to increase occupational oomph:• Thaw the frost. Most pros have been blindsided, at least once, by chilly office politics or unspoken expectations.Like the Titanic to an iceberg, a career collision can seem logically avoidable yet somehow inevitable.""There's a certain inescapable frustration to that,"" Jesse Sostrin told IBD.In his book ""Beyond the Job Description,"" he chips away at what he calls the hidden curriculum of work — things you're expected to understand and accomplish, but which aren't detailed in the job description. ""There's so much unspoken stuff that gets in the way"" of professional success, he said.• Go subsurface. To figure out that job within a job, ""you've got to scan the organization for signs of hidden curriculum,"" Sostrin said.Write down your observations of the various players and their motivations, and seek input in a smart way. Sostrin suggests approaching a manager with this soft-pedaled tack: ""I'm working on these objectives and they don't feel like they're connecting with what's important. Where should I put my focus?""Executives receiving such queries are wise to talk openly about ambiguous priorities. Managers who encourage candid chats raise their stature with workers. ""It's that sense of getting it that creates credibility in leaders,"" Sostrin said.• Create an oasis. Work might have its Dilbert-esque moments, ""but I can make one small part of my experience better,"" Sostrin said. Find where your interests and abilities intersect with the organization's true needs.""Grab that sphere of influence wherever you can,"" he said.• Warm their spirits. It takes more than cold, hard cash to motivate workers. ""They're looking for a connection to their work,"" said Cord Himelstein, vice president of marketing and communications for Michael C. Fina. The employee recognition firm emphasizes a personalized approach to winning over the rank and file. ""They'll lose their motivation if their actions go unrecognized,"" he said.• Shine a light. One-size-fits-all appreciation programs — a standard gift for years of service — can fall flat. Himelstein urges firms to take a thoughtful approach. ""Understand the behaviors you're trying to influence,"" he said. Reward carefully defined outcomes, such as hitting performance goals or financial targets. ""Define how you're going to measure your success"" and track progress.• Mix in movement. Pausing throughout the day to move a little wakes overtaxed minds. ""By taking strategic physical activity breaks, your energy level throughout the day goes up. It will truly get you back to work fully engaged.""So says Sanjay Gupta, president of Wellness & Prevention, a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) company.He recommends conducting walking meetings and keeping exercise balls in conference rooms for a more active spin on sitting.• Exert top muscle. To raise everyone's energy level, CEOs should take the first step.""It's not just what we say; it's what we do,"" Gupta said. ""The culture of health starts at the top.""He signed the CEO Pledge, a nationwide campaign promoted by the National Coalition for Promoting Physical Activity.Chiefs who've signed on promise to boost their own personal fitness and provide opportunities for employees to follow suit. The supposition: If bosses are working out, employees will follow. ""That culture starts with the leader being involved,"" Gupta said. ""We've got to get more deliberate about it for this to work.""

1334,JNJ,"ETF investors are typically affluent and experienced in the stock market. Given that only 3% of U.S. households own ETFs, the industry has its work cut out for it in educating retail investors about them.
"
1335,JNJ,"Here are some of the biggest myths and truths about ETFs that investors must understand to avoid mistakes.
"
1336,JNJ,"Myth No. 1: ETF liquidity doesn't matter and that only the liquidity of the underlying holdings matter. The truth is some thinly traded ETFs have very wide bid/ask spreads even if they hold very liquid stocks. The spread is the difference between the lowest price a trader is willing to sell the ETF and the highest price a buyer is willing to pay. The wider the spread, the bigger the immediate loss upon buying the ETF.
"
1337,JNJ,"Dodd Kittsley, head of institutional product consulting at iShares, recommends investors use limit orders to get trades executed at the midpoint between bid and ask prices.
"
1338,JNJ,"The analytics tool at ETF.com shows iPath Short Enhanced MSCI Emerging Markets ETN (EMSA) with less than $5 million in assets has a bid/ask spread that is nearly as big as the ETN's share price of 81.61. Most ETFs with bid/ask spreads larger than 1% of share price have less than $10 million in assets.
"
1339,JNJ,"""Low-volume ETFs are disasters waiting to happen and in many cases have happened,"" said Ron Rowland, founder of Capital Cities Asset Management and AllStarInvestor.com in Austin, Texas. ""Wide bid/ask spreads are just the most visible problem. The unseen problem is the inability to arbitrage the price of the ETF to its underlying NAV (net asset value).""
"
1340,JNJ,"ETFs shares are created and redeemed through in-kind exchanges to prevent ETFs from trading at a discount or premium to their NAV. Market makers typically create and redeem ETFs in blocks of 50,000 shares, which thereby requires healthy trading volume.
"
1341,JNJ,"But not all small, thinly traded ETFs have wide bid/ask spreads. IPath Inverse S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (XXV) has less than $4 million in assets but a bid/ask spread of 0.03%, which is the same as iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) with $13.5 billion in assets.
"
1342,JNJ,"Myth No. 2: Thinking that due to diversification, ETFs are safer than stocks and can be bought and held with little volatility. The truth is some ETFs are as volatile as individual stocks.
"
1343,JNJ,"""A blue Chip stock like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) may have less market volatility compared to volatile sector ETFs like Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) or iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB),"" Ron DeLegge, editor of ETFGuide.com said in an email. ""On the other hand, a diversified health care ETF like Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) may have less volatility compared to Johnson & Johnson. In comparing volatility, it's always important to do apples-with-apples measurements.""
"
1344,JNJ,"Myth No. 3: All ETFs are tax efficient. The truth: ETFs that hold futures contracts will issue a K-1 tax form instead of a 1099, which can be a hassle to deal with, notes ETF Database analyst Jared Cummans.
"
1345,JNJ,"""Investors also often overlook the fact that two of the most popular funds, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV) are taxed as collectibles,"" Cummans wrote. Capital gains on those are taxed at a maximum 28% rate instead of the ordinary 15%.
"
1346,JNJ,"""ETFs linked to asset classes with high taxable income like REITs or Treasury bonds are best kept in tax-deferred accounts,"" DeLegge said.
"
1347,JNJ,"High turnover in actively managed ETFs, which account for only 1% of all ETF assets, can potentially slap investors with capital gains distributions, said Kittsley of iShares.
"
1348,JNJ,"Myth No. 4: The cheapest ETFs, including those offered with no commission, are always the best. The truth is some ETFs with commission-free trading have wide bid/ask spreads and so investors end up losing the difference between the bid/ask price when they trade.

1349,JNJ,"""A low price tag can be attractive in the near term, but at the end of the day, you want to select ETFs that support your long-term investment goals as well as meet your cost threshold,"" Eric Pollackov, managing director of ETFs at Charles Schwab, said in an email.ETF investors are typically affluent and experienced in the stock market. Given that only 3% of U.S. households own ETFs, the industry has its work cut out for it in educating retail investors about them.Here are some of the biggest myths and truths about ETFs that investors must understand to avoid mistakes.Myth No. 1: ETF liquidity doesn't matter and that only the liquidity of the underlying holdings matter. The truth is some thinly traded ETFs have very wide bid/ask spreads even if they hold very liquid stocks. The spread is the difference between the lowest price a trader is willing to sell the ETF and the highest price a buyer is willing to pay. The wider the spread, the bigger the immediate loss upon buying the ETF.Dodd Kittsley, head of institutional product consulting at iShares, recommends investors use limit orders to get trades executed at the midpoint between bid and ask prices.The analytics tool at ETF.com shows iPath Short Enhanced MSCI Emerging Markets ETN (EMSA) with less than $5 million in assets has a bid/ask spread that is nearly as big as the ETN's share price of 81.61. Most ETFs with bid/ask spreads larger than 1% of share price have less than $10 million in assets.""Low-volume ETFs are disasters waiting to happen and in many cases have happened,"" said Ron Rowland, founder of Capital Cities Asset Management and AllStarInvestor.com in Austin, Texas. ""Wide bid/ask spreads are just the most visible problem. The unseen problem is the inability to arbitrage the price of the ETF to its underlying NAV (net asset value).""ETFs shares are created and redeemed through in-kind exchanges to prevent ETFs from trading at a discount or premium to their NAV. Market makers typically create and redeem ETFs in blocks of 50,000 shares, which thereby requires healthy trading volume.But not all small, thinly traded ETFs have wide bid/ask spreads. IPath Inverse S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (XXV) has less than $4 million in assets but a bid/ask spread of 0.03%, which is the same as iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) with $13.5 billion in assets.Myth No. 2: Thinking that due to diversification, ETFs are safer than stocks and can be bought and held with little volatility. The truth is some ETFs are as volatile as individual stocks.""A blue Chip stock like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) may have less market volatility compared to volatile sector ETFs like Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) or iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB),"" Ron DeLegge, editor of ETFGuide.com said in an email. ""On the other hand, a diversified health care ETF like Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) may have less volatility compared to Johnson & Johnson. In comparing volatility, it's always important to do apples-with-apples measurements.""Myth No. 3: All ETFs are tax efficient. The truth: ETFs that hold futures contracts will issue a K-1 tax form instead of a 1099, which can be a hassle to deal with, notes ETF Database analyst Jared Cummans.""Investors also often overlook the fact that two of the most popular funds, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV) are taxed as collectibles,"" Cummans wrote. Capital gains on those are taxed at a maximum 28% rate instead of the ordinary 15%.""ETFs linked to asset classes with high taxable income like REITs or Treasury bonds are best kept in tax-deferred accounts,"" DeLegge said.High turnover in actively managed ETFs, which account for only 1% of all ETF assets, can potentially slap investors with capital gains distributions, said Kittsley of iShares.Myth No. 4: The cheapest ETFs, including those offered with no commission, are always the best. The truth is some ETFs with commission-free trading have wide bid/ask spreads and so investors end up losing the difference between the bid/ask price when they trade.""A low price tag can be attractive in the near term, but at the end of the day, you want to select ETFs that support your long-term investment goals as well as meet your cost threshold,"" Eric Pollackov, managing director of ETFs at Charles Schwab, said in an email.

1368,JNJ,"Though still in the early days since its Dec. 6 approval, Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug Sovaldi may be enjoying one of the most massive drug launches of all time. Current consensus calls for sales of $4.6 billion this year — and the whisper numbers are running even higher.
"
1369,JNJ,"This doesn't surprise Wall Street, as Sovaldi provides a faster, safer and stronger alternative to a punishing yearlong regimen of interferon. But as analysts obsessively watch the weekly prescription numbers grow, they're also eyeing data from Sovaldi's potential challengers in a market that's estimated at $20 billion a year and growing.

"
1374,JNJ,"In October, Bristol filed to approve a combo of daclatasvir with another of its drugs, asunaprevir, in Japan, which has an unusually high rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection due to a formerly tainted blood supply.
"
1375,JNJ,"Douglas Manion, Bristol's vice president of development, virology and Japan, says that the dual regimen scored good results, but its 24-week duration is looking like yesterday's news now that Sovaldi has set a 12-week standard. He hopes that will be resolved by a triple therapy involving daclatasvir, asunaprevir and a drug dubbed BMS-791325, co-formulated into one pill to be taken twice a day, now in phase three testing.

1378,JNJ,"""Daclatasvir has been studied with so many different drugs, it's used in all genotypes (of the hepatitis C virus) and all patient populations — especially the toughest-to-treat populations,"" Manion said.

AbbVie also stuck to the most common genotype, genotype 1. It did very well in the trials, with cure rates ranging from 90% to 100%. The company plans to file in the U.S. during the second quarter and hit the market late this year.
"
1381,JNJ,"In one respect it will have nearly caught up with Gilead, because current FDA guidelines on Sovaldi recommend that it be used with interferon in genotype 1, unless the patient can't tolerate interferon.

Gilead is banking on its sofosbuvir-ledipasvir combo to be its first official interferon-free genotype 1 treatment — also expected to launch later this year after a Feb. 10 filing.Barry Bernstein, AbbVie's vice president of infectious disease development, touted 3D's strong safety profile and the fact that it cured upward of 92% of patients with compensated cirrhosis.""We believe that the regimens will provide an option for any genotype 1-infected patient,"" Bernstein told IBD.AbbVie, Bristol-Myers and Gilead are all expected to report final study details at the International Liver Congress, meeting in London April 9-13. Company officials are keeping mum on which studies will be presented, but abstracts will go online March 24. (Late-breaking abstracts, which appear right before the conference, often have the hottest data.)Next-Generation RegimesFurther down the road, even more drugs are on the way.AbbVie and partner Enanta Pharmaceuticals (ENTA) are already working on a next-generation regime that will treat more genotypes and also be simpler to take. (A common criticism of the 3D is that it's more complicated than Gilead's promised pill-a-day routine.)Earlier this month, Merck (MRK) also reported very strong phase two results for its two-drug combo for genotype 1 patients, some of whom were co-infected with HIV. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) last October acquired three HCV drugs from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), which it hopes to combine with its already approved Olysio into an all-oral regimen.Sovaldi, meanwhile, has lately been under pressure both for its $1,000-a-pill price tag and concerns about sustainability — after all, one outcome of finding a curative drug is that the patient population eventually shrinks.Still, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover says Gilead has a first-mover advantage and such strong trial data that it likely will be the biggest player for the indefinite future.""I think we'll have Gilead representing 50% of the hep C market,"" he told IBD. ""AbbVie will take the lion's share of what's remaining.""

However, a clinical trial comparing survival rates of CLL patients on Imbruvica with those on GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Arzerra produced such good results that the companies stopped the trial early, on Jan. 7, boding well for its approval.Analysts expect Imbruvica's peak annual sales to pass $6 billion.Pharmacyclics stock was trading down before the press release came out, but it instantly rebounded and was near 142 in afternoon trading.

"
1616,JNJ,"Karnauskas set her 2017 sales estimate at a blockbuster $2.5 billion, saying Wall Street's $1.3 billion estimate is too low. Consensus has been rising over the past six months, however, along with the stock.

1623,JNJ,"This is especially important for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), where the median age at diagnosis is 72 years.

1624,JNJ,"According to Karnauskas, current treatments (which include Rituxan) offer patients a trade-off between toxicity and effectiveness — and in old age, the body has a lot more trouble handling toxicity. She noted that in the phase-two study of the drug, only 12% of newly diagnosed patients and 6% of relapsed patients had to drop out due to ""adverse events,"" even though treatment went on for about two years.
"
1625,JNJ,"All the good data were still in the future when Duggan took over Pharmacyclics. In fact, it was so hard to raise capital that in December 2008 and March 2009 he lent the company $6.4 million of his own money.

1691,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that it is re-organizing its business into three business segments, separating its consumer healthcare business into a standalone unit. Beginning 2019, Pfizer will report under three new business units — Innovative Medicines, Established Medicines and Consumer Healthcare. Presently, Pfizer has two reporting segments — Innovative Health and Essential Health.The present Innovative Health unit will be called Innovative Medicines. Other than including all the current Innovative Health business units, Innovative Medicines will include a new Hospital Medicines business unit created for sterile injectable and anti-infective medicines, which are presently recorded under Pfizer’s Essential Health unit. Also, biosimilars will now be included under the Oncology and Inflammation & Immunology business segments in the Innovative Medicines unit.The Essential Health unit will be renamed to Established Medicines. This unit will continue to include Pfizer’s legacy brands that have lost or will lose market exclusivity including Lyrica, Lipitor, Norvasc and Viagra, and certain generic medicines. While Lipitor, Norvasc and Viagra have already lost patent exclusivity, Lyrica is expected to lose the same in December this year.Pfizer expects a significant reduction in the impact of patent protection losses post-2020 (after Lyrica’s loss of exclusivity). Last year, Pfizer had said that while loss of exclusivities (LOE) hurt 2017 sales by $2.1 billion, the negative impact will go down to about $2 billion in each of the next three years (through 2020). The LOE impact will reduce further post 2020 and will go down to approximately $1 billion in 2021.  It will not be more than $500 million from 2022 through 2025. With potentially lower LOE impact, Pfizer is optimistic that the Established Medicines unit can generate sustainable modest revenue growth. The Consumer Healthcare unit, which was until now a part of Innovative Health, will include all of Pfizer’s over-the-counter drugs. Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial of a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and Pfizer may ultimately opt to retain the business.Pfizer is having a tough time finding a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare segment, In March, British companies Reckitt Benckiser Group and Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy its Consumer Health segment. Some investors believe the split can make the sale easier. Some also speculate that Pfizer may sell its generics unit in a couple of years.The news of business re-organization comes a day after Pfizer deferred its recent price increases of several prescription drugs after being criticized by Trump. There are concerns that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in prices by drugmakers like J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and others.This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 2.7% against a decrease of 1.4% for the industry.Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Over the last five trading days, the Dow has declined 0.7%.Next Week’s OutlookComments from President Trump have guided markets lower on more than one occasion this week.

Several key pieces of data are lined up for released next week including the all-important GDP report.

1693,JNJ,"After the worst first half performance since 2010, the Dow Jones has shown some strength at the start of the second half. This is especially true as the blue-chip index had its best day in a month on Jul 9, which pushed back the index to a positive territory for the year.

1694,JNJ,"Biogen Inc.’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) shares were up around 7% in after-market trading on Thursday on positive top-line data from a mid-stage study evaluating its pipeline candidate, BAN2401 for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD).Biogen is developing BAN2401, a humanized beta amyloid antibody, in collaboration with Japan’s Eisai Co., Ltd. Amyloid is a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. The candidate is being investigated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid.Top-line results of the final analysis of the phase II study (n=856) demonstrated statistically significant slowing of disease progression on the key clinical endpoint (ADCOMS) after 18 months of treatment in patients receiving the highest treatment dose (10 mg/kg biweekly) of BAN2401 as compared to placebo. Meanwhile, treatment with this high dose for 18 months also led to reduction of amyloid beta accumulated in the brain. The study included five dose regimens.This data marked an important breakthrough by Biogen and Eisai in the challenging AD market which led to the share price increase. However, so far this year, Biogen’s shares have declined 6.2%, almost inline with the industry’s decline of 6.5% in the same time frame.   In late 2017, data announced from the same study failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success. An Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint. With the study failing to show an early positive result, the company said that the blinded study, which is being conducted in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or mild Alzheimer's dementia (collectively known as early Alzheimer’s disease) will continue with a comprehensive final analysis to be conducted at 18 months.Detailed data from the study is expected to be presented at future conferences.Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.Last month, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) discontinued two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the IDMC. The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. Back in November 2016, Lilly said that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.Despite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns, considering that more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1695,JNJ,"The biggest news this week was Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) announcement of its plans to spin off its eye care division, Alcon, into a new public company. The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave positive recommendations for granting marketing approval to several drugs this week. AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) relatively new cancer drugs, Lynparza and Imfinzi, were granted marketing approval in Japan.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovartis to Spin Off Alcon: Novartis announced its intention to spin off its eye care division, Alcon, into a separately-traded standalone company.Novartis had acquired Alcon in 2011. Novartis was conducting a strategic review of this business for long, which included retaining the business or a separation via sale, spin-off or an initial public offering.The decision to spin off Alcon looks prudent as the business was not performing per management’s expectations. Alcon management believes that creating a standalone company via a capital markets exit could create additional shareholder value. The divestiture of this unit should also help Novartis focus on its drugs business. Novartis plans to retain ophthalmic pharmaceuticals as part of its pharmaceuticals portfolio.Concurrently, the company announced that it will initiate a share buyback program of $5 billion to be executed by the end of 2019. (Read more: Novartis to Spin Off Alcon as Separate Trading Company)CHMP Gives Positive Opinion to Several Drugs: Bristol Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 inhibitor, Opdivo gained a positive CHMP opinion, recommending expanded approval for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients with melanoma. The CHMP also gave a nod to AstraZeneca’s new formulation of once-weekly Bydureon in a pre-filled BCise device to help improve glycaemic control. This new formulation is already approved in the United States. Sanofi (SNY) also gained positive CHMP opinion for Cablivi (caplacizumab) for treatment of a rare blood disorder called acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Cablivi was added to Sanofi’s portfolio with its latest acquisition of Ablynx. Novartis’ filing looking for label expansion of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah, for two B-cell malignancies was also given a positive opinion by the CHMP. The final decision by the European Union on these products is expected in the coming months.AstraZeneca Gains Japan Approvals for Two New Cancer Drugs: AstraZeneca’s PARP inhibitor, Lynparza gained approval for the second indication in Japan. Lynparza (olaparib) tablets, which are already approved for advanced ovarian cancer, are now approved in Japan for the treatment of patients with unresectable or recurrent BRCA-mutated metastatic breast cancer in patients who have received prior chemotherapy.Also, AstraZeneca’s new PD-L1 inhibitor was approved by the Japanese regulatory authorities for locally-advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Imfinzi is already approved in the United States in this indication while an application in the EU is under review, with a decision expected in the second half. (Read more: AstraZeneca’s Two New Cancer Drugs Get Approval in Japan)Merck’s Keytruda sBLA Gets Priority Review: Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking to expand the label of Keytruda for first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC —a difficult-to-treat lung cancer patient population —was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA’s decision is expected on Oct 30. The sBLA filing was based on data from the KEYNOTE-407 study. We remind investors that data presented from this study stole the limelight at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology earlier this month. Data from the study showed that the combination of Keytruda plus chemotherapy led to significant improvement in both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival regardless of PD-L1 expression. (Read more: Merck’s Keytruda Gets Priority Review in Difficult Lung Cancer)Bristol-Myers Leukemia Drug Gets EU Nod for Expanded Indication: Bristol-Myers announced that the European Commission has given marketing approval to its leukemia drug Sprycel for a new patient population and as a new formulation.

With the deal, Novartis’ generic arm, Sandoz, gained commercial rights to Symjepi in the United States, in exchange for an upfront fee and potential performance-based milestone payments. Both companies will share the profits equally. Meanwhile, upon approval, Sandoz will also get commercial rights for Symjepi Injection 0.15mg, which is presently under FDA review.

1696,JNJ,"The large cap pharmaceuticals sector comprising some of the biggest drugmakers of the world was off to a strong start in 2018. However, the sector took a backseat due to reasons like U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline as well as regulatory front. Also, some older drugs of these companies are not performing up to the mark, inducing a drop in their revenues.The Zacks Large-Cap Pharma industry has declined 3.1% so far this year against the Zacks S&P 500 Composite’s gain of 2.6%.Overall, the sector is expected to rebound in the second half of the year. We believe, new product sales will be ramped up on the back of a rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results and frequent FDA approvals. This upside in turn,  might bring the sector back on track this year. Also, many of these companies have accelerated their cost-saving initiatives to enable investment in new products as well as defend the existing product portfolio to optimize long- and short-term growth. Cost savings can drive the earnings performance.Importantly, mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity is gaining momentum with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity this year.With an optimistic outlook for the rest of the year, here we highlight three stocks that may prove to be good buys. All these stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and have seen their share price and earnings estimates rise in the near term. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Large Cap Pharma StocksH. Lundbeck A/S (HLUYY  -  Free Report)Shares of this Danish drugmaker have rallied 18.9% in the past three months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year EPS has been revised 11.6% and 4.3% upward for 2018 and 2019, respectively, over the last 60 days. H. Lundbeck has a Zacks Rank of 1.The company witnessed solid revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018 despite headwinds from exchange rates and generic erosion. It also strengthened its R&D pipeline with the inclusion of Parkinson's disease candidate, foliglurax, from the acquisition of Prexton Therapeutics, currently in mid-stage development.Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)This Zacks #2 Ranked stock has been working on strengthening its suite of products through buyouts and licensing deals. The company’s new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals through 2022 including around 15 products with blockbuster potential. Pfizer’s growing immuno-oncology portfolio offers strong growth prospects. Shares of the company have increased 3.9% in the past three months. Earnings estimates have also moved 0.3% north both for 2018 and 2019, respectively, over the past 60 days. AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)AbbVie’s key arthritis drug, Humira, is performing well on strong demand trends despite new competition. Moreover, its drug Imbruvica marketed in partnership with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is approved for hematological cancers has multibillion dollar potential and the company is exploring the possibility of a label expansion for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Mavyret for hepatitis C virus has become a major growth driver for AbbVie in a short span within the market. Moreover, AbbVie boasts an impressive late-stage pipeline with label expansions for both new and existing products, expected over the next few years. Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are also anticipated in 2018. Additionally, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and its share price has also gained 4.4% in the past three months. The consensus estimate for the company’s current and next-year bottom line has also been raised 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, over the past 60 days.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1697,JNJ,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that its generic arm, Sandoz, obtained approval for Zessly, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)’s Remicade, in Europe.Zessly is approved for use in all indications of the branded drug including rheumatoid arthritis, adult Crohn's disease, pediatric Crohn's disease, adult ulcerative colitis, pediatric ulcerative colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and plaque psoriasis.The approval from the European Commission is based on review of a comprehensive development program, including analytical, preclinical and clinical data, which confirmed Zessly matching Remicade in terms of safety, efficacy and quality.An approval was in the cards as the CHMP had given a positive opinion on the same in March.The approval will strengthen Sandoz’s already strong biosimilar portfolio with five marketed biosimilars (Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; and filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States).Rixathon (biosimilar rituximab), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases (also approved in the EU as Riximyo under a duplicate marketing authorization); and Erelzi (biosimilar etanercept), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat multiple inflammatory diseases.  With Zessly’s approval, Sandoz will now have six approved biosimilars in its portfolio. Zessly is the third biosimilar which has been approved by the EC in the last 12 months for Sandoz.The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016. However, the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the European Economic Area.Novartis’ shares have declined 2.6% over a year, compared with the industry’s fall of 5.5%. However, Sandoz continues to face pricing pressure and sales are projected to decline in the upcoming quarters.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

With the latest approval, Taltz label will now include data for psoriasis involving the genital area, which impacts roughly 63% of psoriasis patients over the course of their disease.Taltz is already marketed for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy as well as for active psoriatic arthritis. Taltz works by specifically targeting IL-17A, a protein that plays a role in driving underlying inflammation in psoriasis.The drug recorded sales of $146.5 million in the first quarter of 2018. The label expansion will expand the eligible patient population of the drug, which should drive sales going forward.The approval for genital psoriasis was based on data from a study evaluating patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis involving the genital area. In the study, Taltz demonstrated a significant improvement compared to placebo at 12 weeks in the severity of psoriasis affecting the genital area, overall psoriasis, genital itch and the impact of genital psoriasis on sexual activity in such patients.Though many other drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx, J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya and AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira are approved to treat plaque psoriasis, Lilly claims Taltz is now the first and only FDA approved treatment for genital psoriasisTaltz is also being studied in a late-stage study for axial spondyloarthritis.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have declined 2.6% compared with the industry’s decline of 3.8%. Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1699,JNJ,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that a combination regimen of its blockbuster cancer drug, Imbruvica (ibrutinib), failed in a phase III study – DBL3001 – evaluating it as first-line treatment for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”). The drug failed to improve event-free survival (“EFS”) compared to current standard of care.DLBCL is an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”), a type of blood cancer, for which no new therapy has been approved for over a decade for treatment-naive patients. The R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) chemotherapy is the standard of care for these patients.Shares of AbbVie slid 3.9% on Jul 11 following the news. The company’s shares have decreased 1.8% year to date compared with the industry’s decline of 2.5%.The phase III study, which was conducted in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), evaluated Imbruvica in combination with R-CHOP versus R-CHOP and placebo together. The primary endpoint of the study was superiority in EFS. The combination regimen was investigated for the treatment of DLBCL patients who have non-germinal center B cell (“GCB”) or activated B-cell (“ABC”) subtypes. Patients with these two subtypes commonly have poorer treatment outcomes with greater unmet medical need.However, data from the study demonstrated improvement in a certain patient sub-population, which was clinically meaningful and may be analyzed further.The company will present detailed analysis of the study at a future scientific conference and publish it in a peer-reviewed medical journal.In a separate press release, AbbVie and its partner Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced the submission of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for label expansion of leukemia drug, Venclexta (venetoclax). The sNDA is seeking approval of Venclexta in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) for treating newly diagnosed patients with acute myeloid leukemia (“AML”) who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy.The sNDA was filed based on data from two separate early stage studies evaluating Venclexta in combination with MHA and with LDAC.Venclexta’s label was expanded last month as monotherapy or in combination with Roche/Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) Rituxan for the treatment of relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma in second or later line settings.AbbVie Inc.

1700,JNJ,"We expect Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, before market open. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.49%.J&J’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 2.86%Johnson & Johnson Price and EPS Surprise   Johnson & Johnson Price and EPS Surprise | Johnson & Johnson QuoteThe stock has depreciated 9.6% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decline of 1.3% recorded by the industry. Factors to ConsiderJ&J’s sales improved in the first quarter of 2018. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and Consumer segment sales improved. The positive sales trend is expected to continue in the second quarter. In fact, J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite the impact of biosimilars on sales of its key arthritis drug Remicade. Sales in the Consumer and Medical Device segments are expected to improve.We believe that new products in all segments, successful label expansion of cancer drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions will continue to drive top-line growth. Core products like Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna are expected to contribute to growth.However, in the past two quarters, revenues from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) products — added after the June 2017 acquisition of Actelion —  declined sequentially due to lower sales of Tracleer outside the United States due to generic competition. It is less likely that PAH revenues will improve in the second quarterBiosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).However, J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States in 2018. However, the full year guidance includes the impact of generics for Procrit and Tracleer as well as Remicade biosimilars.Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said on the first-quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been strong. The drug recorded sales of $72 million in the first quarter, which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. We expect J&J to discuss initial sales numbers for Erleada, its newly approved prostate cancerdrug, on the second-quarter conference call.In the Medical Devices segment, sales are expected to rise consistently in the Vision Care and Cardiovascular units. Diabetes Care unit will however continue to remain weakIn the Consumer segment, while beauty and over-the-counter products are expected to do well, domestic baby care product sales will likely remain weak. Recent acquisitions as well as new products are likely to provide some support.However, higher investments behind the new product launches will continue to hurt profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that J&J is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: J&J’s Earnings ESP is +0.37%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $2.06 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of J&J’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large drug/biotech stocks that also have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +1.25% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 26.

1701,JNJ,"Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PCRX  -  Free Report) reported encouraging preliminary sales figure for its lead drug, Exparel.Preliminary numbers for Exparel sales came at $80.4 million for the second quarter of 2018, rising approximately 15% year over year. The company reported that daily sales grew 11%, 16% and 18% for the month of April, May, and June, respectively, compared with the year-ago period.Growth in drug sales can primarily be attributed to expanding adoption of Exparel as a non-opioid pain management therapy in various surgical procedures.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales, which includes collaborative licensing and milestone revenues, and royalty revenues along with Exparel sales, for the second quarter is pegged at $77.31 million. The preliminary results already suggest a revenue beat.Pacira’s share price has increased 10.8% so far beginning April 2018, compared with the industry’s gain of 2.9%.We remind investors that the FDA has approved the label expansion of Exparel to include administration via nerve block for prolonged regional analgesia, earlier in April.

1703,JNJ,"Reforms — whether financial or demographic — are pretty rampant in China right now. The ride has been rocky for this economy, with growth dropping to a 26-year low last year and with little respite in sight.  The Chinese economy expanded 1.4% sequentially in Q1, marking the weakest pace of expansion since the first quarter of 2016 and also lagging market expectations of 1.5%.Naturally, the government is adopting a host of accommodative measures to boost the economy.  Probably, as part of the demographic reform, Beijing is planning to end the four-decade-old infamous policy pertaining to birth limits, as reported on Bloomberg. The reform is expected to take effect by 2019.China is actually gradually easing its one-child policy in recent times. China had slightly loosened the policy in 2013, relaxing the limit for couples where one partner is an only child. In 2015, China scrapped its one-child policy altogether, allowing couples to have two children.Why the Move? Put into effect in 1979, the policy is expected to have put off about 400 million births. However, concerns over China's ageing population and the resultant shortage of workers and consumers prompted this move.China’s working age population dropped to its lowest level since 2009 last year and also fell below a billion for the first time since 2010. The number of people 65 or older rose to 11.4% of the population, up from 10.8% in 2016.The State Council last year estimated that about 25% of China’s population will cross 60 by 2030, up from 13% in 2010. As a result, slowing population growth and declining number of workers pose a threat to China’s economic growth and its state-run pension program, per an article published on Reuters.Investors should note that China has long been working on stepping up domestic consumption, reducing focus on exports and intending to move to a ‘slower and more balanced growth’ economy.How Effective Will the Move Be? Now, the scrapping of restriction is expected to translate into huge demographic gains down the road. However, a former division chief at the National Family Planning Commission indicated that ""scrapping birth limits will have little effect on the tendency of China’s declining births,"" as the decision came in late.Investors should note that the number of births fell 3.5% to 17.23 million in 2017 despite 2015’s loosening of birth limits. Still, we expect some positives out of this move over the long term.Impact of Likely Baby Boom on Stock MarketAs expected, companies selling baby-related goods and services will be the immediate beneficiaries from the end of this policy. Baby-related stocks rallied in China following the news. Of course, companies selling products related to baby care should see a surge over the long run and the Real Estate and Education sectors will also get a lift.Below we highlight two U.S. stocks pertaining to baby products that can gain from the possible reform of China’s family planning norm.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report)The Procter & Gamble Company is into Beauty, Hair and Personal Care; Grooming; Health Care; Fabric Care and Home Care; and Baby, Feminine and Family Care. Baby wipes, diapers, and pants belong to the last segment. Notably, PG derives considerable sales from Greater China and is thus expected to gain significantly from a change in child birth policy. PG has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)The company is a renowned name in baby care products along with other health care offerings. Its huge global exposure makes it a must-watch on China news.

Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs — Tivicay (50 mg) and Edurant (25 mg) — into a single, once-daily pill for the treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infectionJuluca gained approval in the United States in November last year and generated sales £10 million in the first quarter of 2018.Tivicay, a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is marketed by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). Edurant is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) marketed by Janssen, J&J’s pharma arm. Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.The approval in the EU was expected as in March this year the Committee for Human Use of Medicinal Products (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) had given a positive opinion recommending approval of Juluca.This year so far, J&J’s shares have declined 11.4% while that of Glaxo have gone up 13%. In the said time frame, the industry has witnessed a decline of 3.7%.Juluca, the first two-drug regimen to be approved, reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.Juluca’s approval was based on data from two phase III SWORD studies. Data from these studies showed that the combination of Tivicay and Edurant antiretroviral was as effective as a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen as a maintenance therapy in HIV patients who have already achieved viral suppression.We remind investors that Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) also gained FDA approval for a single tablet HIV regimen (triple therapy) this year.  Biktarvy gained FDA approval in February this year while a regulatory application is under review in the EU.

1705,JNJ,"In response to President Donald Trump’s tweet on Monday, Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said that it will defer its recent price increases of several prescription drugs maximum until the end of the year. Chief executive officer (CEO), Ian Read, announced the decision following an “extensive discussion” with the President.Last week, the New York based company had announced an increase in list prices of several drugs, effective Jul 1. This was the second time this year that Pfizer increased prices of its medicines. Pfizer raised prices of its medicines by an average of 9%, which is within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, prices of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the January hike.Pfizer defended the price rise by stating that the list price does not reflect the actual price, which includes a discount. It also mentioned that it had hiked prices of only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.In his first tweet on Monday, the President criticized Pfizer for the price increases. Trump warned that the administration will act in response and Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they have raised drug prices for “no reason”. The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies are offering “bargain basement prices” overseas.In the latest statement, Read said the prices of these medicines will return to their pre-Jul 1 levels as soon as technically possible. He also said the prices will be deferred until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is sooner. Meanwhile, the price cuts by the company will remain in effect. In a tweet on Tuesday, the President appreciated Pfizer’s decision and hoped others would follow suit.Incidentally, Pfizer’s announcement of the price hike came only a few weeks after Trump’s claim in May that pharma companies would soon take massive price cuts voluntarily. However, there have been no signs of such price cuts.Pfizer faced criticism for the price hikes as there is a concern that price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in prices by drugmakers like J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and others.This year so far, Pfizer's shares have increased 3.3% against a decrease of 2.2% for the industry.  Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ABP 710 is an anti-TNF monoclonal antibody.Data from the phase III study showed that ABP 710 was non-inferior compared to Remicade based on its primary endpoint, which was assessment of ACR20 at week 22. The ACR (American College of Rheumatology) criteria are used to measure the effectiveness of various arthritis medicines in clinical studies.  An ACR20 score means that a person's RA has improved by 20%.The data showed that there was no clinically meaningful difference between ABP 710 and Remicade.Amgen’s shares have gained 5.5% so far this year against a 7.6% decrease registered by the industry.  Amgen has 10 biosimilar products in its portfolio. Out of them, Amgen’s biosimilar version of Abbvie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) RA drug Humira, Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September 2016 and in the EU in March 2017 for the same indications as Humira. Amjevita is the first biosimilar version of Humira to be approved by the FDA as well as Amgen’s first biosimilar medicine to be approved. Amgen will begin selling Amjevita in most countries in the EU this year and in the United States from January 2023.Amgen has collaborated with Allergan for the worldwide development and commercialization of four oncology antibody biosimilar medicines. Among them, a biosimilar version of Roche’s Avastin— Mvasi — is already approved in United States and EU while a biosimilar version of Herceptin, Kanjinti, is under review in the United States and EU. A biosimilar version of Rituxan — ABP 798 — is in late-stage development.Several of Amgen’s own drugs are facing biosimilar competition. Biosimilars are already having a negative impact on key products like Neupogen and Neulasta in the EU. In the United States, while Neupogen is already facing biosimilar competition, other key drugs like Neulasta and Epogen could start facing biosimilar competition this year. The entry of additional biosimilars in the United States will have a negative impact on the company’s top line.

1708,JNJ,"The Dow snapped a record streak of wins to traverse a turbulent week. Trade-war related concerns continued to weigh on investors with President Trump expressing doubts over the success of upcoming negotiations with China. Additionally, the spike in 10-year Treasury yield also spooked markets, sparking off fresh inflationary concerns. Such fears were also stoked by encouraging retail sales numbers.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.4% on last Friday, marking its seventh straight session of gains. This was the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since Nov. 8, 2017. Notably, healthcare stocks were down initially following the news that President Trump unveiled his new healthcare plan.However, the broad market recovered later after the announcement was not followed up by stringent measures. Low inflation data and weak dollar also boosted investors’ confidence in equities.The index gained 2.3% over last week. This was the blue-chip index’s largest weekly gain since March. Energy and tech stocks were major drivers of the U.S. stock markets. Oil prices first rallied on last Wednesday in the wake of United States’ decision to exit the Iran nuclear deal. This increase fueled a rally in energy stocks once again.Meanwhile, Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) shares jumped after celebrity investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report) announced that it had bought 70 million shares of Apple in the first quarter.

1709,JNJ,"GlaxoSmithKline plc’s (GSK  -  Free Report) HIV company, ViiV Healthcare announced that the two late-stage studies testing its two-drug HIV regimen of dolutegravir (Tivicay) and lamivudine (Epivir) met the primary endpoint.The two phase III studies, GEMINI-1 and GEMINI-2, evaluated the two-drug regimen in treatment naïve - those who have not received prior antiviral therapy -  HIV-1 infected adults compared to a three-drug regimen of dolutegravir plus tenofovir alafenamide fumarate and emtricitabine. The studies demonstrated that the dolutegravir and lamivudine regimen was non-inferior to the standard three-drug regimen in HIV control. This means a two-drug HIV regimen can control HIV in treatment-naïve patients as effectively as a three-drug regimen.Shares of Glaxo were up almost 2% on Thursday in response to the positive news. This year so far, Glaxo’s shares have gained 18.2% against the industry’s decline of 4.2%. Shares of Glaxo also received a boost this week as Mylan’s (MYL  -  Free Report) application to get approval for a generic version of Glaxo’s blockbuster respiratory drug, Advair was rejected for the second time by the FDA. Full results from the studies will be presented at a future medical meeting. Regulatory application to get the two-drug regimen of dolutegravir and lamivudine approved are expected to be filed later this year.Glaxo has several phase III studies ongoing evaluating two-drug regimens for HIV-1 treatment. These studies, conducted across global research centers, include approximately 1,400 HIV infected men and women.The two-drug regimens reduce the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen, thereby reducing long-term toxicity concerns.Juluca is Glaxo’s first and the only approved two-drug regimen. It gained approval in EU last month and in the United States in November last year. It generated sales of £10 million in the first quarter of 2018. Glaxo has developed Juluca in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report). Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs — Glaxo’s Tivicay/dolutegravir(50 mg) and J&J’s Edurant/rilpivirine(25 mg) — into a single, once-daily pill for the treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection.ViiV Healthcare is an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo.

1711,JNJ,"With the suspension of the controversial 2.3% medical device tax for another two years, the medical device industry is currently riding high on optimism. AdvaMed, the medical device industry’s lobbying group, which strongly advocated for this relief, noted that the tax repeal will provide a huge impetus to the companies to channelize their turnovers into strategic consolidations, research and developments and also help in creating new job opportunities.According to an article published in Daily News, the tax before going into effect from January 2020 will save the device companies as much as $3.7 billion during the two-year suspension.The U.S. medical device market is undergoing substantial transformation. An aging population, longer expectancy for life, growing healthcare awareness in emerging economies combined with powerful long-term tailwinds, including mergers & acquisitions (M&As) and product innovation, have been contributing to growth of the sector.M&A Boom Continues It is yet to be seen how far the benefits of the tax repeal have been redirected to M&As till now. Meanwhile, according to Mark Bonifacio, President of Bonifacio Consulting Services, private equity and strategic OEM (Original equipment manufacturer) buyers are competing for assets in all sectors of medical contract manufacturing and broadening their portfolios or investing in new technologies.He strongly stated that although the start of 2018 was sluggish with respect to M&As, it was due to uncertainties over changes in the global healthcare market and the fate of Obamacare’s medical device tax. Now that the doubts are gradually getting cleared, the industry is once again heading toward another year of significant M&A activity.This year’s biggest M&A deal seems to be in the cards with the Wall Street Journal’s latest rumored news related to two mammoths of MedTech space, Boston Scientific BSX and Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). The report says that both the rivals may consider a bid for consolidation.The analysts seem to be optimistic about the rumored deal and believe that after the colossal mergers of Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report)-Covidien and Abbott (ABT)-St. Jude Medical in the last couple of years, Boston Scientific also needs to make a mammoth move to maintain its foothold in the highly competitive medical-technology space.Following the company’s $25 billion consolidation with St. Jude Medical in January, Abbott ABT recently closed the $5.3-billion acquisition of Alere. With the successful wrap up of this transaction, the combined company is anticipated to emerge as a leading player in the $7 billion point-of-care diagnostic space.Another mega consolidation in the recent times was that of medical device major, Becton, Dickinson and Co. and medical, surgical, diagnostic, and patient care devices provider C. R. Bard, for $24 billion. After the completion of the deal in January, Becton, Dickinson is on its way to expand to new areas like vascular access segments – PICCs (peripherally inserted central catheters), midlines and drug delivery ports.Baxter International BAX purchased RECOTHROM Thrombin topical and PREVELEAK Surgical Sealant from specialty pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc (MNK  -  Free Report).Varian Medical (VAR  -  Free Report) also inked a major M&A deal. The company recently signed an agreement to acquire Australia-based global life sciences company, Sirtex Medical Limited for a total deal value of $1.28 billion. The investment will strengthen the company’s position in interventional oncology therapies. This apart, in its effort to gain foothold in the emerging economy, the company recently acquired Cooperative CL Enterprises, a leading distributor of radiotherapy equipment in Taiwan.Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary DePuy Synthes inked a deal to acquire Medical Enterprises Distribution in May.This apart, in 2018, Boston Scientific announced several strategic acquisitions including NxThera and nVision in Urology and Pelvic Health, EmCision in Endoscopy, Securus in EP and Millipede in Structural Heart. This inorganic expansion plan bodes well for the stocks’ operational growth.Divestments Medical device majors continue to offload their non-core business lines and assets that are similar to the ones acquired through mergers to focus on the main segments. These divestures have been mandated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and other international anti-trust regulators. This restricts chances of monopoly in the market.Earlier this month, Johnson & Johnson got a $2.7 billion offer from Fortive Corporation to sell its subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc.’s Advanced Sterilization Products business units to Fortive. If JNJ accepts the proposal, it will be a step toward streamlining of its business per its strategic roadmap for better resource utilization and higher shareholders’ return.This apart, according to a MASSDEVICE report, Medtronic recently divested its stake in LifeTech Scientific to China Everbright Ltd. and another unnamed investor. BD also divested its soft tissue core needle biopsy line and Aspira product line to Merit Medical for $100 million. The divestment is related to its acquisition of C.R. Bard.In April, Henry Schein HSIC announced its decision to spin off the company’s major segment global Animal Health business. We believe this initiative remains part of Henry Schein's 2018-2020 Strategic Plans to focus more on dental and medical businesses. According to the company, this transaction will enable it to make the most of the opportunities in the dental space in order to deliver quality clinical care and advanced wellness and prevention.Apprehending that China’s drug distribution reform may slow down the company’s growth in the region (according to a Reuters report), Cardinal Health sold off its China business to Shanghai Pharmaceuticals Holding for $1.2 billion.Following the announcement of its two major buyouts, Abbott divested its eye care business Abbott Medical Optics (AMO) to Johnson & Johnson for about $4.33 billion to streamline its newly added business lines.A marketer of aesthetic treatment systems, Cynosure, sold itself to Hologic. Notably, Hologic acquired all outstanding Cynosure shares for approximately $1.65 billion.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Bright A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December 2017, a Gallup poll revealed that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Per a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Eastern Europe and China showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s emerging markets’ business registered 17% growth in first-quarter 2018, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 23% year over year).Key Picks from the SpaceIn the medical instrument space, we are positive on ABIOMED, Inc. ABMD and Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

1712,JNJ,"This week’s video covers two companies where management has made key decisions for the future of their respective companies; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), and International Paper (IP  -  Free Report).Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has the largest market capitalization for any U.S. healthcare company at just under $330 billion.  The company’s Q1 earnings report beat both top and bottom line expectations with earnings and revenues improving by +12.6% year over year.  Most importantly the Pharma segment, which accounts for almost half of the company’s total revenues had sales improve by +19%. But after the earnings report, the stock price began to fall as worries about increasing competition from generic drugs would negatively impact Pharma sales.  While JNJ has a nice pipeline of new drugs, and high expectations for its cancer and stroke prevention medications the segment was susceptible to encroachment by generic competitors.  To counter this threat, management announced that it has about $50 billion available for acquisitions.  Further, management commented that they were not looking to make one big $50 billion splash, rather they were looking to make many smaller acquisitions.  These acquisitions are expected to bolster its drug pipeline for the next several years. To add to this good news, JNJ recently announced that they accepted Platinum Equity’s $2.1 billion offer to sell the LifeScan business (diabetes treatments).  This deal is expected to close in late 2018.  Moreover, management revealed that Fortive Corp made a $2.8 billion offer to purchase the Advanced Sterilization Products Business, which if accepted would close in early 2019. These proceeds from the sale of these units are expected to go into its acquisition pool, share repurchase program, and to be used for an increased dividend payment.  Currently, JNJ is in a very unique group called Dividend Kings; a company that has increased dividend payments each year for the past 50 consecutive years.  The company has a current annual dividend yield of +2.94%.Price and Earnings Consensus GraphAs you can see in the graph below, the stock price had been on a steady upwards trend since the third quarter 2015.  When the markets peaked in January of 2018, the stock price then fell for the next several months due to generic competition worries.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteMany analysts have stated that JNJ’s current stock price provides a great buying opportunity with plenty of upside growth potential.  This is due to the sale of underperforming assets, its acquisition power, and strong dividend payment.  Overall, the long-term outlook for the company is very strong.International Paper (IP  -  Free Report) has been doing very well for the past several quarters.  In its most recent earnings report the company beat both the Zacks consensus earnings and revenue estimates with earnings growing by +59% while revenues improved by about +2%.  While revenues beat expectations they were not overly impressive. To improve revenues management announced an increase in pricing for all three of the company’s primary products; printing papers, cellulose fibers, and containerboard.  This move is expected to accelerate both cash flows and earnings over the next several quarters.  Further, in the first four months the company has seen box shipments improve by +1.9%.  This indicates that the upswing in pricing has not impacted demand and subsequent sales. The new cash flows are expected to be funneled into a share repurchase initiative and or an increase in the company’s dividend.  Currently, the company has a +3.3% annual dividend yield. The new pricing power has caused analyst estimates to increase for the next two quarters, and for FY 18 & FY 19. As you can see in the table below, this was not a one-time increase in target prices, but estimates have been repeatedly increased over the past 90 days.The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM score of A.  Therefore the near and long-term outlook for the company is very solid.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1713,JNJ,"This week Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) announced an all-cash deal tobuy immuno-oncology biotech, ARMO Biosciences, Inc. . J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Darzalex gained FDA approval for combination use in first-line setting while Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced a couple of regulatory/pipeline updates on its PD-L1 inhibitor, Tecentriq. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) sold rights to a schizophrenia product and its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza gained marketing approval in the EU.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesLilly to Expand Immunotherapy Pipeline with ARMO: Eli Lilly announced a definitive agreement to buy California-based immuno-oncology biotech ARMO BioSciences for $50 per share or approximately $1.6 billion in an all-cash deal. The acquisition will add ARMO's lead product candidate, pegilodecakin to Lilly’s cancer pipeline. Pegilodecakin, a PEGylated IL-10, is being studied in a late-stage study in pancreatic cancer as well as early-stage studies in lung and renal cell cancer, melanoma and other solid tumor types. ARMO BioSciences went public in January this year.Lilly has a well laid out oncology strategy, which involves building on key cancer treatments like Cyramza, Lartruvo and Verzenio as foundational agents while focusing on developing new standard-of-care changing therapies and combination regimens, including immuno-therapies. The ARMO BioSciences acquisition, which adds a promising next generation immunotherapy pipeline asset to Lilly’s portfolio, is in line with this strategy. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018J&J Darzalex Gets FDA Nod in First Line Setting: J&J’s multiple myeloma drug, Darzalexgained FDA approval in first-line setting. With the latest approval, Darzalex can now be prescribed in combination with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) for the treatment ofpatients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. With theapproval in first-line setting expected this year, it is expected that Darzalex saleswill improve further,going forward.J&J also announced data from two phase III studies evaluating its investigational compound esketamine nasal spray in combination with newly initiated oral antidepressant (“NIOD”) in patients with treatment-resistant depression compared to placebo nasal spray and the NIOD. The combination demonstrated a statistically significant, clinically meaningful rapid reduction of depressive symptoms on treatment with flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus NIOD compared to placebo plus NIOD in the study in adults. However, in the study conducted on elderly patients aged 65 and older, though the esketamine arm witnessed clinically meaningful effects compared to the placebo arm, the study narrowly missed statistical significance for its primary efficacy endpoint. The results were presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.AstraZeneca Sells Seroquel Rights to Luye Pharma: AstraZeneca announced an agreement to sell Seroquel and Seroquel XR, a treatment for schizophrenia and bipolar disease, rights in the UK, China and other international markets to Luye Pharma Group. The total consideration is $538 million, which includes upfront payment of $260 million as well as certain future payments to AstraZeneca. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter, is part of the company’s efforts to focus on its three main therapy areas of Oncology, Cardiovascular, Renal & Metabolism and Respiratory.Sales of Seroquel/Seroquel XR have been declining as the drug is facing generic competition since November 2016. In 2017, Seroquel XR recorded sales of $332 million, representing a year-over year decline of 55%.AstraZeneca& Merck’s PARP inhibitor, Lynparza(tablets) gained EUapproval for use as a maintenance therapy in platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer, regardless of patients’ BRCA mutation status. The approval thus expands the eligible patient population for Lynparza. Approval for the same indication in the United States was received in August last year.Roche’s Tecentriq in Focus: Roche’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for label expansion of its PD-L1 inhibitor Tecentriq was granted priority review by the FDA. With the latest application, Roche is looking to get Tecentriq approved in combination with Avastin (bevacizumab) plus carboplatin and paclitaxel for first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The FDA’s decision is expected on Sep 5, 2018.Tecentriq is presently marketed for the treatment of second-line metastatic NSCLC. Label expansion in first-line setting should boost the drug’s sales further. Tecentriq is also approved for the treatment of patients suffering from locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who are not eligible for cisplatin chemotherapy. The drug recorded sales of CHF457 million in 2017.In another news on Tecentriq, Roche announced that a late-stage study evaluating the drug in combination with Cotellic in heavily pre-treated patients with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) did not meet its primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) compared to regorafenib.The NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 1.6% in the last five trading sessions. Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Here is how the seven major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions:All stocks were in the green last week except Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report), which declined 0.6%.

1714,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) shares have soared 91.9% in the past six months, significantly outperforming the industry’s decline of 7.7%. The stock saw a turnaround this year after it fell 13% in 2017.Geron is focused on developing anti-cancer therapies based on telomerase inhibitors. The company’s pipeline consists of only one candidate, imetelstat. It is being developed for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (“MF”) and myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”). Notably, Geron has collaborated with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, for imetelstat.Geron has no approved product in its portfolio and its top line solely comprises license fees and royalties.Currently, Imetelstat is being evaluated for MF in a phase II IMbark study and for MDS in a phase II/III IMerge study.In December 2017, Geron presented preliminary data from part I of phase II/III IMerge study. The data showed that imetelstat achieved RBC transfusion-independence (RBC-TI – reduced or no requirement of RBC transfusion over a certain interval) in 54% of the patient population, which have not received prior treatment with either lenalidomide or a hypomethylating agent, for at least 8 weeks.Moreover, Geron expanded the Part I of IMerge and enrolled 20 additional patients in a refined MDS population to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier. The FDA granted fast track designation to imetelstat based on data from part 1 of IMerge in October 2017.Meanwhile, the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed during the third internal review in March 2018 supported continuation of the phase II IMbark study without modifications. However, J&J is planning to amend the protocol of the study to allow long-term treatment of patients.Investors are solely banking on the continuation and success of these two studies. Geron’s price has started rallying before J&J’s earnings release next week in anticipation of positive updates on imetelstat.Geron Corporation Price  Geron Corporation Price | Geron Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksGeron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc.

1715,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry within the pharmaceutical division that accounts for almost half of its revenues. The company has several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology; oncology; pulmonary hypertension; and infectious diseases/vaccines. However, several products in this segment are facing generic competition.J&J’s stock has depreciated 6.1% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with a decline of 1.7% recorded by the industry.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales witnessed a positive trend in the second half of 2017 after being soft in the first half of the year. We are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in first-quarter results.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical segment is $9.51 billion. Last quarter, the segment’s sales beat the consensus estimate.We believe that new products, continued share gains of some key products, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex, and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech Actelion that J&J bought in June, will support the top line.Continued share gains should drive sales of Imbruvica (cancer indications), Xarelto (blood thinner), Zytiga (prostate cancer) and Stelara (psoriasis). Meanwhile, strong adoption for the newer indication of Crohn's disease should continue contributing to Stelara growth. J&J also gained FDA approval for Zytiga in first-line setting in February, which can drive sales of the drug higher in the first quarter. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Also, strong adoption in outside U.S. markets and accelerated adoption in the United States across all lines of therapy should drive sales of Darzalex. These positives will likely offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting. Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to continue hurting key arthritis drug Remicade’s sales outside the United States. J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said at the fourth-quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been decent. The drug recorded sales of $47 million in the last quarter, which are expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Also, J&J should discuss the initial sales uptake of Juluca at the call — the first dual treatment for HIV developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) — that gained FDA approval in last November. Juluca is under review in the EU.Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss commercialization plans for Erleada, its newly approved prostate cancer drug, at the first-quarter conference call.Overall, in2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve.

1717,JNJ,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday without team USA for the first time since 1986, which is a huge disappointment for first time broadcast partner Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). But American soccer fans woke up Wednesday to news that North America won the rights to host the 2026 World Cup, beating out Morocco. Here is everything you need to know about the bid, its economic impact, and what companies stand to benefit. Hint: Fox is already celebrating.North America FIFA announced, in a 134 to 65 vote, to award the 2026 World Cup to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico’s joint bid. The reasons here are pretty simple: money. North America is expected generate $14 billion in revenue and $11 billion in profits for FIFA, which is huge for an organization that makes 90% of its money from the World Cup—Morocco reportedly couldn’t offer half of that figure. Soccer’s largest governing body was also under pressure after awarding the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to more controversial hosts, Russia and Qatar.The North American bid included 23 host city candidates, including three from Canada, three from Mexico, with the rest spread out throughout the U.S. Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York/New Jersey are the three cities vying for the rights to host the final.Under the current plan, the U.S. is set to host 60 matches, with Canada and Mexico each set to hold 10. If that number seems a little off to some soccer fans, it’s because the 2026 World Cup will see the world’s biggest sporting event expand its field for the first time to 48 teams up from 32, for a total of 80 matches—up from 64 under the current format.The North American bid noted that it expects the top six games, which would mean the opening games in all three countries, along with the two semifinals, and the final, to compare favorably to Super Bowl ticket sales as well as overall hospitality figures. The committee projects the overall economic impact will be roughly $5 billion, with $5.8 billion worth of ticket sales expected.Companies The clear winner of the 2026 World Cup bid is Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two broadcast powers won the U.S. television rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments for roughly $1 billion combined back in 2011. Then, somewhat quietly in 2015, FIFA awarded Fox and Telemundo the rights to the 2026 World Cup without opening up the bidding. The move sparked outrage from ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and other networks..@FOXSports President and COO Eric Shanks on North America winning the bid for #WorldCup 2026: ""It's a tremendous day, a lot of hard has paid off."" https://t.co/nbcpI3ZFCB pic.twitter.com/ysVfKbOTrR— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) June 13, 2018Fox reportedly only paid 10% more than in its current $425 million contract. On its face, this was a somewhat crazy move because Fox had not even broadcast its first World Cup game at the time, and no one knew what country would host the 2026 tournament. Diving a little deeper, the answer is somewhat clear. FIFA didn’t want any legal trouble from Fox, since, in a shocking move, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be hosted in the fall or winter due to heat concerns, which directly conflicts with the NFL season and other programming.Fox and Telemundo now own the rights to the world’s biggest sporting event on home soil. And this means live games in primetime, which is a trully amazing opportunity that likely has Fox, Telemundo, and FIFA’s marketing partners giddy. In a media landscape driven more and more by the Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) of the world, a month of adverting live in primetime is almost invaluable. Current FIFA and World Cup sponsors, which spend upwards of $50 million a year, include Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY and more. With that said, major U.S.-based companies now have even more incentive to get in on the World Cup.Aside from big opportunities for staples like Nike NKE, it could be a chance for Under Armour UAA to break into the World Cup scene via a team-based sponsorship, while everyone from YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report) to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other tech companies could work their way in somehow. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and other giants are current official sponsors of U.S. Soccer. Bottom Line Soccer has been the supposed sport of the future in the U.S. since it hosted the 1994 World Cup. Today, the world’s most popular sport sits just behind baseball and basketball as Americans’ favorite sport, according to a Gallup poll (basketball was favored by 11%, with baseball at 9%).Meanwhile, soccer jumped up to 7%—its highest spot ever on the annual poll. And a lot can change in eight years, especially as money pours into the MLS and the NFL’s ratings decline.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1718,JNJ,"VIVUS Inc. (VVUS  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 10 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, wider than a loss of 1 cent reported in the year-ago period but narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 11 cents.Quarterly revenues plunged 55.9% from the year-ago period to $11.9 million mainly due to lower product sales. Moreover, the company did not record any license and milestone payment in this quarter compared to a one-time payment of $5 million in the year-ago period.VIVUS’ marketed drugs have not been performing well with steady decline in sales.

VIVUS will have to pay Janssen $135 million upon closing of the deal. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter.Pancreaze, delayed release capsule, was approved in 2010 for EPI, the inability to properly digest food due to a lack of digestive enzymes made by the pancreas owing to cystic fibrosis or other conditions. In the press release, the company stated that Pancreaze's cash flow is positive, which is expected to boost VIVUS’ revenues.Debt RestructuringVIVUS entered into an agreement with Athyrium Capital Management for a new line of credit of $120 million through issuance of Senior Secured Note. The notes will bear an interest of 10.375% for a period of three years. It will be interest free after that period. These notes will be issued after successful completion of PACREAZE acquisition.Concurrently, VIVUS will repurchase Athyrium’s Convertible Notes of $60 million face value issued earlier, which is due in May 2020, at a discount or on par.2018 ObjectivesVIVUS remains focused on improving Qsymia and Stendra’s sales through innovative strategies and expansion into new geographies.The company is on track to file an investigational new drug application for tacrolimus to develop it for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

1719,JNJ,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 loss of $1.22 per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.29 and the year-ago loss of $1.27.Total revenues in the quarter surged 169.5% year over year to $8.3 million. This upside can mainly be attributed to amortization of the upfront fees related to a global development and commercialization agreement with Janssen, subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), for TD-1473. Moreover, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.74 million.Theravance shares were up 3.4% on May 8, following the earnings release. However, shares have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 12.6% compared with the industry’s 2.9% decrease.Quarterly DetailsVibativ generated U.S. revenues of $3.7 million in the first quarter, up 20.6% from the year-ago period. Revenues from collaborations were $4.6 million compared with $37,000 in the year-earlier quarter.Research and development expenses were $47.8 million, up 21.4% from the year-ago period while selling, general & administrative expenses rose 44.6% to $24.7 million. The increase in expenses was due to higher employee-related costs and stock-based compensation.Pipeline and Other UpdatesIn February 2018, Theravance entered into a global collaboration agreement with Janssen to jointly develop and commercialize its pan-Janus kinase inhibitor, TD-1473, for the treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases.  A phase II study and a phase IIb/III study are likely to be initiated in the second half of 2018 to evaluate TD-1473 in Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, respectively.In January, Theravance along with partner Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the new drug application (""NDA"") for pipeline candidate, revefenacin (TD-4208), has been accepted by the FDA for treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A response from the regulatory body is expected on Nov 13, 2018. The company is preparing for the commercial launch of the drug upon potential approval.The company’s collaboration partner Alfasigma for velusetrag (TD-5108) opted-in to acquire rights to the candidate. Per the opt-in decision, global rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize velusetrag will be transferred to Alfasigma for $10 million upfront fees and future milestone payments and royalties. Theravance has decided not to pursue further development of velusetrag as part of its pipeline strategy.2018 Outlook ReiteratedTheravance continues to expect operating loss, excluding non-cash share-based compensation, for 2018 in the range of $180-$200 million.Theravance Biopharma, Inc.

1720,JNJ,"First-quarter results of pharma bigwigs like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) stole the limelight this week. Other than that, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the second indication of its CAR-T therapy, Kymriah. While AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) submitted a regulatory application in the EU for its psoriasis candidate, risankizumab, Merck’s PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda gained FDA’s Priority Review status for yet another label expansion application.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesMixed Q1 Results for Merck & Pfizer: Both the pharma giants beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. While Pfizer re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018, Merck raised its outlook for both earnings and sales. Both the companies witnessed a relatively weaker top-line performance in the quarter.For Merck, strong sales of Keytruda, Gardasil and Bridion were partially offset by lower sales of other key therapies – RotaTeq, Zepatier and Zostavax. Meanwhile, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.While for Pfizer, the top-line was hurt by decline in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and Pristiq and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.Allergan beat estimates for both earnings and revenues in the first quarter of 2018 and raised its 2018 guidance for both earnings and sales.Novartis’ Kymriah Gets FDA Approval for Second Indication: Novartis’ supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get its CAR-T therapy Kymriah approved for the second indication was granted approval by the FDA. With the latest approval, Kymriah suspension has been approved for intravenous infusion for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), high grade B-cell lymphoma and DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma.Kymriah was the first CAR-T therapy to obtain FDA approval in August 2017 for the treatment of patients up to 25 years of age with B-cell precursor ALL that is refractory or in second or later relapse.Separately, Novartis announced that the FDA has given a complete response letter to its BLA for its proposed biosimilar version of Roche’s cancer drug, Rituxan.Merck’s Keytruda in News: Merck’s supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) looking to get overall survival data from the phase III KEYNOTE-189 study included on the label of the PD-L1 inhibitor, Keytruda was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA will give its decision on Sep 23, 2018.The study evaluated Keytruda, in combination with Lilly’s Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The combination treatment improved overall survival regardless of PD-L1 expression including in patients whose tumors tested negative for PD-L1.Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 study. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy, which should support uptake and sales.Merck also announced interim data from another pivotal lung cancer study on Keytruda, which met a pre-specified secondary endpoint of overall response rate (ORR) in an early cohort of participants. The phase 3 KEYNOTE-407 study evaluated Keytruda in combination with carboplatin-paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel for the first-line treatment of metastatic squamous NSCLC.AbbVie Submits Application for Psoriasis Candidate in EU: AbbVie submitted a marketing application to the European regulatory authorities for investigational interleukin-23 (IL-23) inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) is supported by data from four pivotal phase III studies. Data from these studies have shown that more than half of the patients receiving risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance at one year.Meanwhile, AbbVie also announced commencement of a self-tender offer for up to $7.5 billion of its common stock at a price not less than $99.00 per share and not more than $114.00 per share.United Therapeutics to Acquire SteadyMed: United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) announced a definitive merger agreement with SteadyMed Ltd. per which United Therapeutics will acquire the latter for $216 million including contingent payments. With the deal, United Therapeutics will add SteadyMed’s drug device pipeline product, Trevyent for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients to its portfolio. The product could have posed competition to United Therapeutics’ RemoSynch implantable pump, which is under review in the United States.Trevyent is a single-use, pre-filled pump that has been developed by SteadyMed to deliver a two-day supply of treprostinil subcutaneously using SteadyMed’s PatchPump technology to treat PAH. Though SteadyMed received a refuse-to-file letter from the FDA for want of further information, SteadyMed intends to resubmit its NDA by the end of 2018.Allergan’s Ubrogepant Succeeds in 2nd Phase III Study: Allergan announced that the second of two pivotal phase III studies evaluating its oral anti-CGRP acute migraine treatment ubrogepant met its co-primary endpoints. The phase III data showed ubrogepant displaying strong efficacy and a clean side effect profile.The ACHIEVE II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of orally administered ubrogepant (25 mg and 50 mg) for treating a single migraine attack of moderate-to-severe headache intensity.The study data demonstrated that a “significant greater percentage of patients” treated with ubrogepant, at both the doses, were free from pain at two hours after the initial dose as compared to those treated with placebo. Also, a statistically significant greater percentage of ubrogepant patients taking the 50 mg dose experienced absence of the “most bothersome migraine-associated symptom” -- either photophobia, phonophobia or nausea -- at two hours after the initial dose compared to those treated with placebo. However, the 25 mg dose failed to demonstrate statistical significance in this endpoint.J&J Seeks Label Expansion of PAH Drug: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Actelion submitted a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA seeking approval for a label expansion of its PAH drug, Opsumit (macitentan) to include treatment of patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH).Also, J&J announced a definitive agreement to acquire private biotech, BeneVir Biopharm.

Moreover, rising healthcare costs are pushing as many as 100 million people into poverty. The organization wants to bring another 1 billion people under healthcare coverage globally by 2023.In a bid to accomplish WHO’s goal, many philanthropic activities are carried out by several trusts and foundations all over the globe. Given the increase in population and incidence of diseases along with growing awareness and healthcare coverage initiatives, the drug sector is expected to grow.

1722,JNJ,"Biotech major Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval to include the positive overall survival data in multiple myeloma from the late-stage ASPIRE study in Kyprolis label.Final data from the phase III ASPIRE study presented in July last year showed that a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis significantly improved overall survival (OS) in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.Overall survival data from the study showed that patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma lived 7.9 months longer when treated with Kyprolis plus Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd ) compared to those treated with Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd) (median OS of 48.3 months for KRd versus median OS of 40.4 months for Rd). The data also showed that KRd reduced the risk of death by 21% compared to Rd.While Kyprolis, a proteasome inhibitor, is already approved for use in combination with Revlimid and dexamethasone for patients with relapsed multiple myeloma, the overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales.Amgen’s shares have gained 6.2% so far this year against the 6.8% decrease registered by the industry.A similar application is also under review in the EU. In April, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) granted a positive opinion recommending inclusion of the OS data from the ASPIRE study in the label of Kyprolis.In early 2018, Amgen gained FDA approval to include overall survival data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on the label of KyprolisWith the approval to include OS results from ASPIRE study, Kyprolis label now includes OS data from two phase III studies which should drive sales of the drug in future quarters.Kyprolis has become a key revenue driver for Amgen. The drug recorded sales of $222 million in the first quarter of 2018, representing growth of 17% year over year, driven by increased demand and a robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Kyprolis represents significant commercial potential. Sales are likely to be driven by launch in additional countries, expansion into additional indications and a longer duration of treatment.Amgen also has a collaboration with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked biotech stock is BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.BioMarin’s earnings per share estimates increased 47.7% for 2018 and 20.0% for 2019 in the last 60 days.

1723,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings per share of 77 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 74 cents by 4.1%. Earnings rose 12% year over year as lower tax rates and share count, due to aggressive share repurchases in the quarter, made up for a weaker sales performance and higher R&D costs.The pharma heavyweight recorded revenues of $12.91 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion. Revenues however rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis due to positive impact of currency changes. Currency movement benefited Pfizer’s first-quarter revenues by 3%. However, on an operational basis, excluding the impact of currency, revenues declined 2% year over year.International revenues rose 8% (up 1% an operational basis) to $6.63 billion. U.S. revenues declined 5% to $6.28 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 6% on a reported basis (up 3% an operational basis) from the year-ago period to $7.83 billion.While Ibrance and Eliquis did well in the quarter, IH segment revenues were hurt by lower sales of Enbrel, Lyrica and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13. Meanwhile, unfavorable customer buying patterns somewhat hurt sales of Ibrance, Xeljanz and certain other products.Ibrance revenues rose 35% to $933 million in the quarter. Xeljanz sales rose 29% to $326 million. Lyrica sales declined 1% to $1.13 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 30% to $765 million. Chantix sales rose 3% to $251 million in the quarter.Revenues from blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $159 million in the quarter compared with $168 million in the previous quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel.Enbrel revenues declined 21% to $506 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 3% to $1.38 billion as higher international sales made up for the decline in the United States. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 12% in the United States due to lower government purchases than last year for the pediatric indication and continued decline in revenues for the adult indication. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 16% in international markets.Revenues from the Consumer Healthcare segment, which Pfizer is considering selling, rose 4% to $905 million. Global Oncology revenues increased 23% to $1.7 billion. Global Vaccine revenues declined 3% to $1.46 billion. Internal Medicine declined 3% to $2.35 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 5% to $869 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease rose 2% to $549 million.Pfizer EH segment sales declined 5% (down 9% operationally) to $5.08 billion.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe and lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages. Viagra sales declined 46% to $187 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017.However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter. Biosimilars revenues rose 53% operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 12% operationally.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $55 million in the United States and $145 million globally, other biosimilars brought in sales of $29 million (down 5%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 3% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.29 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 1% to $1.74 billion.In the quarter, Pfizer bought back shares worth $6.1 billion, including $2.1 billion of open-market share repurchases and $4.0 billion in accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2018.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.90 - $3.00. At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% while revenues are expected to increase 4%.Research and development expenses are likely to be in the range of $7.4–$7.9 billion while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$15.0 billion.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 17% in 2018, 300 basis points less than 20% in 2017 due to expected advantage from U.S. tax reform.Our TakePfizer’s first-quarter results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for revenues. Meanwhile, it re-affirmed its previously issued guidance for 2018.Shares of Pfizer fell around 2.2% in pre-market trading on lower-than-expected sales in the quarter. The top-line was hurt by declines in sales of key drugs like Lyrica, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13, and Enbrel. Also, loss of exclusivity for some products like Viagra and continued supply shortages in legacy Hospira products hurt revenues.This year so far, Pfizer’s shares have increased 2%, against a decrease of 3.1% for the industry.Pfizer faces top-line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition. However, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks will help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer looks well poised to record profit growth in 2018.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1724,JNJ,"Designed to provide broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market, the Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR  -  Free Report) is a smart beta exchange traded fund launched on 09/12/2016.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?Products that are based on market cap weighted indexes, which are strategies designed to reflect a specific market segment or the market as a whole, have traditionally dominated the ETF industry.Market cap weighted indexes work great for investors who believe in market efficiency. They provide a low-cost, convenient and transparent way of replicating market returns.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.Non-cap weighted indexes try to choose stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, which is based on specific fundamental characteristics, or a mix of other such characteristics.Even though this space provides many choices to investors--think one of the simplest methodologies like equal-weighting and more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting--not all have been able to deliver first-rate results.Fund Sponsor & IndexThe fund is sponsored by Fidelity. It has amassed assets over $287.93 M, making it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, this particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates.The Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates reflects the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends and have a positive correlation of returns to increasing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields.Cost & Other ExpensesCost is an important factor in selecting the right ETF, and cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive cousins if all other fundamentals are the same.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.29% for FDRR, making it on par with most peer products in the space.The fund has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.01%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.69% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Johnson + Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).FDRR's top 10 holdings account for about 25.02% of its total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has lost about -0.92%, and is up about 11.03% in the last one year (as of 04/28/2018). FDRR has traded between $27.57 and $32.66 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.96 and standard deviation of 11.99% for the trailing three-year period. With about 123 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1725,JNJ,"The healthcare industry is entering a period of significant changes. Software and new technologies are gradually beginning to revolutionize the industry.Drug/biotech companies constantly strive to bring differentiated and high-quality medicines, vaccines and consumer healthcare products to as many people as possible.To bring a successful drug on the market, these companies spend millions of dollars and several years in research and development (R&D) activities. However, many candidates fail in studies and never reach patients. Biotech, medical research and drug discovery involve significant expenditure. It is thus very important for the research landscape to change.Major advances in science and technology are transforming the way scientists conduct research on diseases and are likely to improve diagnosis and treatment in the future.Here we discuss three emerging technologies, which the pharma/biotech industry has started adopting, albeit slowly. These are poised to transform the sector by saving both time and cost.Artificial Intelligence & Machine LearningArtificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.Drug/biotech companies are analyzing the huge amount of data in their database by applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to identify patterns in ways that humans cannot. Artificial intelligence driven solutions are enabling pharma/biotech companies to identify the appropriate patient population, reduce or eliminate the need for some studies, and in some cases even predict outcomes in a virtual patient.Several collaborations have been formed in the past couple of years between big pharma/biotech players and AI-driven companies, primarily startups to discover novel biological targets and molecules for pharma players using AI. For example, last year, Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) collaborated with two external companies - Exscientia, a UK specialist in machine-learning and Insilico Medicine, a U.S. leader in AI-led drug discovery - to harness AI.Also, last year, Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) pharma arm, Genentech formed a research partnership with GNS Healthcare to power cancer drug development with the latter’s REFS causal machine learning and simulation AI platform. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) also collaborated with Boston-based BERG last year to use artificial intelligence for discovering novel targets and therapeutics to treat neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease.J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) have collaborations with IBM’s (IBM  -  Free Report) Watson Health unit to leverage the latter’s AI solutions and applications for drug discovery and accelerate primarily cancer research efforts of these companies.Pfizer, J&J, Glaxo carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  Artificial intelligence has been touted as the next big emerging technology in the biotech industry as it can drastically reduce the time and cost it takes to develop new life-saving drugs.A significant amount of time is invested in identifying a potential disease target and testing whether a drug candidate can hit that target. With the use of AI, it is estimated that the drug design timeframe can be cut down from 4-5 years to one year while also drastically reducing the costs.Though AI is in the relatively early stages of being used in biotech for drug discovery and other purposes, a broad-scale adoption is expected by 2025.3D Bio-PrintingThree dimensional printing or 3D printing is a prototyping technology by which different materials are fused under computer control to create a three-dimensional object. Add biology/cells to the process and it becomes a new technique – 3D bioprinting. These printers are used to manufacture human tissues/muscles as well as organs and bones that can be implanted into living humans.3D printing technology, also known as additive manufacturing, is leading to major innovations in medicine manufacturing, particularly personalized medicines. Compared to conventional manufacturing systems, 3D bioprinters offer benefits like high production rates, better precision and accuracy and reduces material wastage, which can save costs.Though still new to pharmaceutical drug research and development, 3D printing has been in use in the medical devices sector for many years and is mainly used to make dental implants and custom prosthetics.The first 3D printed prescription drug, Spritam, to treat epilepsy was approved by the FDA in 2015 and launched in the United States in 2016. It was made by private company Aprecia Pharmaceuticals using its Zip Dose technology.It is expected that 3D printing has great potential to revolutionize the field of drug manufacturing. It could be used for printing drug tablets with a personalized dosage, drugs with different release rates and for printing living tissue. In 2016, Texas-based Nano3D BioSciences developed a novel assay for vasoactivity using its core 3D cell culture platform, magnetic 3D bioprinting in partnership with AstraZeneca.Glaxo is working on a project to decide if it should invest in 3D printing of drugs.Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) Internet of Medical Things brings together medical devices and applications and technology that procure vital data in real time. Chronic diseases, which require frequent monitoring, can be tracked effectively so that patients receive timely and proper treatment. Wearable devices like Apple Watch, Fitbit and Samsung S Health help users achieve their fitness and health targets.It could well be the future of healthcare as pharma and medical device companies look to innovate and keep up with technology to help patients and physicians better monitor and track diseases.According to a report by Allied Market Research, the IoT healthcare market will reach $136 billion worldwide by 2021, registering CAGR of 12.5% over 2015-2021.  This is because it has the potential to transform the healthcare industry in terms of delivery, affordability, and reliability.Pharma and tech companies are now taking things a step further and collaborating to make devices that can track chronic and lifestyle associated diseases like diabetes, which are becoming rampant.In fact, the scope for innovation in this area — contact lenses that can detect glucose levels, devices that monitor caloric intake, bioelectronic medicines that may treat a wide range of chronic diseases, robotic-assisted surgery — is seemingly endless.ConclusionWhile the healthcare space is growing by leaps and bounds with these emerging technologies, mounting concerns around privacy, data protection and governance prevail. Also, many of the AI and 3D bioprinting research companies overestimate their achievements, something that drug/biotech companies should be wary of. Nonetheless, these nascent technologies hold ample promise and their proper execution will definitely prove to be a trump card for the space.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1726,JNJ,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) and Hungary-based partner Gedeon Richter Plc. have announced positive top-line results from the third pivotal study, evaluating the companies’ schizophrenia drug Vraylar (cariprazine) for an expanded indication. Both entities are looking to get Vraylar approved for the treatment of adults with major depressive episodes related to bipolar I disorder.Notably, Vraylar is already approved in the United States and the EU for the acute therapy of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as for schizophrenia. Additionally, the FDA approved the drug in November 2017 for an expanded use as a maintenance therapy for treatment of schizophrenia.Shares of Allergan have inched up 0.7% this year so far against the industry’s decrease of 5.9%. The phase III (RGH-MD-53) study was investigating two doses of Vraylar (1.5 mg and 3 mg) in 493 adult patients with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression) compared with placebo. The study met its primary as well as secondary endpoints.Though Vraylar’s 1.5 mg dosage showed a significantly greater improvement than placebo on the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) from baseline to week 6, the 3 mg dose failed to reach statistical significance. However, the drug was generally well-tolerated in the trial. We also note that around 5% of the total patients, under Vraylar treatment, discontinued the trial due to adverse events in comparison to 3% treated with placebo.We remind investors that last December, Allergan and Gedeon produced positive top-line results from the second pivotal phase III (RGH-MD-54) program, examining Vraylar for treatment of bipolar I depression. This study also met its primary endpoint.Based on the above reported data, the company is planning to submit regulatory applications to the FDA in the second half of 2018.Allergan has a licensing agreement with Gideon Richter, a Hungarian multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, to co-develop and market Vraylar in the United States as well as Canada.The schizophrenia drug performed well in 2017, recording sales of $287.8 million compared with $94.3 million in 2016. It is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top line in 2018.Per National Alliance of Mental Illness, bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental diseases and the third most frequent cause of hospitalization in the United States for both youth and adults aged between 18 and 44 years. Moreover, 2.6% of adults in the country are affected with bipolar disorder. Hence, approval of the drug for the expanded indication will provide the company with access to a wider patient population base suffering bipolar issues.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market include AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc's (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.Allergan plc Price Allergan plc Price | Allergan plc Quote Zacks RankAllergan carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1727,JNJ,"AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its diabetes drug, Bydureon (exenatide extended-release) for injectable suspension, as an adjunctive to basal insulin. The approval allows the use of the drug as add-on therapy to basal insulin for treating type II diabetes (T2D) in patients receiving one or more antidiabetic medicines in addition to diet and exercise and with inadequate glycemic control.The drug was originally approved in 2012 for the treatment of T2D. In October 2017, the FDA approved the extended release version – Bydureon BCise – in patients with uncontrolled diabetes treated with other oral agents.AstraZeneca’s shares have returned 1.5% so far this year, against the industry’s decline of 4.3%.The approval was based on data from the DURATION-7 study, which evaluated Bydureon as an add-on therapy to insulin glargine, with or without metformin. The drug achieved a mean reduction of 0.9% in HbA1c levels compared to 0.2% for placebo, in patients with a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.5%.Moreover, 32.5% of the patients in the Bydureon arm reached an HbA1c level of less than 7% against 7% of patients in the placebo arm.However, Bydureon competes with several other diabetes drugs including Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Invokamet XR, which has achieved better effectiveness in reducing HbA1c levels in clinical studies.In a separate press release, AstraZeneca announced that the FDA has granted priority review to the regulatory application seeking approval of anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin candidate, moxetumomab pasudotox. A biologics license application (“BLA”) was submitted by the company, seeking approval of the candidate for the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia (“HCL”) in adult patients in second or later-line setting. A decision from the FDA is expected in the third quarter of 2018.The BLA was submitted based on data from a phase III study, evaluating moxetumomab pasudotox in patients with relapsed or refractory HCL. Data showed that the candidate met the primary endpoint of durable complete response in the study.In another press release, AstraZeneca along with partner Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that the European Medicines Agency has accepted the marketing authorization application (“MAA”) for its PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, seeking approval in metastatic breast cancer. The drug is already approved for treating ovarian cancer in EU.The MAA includes data from the phase OlympiAD study, which evaluated Lynparza against chemotherapy in patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer, harboring germline BRCA mutations.The drug achieved significant improvement in progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy (7.0 vs 4.2 months). Lynparza also reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 42%.The MAA is likely to get approval from the EMA as the FDA has already approved Lynparza in a similar indication in January 2018 based on OlympiAD study data.An approval will certainly boost the prospect of the drug and give it an advantage over other drugs in the PARP inhibitor segment in both the United States and EU. Other PARP inhibitors include Clovis Oncology, Inc.’s (CLVS  -  Free Report) Rubraca and TESARO’s Zejula, which are approved only for ovarian cancer. Both the drugs are also being developed for the breast cancer indication.AstraZeneca PLC Price  AstraZeneca PLC Price | AstraZeneca PLC QuoteZacks RankAstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1728,JNJ,"Shire plc’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) shares have been rallying since Japan-based Takeda Pharmaceutical announced its takeover intentions. Shire’s stock has gained almost 16% since closing on Mar 27.In the press release issued by Takeda, it has confirmed that it is considering a possible offer to buy out Shire to boost its core therapeutic areas. The acquisition will also help Takeda to have greater presence in the United States. However, there is no certainty that Takeda will make an offer, which needs to be confirmed by no later than Apr 25, 2018.Shire’s shares have lost 3.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 0.7% in that period.Investors are speculating a bidding war following Takeda’s announcement. Previously, several companies have been rumored to acquire Shire including Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report).Shire has a strong hold in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) market, a major revenue generator for the company. The company has three drugs in its ADHD portfolio. However, the company faces competition as a result of the presence of generics of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Concerta, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Ritalin LA, and Adderall XR. Moreover, sales of Shire’s ulcerative colitis drug, Lialda, are also falling due to generic competition.Meanwhile, Shire is also looking for strategic alternatives for its neuroscience franchise, which includes the ADHD portfolio of drugs.Hence, Shire may consider the offer, as and when made by Takeda. It will likely create a company with sales to the tune of $30 billion.However, many analysts are skeptical about the impact of the deal on Takeda’s finances as both the companies have similar market cap. Also, there remains a concern about the benefit of adding Shire’s haemophilia portfolio to Takeda’s product line.Investors are likely to remain focused on any further announcements made by Takeda.Shire plc Price  Shire plc Price | Shire plc QuoteZacks RankShire currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1729,JNJ,"U.S. equity markets are going through a rough patch. There is a lot of uncertainty around trade negotiations and recent concerns around Facebook’s data breach are weighing on the tech sector. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing (read: Stocks and ETFs with Juicy Dividend Yields).What’s Bothering the Markets?Tech’s FreefallA day after recording massive gains on talks of negotiations between China and the United States relating to trade, the markets suffered huge losses led by tech stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.4%. Moreover, Standard & Poor's 500 fell 1.7% and the technology heavy Nasdaq slid 2.9%, as investors flocked to safety.Social media companies were the major losers, as the recent data debacle introduced fresh concerns around the activities of sector participants. Twitter Inc (TWTR  -  Free Report) slumped 12% at the end of trading on Mar 27, as Citron Research said it is shorting the stock owing to the company’s reliance on licensing user data. Moreover, Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) slumped a further 4.9% as Mark Zuckerberg prepares to testify in front of Congress.Facebook has been falling, following a report that data mining firm Cambridge Analytica, the firm that worked for President Trump’s campaign, unethically obtained data from around 50 million Facebook users without their permission. ""While this will not be a pleasant experience for Zuckerberg and his team going in front of Congress, it is a necessary smart strategic step for Facebook to head to the Beltway as the public fury continues to grow around the Cambridge data leak,"" per a CNBC article citing Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights.Trade Uncertainty and GeopoliticsAlthough tensions between Washington and Beijing are easing, with signs of negotiations between China and the United States relating to trade, it will be naive to sit back, relax and hope that the negotiations won’t have a major impact on the global financial markets. Owing to the recent volatility in the markets, allocating a portion of your portfolio to safe dividend funds seems like an appealing option (read: ETFs to Buy as Trade War Fears Abate).Moreover, investors expect the United States to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, after John Bolton was appointed as national security adviser. This could bring back sanctions on Iran and weigh on its capability to export crude oil to the market. As a result, rising geopolitical risks might increase the appeal of dividend investing.  In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increased returns when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund QDFThis fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends, while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

1732,JNJ,"“At some point in every person's life, you will need an assisted medical device … as you age and you have a hip replacement or a knee replacement or a pacemaker.”In the current context, nothing appears to be more apt than this remark made by Aimee Mullins (an American athlete). Considering the growing prominence of the orthopedics industry, it seems that the ''prosthetic generation is indeed all around us!''Per a new market intelligence report by BIS Research published by CISION, the global orthopedics devices market was worth $40.20 billion in 2016. It is estimated to be worth $61.02 billion by the end of 2023, at a CAGR of 6.1% with joint reconstruction and replacement devices segment being the highest revenue generator.In 2015, North America (51.4%) had the highest share in the orthopedics devices market and is expected to lead the same through 2024. Encouragingly, Asia Pacific is also estimated to catch up with a CAGR of 8.6% through 2024 in the niche space (per a Grand View Research report published by Becker's Healthcare).Thus, for investors who are keen on placing a bet on the healthcare space for long-term gains, the orthopedics market undoubtedly holds immense potential.Here, we take a look at five major factors that have been driving  the global orthopedic industry in the last couple of years.Major Market MoversAgeing PopulaceOne of the major factors driving the orthopedic market is aging population. Per a WHO report published by Global Market Insights, the population above 60 is expected to be 2 billion globally by 2050.Poor Life StylePoor eating habits, smoking, drinking and lack of physical activity will also drive demand for orthopedics market. Rising healthcare expenditures, unhealthy lifestyle practices along with expanded treatment options have been driving demand. Per a report by Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published by Advisory Board, U.S. healthcare spending is projected to rise to around $5.5 trillion by 2025, representing 19.9% of GDP (based on the assumption that the Affordable Care Act will continue through 2025).Rising Incidence of DiabetesDiabetes and obesity will also fuel growth of this market. Globally, the diabetes market is expected to touch $66,053.1 million, at a CAGR of 6.7% between 2016 and 2025 (per a Transparency Market Research report).Positive Tidings on the Regulatory FrontThe orthopedic market is riding high on recent FDA nods and product launches. Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (ZBH  -  Free Report)  reached a new milestone in the field of total shoulder arthroplasty with the recent FDA approval for its SidusStem-Free Shoulder system. Furthermore, the company launched the Vitality+ and Vital Spinal Fixation Systems in the United States, along with the global launch of Persona Partial Knee System.NuVasive, Inc. (NUVA  -  Free Report) announced the receipt of FDA clearance for the company's PRECICE system from NuVasive Specialized Orthopedics (NSO). Further, Smith & Nephew (SNN  -  Free Report) announced the full commercial release of bi-cruciate retaining JOURNEY II XR total knee arthroplasty (“TKA”) in the United States and Japan recently.Robotic Surgery Boosting OrthopedicsMedical technology companies are trying to expand through robots rather than complex surgeries. Per a report by Technavio, the global orthopedic surgical robots market is estimated to witness CAGR of around 47% by 2021. In view of the abovementioned factor, a number of bigwigs are spending a lump sum on R&D to continuously innovate and develop devices with improved efficacy and no side effects.In this regard, one of the most noteworthy is Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report). Mako is Stryker’s robotic-arm assisted surgery platform. Recently, Stryker launched the robotic-arm assisted total knee arthroplasty application for use with its Mako System.Medical device major Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Orthotaxy. This is a privately-held developer of software-enabled surgery technologies, including a differentiated robotic-assisted surgery solution.3D Printing in ActionAnother technology which orthopedic device companies are trying to leverage is 3D printing. Per a report by Future Market Insights published by CISION, orthopedic implants in the application category of the global 3D printed medical devices market are expected to be worth $970 million in the 2017-2027 time frame at a CAGR of 19.2%. In this regard, Stryker’s Tritanium TL Curved Posterior Lumbar Cage is a 3D-printed interbody fusion cage intended for use as an aid in lumbar fixation. This device recently won FDA nod.3 Stocks in FocusWe have selected three companies, which we believe are well poised given the encouraging prospects of the orthopedics market.Stryker Corporation: This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.8%.  The current-quarter estimate revision trend for the stock has been encouraging with five estimates moving upward, compared to two downward movements in the past two months. Resultantly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased around 0.6% to $1.60 per share. The company’s five-year historical growth rate is also favorable at 10.1% compared with the industry’s 5.7% and the S&P 500’s 2.8%. Stryker's share price movement over the past year has been favorable. The company yielded a return of almost 26.3%, better than the industry's 17.1%. Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report): This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.1%. The company’s five-year earnings growth rate  of 14.3% also compares favorably with the S&P 500’s 9.4%. Over the past three months, shares of Orthofix have outperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock has gained 51.9% compared with the industry’s 17.1% rise. This company recently announced FDA approval and U.S. limited market launch of the FORZA XP Expandable Spacer System.Johnson & Johnson: This company has a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.8%.  Estimate revisions for the current year have been solid with 10 estimates moving upward, compared to one movement in the opposite direction over the past two months. Resultantly, the consensus estimate increased around 3.2% to $8.11 per share. The company’s five-year historical growth rate  of 7%  also compares favorably with the industry’s 3.1% and the S&P 500’s 2.8%.Shares have increased 8.3% in the past month, comparing favorably with a 0.4% increase witnessed by its industry. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1733,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 5 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, which was wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 4 cents and flat with the year-ago period.Quarterly revenues surged 103% to $0.19 million from the year-ago quarter. Revenues, however, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 million. Revenues comprised royalty and license fee revenues received under various non-imetelstat license agreements.Shares were up 7.4% in after-hours trading on Mar 16. Moreover, so far this year, Geron’s shares have outperformed the industry, rising 87.2% during the period compared with the industry’s gain of 1.4%.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 39% to $2.5 million due to lower costs for the proportionate share of clinical development costs for imetelstat. General and administrative (G&A) expenses rose 14.6% to $5.5 million due to increased stock-based compensation and consulting costs, partially offset by lower legal costs.The company ended the quarter with $109.2 million in cash and investments compared with $112.7 million at the end of the third quarter.2017 ResultsRevenues for the full year were significantly down to $1.1 million from $6.2 million in the year-ago period. We note that revenues in the year-ago quarter had included a $5 million upfront payment from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary Janssen related to a licensing agreement.The company reported a loss of 18 cents for the year, narrower than year-ago loss of 19 cents.R&D expenses were down 38.9% to $11 million while G&A expenses were up 2.7% to $19.3 million.Pipeline UpdateGeron’s sole pipeline candidate, imetelstat, is being evaluated in two mid-stage studies – IMerge and IMbark – in myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) and myelofibrosis (“MF”), respectively. Geron is conducting the studies in collaboration with J&J.In December 2017, Geron presented preliminary data from part I of phase II/III IMerge study. Data showed that imetelstat achieved RBC transfusion-independence (RBC-TI – reduced or no requirement of RBC transfusion over a certain interval) in 54% of the patient population, who have not received prior treatment with either lenalidomide or a hypomethylating agent, for at least 8 weeks. RBC-TI was achieved in 31% of the patients in the above subset for at least 24 weeks.Based on this data, J&J expanded part I of the study to include 20 more patients in refined MDS indication to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier. In October 2017, the FDA granted fast track designation to imetelstat based on data from part 1 of IMerge.Meanwhile, the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed during the third internal review in March 2018 supported continuation of the phase II IMbark study without modifications.However, J&J is planning to amend the protocol of the study to allow long-term treatment of patients. The amendment will be based on a primary analysis of data from the study, which is expected in the second quarter of 2018. J&J will also notify Geron about continuation of the study based on this analysis, which is expected in the third quarter of 2018.Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderGeron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Horizon Pharma Public Limited Company (HZNP  -  Free Report) and Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report).

1735,JNJ,"The medical device tax suspension up to Jan 1, 2020, is one of the very few amendments that have garnered the maximum number of bipartisan votes in the House.Since its enactment in 2013, the 2.3% tax has been quite a menace for the medical device industry. Per a statement by the Advanced Medical Technology Association lobbying group, the tax had a significant negative impact on medical innovation and employment. Considering this, the House placed a suspension on the tax from January 2016 to December 2017 only to bring it back on Jan 1, 2018.But recently, the House came up with a $31-billion bill on tax cuts, which included the abatement of the infamous medical device tax.While the MedTech fraternity has been cheering the latest repeal, the share price and net margin performance of the medical device manufacturers is showing a different story. Let’s delve deeper.How Glitzy is the Repeal for MedTech?Innumerable reports claim that the repeal will ramp up domestic production, increase hiring of skilled professionals and lower the nation’s overdependence on offshore production.Further, MedTech bigwigs are expected to enhance the R&D, improve margins, launch products, reduce capital depreciation, invest in early-stage MedTech companies, execute clinical trials and in turn fuel the next generation of U.S. Medical-Device industry by reinvesting profits (tax savings).Notably, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) shelled out a lump sum $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Meanwhile, medical device giant Stryker Corporation (SYK  -  Free Report) reported net earnings of $1.14 billion and paid approximately $229 million as medical device excise tax in 2015 — nearly 16% of earnings (data from a Med Device Online report). If the tax didn’t exist, analysts believe the companies could have used the cash to expand and improve their pipelines.This drew heavy criticism, compelling the Democrats and the Republicans to lift the tax.History Says a Different StorySince the tax was abolished in 2015-end, the companies were expected to rake in profits and also put up an impressive show on the bourses starting 2016. However, the price performance and margin trend contradicted expectations.In fact, the tax repeal news created quite a stir amongst analysts back in 2016, dealing a blow to shares of medical device manufacturers. Our data shows that the broader Medical-Products industry has underperformed the S&P 500 market in the last two years. The industry’s 31.3% cuts a sorry figure in comparison to the S&P 500’s 34.5%. Here we take a sneak peek at the net margin trend of companies since the last tax repeal. Although no single metric can determine the profitability of a business accurately, investors can count on net margin to get a fair idea of the amount of profit a company is making. A declining net margin post the tax repeal amendment throws light on the enormous risks and costs associated with the R&D and compliance requirements of MedTech manufacturers. This also raises a question on how will the tax repeal provide an impetus to the MedTech space, if it could do nothing significant two years back.5 Stocks Grappling With Declining Prices & Net MarginHere we have five MedTech stocks that have witnessed significant margin contraction despite the tax repeal in 2015.We would like to draw your attention to the share price and net margin performance of companies following the tax’s abolition in 2015.Over the past two years, Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report) has been observed to underperform the broader markets. As per the latest share price movement, the stock lost 7%, comparing unfavorably with the S&P 500’s gain of 35.4%.The company has been facing escalating costs and expenses that are weighing on its margins. Also, the company’s reiteration of 2018 guidance despite the projection of favorable foreign currency translation fails to lift investors’ spirits. Over the past two years, Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC  -  Free Report) has underperformed the S&P 500 index. The stock has lost 18.8%. We are disappointed with the continued deterioration in the company gross, operating and net margins, thanks to higher cost of sales and expenses. Also, a tough competitive landscape and pricing pressure weigh on the stock.The U.S. healthcare products and service distribution industry is highly competitive and consist principally of national, regional and local distributors. In the North American dental products market, the company faces stiff competition from Patterson Dental business of Patterson Companies Inc. and Benco Dental Supply.DENTSPLY SIRONA Inc.’s (XRAY  -  Free Report) share price movement has been disheartening over the past two years. The company has lost 7.1% in the period. A lackluster margin trend over the same time frame indicates the company’s failure to garner profits post the tax repeal.For the days to comeDENTSPLY expects gross and operating margins to remain flat to decline slightly from 2017 levels as underlying margin rate improvement is expected to be offset by adverse foreign exchange and target inventory equipment reduction.Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc. (MDRX  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two months. Notably, the stock has returned 5.2%, compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 35.4%. Further, the company’s margins have contracted significantly in the past two years.Allscripts also expects a modest increase in operating expenses. The company faces sluggishness in the international market and competition from larger players.Bruker Corporation (BRKR  -  Free Report) has underperformed the broader market in terms of price in the past two years. The stock has returned just 10.3%, much lower than the S&P 500 market. Further, the company’s margins have declined steeply in the past two years.Bruker conducts 80% of its business in international markets. As a result, currency fluctuations continue to result in foreign currency transaction losses.Will the latest MedTech tax overhaul paint a different picture for these stocks?Will History Repeat Itself?Our analysis clearly shows that the broader industry hasn’t reacted positively to the tax repeal amendment that was legislated in 2015. If we consider the repeal’s effect on the MedTech space, the trend is expected to continue this time around as well!However, the MedTech industry has been favored by a massive change in consumer behavior lately. This coupled with changing market dynamics led to a dramatic transformation of the U.S. healthcare system over the last couple of years. This is evident from the rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care along with the shift of the payment system to a value-based model.Further, the strategic application of Artificial Intelligence in every sphere of healthcare can provide boost productivity in the MedTech space. Companies that have adopted AI technologies witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and are expected to record strong margin expansion as well.You never know, the current favorable trend might turn the tables for the MedTech industry!More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007? Now 2017 looks to be a pivotal year to get in on another emerging technology expected to rock the market. Demand could soar from almost nothing to $42 billion by 2025. Reports suggest it could save 10 million lives per decade which could in turn save $200 billion in U.S. healthcare costs. A bonus Zacks Special Report names this breakthrough and the 8 best stocks to exploit it.

1736,JNJ,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 76 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 41 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter.Vertex reported revenues of $640.8 million in the first quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $617.56 million. However, sales were down 10.3% year over year due to significantly lower collaborative revenues.The company had received an upfront payment of $230 million from Germany-based Merck KGaA in the year-ago period for out-licensing of four oncology programs.CF Drugs Sales Remain StrongVertex’s first-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (“CF”) products — Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko, collaborative ($1.7 million) and royalty revenues ($1.4 million). CF product revenues were $637.7 million in the first quarter, up 33% year over year due to continuous expansion of patient population.Kalydeco sales surged 34.4% to $250 million while Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $354 million, up 20% year over year.The growth was supported by continued approvals in expanded population and uptake globally.During the quarter, Vertex received approval for its third CF drug, Symdeko, in the United States. The drug has contributed $34 million to the top line.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses increased 14.7% to $260 million in the first quarter due to higher costs related to phase III development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 15.4% to $99.6 million mainly driven by worldwide investments to support the treatment of CF patients.2018 Revenue GuidanceVertex provided guidance for 2018 revenues, primarily driven by CF drugs sales. The company expects revenues to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.8 billion.Guidance for combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 was maintained in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 billion.Pipeline & Regulatory UpdatesVertex remained focused on developing its triple combination regimens for treatment of CF. The company has advanced two next-generation CFTR correctors – VX-659 and VX-445 – to phase III stage.In February 2018, the FDA approved Symdeko for the treatment of CF patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or who have at least one mutation that is responsive to Symdeko. The drug is under review in the EU for a similar indication.An ongoing phase III study is evaluating Symdeko in children aged 6 through 11 years with similar mutations.A label expansion of Kalydeco to include patients aged 2 to 12 years is under review in the United States as well as Europe. A decision from the FDA is expected in August. Meanwhile, Vertex is also evaluating the drug in a phase II study for the treatment of infants below 12 months.Similarly, Vertex is also seeking approval of Orkambi in patients aged two to five years. Regulatory applications are under review in the United States and Europe with a decision expected in August in the United States. A phase III study will be initiated in the second half of 2018 to evaluate the drug in patients aged between 12 months and less than 24 months.Moreover, in January 2018, the European Commission approved a line extension for Orkambi to include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and who have two copies of the F508del mutation.Apart from CF, Vertex is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease, thalassemia, influenza and pain management. During the first quarter, Vertex announced positive data from a Phase II proof-of-concept study evaluating its pain candidate, VX-150, for acute pain following bunionectomy surgery. Two other phase II studies are evaluating the candidate in neuropathic pain and pain from osteoarthritis of the knee. A phase III study on pimodivir in combination with standard-of-care treatment in patients with influenza is being conducted in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Our TakeVertex’s first-quarter results reflect strong performance of its CF products, which helped it to beat estimates on both counts.Shares rose almost 2% in after-hours trading in response to the strong quarterly results. After a robust increase in share price last year, Vertex’s share price has increased 5.9% so far this year against a decrease of 10.1% for the industry.Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. The approval of Symdeko further strengthens the franchise. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population — almost 90% of the patients — in the future. However, competition is increasing as several major companies are expressing interest in CF.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteZacks Rank and Key PicksVertex carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A couple of better top-ranked stocks from the biotech sector are Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report) and Protagonist Therapeutics (PTGX  -  Free Report).

1738,JNJ,"Making its debut on 09/12/2016, smart beta exchange traded fund Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR  -  Free Report) provides investors broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has long been dominated by products based on market cap weighted indexes, a strategy created to reflect the market or a particular market segment.A good option for investors who believe in market efficiency, market cap weighted indexes offer a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way of replicating market returns.There are some investors, though, who think it's possible to beat the market with great stock selection; this group likely invests in another class of funds known as smart beta, which track non-cap weighted strategies.These indexes attempt to select stocks that have better chances of risk-return performance, based on certain fundamental characteristics or a combination of such characteristics.The smart beta space gives investors many different choices, from equal-weighting, one of the simplest strategies, to more complicated ones like fundamental and volatility/momentum based weighting. However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexFDRR is managed by Fidelity, and this fund has amassed over $293.27 M, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. This particular fund seeks to match the performance of the Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates before fees and expenses.The Fidelity Dividend Index for Rising Rates reflects the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends and have a positive correlation of returns to increasing 10-year U.S. Treasury yields.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Operating expenses on an annual basis are 0.29% for FDRR, making it on par with most peer products in the space.FDRR's 12-month trailing dividend yield is 2.95%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsIt is important to delve into an ETF's holdings before investing despite the many upsides to these kinds of funds like diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.85% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Johnson + Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 25.32% of FDRR's total assets under management.Performance and RiskSo far this year, the ETF has added roughly 0.90%, and was up about 13.31% in the last one year (as of 05/23/2018). FDRR has traded between $28.03 and $32.66 in the past 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.96 and standard deviation of 11.88% for the trailing three-year period. With about 123 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1739,JNJ,"Shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) decreased 1.2% at market close on Apr 17, 2018 despite beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both earnings and revenues. This was primarily due to the fact that its top- selling drug, Remicade witnessed a 17% decline in sales, owing to recent competition in the United States.The company’s revenues increased 12.9% on a year-over-year basis to $20.1 billion in first-quarter 2018 and came ahead of the consensus mark of $19.5 billion.Increase in sales was driven primarily by strong sales of cancer drugs, favorable foreign exchange trends and recent acquisition activity. In June 2017, JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company, Actelion for $30 billion.Johnson & Johnson reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $2.06 for first-quarter 2018, up 12.6% year over year and 18.4% on a sequential basis. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01.Segment Sales and OutlookThe company reported increase in sales by geographical segments. U.S. sales increased 6.1% to $10.0 billion from $9.4 billion in the year ago quarter, while International sales increased 10.9% to $10.1 billion from $8.4 billion.Moreover, on a business-segment basis, the company reported improvements in all the three segments. Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical devices revenues increased 5.3%, 19.4% and 7.5% respectively.Although the company is facing headwinds related to sales of some of its key drugs like Remicade and Zytiga, certain new drugs are expected to make up for the loss. Its blood cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica delivered strong sales growth in the quarter. However, the company’s high dependence on the pharma segment is a concern, as the consumer and medical devices segment failed to register attractive growth.Although J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00-$8.20, it increased its revenue guidance to a range of $81.0-$81.8 billion from $80.6-$81.4 billion expected earlier.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Johnson and Johnson (see all Health Care ETFs here).Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $15.5 billion and charges a moderate fee of 13 basis points a year.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Health Care Equipments and Supplies and Health Care Providers & Services, with 33.3%, 20.9% and 19.8% exposure, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson, Unitedhealth (UNH  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), with 10.9%, 7.3% and 6.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 13% in a year but lost 0.5% year to date.

1740,JNJ,"U.S. equity markets are facing widespread volatility, thanks to trade negotiations and recent geopolitical risks owing to the U.S. strike on Syrian chemical facilities.  Although the markets shrugged off fears stemming from the Syria attack and proposed sanctions on Russia as the earnings season is underway, the long-term impact of such factors might increase the appeal of dividend investing (read: Stocks and ETFs with Juicy Dividend Yields). Into the Headlines Market turbulence has brought portfolio reallocation back into play. Tensions between Washington and Beijing have been bothering the markets for quite some time now. Although talks of negotiations have been doing the rounds, nothing can be said for certain. To sail through market volatility, allocating a portion of your portfolio to safe dividend funds seems like a judicious option (read: ETFs to Buy as Trade War Fears Abate). Moreover, the recent chemical attack in Syria has increased tensions pertaining to U.S.-Russia relations. The recent missile strikes on Syrian chemical plants by a U.S.-led coalition with France and U.K. has complicated the situation. Anatoly Antonov, Russia’s ambassador to the United States, told the Wall Street Journal, “We warned that such actions will not be left without consequences. All responsibility for them rests with Washington, London and Paris. Insulting the president of Russia is unacceptable and inadmissible.” In the event of a response by Russia, Iran or Syria, the markets might take a hit on actual war concerns, instead of only a trade war. Although the odds of that happening are low, it is advisable to safeguard one’s portfolio against such severe events. This is because during such volatile times, it is difficult to beat algorithmic trading outlets, which are programmed to start selling by merely reading news headlines indicating at an adverse event.  Moving on to interest rate, the CME Fed watch tool currently forecasts two more rate hikes in 2018, which many analysts believe has already been priced in by the Wall Street. In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increased returns when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit low volatility as they are stable and mature companies. Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies offering high dividends.  It has AUM of $27.3 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Industrials, Consumer Services and Health Care with 33.2%, 19.0% and 12.0% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 4.0%, 4.0% and 3.9% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 17.4% in a year and 0.5% year to date. It has a dividend yield of 1.87% and has garnered $241.1 million in inflows in the first two weeks of April, per etf.com data. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends.  It has AUM of $20.6 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Information Technology, Financials and Health Care with 17.0%, 14.2% and 12.9% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Microsoft Corp, JP Morgan Chase & Co (JPM  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson, with 7.0%, 3.9% and 3.5% allocation, respectively. It has returned 12.9% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a dividend yield of 2.94% and has garnered $123.6 million in inflows in the first two weeks of April, per etf.com data.  Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide cheap exposure to U.S. companies paying out high dividends.  It has AUM of $7.4 billion and charges a fee of 7 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Consumer Staples, Information Technology and Industrials with 21.9%, 21.7% and 15.1% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM  -  Free Report), Intel Corp (INTC  -  Free Report) and Pfizer Inc (PFE  -  Free Report) with 4.8%, 4.6% and 4.6% allocation respectively. The fund has returned 15.6% in a year but has lost 2.5% year to date.

Notably, S&P 500 breached its 50-day moving average and closed above this level for the first time since Mar 16.The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also gained 1.7% driven by a sharp increase in the share price of Netflix Inc.

The company revised its 2018 financial outlook. Adjusted net earnings have been raised to $12.40-$12.65 from the previously projected $12.30-$12.60 band. Consequently, the stock price rose 3.6% (Read More: UnitedHealth Q1 Earnings & Revenues Top, View Lifted).The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s (GS  -  Free Report) first-quarter earnings and revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1742,JNJ,"After a strong start in 2018, the drug sector struggled a bit in the next few months probably on U.S. market instability and a few negative updates on the pipeline and regulatory front. In the first four months of the year (January-April), the biotech industry significantly underperformed the S&P 500. The biotech industry declined 9.3% compared with the S&P 500’s decline of 0.8%.However, the industry has bounced back in the past month. It rose 6.8%, better than the S&P 500’s increase of 2.9%. A better-than-expected first quarter pulled up the biotech industry. As of May 31, 2018, 94.8% of the medicalsector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index reported results. Total earnings for these companies were up 13.8% on 7.1% higher revenues, with 77.4% beating EPS estimates and 71.7% beating revenue estimates. Several positive pipeline and regulatory updates also contributed to the rise.Acquisitions and strategic collaboration deals have also been rising consistently this year with the tax reform in place. The new tax law, which cuts corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and encourages companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%, is spurring merger activity.In fact, the drug/biotech sector has been one of the best-performing industries in the U.S. stock market. The outlook for biotech/drug sector is quite positive for the rest of the year.Here we take a look at three stocks whose share price has increased in the past month. These stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report): The company share price has increased 5.9% in the past month. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2. In May, Biomarin received FDA approval for pegvaliase to reduce blood phenylalanine (Phe) levels in phenylketonuria (PKU) patients. This was the second product approval for BioMarin in less than two years, the first being Brineura in mid-2017. Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well. BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs – Vimizim and Kuvan – continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs.Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (LGND  -  Free Report)): The company’s share price has increased 25.1% in the past month. The company benefited from its numerous licensing agreements. This year so far, Ligand has entered into a worldwide OmniAb platform license agreement with Glenmark Pharmaceuticals per which the latter will be able to use the its full OmniAb platform to discover fully human mono- and multispecific antibodies. Ligand also entered into a worldwide OmniAb platform license agreement with Ferring Pharmaceuticals and venBio Partners this year. Ligand also carries a Zacks Rank #2.VIVUS, Inc. (VVUS  -  Free Report): The share price of the company has increased 32.9% in the past month. In May 2018, VIVUS entered into an agreement with Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), to acquire all rights to the latter’s exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (“EPI”) drug, Pancreaze, in the United States and Canada. This is the first of what the company expects to be a series of product acquisitions designed to generate revenues and strengthen its financial position.

The company carries a Zacks Rank #2.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1743,JNJ,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), to include a new indication – moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (“UC”). The drug is approved for the treatment of adult patients with recommended a dose of 10 mg twice-daily for at least eight weeks.The approval was expected as the FDA Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee had adopted a positive vote in a meeting in March recommending the approval of the supplemental new drug application (sNDA) filed in July last year seeking label expansion of Xeljanz in UC.Xeljanz is already marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis. In the first quarter of 2018, Xeljanz sales were $326 million, up 30.4% from the year-ago period. The label expansion in the UC indication is likely to boost its sales further.Shares of Pfizer have lost 0.5% so far this year, compared with a 6% decrease for the industry it belongs to.The approval was based on data from three pivotal studies – OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2 and OCTAVE Sustain – which demonstrated that statistically significant and greater proportion of patients achieved remission when treated with Xeljanz compared to a placebo.Pfizer is currently evaluating Xeljanz in an open label long-term extension study, OCTAVE Open.However, there are several blockbuster drugs in the inflammatory segment approved for UC, which includes Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade and Simponi, AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira and Shire’s (SHPG  -  Free Report) Lialda. Moreover, many biotech companies are developing their candidates for the treatment for UC. Hence, competition is likely to increase in this segment.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc.

1744,JNJ,"The Dow opened slightly higher on Wednesday morning as investors look to rebound from a brutal day of trading Tuesday that saw tech stocks drop en masse. With international trade fears cooled for now, the 30-stock Dow fared better during the selloff than the tech-heavy Nasdaq, suggesting that investors might be shifting their sector exposure to favor consumer staples and industrials right now.Tech’s recent volatility seems to stem from a combination of profit taking and new skepticism surrounding internet privacy in the wake of Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) latest data scandal. The famous “FANG” stocks—Facebook, Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), and Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report)—have been among the worst performers.For those still bullish on tech, the selloff presents an interesting buying opportunity, especially with all signs pointing to another strong earnings season for the sector. However, some might be looking to move some cash out of the tech space and into lower-risk plays.With this in mind, the Dow 30 stocks include plenty of attractive options today. Check out these three Dow stocks to buy now!1.       The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report)This insurance giant has exposure to nearly all of the industry’s key markets, making it one of the largest and most well-known brands in the business. The company is also looking strong on the back of an improving earnings outlook and a solid financial position.TRV’s full-year EPS estimates have trended higher recently, with our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal period gaining $1.00 over the past 90 days. This positive revision activity has earned the stock a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Meanwhile, the company continues to be a cash cow, bringing in about $26 in cash per share right now.TRV uses its financial strength to reward shareholders and offers a dividend yield of 2.1%. Insurance might not be the most exciting industry, but investors might start flocking to cash-heavy income plays like TRV soon. 2.       Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)This healthcare and consumer goods is likely outside of the problem areas that investors should be most cautious about right now, and its improving earnings outlook and attractive valuation make it an appealing bet right now.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for JNJ’s full-year earnings has gained 26 cents over the past 90 days, lifting the stock to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). JNJ is also trading at about 17x forward 12-month earnings, which represents its lowest earnings multiple over the past year. This company is also an income pick and offers a dividend yield of about 2.6%. 3.       The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Boeing was sold off amid concerns that China would target the company for retaliation against Trump’s latest batch of tariffs, but reports that U.S. officials were negotiating with Chinese regulators should cool these fears. With that said, investors can now scoop up this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock at a discount.Boeing owes its strong Zacks Rank to an improving earnings outlook, but the company is also well positioned to benefit from encouraging news. For instance, we recently learned that American Airlines (AAL) dropped its deal with Airbus, meaning that Boeing likely snagged a contract worth up to $8 billion.Boeing has sunk nearly 12% over the past month, but if trade negotiations go well, the stock should rebound just fine. Want more market analysis from this author?

1745,JNJ,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have outperformed the large-cap pharma industry in the past three months. The stock has returned 1.5% in that timeframe against the industry’s decline of 1.1%.AbbVie’s outperformance was backed by decent quarterly results, an optimistic outlook for stronger underlying business performance through the rest of the year,positive pipeline news flow and regulatory updates.It is one of the reputed names in the pharmaceutical sector. AbbVie came into existence on Jan 1, 2013, after Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) divested its pharmaceutical divisionHere are six reasons to invest in the stock.Favorable Rank & Earnings Surprise Record: AbbVie has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It has been consistently beating earnings expectations.  Earnings surpassed expectations in each of last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.39%.The company is expected to record earnings and sales growth of 39.3% and 16.8%, respectively, in 2018. Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 increased 0.3% and 0.2%, respectively, in the past 60 days.Valuation Looks Reasonable: Despite the outperformance, AbbVie’s valuation looks fairly reasonable currently.AbbVie currently has a forward twelve months price-to-earnings ratio (P/E F12M) of 11.25, which is near the lowest level (11.03) in the past year. When compared with the highest level of 17.99 and median level of 13.92 over the past year, there is apparently some upside left.The space also looks inexpensive when compared with the industry, as the current as well as median F12M P/E ratio for the industry is 14.02 and 15.63, respectively. Price-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M) chart  Key Drug Humira Going Strong: AbbVie’s flagship product Humira is approved for several inflammatory indications like rheumatoid arthritis. Humira continues to witness strong demand trends despite launch of drugs with new mechanisms of action and competition from indirect biosimilars. Currently approved for 13 indications, Humira sales have increased consistently - 11.7% in 2015, 16.1% in 2016 and 14.6% in 2017 - backed by robust demand trends. The product continues to see strong growth in the dermatology and gastroenterology markets. The company expects Humira sales to approach $21 billion in 2020.Though two biosimilar versions of Humira are already approved by the FDA, per settlements with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and Samsung Bioepis, biosimilar entry into the United States is set for 2023, thus delaying direct biosimilar competition in the country.Strong Oncology Portfolio: AbbVie work rigorously on expanding and accelerating its presence in oncology. A key drug in its oncology portfolio is Imbruvica, which is currently approved for quite a few indications and has multi-billion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments. AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020. AbbVie has developed Imbruvica in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report).AbbVie is also studying another cancer drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In June, regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL were approved in the United States. Label expansion to include this broader patient population should boost Venclexta’s commercial potential.Meanwhile, the 2016 acquisition of drugmaker, Stemcentrx added a key late-stage candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T, to AbbVie’s portfolio. Rova-T is currently in registrational studies for first and second-line small cell lung cancer (SCLC). A phase I, eight-arm ""basket study"" on Rova-T in neuroendocrine tumors is also ongoing.Promising Pipeline: AbbVie has a deep pipeline consisting of several interesting late-stage candidates. Promising candidates include elagolix (endometriosis), risankizumab (inflammatory diseases), Depatux-M/ABT-414 (glioblastoma multiforme), ABBV-8E12 (early Alzheimer's disease and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), and upadacitinib/ABT-494 (inflammatory diseases).The company expects to move 10 tumor candidates into clinical development in 2018.Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in the second half of the year including FDA decisions on risankizumab and elagolix regulatory applications.Mavyret Performs Beyond Expectations: AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily hepatitis C (HCV) treatment, Mavyret, gained approval in the United States, EU, Canada and Japan in 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Mavyret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history. Mavyret performed beyond expectations in the first year of launch, recording sales of almost $500 million in 2017. The positive sales trend continues in 2018 with the drug recording sales of $850 million in the first quarter of 2018. With less than a year on the market, Mavyret already commands 45% share in the United States.Conclusion                                                                                  AbbVie faces its share of challenges in the form of slower sales of HCV drugs, potential biosimilar competition to Humira, regular pipeline setbacks and rising competition. However, we believe AbbVie is well positioned to overcome these headwinds.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1746,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted breakthrough therapy designation to its late-stage pipeline candidate, erdafitinib for the treatment of urothelial cancer, a type of bladder cancer.The designation from the FDA is intended to expedite the development and review of drugs with early evidence of substantial potential clinical benefit to patients, or benefit patients without current treatment options.The designation for erdafitinib was primarily based on efficacy findings from a phase II study, evaluating it in advanced urothelial cancer indication and showed an overall response rate of 42%.J&J stock declined 4.2% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a gain of 0.9% recorded by the industry.Urothelial cancer, which starts in the urothelial cells that line the inside of the bladder, is usually characterized by serious outcomes due to the often rapid progression of the tumor and the lack of efficacious treatments. It is the sixth most common form of cancer in the United States. It is estimated that more than 81,000 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed this year, per a J&J press release.J&J has a robust pipeline. The company expects to launch or file for approval more than 10 new blockbuster products by 2021. The company is targeting more than 50 line extensions of existing and new drugs as well. This should help lessen the impact of genericization of key products in the pharma portfolio.Key late-stage candidates in the company’s pipeline include esketamine (treatment-resistant depression), niraparib (prostate cancer), and imetelstat (myelofibrosis) among others. While a regulatory filing in the United States for esketamine is expected in 2018 that for niraparibis expected next year. Please note that imetelstat is being developed in partnership with Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report).An important new drug, Guselkumab/Tremfya was approved last year wasfor plaque psoriasis. Also,the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) received approval in the United States in November last year while the candidate is under review in the EU. Juluca has been developed by J&J in partnership with ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report).Meanwhile, Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV is under review in the United States. Symtuza was approved in the EU in September last year.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1747,JNJ,"Last week, U.S. Senator Tina Smith expressed concerns that big pharma companies plan to use their large corporate tax savings to reward shareholders instead of bringing down costs of expensive drugs and benefiting consumers. The Senator questioned through letters to CEOs of five big pharma companies — Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Labs (ABT  -  Free Report) — how they plan to use their extra cash.Please note that on their Q4 conference calls held earlier this year, most big pharma companies discussed what they plan to do with the extra cash they save from the new tax bill. These companies plan to invest the extra cash in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. Not many talked about taking any steps to lower prescription drug costs.This apart, key announcements this week included the failure of Dermira, Inc.’s (DERM  -  Free Report) acne candidate in two pivotal late-stage studies, Merck’s oncology collaboration with Japan’s Eisai, expansion of Jardiance clinical studies by Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and FDA committee backing for Pfizer’s Xeljanz for the third indication.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesDermira Shares Sink as Acne Candidate Fails: Shares of Dermira plunged after it announced that its acne candidate, olumacostat glasaretil, surprisingly failed to meet the primary endpoint in either of the two pivotal phase III studies -- CLAREOS-1 and CLAREOS-2. The company said that it will likely stop olumacostat glasaretil’s development following this failure.

Per this deal, the companies will jointly develop and commercialize Eisai’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Lenvima, both as a monotherapy and in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda for several types of cancer. For the deal, Merck will give Eisai an upfront payment of $300 million. The companies will share global development and marketing costs as well as gross profits from Lenvima equally. (Read More: Merck to Pay $300M Upfront to Co-Develop Eisai's Cancer Drug)Pfizer’s Xeljanz sNDA Gets FDA Committee Backing: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug application to include the ulcerative colitis (UC) indication in its label received a backing from an FDA advisory committee. The FDA’s Gastrointestinal Drugs Advisory Committee (GIDAC) voted unanimously in favor of the JAK inhibitor. The FDA’s decision is expected in June. Xeljanz, which is already approved to treat rheumatoid arthritis and active psoriatic arthritis, recorded sales of $1.35 billion in 2017, representing growth of 45% year over year.AstraZeneca Looks for Forxiga EU Approval in Type I Diabetes: AstraZeneca’s application looking to get its SGLT-2 inhibitor, Forxiga, approved for a new indication -- an oral adjunct treatment to insulin in type-1 diabetes (T1D) patients -- was accepted by the European Medicines Agency. Forxiga is presently approved as a monotherapy as well as a combination therapy to treat type-2 diabetes. If approved, Forxiga will become the first SGLT-2 inhibitor approved in Europe for the treatment of T1D as an oral treatment adjunct to insulin. (Read More: AstraZeneca's Forxiga Label Expansion Filing Accepted in EU)Glaxo Presents Asthma/HIV Data: Glaxo (GSK  -  Free Report) presented data from OSMO study on a new respiratory medicine, Nucala, at American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI) and World Allergy Organization (WAO) Joint Congress in Orlando. Data from the study showed that patients whose asthma was uncontrolled with Xolair witnessed improved asthma control on switching to Glaxo’s new respiratory medicine, Nucala.Glaxo also presented interim data from a phase IIIb study, INSPIRING, on investigational HIV candidate dolutegravir at a medical conference in Boston. (Read More: Glaxo’s Encouraging Asthma & HIV Data at Medical Meetings)Meanwhile, Glaxo gained approval to expand the European label of its once-daily LABA/ICS combination treatment, Relvar Ellipta. Now, Relvar Ellipta can be used in the EU in patients whose asthma is already adequately controlled by an ICS/LABA. With the label update, doctors can prescribe asthma patients to switch to once-daily Relvar Ellipta from their current twice-daily ICS/LABA, while experiencing comparable benefit in lung function and safety profile.Lilly, Boehringer to Expand Jardiance Clinical Studies: Lilly and partner Boehringer Ingelheim announced plans to initiate two phase III EMPERIAL studies, which will evaluate the effect of Lilly’s SGLT2 inhibitor Jardiance on exercise ability and heart failure symptoms in people with chronic heart failure irrespective of whether they have type II diabetes. Though the presently ongoing phase III EMPEROR outcomes studies are evaluating the effect of Jardiance on long-term morbidity and mortality outcomes in people with heart failure, the EMPERIAL studies will investigate if treatment with Jardiance can help improve the everyday lives of people living with chronic heart failure.

1748,JNJ,"Shares of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) fell 7.8% as investors were not much impressed with the company’s initial results from the phase III study, CheckMate -227. The study was evaluating the Opdivo 3 mg/kg plus low-dose Yervoy (1 mg/kg) combination in first-line advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) patients with high tumor mutational burden (TMB) ≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb).The combination demonstrated a superior benefit for the co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) versus chemotherapy. The initial results showed that the one-year PFS rate was more than triple with the combination versus chemotherapy (43% vs. 13%).The overall response rate with the combination was 45.3% while that of 26.9% the chemotherapy arm. 68% of responders had ongoing responses at one year (25% with chemotherapy). Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse event rate with the Opdivo plus low-dose Yervoy combination was 31% versus 36% with chemotherapy.While the results were encouraging, investors were disappointed as Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Keytruda seem to have fared better than Opdivo and Yervoy combination.  Merck announced results from a phase III study, KEYNOTE-189, evaluating anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda, in combination with pemetrexed (Alimta) and cisplatin or carboplatin for the first-line treatment of metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC. The results showed that the Keytruda-pemetrexed-platinum chemotherapy combination significantly improved overall survival (“OS”), reducing the risk of death by half compared with chemotherapy alone.Consequently, shares of Bristol-Myers declined. The first-line NSCLC market competition is stiffening with quite a few companies trying to capture additional market share.     Shares of the company have gained only 4.8% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 10.7%. Concurrently, Bristol-Myers announced that it obtained FDA approval for Opdivo plus Yervoy (injections for intravenous use) as the first immuno-oncology combination therapy for previously untreated patients with intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma. The phase III trial, CheckMate-214 demonstrated a significant and unprecedented increase in OS for the abovementioned combination in this patient population compared to a current standard of care, Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Sutent.Moreover, Opdivo demonstrated sustained OS advantage over standard of care in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the Head and Neck in CheckMate-141. Patients treated with Opdivo experienced a 32% reduction in the risk of death after two years minimum follow-up.We note that Opdivo is currently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Opdivo continues to be launched globally on approvals and label expansions. The drug has been performing impressively due to demand resulting from the rapid commercial acceptance for several indications including melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and second-line NSCLC. Label expansion into additional indications would give the product access to a higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug significantly.Bristol-Myers announced a worldwide collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s  (JNJ  -  Free Report) Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) on a Factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor program that includes the development and commercialization of the former’s factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor, BMS-986177.We note that BMS-986177, an investigational anticoagulant compound is being evaluated for prevention and treatment of major thrombotic conditions. Both companies are expected to advance BMS-986177 into phase II trials in the second half of 2018 for the study of secondary stroke prevention.Zacks RankBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1751,JNJ,"The PowerShares Dividend Achievers Portfolio (PFM  -  Free Report) was launched on 09/15/2005, and is a passively managed exchange traded fund designed to offer broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.The fund is sponsored by Invesco Powershares. It has amassed assets over $290.67 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. While value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets when you consider long-term performance, growth stocks are more likely to outpace value stocks in strong bull markets.CostsSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.55%, making it one of the more expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.01%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Staples sector--about 18.30% of the portfolio. Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM  -  Free Report) accounts for about 4.16% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 31.6% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskPFM seeks to match the performance of the NASDAQ US Broad Dividend Achievers Index before fees and expenses. The NASDAQ US Broad Dividend Achievers Index is designed to identify a diversified group of dividend-paying companies which have increased their annual dividend for 10 or more consecutive fiscal years.The ETF has lost about -2.84% so far this year and was up about 8.72% in the last one year (as of 05/23/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $23.95 and $27.75.The ETF has a beta of 0.86 and standard deviation of 11.56% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 266 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesPowerShares Dividend Achievers Portfolio carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, PFM is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Large Cap ETFs area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD  -  Free Report) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV  -  Free Report) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $36.74 B in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $36.40 B. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.20% and VTV charges 0.05%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1752,JNJ,"With the passing of the new tax bill, the corporate tax rate has come down from 35% to 21% which is likely to boosts profit margins. Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations at a one-time tax rate of 10%, leaving these companies with extra spending power.Most big pharma companies discussed their plans to use the extra cash they save from the new tax bill at their fourth-quarter conference calls. The extra cash will mostly be invested in capital expenditures, products/pipeline, in-licensing or acquisition deals or rewarding shareholders through higher dividends and share buybacks. However, the majority of companies did not mention any effort regarding lowering of prescription drug costs.Last week, Senator Tina Smith in letters to five big pharma companies, expressed concern about how big pharma companies plan to used billions of dollars they will save from the tax cut offered under the tax bill passed in December 2017. She is concerned about the fact that the companies are favoring investors instead of using the savings to bring down prescription drug costs. Major life-saving drugs which are protected by patents are steeply priced. Thus, making these drugs affordable will help consumers, as it will lower their medical costs.The Senator has sent letters to CEOs of Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) to provide the details of how they intend to utilize major savings from the tax overhaul.The prices of major prescription drugs have skyrocketed over the past years, pinching hard U.S. citizens as their medical bills have soared. Moreover, the government also has to pay higher costs for the drugs that are covered under Medicare. The concern of the senator is thus justified. A move to restrict the use of tax savings for boosting shareholders will be a welcome move for consumers.Moreover, large players from every other industry have similar plans, which have undercut President Donald Trump’s plans to create jobs and boost wages.Senator Smith is also working toward making cheaper generic drugs available in the market faster by introducing a new legislation, as reported by KDAL.Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return  Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnDon’t Even Think About Buying Bitcoin Until You Read ThisThe most popular cryptocurrency skyrocketed last year, giving some investors the chance to bank 20X returns or even more.

1753,JNJ,"Theravance Biopharma (TBPH  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 loss of $1.64 per share, wider than both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $1.15 and the year-ago loss of $1.36.Total revenues in the quarter plunged 21.1% year over year to $4.5 million compared with the prior-year figure. This downside can mainly be attributed to lower sales from the company’s sole marketed product, Vibativ (telavancin). However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4 million.Theravance’ shares were down more than 2% on Feb 27 in after-hours trading following the earnings release, which reported wider loss. Moreover, the shares have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has lost 8.4% versus the industry’s 0.8% increase. Quarterly DetailsVibativ generated U.S. revenues of $4.1 million in the fourth quarter, down 18% from the year-ago period. Sales decreased mainly due to the impact of generic competition in the United States.Revenues from collaborations were $0.4 million compared with $0.7 million in the year-earlier quarter.Research and development expenses were $51 million, up 21.4% from the year-ago period, mainly due to increases in employee-related costs and advancement of the company’s priority pipeline programs, partially offset by reduction in external expenses.Selling, general & administrative expenses rose 44.6% to $20.9 million, primarily on higher employee-related costs.2017 ResultsFull-year sales slumped 68.3% year over year to $15.4 million. However, the number beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.5 million.Full-year loss of $5.45 per share was wider than the year-ago tally of $4.26. Loss was also wider than the consensus mark of a loss of $4.85.Pipeline and Other UpdatesEarlier this February 2018, Theravance entered into a global collaboration agreement with Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), to jointly develop and commercialize its pan-Janus kinase inhibitor, TD-1473, for treatment of inflammatory intestinal diseases.Pursuant to the above-mentioned contract, Theravance will be entitled to receive an upfront payment of $100 million and be also eligible to get potential payments of $900 million if J&J remains in the collaboration on completion of phase II activities.Also in January, Theravance along with partner Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) announced that the new drug application (NDA) for the pipeline candidate, revefenacin (TD-4208), has been accepted by the FDA for treatment of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A response from the regulatory body is expected on Nov 13, 2018. The NDA acceptance was supported by positive data from two replicate pivotal phase III efficacy studies and a single 12-month, open-label, active comparator safety trial. In October 2016, the company reported positive data from both the phase III evaluations.2018 OutlookTheravance projects operating loss for 2018 in the range of $180-$200 million.Theravance Biopharma, Inc.

1754,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry within the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for almost half of its revenues. The company has several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology, oncology, pulmonary hypertension,, and infectious diseases/vaccines. However, like many of its peers, J&J is facing generic competition and pricing pressure for some of the products in its pharmaceutical segment.J&J’s stock has depreciated 8.5% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with a decline of 2.4% recorded by the industry.J&J’s Pharma segment sales picked up from the second half of 2017 after being soft in the first half of 2017. We are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in second-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the J&J’s Pharma segment sales is $9.93 billion.We believe that new products, continued share gains of some key products, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and meaningful contribution from acquisitions will support the top line.Continued share gains will drive sales of Imbruvica (cancer indications), Xarelto (blood thinner), Zytiga (prostate cancer) and Stelara (psoriasis). Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for total Imbruvica sales is $608 million.Strong adoption witnessed for the newer indication of Crohn's disease will continue to contribute to Stelara growth. Zytiga was approved in the first-line setting in February, which contributed to the strong performance of the drug in the first quarter, a trend we expect will continue in the second quarter. Also, strong adoption in outside U.S. markets and accelerated adoption in the United States across all lines of therapy are likely to drive sales of Darzalex. Importantly, Darzalex was approved in the first-line setting this May, which can add significantly to sales in the second quarter.These positives will offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting and market share decline due to competitive pressure. Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of key arthritis drug, Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report). The Zacks Consensus Estimates for total Remicade sales is $1.33 billion.We note that some inventory build and seasonality issues hurt sales of Xarelto in the first quarter. It remains to be seen if the issues persist in the second quarter as well.Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said on the first quarter conference call that the uptake of the product has been strong. The drug recorded sales of $72 million in the first quarter, which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss initial sales numbers for Erleada, its newly approved next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for prostate cancer on the second-quarter conference call.Overall, in the second quarter, sales in the Pharmaceutical segment are expected to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve (Read more: J&J to Set Pharma Q2 Earnings in Motion: What’s Up?)J&J currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Trump said Pfizer and other U.S. drugmakers should be “ashamed” that they had raised drug prices for “no reason.” The tweet also said that by raising drug prices in the United States, these drug companies were offering “bargain basement prices” overseas. He warned that the administration will respond. A day after this tweet was published, Pfizer issued a statement saying it will defer the price increases until the President’s drug pricing blueprint goes into effect or until the end of the year, whichever is earlier. AbbVie’s Imbruvica Lymphoma Study Fails: AbbVie announced that a late-stage study evaluating its cancer drug Imbruvica for the first-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) failed to meet the primary endpoint.The study evaluated the addition of Imbruvica to R-CHOP (combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone), which is the existing standard of care for DLBCL, an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) versus R-CHOP plus placebo. However, the study data showed that adding Imbruvica to R-CHOP did not improve event-free survival (EFS) in the targeted patient population. Imbruvica is presently FDA approved for eight indications including five B-cell blood cancers, as well as in chronic graft-versus-host-disease. The drug, which AbbVie markets in partnership with J&J, recorded sales of $762 million in the first quarter of 2018. This included U.S. sales of $624 million, up 36.7%, and $138 million (up 47.2%) of international profit sharing with J&J.AbbVie also filed a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for a label expansion of Venclexta (venetoclax) for the first-line treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  AbbVie is looking to get Venclexta approved in combination with a hypomethylating agent (“HMA”) or with low-dose cytarabine (“LDAC”) in AML patients who are ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. (Read more: AbbVie's Imbruvica Fails in Phase III Blood Cancer Study)Merck’s Keytruda sBLA Gets Priority Review: Merck’s supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) looking to expand the label of Keytruda for previously treated patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, was granted priority review by the FDA.

1756,JNJ,"Big banks are starting the second-quarter earnings season this week, and results from pharma giants are due over the next few weeks, making this a good time to shift attention to the reporting cycle from tariff concerns. Although trade woes are a concern for pharma companies as around 55% of their revenues are generated from foreign markets, the overall earnings number is expected to be upbeat.The healthcare sector has jumped 6.5% in the last three months, better than the S&P 500’s 5% rally. Signs of the sector’s success became more evident in the last three months, when the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index and the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index gained 3.1% and 11.7%, respectively.With Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Jul 17 and Jul 18, respectively, this may be a good time to figure out which of these is a better stock. Both stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings scheduled next week include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceJohnson & Johnson has seen a gain of 4.18% over the last one month, while Novartis has advanced 4.16%. So Johnson & Johnson is a winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Novartis and the broader industry, which rose 3.70% during the same period.ValuationThe most-appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Novartis with an EV/EBITDA value of 12.10 is overvalued compared to the broader industry, which has a valuation of 11.98. However, Johnson & Johnson holds an edge over both Novartis and industry here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 7.92.Dividend YieldOver a year, Johnson & Johnson and Novartis have offered dividend yields of 2.82% and 2.42%, respectively, while the industry’s dividend yield was 3.11%. Although the industry’s dividend yield is slightly higher than both the pharma giants, between the individual stocks, Johnson & Johnson has taken the lead here too.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to allegedly exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 22.77%, Novartis underperforms its bigger rival Johnson & Johnson, which has a net margin value of 26.23%. The broader industry’s net margin value is equal to that of Johnson & Johnson.Return on EquityReturn on equity (ROE) is one of the key financial ratios for pharma companies as these entities employ huge amounts of capital to bring their products to the market. In this respect, using ROE will help in evaluating the company’s ability to generate ample profits from its equity capital.The broader industry has ROE of 29.71%. Coming to the two stocks, Johnson & Johnson with an ROE of 30.65% is clearly at an advantage over both the industry and Novartis, which has ROE of 16.23%.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Johnson & Johnson has delivered positive surprises in each of the four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 2.86%. On the other hand, Novartis has delivered positive surprises in the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 3.34%.When considering Earnings ESP, Johnson & Johnson has an ESP of +0.37%, while Novartis has an ESP of -2.68%. Johnson & Johnson’s earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 0.3% over the last 90 days, while the same metric for Novartis has declined by 1.3%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that Novartis holds an edge over Johnson & Johnson when considering only earnings history. However, when considering price performance, valuation, ROE, and net margins Johnson & Johnson is at an advantage over Novartis. Additionally, Johnson & Johnson also has a better dividend yield than Novartis and with a more comprehensive look at its estimate revisions, Johnson & Johnson is clearly the better stock.What clinches the case in favor of Johnson & Johnson at this point in time is that it has a better ESP, which is a leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. This is why it might be wise to bet on Johnson & Johnson over Novartis as both prepare to report earnings next week.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more, wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1757,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is reportedly raising prices of almost 100 drugs, effective July 1. This is the second time that the drug giant has raised the prices of its drugs this year. The scrutiny of drug prices has increased since Trump assumed office. However, with a softer drug pricing policy formed last month, we expect other companies to follow suit.The increase in price was nearly 9% for the majority of the drugs, within the agreed limit of 10% price rise a year. However, price of a few drugs like Xalatan, Viagra and Chanix have already increased in double digits including the price hike of January.On May 11, Trump announced plans to control drug prices in the United States. However, a group of investors believe the plan is not likely to have a major impact on the profits of large pharma companies. Instead of including provisions of direct negotiations by Medicare with the pharma companies, Trump targeted intermediaries, certain small pharma companies and foreign countries. Thus, Medicare is a major customer of drugs, paying nearly 30% of dollar values of prescriptions filled. Medicare could have negotiated lower prices directly from the manufacturers.The President also expects to increase competition by streamlining some approval-related regulatory processes and promoting faster approval to generics/biosimilars. The plan allows more substitutions/additions in Medicare’s drug list for single-source generics to contain price rise and gives sponsors more negotiation power with manufacturers. It also instructs companies to display list prices in advertising. The plan also focuses more on transparency related to pricing and availability of generics.Moreover, the announcement of the price hike by Pfizer comes after weeks of Trump’s claim that pharma companies will take massive price cuts voluntarily soon.Pfizer has defended the price rise by stating that list price does not reflect actual price, which includes discount. It also mentioned that it has hiked prices for only one-tenth of its drug portfolio and also reduced prices of five drugs by 16% to 44%.Meanwhile, price hike by one company may soon trigger a market-wide increase in drug prices. Thus, Pfizer’s move can again stir the opposition related to drug price rise, especially by large pharma companies. Along with Pfizer, stock prices of several other large cap pharma companies moved north on Jul 2 including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report). A rise in drugs prices will certainly help these companies to boost its profits.So far this year, the large cap pharma industry has declined 5.1% against the S&P 500’s rise of 2.2%.We expect investors to remain focused on other pharma companies for any announcement related to drug prices and any subsequent move by the government to restrict any further hike.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1758,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 pharma earnings on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter of 2018. The drug and consumer products giant upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018. Shares were up around 1% in pre-market trading.This year so far, J&J’s shares have declined 5.7%, comparing unfavorably with the 2.7% decline witnessed by the industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $2.06 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 and increasing 12.6% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings excluded amortization expense and some special items. Including these items, J&J reported first-quarter earnings of $1.60 per share compared with earnings of $1.61 in the year-ago period.Sales Beat SlightlySales came in at $20 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.48 billion. Sales also increased 12.6% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 8.4% and a positive currency impact of 4.2%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis, better than 2.4% increase seen in 2017. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and the Consumer segment sales improved.First-quarter sales grew 6.1% in the domestic market to $9.95 billion and 19.9% in international markets to $10 billion, reflecting 10.9% operational growth and 9% positive currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 19.4% year over year to $9.84 billion, reflecting 15.1% operational growth and 4.3% positive currency impact as sales rose in both domestic and international markets. Sales in the domestic market rose 9.9% to $5.35 billion while international sales grew 33.1% to $4.49 billion (operational increase of 22.5%).New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 7.5% on an operational basis, slightly less than 7.6% growth seen in the previous quarter.In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $585 million, less than $610 million in the previous quarter. The $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech,Actelion in June last year diversified J&J’s revenues to the PAH category and added 7.6% to sales growth in the first quarter.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 12.7% due to higher managed care discounting. Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), was down 16.9% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 22.5%. However, international sales rose 1.8% despite biosimilar competition.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug, Erleada for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug, Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first-line setting.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.77 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 3.2% and positive currency movement of 4.3%.Domestic market sales rose 2.2% year over year to $3.16 billion. International market sales increased 12.7% (operational increase of 4.2%) year over year to $3.61 billion.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.4 billion in the reported quarter, up 5.3% year over year(operational increase of 1.3%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 4%. Sales in the domestic market rose 1.6% from the year-ago period to $1.44 billion.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 8.2% to 1.96 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 1.2% and a positive currency impact of 7%.2018 Outlook J&J maintained the previously issued earnings guidance for 2018 while increasing the sales range.J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%.However, now it expects revenues in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 4% to 5% (previously 3.5% to 4.5%).Our TakeThough quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta face generic competition, we believe that new products like plaque psoriasis drug, Tremfya (guselkumab), cancer drugs, Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, currency tailwinds and contribution from acquisitions helped J&J deliver strong sales and profit in the first quarter of the year and led it to raise the sales outlook for the whole year. In fact, J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales, as told by chief financial officer, Dominic J. Caruso to Bloomberg.Meanwhile, J&J announced some global supply chain initiatives, which will annually save approximately $600 million to $800 million in pre-tax costs by 2022. Meanwhile, Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer of J&J said that the company will invest more than $30 billion in R&D and capital investments in the United States over the next four years. The new tax laws will leave some extra cash in the hands of large pharma companies like J&J, allowing them to invest in innovation and capital building.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Johnson & Johnson Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Johnson & Johnson QuoteA better-ranked stock is Pfizer, Inc.

The company’s shares lost 30.4%, compared to the industry’s decrease of 2.6%.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased nearly 4.4% from the year-ago period to $15.7 million.

It included an operational increase of 6.5% and positive currency movement of 1.8%.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 2%.Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in Vision Care and Cardiovascular as well as improving growth in surgery, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unit.Domestic market sales rose 5.3% year over year to $3.31 billion. International market sales increased 11.1% (operational increase of 7.5%) year over year to $3.66 billion.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.54 billion in the reported quarter, up 3.1% year over year (operational increase of 0.4%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 2.7%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 0.2% worldwide. Slower growth in domestic baby care products due to competitive pressure was offset by growth in beauty and over-the-counter products.Sales in the domestic market declined 0.6% from the year-ago period to $1.38 billion.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 5.7% to $2.16 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 1.2% and a positive currency impact of 4.5%.Margins DiscussionCost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, declined 80 basis points mostly due to favorable product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were up 50 bps year over year to 29.8% of sales due to investment behind new products. Research and Development costs, as a percentage of sales, rose 340 bps over the prior-year quarter to 18%.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales rose 6.3% to $76.5 billion, falling slightly short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $76.8 billion. Operationally, sales rose 6% in the year, which was in line with the upper end of the guided range of 5.5.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $7.30 per share, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.28 and up 8.5% year over year. Earnings were at the higher end of the guidance range of $7.25 - $7.30 per share.2018 Outlook IssuedJ&J issued a mixed guidance for 2018 wherein the earnings range was above the consensus estimate while sales fell slightly short of the same.J&J expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%. The company’s guidance exceeded the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.86 per share. Currency fluctuations are expected to favorably impact earnings per share by 20 cents.It expects revenues in the range of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, the sales guidance fell slightly short of the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.55 billion. Organic sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to be in the range of 2.5%-3.5% which, though slightly higher than 2.4% seen in 2017, fell short of 4.2% in the fourth quarter. Currency fluctuations are expected to favorably impact sales by 200 basis points.In 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from acquisitions, mainly Actelion, will support top-line growth.Adjusted pre-tax operating margins are expected to increase by approximately 100 basis points in 2018 despite expectations for increased R&D investments. The company said that since tax rates on U.S. earnings will be lower in 2018, it will allow increased investment in R&D.Adjusted tax rate guidance is in the range of 16.5.The company does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States in 2018. However, the company is confident that it can absorb the impact of any potential Zytiga headwind should there be an earlier-than-expected generics launch in 2018.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There has been three moves up in the last two months.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, JNJ has a nice Growth Score of B, however its Momentum is doing a bit better with an A.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is more suitable for momentum investors than those looking for value and growth.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Interestingly, JNJ has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1762,JNJ,"We are into the second half of the year. It’s time to analyze how the first half turned out to be for pharma and biotech stocks in terms of FDA decisions. The regulatory body approved 17 novel drugs in the first half of 2018, which is less than the year-ago period figure of 23. However, with several FDA decision lined up for the second half, a higher number of drugs could be approved in the rest of the year.Key FDA approvals in the first half included Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report)/Novartis’s first CGRP antibody Aimovig/erenumab for prevention of migraine, J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor and BioMarin Pharmaceuticals’ Palynziq to treat phenylketonuria (PKU).With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts.Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of July.FDA Decision on Indivior’s Schizophrenia Injection RBP-7000: On Jul 28, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Indivior Plc’s (INVVY  -  Free Report) RBP-7000, which has been developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. RBP-7000 is a once-monthly injectable risperidone given using the Atrigel delivery system. Indivior is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Progenics Pharmaceuticals’ Azedra Review: Progenics Pharmaceuticals’ (PGNX  -  Free Report) new drug application (NDA), looking to get its pipeline candidate, Azedra approved for the treatment of patients suffering from malignant rare neuroendocrine tumors — pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma — is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Jul 30, after a three-month delay from the previous FDA action date in March. Azedra was added to Progenics’ portfolio with the acquisition of Molecular Insight Pharmaceuticals in 2013.Decision on Insys Therapeutics’ Pain Candidate: On Jul 28, the FDA is also expected to give its decision on Insys Therapeutics’. (INSY  -  Free Report) buprenorphine sublingual spray for moderate-to-severe acute pain. It is important to remember that in May an FDA advisory committee voted against its approval. The company had filed a new drug application (""NDA"") in September last year based on positive data from a pivotal study on the candidate. The FDA accepted the NDA for review in December assigning a PDUFA date of Jul 28, 2018.It is quite possible that the unfavorable vote by the committee may influence the FDA’s decision and delay the approval of the drug.Will an FDA Panel Back New Indication for Glaxo’s Nucala?: Toward the end of the  month, an FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) label expansion filing for eosinophilic asthma drug, Nucala (mepolizumab) for a  new indication -  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). With the latest filing, Glaxo is looking to get Nucala approved as an add-on maintenance treatment of COPD with an eosinophilic phenotype. Nucala is presently approved for treating severe eosinophilic asthma and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (""EGPA""). Glaxo hadfiled a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to the FDAfor label expansion of Nucala to include use in COPD in November last year.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committee into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1763,JNJ,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.1% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is JNJ due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.J&J Tops First-Quarter Earnings Estimates, Raises Sales GuidanceJ&J’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $2.06 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01 and increasing 12.6% from the year-ago period.Adjusted earnings excluded amortization expense and some special items.

Sales also increased 12.6% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 8.4% and a positive currency impact of 4.2%.Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.3% on an operational basis, better than 2.4% increase seen in 2017. This is because the Pharmaceutical segment continued the positive momentum seen in the second half of 2017 and the Consumer segment sales improved.First-quarter sales grew 6.1% in the domestic market to $9.95 billion and 19.9% in international markets to $10 billion, reflecting 10.9% operational growth and 9% positive currency impact.Segment DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales rose 19.4% year over year to $9.84 billion, reflecting 15.1% operational growth and 4.3% positive currency impact as sales rose in both domestic and international markets.Sales in the domestic market rose 9.9% to $5.35 billion while international sales grew 33.1% to $4.49 billion (operational increase of 22.5%).New products like Imbruvica and Darzalex continued to perform well.

The strong performance was led by the company’s oncology portfolio.Imbruvica sales rose 43.5% to $587 million in the quarter driven largely by higher market share across all lines of therapy and market growth in the Unites States.Stelara sales rose 28.9% to $1.06 billion in the quarter. Stelara gained market share in the quarter driven by share gains in the psoriasis market as well as in the newer Crohn's disease market. Simponi / Simponi Aria sales rose 21% to $518 million in the quarterDarzalex sales rose 69.4% to $432 million in the quarter. Darzalex enjoyed increased penetration in outside U.S. markets and market growth in the United States. With an approval in first-line setting expected this year, it is expected to be a driver of Darzalex sales, going forward.Xarelto sales rose 12.7% to $578 million in the quarter. Sales were softer than the previous quarter due to some inventory build and seasonality issues. However, the company said the drug continued to witness market share gains.Zytiga sales rose 61.6% to $845 million in the quarter due to improved market share in a growing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market. Zytiga was approved in the first-line setting in February, which was a key driver of Zytiga’s strong performance in the first quarter. Invega Sustenna sales rose 15.2% to $696 million.In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $585 million, less than $610 million in the previous quarter. Strong demand for Uptravi and Opsumit was partially offset by the expected decline of Tracleer outside the United States due to generic competition and the transition of patient assistance foundations. The Actelion acquisition added 7.6% to sales growth in the first quarter.Invokana/Invokamet sales declined 12.7% to $248 million due to higher managed care discounting.Sales of Remicade declined 16.9% in the quarter to $1.4 billion with U.S. sales declining 22.5% due to some rebate adjustment. However, international sales rose 1.8% despite biosimilar competition.Regarding newly launched Tremfya, J&J said that the uptake of the product has been strong. Tremfya recorded sales of $72 million in the first quarter compared with $47 million in the previous quarter.J&J is quite confident that its Pharma segment will continue to perform better than the market this year despite the impact of biosimilars on Remicade sales.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.77 billion, up 7.5% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 3.2% and positive currency movement of 4.3%.Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.1%.Operational growth was driven by continued strong performance in vision care, electrophysiology as well as the advanced surgery business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the diabetes care and orthopedics, particularly US Hips, Knees, and Spine.Domestic market sales rose 2.2% year over year to $3.16 billion. International market sales increased 12.7% (operational increase of 4.2%) year over year to $3.61 billion.The Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.4 billion in the reported quarter, up 5.3% year over year (operational increase of 1.3%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 4%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, adjusted operational sales growth was 2% worldwide, an acceleration from the fourth quarter of 2017. Slower growth in domestic baby care products due to competitive pressure was offset by growth in beauty and over-the-counter products.Sales in the domestic market rose 1.6% from the year-ago period to $1.44 billion.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 8.2% to 1.96 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 1.2% and a positive currency impact of 7%.Margins DiscussionCost of goods sold, as a percentage of sales, declined 140 basis points mostly due to favorable product mix. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were down 50 bps year over year to 26.3% of sales despite investment behind new products. This was due to lower cost relative to sales growth in the Pharmaceutical unit. Research and Development costs, as a percentage of sales, rose 30 bps over the prior-year quarter to 12%.2018 Sales Outlook RaisedJ&J maintained the previously issued earnings guidance for 2018 while increasing the sales range.J&J still expects 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%. Currency fluctuations are expected to favorably impact earnings per share by 20 cents. However, revenues are expected in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth rate in the range of 4% to 5% (previously 3.5% to 4.5%).Organic sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to be in the range of 3 versus 2.5%-3.5% previously.Currency fluctuations are expected to favorably impact sales by 200 basis points.Adjusted pre-tax operating margins are expected to increase by approximately 150 basis points (previously 100 bps) in 2018 despite expectations for increased R&D investments.Adjusted tax rate guidance is in the range of 16.5.The company does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States in 2018. However, the company is confident that it can absorb the impact of any potential Zytiga headwind should there be an earlier-than-expected generics launch in 2018.However, the 2018 guidance includes the impact of generics for Procrit and Tracleer as well as Remicade biosimilars.New Cost Savings InitiativeJ&J announced some global supply chain initiatives, which will annually save approximately $600 million to $800 million in pre-tax costs that will be substantially delivered by 2022. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing.J&J said that the company will invest more than $30 billion in R&D and capital investments in the United States over the next four years (2018-2021), representing an increase over the prior four years of more than 15%. The new tax laws will leave some extra cash in the hands of large pharma companies like J&J, allowing them to invest in innovation and capital building.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?It turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter compared to four lower.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, JNJ has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is primarily suitable for growth investors while also being suitable for those looking for momentum and to a lesser degree value.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, JNJ has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

1764,JNJ,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to Retacrit, a biosimilar version of two blockbuster drugs – Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Epogen and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Procrit.  Pfizer already markets the biosimilar in EuropeRetracrit is indicated for the treatment of anemia due to chronic kidney disease, anemia due to Zidovudine in HIV-infected patients and anemia due to the effects of concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy (anemia post chemotherapy). The drug is also approved for the reduction of allogeneic red blood cell (RBC) transfusions in patients undergoing elective, noncardiac, nonvascular surgery.Retacrit becomes the first biosimilar erythropoiesis-stimulating agent approved in the United States.Procrit generated sales of $972 million while Epogen’s sales were $1.1 billion in 2017. The sales numbers suggest bright prospects for Retacrit as it will be a lower cost alternative treatment option for patients using Procrit/Epogen. However, Procrit already faces biosimilar competition from drugs like Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Binocrit in Europe.Pfizer’s shares have declined 1.5% so far this year, comparing favorably with a fall of 3% recorded by the industry.The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated a high level of similarity of Retacrit with Epogen and Procrit. In May last year, the FDA’sadvisory committee had recommended approval of RetacritPfizer has entered into collaboration with Switzerland-based Vifor Pharma for the commercialization of Retacrit in certain channels.Retacrit is the third approved biosimilar in Pfizer’s commercial portfolio which includes Inflectra, a biosimilar version of J&J’s Remicade. The company is also developing 11 different biosimilar candidates in several mid-to-late stage studies.As the Trump administration continues to rally against exorbitantly high drug prices, the FDA has been actively approving generics/biosimilar of expensive branded drugs in a bid to bring down prices through competition. We saw several such approvals in 2017 and expect the trend to continue this year.Pfizer Inc. Price  Pfizer Inc. Price | Pfizer Inc. QuoteZacks RankPfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1765,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) is expected to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 7.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20%.Geron’s shares have outperformed the industry in the past year. The stock has gained 8.2% while the industry witnessed a decline of 1.9% in the said time frame.Pipeline in FocusGeron’s revenues solely comprise license fees and royalties as it has no approved product in its portfolio. Moreover, it has only one candidate in its pipeline, imetelstat. Hence, investor focus will remain on any updates related to it.Geron is developing imetelstat in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) for treating patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (“MF”), myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) and acute myelogenous leukemia (“AML”).Two late-stage studies for imetelstat are ongoing – IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of MF, and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of MDS.Following second internal review of data from IMbark and IMerge in April last year by J&J, the studies continued unmodified. In November 2017, Geron initiated dosing in the expanded part 1 of the ongoing phase II/III IMerge study. The expanded part is being conducted to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier.Janssen will decide on continuation of part 2 of IMerge based on data from expanded part 1.Janssen is expected to evaluate maturing data from the IMbark study in 2018, including an assessment of overall survival. An internal review of the data is expected in the first quarter of 2018. However, the continuation of the study will depend on a protocol-specified primary analysis, which will be done in the third quarter of 2018 or on reaching a pre-specified number of deaths.We expect the company to provide an update on the path forward for imetelstat development on the fourth-quarter conference call.Surprise HistoryGeron’s performance over the last four quarters has been fairly decent, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and meeting the same once. The average positive surprise over the last four quarters is 14.17%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Geron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 4 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Geron’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Geron Corporation Price and Consensus  Geron Corporation Price and Consensus | Geron Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Exelixis (EXEL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Feb 26 after market close.

1766,JNJ,"The Dow rebounded strongly over the first five trading days after entering correction territory last week. The index gained on Monday after investors looked to buy on the cheap, with energy stocks among the key gainers. The Dow continued to gain over Tuesday and Wednesday despite initial concerns about a higher-than-expected consumer prices data. Ultimately, the Dow gained for the fifth consecutive day on Thursday, on track to post its biggest weekly increase since November 2016.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 1.4% last Friday despite a tumultuous week. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) decreased 13.2% to close at 29.06. However, it remained three times higher than last year’s average. All the key U.S. indexes made a recovery during the last hour of trading to end in positive territory. The movement lacked specific catalysts even as the blue-chip index registered an increase of more than 300 pointsDuring last week, markets slipped into correction territory, with the Dow witnessing two 1,000-point drops during the period, losing 5.2% in the process. Markets suffered huge losses during the week following concerns that bonds were becoming more attractive investments than equities.Rising bond yields diminished the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. A tighter labor market, strong wage growth and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. A higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.The Dow This WeekThe index increased 1.7% on Monday. The movement came after investors looked to buy on the cheap, with energy stocks among the key gainers. Domestic oil prices recovered after last-week’s decline after OPEC in its monthly report projected global oil demand would increase by 1.59 million barrels per day (bpd) this year, better than its previous outlook by 60,000 bpd.Additionally, President Trump signed into law a bipartisan budget deal that will provide a massive spending boost to the Pentagon and U.S. infrastructure. This in turn had a positive impact on the key indexes.The index gained for the third consecutive day on Tuesday, adding 0.2%.  Despite registering gains on Tuesday, the Dow remained 7% below the all-time high level registered on Jan 26.Additionally, trading volumes during the day were comparatively lower as investors waited for Bureau of Labor Statistics’ consumer prices report on Wednesday for further clues on inflation.The index increased 1% on Wednesday registering its longest stretch of gains in more than five weeks. Markets managed to rebound after declining initially following a better-than-expected consumer prices report, a key inflation metric. A strong earnings season and a steady economy helped all the three key indexes to shrug off their yearly declines to close in positive territory.The index increased 1.2% on Thursday, ending in positive territory on for the fifth straight trading day. This was the Dow’s best such feat since December 2011. The index is now up 4% for the year and is on the way to post its biggest weekly increase since November 2016. Although, the movement lacked specific catalysts, part of the day’s gains were fueled by strong earnings and a resilient U.S. economy.Components Moving the Index Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 63 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 59 cents. Further, the figure increased 6 cents from the year-ago quarter of 57 cents.

Security, Infrastructure Platforms and Applications revenues increased in the quarter.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues are expected to rise 3-5% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated between 64 cents and 66 cents per share.

(CAT  -  Free Report) reported a rise of 34% in global retail sales for the three months ended January 2018, at par with the performance witnessed in December 2017 and at levels last seen in August 2011. This was driven by improvement across all regions. Within Machines, Resource Industries and Construction Industries reported positive gains for the seventh and 12th consecutive months, respectively.In January, Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Caterpillar’s performance was driven by a 51% increase in Asia Pacific sales. The region has been a consistent contributor for the company since it posted the first positive reading in August 2016. Latin America registered growth of 49% in October and Europe, Africa and Middle East (“EAME”) sales were up 31%. North America sales also went up 23%.

Please note that in December last year, the NDA was granted priority review by the FDA. With the FDA granting priority review, a response was expected in April 2018. Erleada’s NDA submission was based on positive data from the phase III SPARTAN study.Last week, J&J presented positive data from the SPARTAN study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium meeting. The data from the study showed that Erleada (apalutamide) significantly reduced the risk of metastatis or death by 72% and increased median metastatis-free survival by more than two years in patients with nmCRPC.

1768,JNJ,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced extension of its 2014 research and development (R&D) agreement with Calico Life Sciences to jointly discover and develop candidates to treat age-related diseases including neurodegeneration and cancer.Calico is a San Francisco Bay Area based biotech company, backed by Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Since the companies first entered the deal, the partnership has produced more than two dozen early-stage programs. With the latest agreement, the collaboration has been extended for another three years.Calico will be responsible for the early R&D programs until 2022 and will continue to advance the programs through phase IIa through 2027. AbbVie will continue to support Calico in early R&D stages and will have the option to manage late-stage development and commercial activities. The companies will be sharing costs and profits equally and contribute $500 million each additionally to the collaboration.The deal strengthens AbbVie’s grip on the oncology segment. As it is, AbbVie has a strong position in the oncology market with drugs like Imbruvica, which it markets in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report).Imbruvica, currently approved for quite a few indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Several studies on Imbruvica are ongoing to evaluate the drug alone or in combination in different patient segments. AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020.AbbVie is also studying chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) drug Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory CLL patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy and other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and AML. Data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL presented in last September showed that the combination led to a profound improvement in progression free survival compared to Treanda plus Rituxan. Regulatory applications seeking approval for the combination use in this broader patient population were approved in the United States earlier this month. Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie’s shares have declined 4.8% this year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 4.9%. AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1769,JNJ,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted a priority review to its lymphoma drug Imbruvica’s (ibrutinib) sNDA for the treatment of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM) in combination with Rituxan (rituximab), marketed by Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche Group (RHHBY  -  Free Report).The sNDA was based on positive data from the phase III study, iNNOVATE, which evaluated Imbruvica in combination with Rituxan and showed positive outcomes across all lines of WM treatment including patients with untreated and relapsed/refractory WM.The phase III study (n=150) enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive WM. Patients received intravenous Rituxan 375 mg/m2 once weekly for four consecutive weeks followed by a second four-weekly Rituxan course post a three-month interval. They either received Imbruvica420 mg or placebo once daily until permanently discontinuing the treatment. The primary endpoint was progression free survival with a measure of safety and tolerability across all treatment lines.Based on the data and if approved, the sNDA would expand the drug’s label for the indication of WM as the first chemotherapy-free combination treatment option.Notably, Imbruvica is a first-in-class Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The drug is already approved in the United States for the following indications such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia along with previously-treated mantle cell lymphoma, previously-treated marginal zone lymphoma and the previously-treated chronic graft-versus-host disease.The drug is being jointly developed and marketed by Pharmacyclics LLC, which got acquired by AbbVie in 2015 and Janssen Biotech, a unit of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).We also mark that AbbVie’s Humira drug is a key growth driver for its revenue base. Imbruvica also appears to have great potential of a blockbuster drug. In the first quarter of 2018, the drug’s net revenues were $762 million, up 38.5% year over year. By the end of the year, its global revenues might exceed $3.3 billion with sales in the United States likely to cross $2.7 billion.Share of AbbVie has decreased 3.8% year to date compared to the industry’s decline of 4.4%. AbbVie currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1770,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 4 cents per share for the first quarter of 2018, narrower than the year-ago loss of 5 cents.Quarterly revenues fell 40.8% from the year-ago quarter to $0.32 million. Revenues comprised royalty and license fee revenues received under various non-imetelstat license agreements. The company stated that active non-imetelstat license agreements reduced in numbers and products sales from the licensees decreased.Shares were down 5.5% in pre-market trading on May 11. However, so far this year, Geron’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry, rising 101.7%, against the industry’s decline of 11.3%.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 27.7% to $2.4 million. The decline was due to decreased stock-based compensation and lower costs for the proportionate share of clinical development costs for imetelstat under collaboration with Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).General and administrative (G&A) expenses rose 14.1% to $5.3 million due to consulting costs and legal costs.The company ended the quarter with $103.2 million in cash and investments compared with $109.2 million at the end of the fourth quarter.Pipeline UpdateGeron’s sole pipeline candidate, imetelstat, is being evaluated in two mid-stage studies – IMerge and IMbark – in myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) and myelofibrosis (“MF”), respectively. Geron is conducting the studies in collaboration with J&J.In December 2017, Geron presented preliminary data from part I of phase II/III IMerge study. Data showed that imetelstat achieved RBC transfusion-independence (RBC-TI – reduced or no requirement of RBC transfusion over a certain interval) in 54% of the patient population, who have not received prior treatment with either lenalidomide or a hypomethylating agent, for at least eight weeks. RBC-TI was achieved in 31% of the patients in the above subset for at least 24 weeks.Based on this data, J&J expanded part I of the study to include 20 more patients in a refined MDS indication to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier. In October 2017, the FDA granted fast track designation to imetelstat based on data from part 1 of IMerge.Meanwhile, the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed during the third internal review in March 2018 supported continuation of the phase II IMbark study without modifications.However, J&J is planning to amend the protocol of the study to allow long-term treatment of patients. The amendment will be based on a primary analysis of data from the study, which is expected in the second quarter of 2018. J&J will also notify Geron about continuation of the study based on this analysis, which is expected in the third quarter of 2018.Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Key PicksGeron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A couple of other stocks to consider in the biotech sector are Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND  -  Free Report), and Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1771,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 62 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents by 10.7%. Earnings also rose 32% year over year driven by higher international sales and lower costs and share count.The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $13.70 billion, which also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.61 billion. Revenues rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis. On an operational basis, revenues were flat year over year.Sales in DetailCurrency movement benefited Pfizer’s fourth-quarter revenues by 1%. In February 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS) business to ICU Medical. Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues in the prior-year quarter, sales rose 2% operationally.Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) somewhat offset lower sales of Enbrel and Viagra, loss of exclusivity for some products and supply shortages in legacy Hospira products.International revenues rose 5% (up 4% an operational basis) to $7.19 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues declined 4% to $6.51 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 6% on a reported basis (up 5% an operational basis) from the year-ago period to $8.22 billion. Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Eliquis globally and Xeljanz Lyrica, Ibrance and Chantix/Champix, all primarily in the United States.Ibrance revenues rose 11% to $716 million in the quarter driven by strong U.S. revenues. However, Ibrance sales were softer than the prior quarter as a one-time price adjustment hurt international sales.Xeljanz sales rose 47% to $410 million. Lyrica sales rose 8% to $1.13 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43% to $710 million. Chantix sales rose 28% to $271 million in the quarter.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $168 million in the quarter compared with $150 million in the third quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 13% to $634 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada. Total Viagra (IH+EH) sales declined 46% to $209 million due to generic competition that began in December 2017.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues rose 7% to $1.53 billion as higher international sales made up for the decline in the United States. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 7% in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 27% in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets for the pediatric indication.Consumer Healthcare revenues declined 2% to $950 million. Global Oncology revenues increased 10% to $1.51 billion. Global Vaccine revenues rose 7% to $1.62 billion. Internal Medicine rose 6% to $2.44 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise rose 6% to $1.10 billion. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 2% to $603 million.Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision is expected this year, which could also be to retain the business.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 7% (down 8% operationally) to $5.48 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 3%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products, primarily Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe, lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter. Biosimilars revenues rose 72% operationally while emerging markets revenues grew 10% operationally.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $44 million in the United States and $135 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $30 million (down 7%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 3% (operationally) in the quarter to $4.32 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses also declined 9% to $2.3 billion.2017 ResultsFull-year sales were $52.55 billion, flat year over year on an operational basis. Sales marginally beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $52.50 billion and were in line with the guidance range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion.Adjusted earnings of $2.65 per share for the full year exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.60 as well as the guided range of $2.58 - $2.62. Earnings rose 11% year over year.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $53.5 billion to $55.5 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $53.72 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.90 - $3.00, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.77 per share.At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 11% while revenues are expected to increase 4%.Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $7.4–$7.9 billion while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$15.0 billion.Adjusted tax rate is expected to be 17% in 2018.Our TakePfizer’s fourth-quarter results were above expectations as it beat estimates for both earnings and revenues. Meanwhile, it issued an upbeat guidance for 2018. Also Pfizer said that it plans to invest approximately $5 billion in capital projects in the United States over the next five years on increased access to foreign cash following the U.S. tax reforms.However, after initial gains, shares of Pfizer fell around 1.9% in premarket trading. We believe that lower sales in the United States and a sequentially softer performance of Ibrance in the quarter hurt investor sentiment. In the past year, Pfizer’s shares have increased 24.6%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 29% for the industry.Despite top-line headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, pricing pressure and rising competition, Pfizer achieved 11% adjusted earnings growth in 2017. New products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts, a lower tax rate and share buybacks helped the company achieve its 2017 guidance. Meanwhile, Pfizer looks well poised to record profit growth in 2018.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1773,JNJ,"Both Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported upbeat first-quarter results on May 1. In fact, both pharma giants managed to outpace their earnings estimate but missed on the revenue front. However, the companies’ top and bottom lines rose year over year.Merckhas a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), while Pfizer possesses a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Now, but let’s see which stock is better positioned in terms of fundamentals, post earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major earnings came from other pharma giants like Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Q1 Earnings PerformanceIn the first quarter, Merck reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by six cents. The bottom line increased 19.3% from the year-ago period. Meanwhile, the company’s revenues of $10.04 billion fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.12, but increased 6% year over year. (Read More:  Merck Beats on Q1 Earnings, Lags Sales, Raises Outlook)Pfizer posted first-quarter earnings of 77 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by only 3 cents. Earnings advanced 12% from the year-ago period, due to lower tax rates and share count. Moreover, revenues increased 1% year over year to $12.91 billion but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.09 billion. (Read More: Pfizer Stock Falls on Q1 Sales Miss, Earnings Beat)Price PerformanceMerck has witnessed a rise of 5.8% in the past three months, while Pfizer has advanced only 2.6%. So Merck is a clear winner in this respect with better returns than both rival Merck and the broader industry, which declined 2% during the same period.ValuationThe most appropriate ratio to evaluate these two drug makers is perhaps EV/EBITDA. This metric is usually used to compare two stocks in the same industry. It is superior to other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two pharma majors, Pfizer with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.63 is overvalued than the broader industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 11.32. On the other hand, with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 8.19, Merck is underpriced than both Pfizer and the industry.Net MarginThe pharmaceutical industry enjoys higher profit margins than several other sectors. This is possibly one of the reasons why critics of the sector continually draw attention to exorbitant drug pricing, which helps the sector maintain its steep margins.With a net margin value of 31.44%, Pfizer performs better than rival Merck, which has a net margin value of 27.85%. In comparison, the broader industry has a net margin value of 26.86%.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial health of a company and a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of a capital-intensive industry like pharma, this is an indicator of a company’s long-term sustainability.Merck’s debt-to-equity ratio of 61.8% is significantly high compared with the industry’s D/E ratio of 56%.  With a comparatively lower D/E ratio of 46.8%, Pfizer evidently has a better leverage condition.Earnings History and Estimate RevisionsMerck delivered positive surprises in all the last four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 8.55%. In comparison, Pfizer delivered an earnings beat in all the trailing four quarters and posted an average positive earnings surprise of around 5.23%.When considering estimate revisions, Merck’s earnings estimate for the current year has improved 1.2% over the past 30 days. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s earnings estimate has declined by 0.3% over the same period. ConclusionIn our comparative analysis, we found that both the two pharma giants have certain positives. Pfizer holds a better leverage position and has a higher net margin. However, in terms of valuation, Merck is more underpriced than Pfizer. Further, Merck has comparatively higher price performance than Pfizer.Moreover, Merck also holds an edge over Pfizer when considering its average positive earnings surprise and estimate revisions. What clinches the case in favor of Merck at this point of time is that it has a better Zacks Rank than Pfizer. In this respect, our analysis clearly indicated that Merck is better positioned than Pfizer and thus calls for investors’ attention post earnings.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1774,JNJ,"AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced a 35% hike in its quarterly dividend along with the authorization of a new $10 billion share buyback program by the board. AbbVie stock rose more than 1% on Thursday in response to the news.The dividend was increased from 71 cents per share to 96 cents per share. The cash dividend is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on Apr 13. The new quarterly dividend amounts to an annual dividend of $3.84 per share, which implies a dividend yield of 3.4%.Please note that this is the second dividend hike for AbbVie in less than six months. In October last year, AbbVie announced an 11% hike in quarterly dividend to 71 cents per share from 64 cents per share.AbbVie hiked its quarterly dividend by 4% in 2015 and 12% each in 2016 and 2017. In fact, since its inception in 2013, AbbVie has hiked its dividend by 140%.On the fourth quarter conference call held last month, management hinted that shareholder returns were likely to go up as the company’s cash position has improved following the recent U.S. tax reforms.In fact, AbbVie has performed exceptionally well in the past year, supported by a series of positive news. The stock has returned 86.9% in the past year, comparing favorably with a gain of 10.6% recorded by the industry.AbbVie met primary endpoints in several pivotal studies – the key phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; three phase III studies evaluating oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and also a phase IIb study in atopic dermatitis; and four pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Meanwhile, AbbVie gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication of cancer drug, Imbruvica. In fact, Mavyret’s launch has been stronger than expected as informed by the company on its fourth-quarter conference call.AbbVie also settled its patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares. Moreover, the agreement gave AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock should continue in 2018. Importantly, Humira has been generating solid sales based on strong demand trends for the drug – a trend expected to continue this year. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1775,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen Biotech announced that the FDA has approved its new drug application (NDA) for apalutamide for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC). Apalutamide, J&J’s next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor, will be marketed under the trade name of Erleada.The FDA decision comes much earlier than expected. Please note that in December last year, the NDA was granted priority review by the FDA. With the FDA granting priority review, a response was expected in April 2018.Erleada’s NDA submission was based on positive data from the phase III SPARTAN study.Last week, J&J presented positive data from the SPARTAN study at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium meeting. The data from the study showed that Erleada (apalutamide) significantly reduced the risk of metastatis or death by 72% and increased median metastatis-free survival by more than two years in patients with nmCRPC.J&J stock has returned 11.2% in the past year, which compares favorably with a gain of 10.6% recorded by the industry.Given that there are no FDA-approved treatments available for this patient population, Erleada’s approval is a significant boost for the company’s cancer portfolio.Also, Erleada’s approval has strengthened J&J’s prostate cancer franchise, especially with key drug Zytiga, approved for treating metastatic CRPC, facing patent challenges.Several companies like Amneal, Apotex, Dr. Reddy’s (RDY  -  Free Report), Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) among others are looking for an FDA approval of their generic versions of Zytiga.Last month, J&J announced that the U.S. PTO issued a final written decision in an inter parties review (IPR) by a generic manufacturer, invalidating J&J’s ‘438  patent for Zytiga.Zytiga was a key driver of revenue growth at J&J last year. Zytiga sales rose 10.8% to $2.5 billion in 2017 due to improved market share in a growing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market.Though J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga this year, it is confident that its guidance for 2017 organic sales growth (of 2.5%-3.5%) can absorb the impact of any potential Zytiga headwind such as an earlier-than-expected generics launch in 2018. In addition, Erleada’s early approval can somewhat make up for any lost sales of Zytiga in case a generic is launched this year.Apalutamide was added to J&J’s portfolio through the August 2012 Aragon acquisition.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus  Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson Quote(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

1776,JNJ,"The global medical device industry has demonstrated strong and sustainable growth in the recent past. Banking on an aging population, increasing incidence of chronic and lifestyle diseases, increasing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and big-data applications, upbeat consumer sentiment and increased business investments, this sector appears to be in the pink of health.Going by KPMG data, the medical device industry’s global annual sales is forecast to rise more than 5% a year to reach nearly $800 billion by 2030.A CISION report says that the United States is the largest medical device market in the world at present, raking in more than $180 billion in revenues. Despite several socio-political hazards and economic dips, U.S. medical device companies have been riding high on R&D innovation, increasing consolidation, emerging market expansion and tax cuts.Undoubtedly, it has been a very profitable investment space of late.Here are a few major developments:Abolition of MedTech Tax The bipartisan two-year suspension of the Medical Device tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on MedTech manufacturers, marks a temporary relief. It will be again put into effect from Jan 1, 2020.The repeal is expected to boost hiring and investment at 9,000 America-based medical device manufacturers, thus instilling investor optimism.The ratification of the tax-repeal amendment has encouraged massive investments in the sector.M&A Uptrend ContinuesApart from the tax relief, the MedTech fraternity has also been riding high on the ongoing merger and acquisition (M&A) trends in the space. In fact, various reports suggest that M&A has been the key catalyst driving the U.S. healthcare space of late. Per data provided by BioSpectrum Asia, M&A activity in the MedTech space surged 50% in 2017, increasing the value of aggregate M&A to more than $200 billion.Some of the major acquisitions in the recent past include Becton, Dickinson and Company’s (BDX  -  Free Report) acquisition of C. R. Bard and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actelion.PBM-Health Insurers ConsolidationLately, health insurers have been looking to collaborate with pharmacy benefit managers in the MedTech space to streamline costs in the drug supply chain.Buoyed by continued capital inflow, strategic M&A policies by key medical device players have expanded customer bases, moderated leverage and enhanced cash flow. These have also alleviated pricing pressure and competition in the MedTech space.In this regard, the latest buyout announcement of Express Scripts by Cigna (CI  -  Free Report), which comes just three months after drug chain and pharmacy giant CVS Health Corp’s (CVS  -  Free Report) announcement to acquire the nation's third-largest health insurer, Aetna, is important.Digital Revolution and MedTechLatest trends like robotic surgeries, Big-data analytics, bio printing, 3D printing, electronic health records (EHR), predictive analytics, real-time alerting and revenue cycle management services in the U.S. MedTech space are gaining prominence.Various reports suggest that the strategic application of AI in every sphere of healthcare can provide an impetus to productivity. Companies that adopted AI technologies have witnessed a 50% reduction in healthcare costs and have also experienced improved patient outcome of more than 50%.This along with a rise in minimally-invasive surgeries, higher demand for liquid biopsy tests and use of IT for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model have been driving profits at medical device companies of late.Trade War Fears Grip MedTechThe 10 sectors that have been identified by Trump for imposition of higher tariff are now on investors’ radar. Healthcare, including medical equipment, is one of the sectors, likely to bear the brunt of the trade dispute.Going by data provided in an article by Christian B. Jones in Mondaq, MedTech firms in the United States currently sell $4.7 billion annually to China, while the nation imports from China a total of $5 billion in medical device. U.S. exports of medical devices last year totaled $52 billion, creating a $1 billion worldwide trade surplus. Needless to say, the medical device lobby is extremely apprehensive about the proposed tariffs on Chinese products as it could significantly affect international trade.Zacks Industry RankWithin the Zacks Industry classification, Medical Device is broadly grouped into the Medical sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) and further sub-divided into four industries at the expanded level: Medical - Instruments, Medical - Products, Medical - Dental Supplies and Medical Info Systems.We rank all 250-plus industries in the 16 Zacks sectors based on the earnings outlook and fundamental strength of the constituent companies in each.The Zacks Industry Rank is #70 (top 27% of the 250 plus Zacks classified industries) for Medical Info Systems, #84 (top 33%) for Medical - Dental Supplies, #108 (top 42%) for Medical - Instruments and #189 (bottom 26%) for Medical - Products. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Upon analyzing the Zacks Industry Rank for different Medical Device segments, it can be said that apart for certain medical product stocks, the near-term outlook for the aforementioned Medical device subsectors is overall positive.Price PerformanceThe price performance of two major Zacks categorized sub industries, are as follows:Over the past 30 days, while the S&P 500 has gained 2.2%, the med instruments space has risen 3.6%. Some of the stocks within this space that have been trading above the S&P are Varian Medical Systems, Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report), STERIS plc (STE  -  Free Report) and Edwards Lifesciences Corp. (EW  -  Free Report).While the Medical Product subsector’s industry rank indicated a bearish tone, the sector has increased 2.9% in this period. Some players from this space are Haemonetics Corp. (HAE  -  Free Report), Baxter International Inc. (BAX  -  Free Report) and Boston Scientific (BSX  -  Free Report).Zacks' 2017 IPO Watch ListBefore looking into the stocks mentioned above, you may want to get a head start on potential tech IPOs that are popping up on Zacks' radar.

1778,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 results were mixed as it beat estimates for earnings while missing the same for sales. J&J announced its fourth-quarter results on Jan 23 before markets opened.As expected, J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 4.2% on an operational basis in the fourth quarter, better than 3.8% increase seen in the third quarter and 2.4% in the first half.Meanwhile, the acceleration in underlying sales growth in J&J’s Pharma segment seen in the third quarter continued in the fourth quarter.  Pharmaceutical segment sales rose 17.6% year over year in the fourth quarter to $9.7 billion. Also the drug and medical device giant issued a bullish profit outlook for 2018. J&J estimated 2018 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $8.00 - $8.20, reflecting an operational growth rate between 6.8% and 9.6%. The company’s guidance exceeded the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.86 per share.Despite all these positive factors, shares of J&J have declined since the earnings release on what seems to be investor disappointment with the 2018 revenue guidance.In 2018, J&J expects revenues in the range of $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion, reflecting operational constant currency sales growth in the range of 3.5% to 4.5%. However, the sales guidance fell slightly short of the then Zacks Consensus Estimate of $81.55 billion. Organic sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, is expected to be in the range of 2.5%-3.5%, which, though slightly higher than 2.4% seen in 2017, is short of 4.2% recorded in the fourth quarter. The organic sales growth outlook fell short of investor expectation, which resulted in the share price drop.We understand investors’ concern with the projected decline in revenue growth in 2018. However, we do believe that this outlook is conservative, considering that J&J has a history of issuing a cautious outlook, especially at the beginning of the year. We believe that there are several tailwinds this year, which can coax it to improve the projection as the year progresses. Two new drugs were approved last year - Guselkumab/Tremfya in the United States as well as in the EU for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions -  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug, Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive sales higher in 2018. The newly approved products will also contribute to sales in 2018.In 2017, J&J also submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of key drugs including Darzalex (in first-line setting for multiple myeloma), Xarelto (for chronic coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease), Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication), Zytiga (for earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer). It might get FDA nod for these line extensions this year, which can provide top-line support, if launched.This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketamine while apalutamide for pre-metastatic prostate cancer and Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIV, could be approved by the FDA. Also, several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018.Meanwhile, J&J’s Pharma segment sales accelerated in the second half from a weak first half and management seemed confident that the positive trend will continue in 2018. J&J also said on the call that the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve in 2018.We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from acquisitions, mainly Actelion, will support top-line growth.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1779,JNJ,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fourth-quarter and full year 2017 results on Jan 30, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08%.The pharma giant has a fairly decent record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing in one, resulting in an average positive surprise of 0.79%.Pfizer’s shares have risen 18.7% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 24.7% for the industry.Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are likely to contribute meaningfully to the top line.However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for some products (primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in developed Europe), supply shortages in legacy Hospira products, and divesture of the Hospira Infusion Systems unit will continue to hamper top-line growth.Blockbuster drug Enbrel’s sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to see lower sales while lower demand is expected to hurt sales of Viagra.On the third-quarter call, Pfizer said that it is facing supply shortages for products from legacy Hospira portfolio mainly due to capacity constraints and technical issues. At the time of acquiring Hospira in September 2015, Pfizer had estimated that it would take a couple of years to integrate the manufacturing plants and resolve the majority of the supply chain issues. The company also stated that the remediation of the business has taken longer than expected. We expect the supply shortages to hurt sales in the fourth quarter.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks.Two leukemia treatments - Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin (approved in EU in June 2017 and in the United States in August 2017) for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were approved in third-quarter 2017.Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif were approved for line extensions in the fourth quarter while Ixifi, Pfizer’s second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade, was also launched in December.All these new products and line extensions should bring in some additional sales in the fourth quarter.We also expect management to update on the commercialization plans for new approved oral SGLT-2 inhibitor, Steglatro (ertugliflozin) tablets on the conference call. Apart from being approved as a monotherapy to treat type II diabetes, Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name, Segluromet and with Januvia, under the brand name Steglujan.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate is +0.45%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other health care stocks worth considering per our model. These have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jan 26.

1780,JNJ,"We expect Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, to beat expectations when it reports first-quarter 2018 results on April 17, before market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.16%.J&J’s performance has been pretty impressive, with the company exceeding earnings expectations in all the trailing four quarters. The average positive earnings surprise over the last four quarters is 3.09%The J&J stock has depreciated 6.6% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decline of 1.0% recorded by the industry.Factors to ConsiderJ&J’s sales growth accelerated in the second half of 2017, backed by higher sales in the Pharmaceutical segment and improving performance in Medical Devices.In 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong, while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will likely continue to improve.We believe new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex, and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech — Actelion — which J&J bought in June last year, will support the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Pharmaceutical segment in Q1 is $9.5 billion.However, in the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues from pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) products — added from the Actelion acquistion —declined sequentially. It is to be seen if PAH revenues improve in Q1.Meanwhile, biosimilar competition is expected to continue to hurt sales of the key arthritis drug — Remicade — outside the United States.However, J&J does not expect any biosimilar entrants for Zytiga, Prezista, Risperdal Consta, or Invega Sustenna in the United States this year.Regarding the newly-launched Tremfya, J&J noted at the Q4 conference call that the uptake of the product has been decent. The drug recorded sales of $47 million in Q4 which is expected to be higher in the to-be reported quarter. Meanwhile, we expect J&J to discuss commercialization plans for Erleada, its newly-approved prostate cancer drug, at the Q1 conference call. Also, J&J will discuss the initial sales uptake of Juluca— the first dual treatment for HIV developed in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) —  which received the FDA approval in November last year. Juluca is under review in the EU.In the Medical Devices segment, sales are expected to continue to rise in the Vision Care and Cardiovascular units. Diabetes Care unit will continue to remain weak. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Medical Devices segment in Q1 is $6.7 billion.In the Consumer segment, global consumer category slowdown across many of the company’s markets will continue to hurt sales. However, recent acquisitions as well as new products will likely provide some support. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from the Consumer segment in Q1 is $3.35 billion.Meanwhile, higher investments behind the new product launches will continue to thwart profits.Earnings WhispersOur proven model shows that J&J is likely to beat estimates this quarter because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely positive surprise.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate ($2.03 per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate ($2.01 per share), is +1.16%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J has a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of J&J’s Zacks Rank #2 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other large drug/biotech stocks that have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:Amgen, Inc.

1781,JNJ,"Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.'s (KPTI  -  Free Report) shares increased more than 6% on Apr 10 after the company announced that its oral selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound, selinexor (KPT-330), has been granted a fast track designation by the FDA.The company is looking to get the candidate approved for treatment of patients with penta-refractory multiple myeloma, having received at least three prior lines of therapy.The FDA grants a fast track designation to expedite a candidate’s development as well as its faster review to treat serious and unmet medical conditions. With this designation, a candidate is expected to be granted a priority review once it files a new drug application.This news is a huge positive for the company as it comes ahead of the data from a phase IIb STORM study on selinexor, expected by the end of this April. The study is evaluating selinexor with low-dose dexamethasone on 122 penta-refractory multiple myeloma patients.Positive data from the trial will allow the company to submit a regulatory application to the FDA during the second half of 2018. It will also pave the way for selinexor’s accelerated approval in the United States for the given indication.Karyopharm’s shares have rallied 29.6% year to date against the industry’s decrease of 2.2%. We remind investors that Karyopharm is also evaluating selinexor in several mid- and later-phase studies on multiple cancer indications, the most advanced being the phase III study of the candidate in combination with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Velcade on multiple myeloma patients. The company is also planning to evaluate Selinexor on subjects with gynecological malignancies.Notably, last October, Karyopharm entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Japanese company Ono Pharmaceutical for developing and commercializing selinexor for all human oncology indications in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the 10 Southeast Asian countries.Going forward, we expect investor’s focus to remain on the company’s further updates on selinexor.Karyopharm Therapeutics Inc.

1782,JNJ,"After a spell of high volatility driven by uncertainty over global trade policy and the threat of rise in prices of essential commodities, Wall Street is looking for some respite in the upcoming earnings season. Q1 is expected to be one of the strongest in years, both in terms of earnings and revenues. Such solid quarterly profits could provide support to the markets.Earnings expectations are rising of late mostly due to the recently-passed tax reform bill that sharply trims corporate tax rates. Upbeat economic scenario both at home and abroad is also one of the primary factors that will help earnings pick up pace.Given the positive trend, investing in blue-chip stocks that are likely to make the most of the earnings season seems judicious. But, why blue chips? This is because such stocks are positioned to report impressive earnings results as they mostly have a strong balance sheet and solid cash flow.Q1 Earnings Growth Expected to be StrongerBlue chips are expected to soar high as this earnings season unfolds. Total earnings among all sectors are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter, marking the best quarterly performance in more than six years (read more: Q1 Earnings to Take Wall Street by Storm: Top 6 Picks).The gains are likely to be broad-based, with nearly all the sectors expected to report year-over-year earnings growth, except for autos and conglomerates. The energy sector is poised to report highest earnings growth among all sectors. Materials, construction, industrial products, technology, financials, retail/wholesale, and medical to name a few are expected to contribute significantly.Catalysts Behind the Strong ExpectationsThe recent tax code overhaul and a strengthening economy could certainly help blue-chip companies make more money this upcoming earnings season.Republican-Backed Tax PackageRepublicans efficaciously defied opposition from Democrats to pass the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code that trimmed corporate taxes from 35% to 21%. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.A one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will help blue chips bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities. They also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down.Strong Economic GrowthEconomic recovery is also likely to give a boost to profitability of American blue-chip companies. Trump’s economy is in the pink of health, with the unemployment rate remaining at a 17-year low of 4.1% in March, while workers’ hourly wages rose 8 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.82 in the month.The United States at the same time added an average of 202,000 jobs a month in Q1, faster than the average gains in the same period of 2017 and 2016. U.S. consumer sentiment in March reached its highest level since 2004, courtesy of a healthy job market.The global economy too is estimated to expand at a rate of 3.1% year over year in 2018. This comes on top of a promising 3% growth rate in 2017, per the World Bank.4 Blue Chips to Buy Heading into Earnings SeasonBlue chips are poised for a strong earnings season, mostly in response to the corporate tax cut policy and robust economic growth both at home and abroad.This calls for investing in some fundamentally sound blue-chip companies which can make the most of the earnings season. We have, thus, zeroed in on four such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV  -  Free Report) provides a range of commercial and personal property, and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations, and individuals. Considering a more comprehensive earnings history, Travelers Companies has an average four-quarter positive earnings surprise of 43.1%.

1783,JNJ,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Utilities and Industrials with 20.9%, 19.7% and 19.2% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens. It has AUM of $2.0 billion and charges a fee of 28 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Industrials and Health Care with 20.2%, 18.7% and 17.5% allocation, respectively.The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil XOM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 5.0%, 4.6% and 4.1% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 22.0% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date. XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell), with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report)XLU is one of the most popular funds in the utility space. The fund has AUM of $7.3 billion and is a relatively cheaper bet as it charges a fee of 13 basis points a year. It has an 11.4% allocation to NextEra Energy (NEE  -  Free Report), 8.0% to Duke Energy (DUK  -  Free Report) and 7.8% to Dominion Energy (D  -  Free Report).

1784,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, announced that the FDA has granted approval to its prostate cancer drug, Zytiga, (abiraterone acetate) in combination with prednisone to treat an early stage of prostate cancer.Notably, Zytiga, was earlier approved in both the United States and the EU to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in treatment-experienced patients, whose chemotherapy contained docetaxel.  With this latest nod from the regulatory body, the drug’s label has been expanded to treat newly-diagnosed patients with metastatic high-risk castration-sensitive prostate cancer (CSPC).Zytiga was approved for treatment of newly diagnosed CSPC patients in the EU in November 2017. The company also submitted regulatory filings for the combination therapy in Japan, Canada, Mexico, Switzerland, Singapore and Philippines for the given indication.J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has increased 10.8%, comparing favorably with the industry’s 10.1% rally. The FDA approval for the expanded patient population was supported by encouraging data from a pivotal phase III LATITUDE study, evaluating Zytiga/prednisone’s combination on CSPC patients with no prior experience of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Data from the trial demonstrated a statistically significant and improvement in overall survival in the given patients’ population. The combination regimen showed a reduction in death risk by 38% compared with placebos.It is important to note that Zytiga is one of the most important and successful products in the company’s oncology portfolio. The drug’s sales surged 45.5% to $755 million in fourth-quarter 2017 owing to an improved share in a growing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer market. It was the highest prescribed oral medication in the United States for patients with metastatic CRPC in 2016.Approval for the combination therapy on CSPC patient population should increase Zytiga’s sales in the future quarters.Incidentally, another marketed drug for CSPC patients, having received docetaxel therapy, is Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Japanese company, Astellas Pharma’s, combined Xtandi (enzalutamide).Though Zytiga is facing patent challenges in the United States, the company anticipates no impact from generic competition for the drug this year. Also, J&J is confident that it can absorb the effect of any potential Zytiga headwind, should there be an earlier-than-expected generic launch in 2018.Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson Quote Zacks Rank & Key PicksJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Two better-ranked stocks in the health care sector are Exelixis, Inc. (EXEL  -  Free Report) and XOMA Corporation (XOMA  -  Free Report).

The company had announced the receipt of a binding offer from Platinum Equity in March.The LifeScan unit makes blood glucose monitoring products and generated revenues of $1.5 billion last year.J&J stock has declined 12.3% this year so far, which compares unfavorably with a decrease of 4% recorded by the industry.The move was in line with J&J’s strategic plans for its diabetes business. The company has been planning to streamline its non-core assets since last year. As part of the streamlining efforts, J&J had announced the closing of operations at its Animas Corporation diabetes care unit in October last year. The company has arranged a deal with medical device maker, Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) for the transition of patients on Animas insulin pump to Medtronic pump. Meanwhile, J&J also received an offer of $2.8 billion from Fortive Corporation (FTV  -  Free Report) earlier this month for its Advanced Sterilization Products business.Moreover, sales in J&J’s Diabetes Care franchise declined 9.7% in 2017 to $1.6 billion due to price decline and competitive pressure.

1787,JNJ,"Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced the discontinuation of two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease (AD) candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC).The IDMC said that the AMARANTH study evaluating lanabecestat in early Alzheimer's disease and the DAYBREAK-ALZ study in mild Alzheimer's disease dementia were unlikely to meet the primary endpoints upon completion, leading to the decision to discontinue the studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor. The companies claim that the recommendation to stop the studies was not based on safety concerns.As Lilly does not expect to incur significant costs related to these discontinuations, it maintained its previously issued 2018 earnings guidance. Meanwhile, the 2014 partnership between Lilly and AstraZeneca to develop a BACE inhibitor remains intact.Lilly and AstraZeneca are also developing another treatment for Alzheimer's disease, an antibody targeting beta amyloid in early-stage studies.Year to date, Lilly’s shares have risen 1.7% against the industry’s decline of 3.7%.This is not the first failure for Lilly in the Alzheimer’s disease market, In November 2016, Lilly’s anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly also suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.The Alzheimer’s disease market has attracted a lot of attention from several companies. However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage Alzheimer’s disease, due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal Alzheimer’s disease as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s disease due to lack of efficacy.In late 2017, Biogen’s Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concern about the candidate’s chances of success.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Lilly currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1796,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 8.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 25%.Geron’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 111.1% while the industry witnessed a decline of 10.9% in the said time frame.Pipeline in FocusGeron’s revenues solely comprise license fees and royalties as it has no approved product in its portfolio. Moreover, it has only one candidate in its pipeline, imetelstat. Hence, investor focus will remain on any updates related to it.Geron is developing imetelstat in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) for treating patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (“MF”), myelodysplastic syndromes (“MDS”) and acute myelogenous leukemia (“AML”).Two late-stage studies for imetelstat are ongoing – IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of MF, and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of MDS.In the fourth quarter of 2017, Geron expanded the Part I of IMerge and enrolled 20 additional patients in a refined MDS population to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier. Consequently, research & development expenses are expected to be on the higher side in the soon-to-be reported quarter.Janssen will decide on continuation of part II of IMerge based on data from expanded part I.In March 2018, Geron announced that the phase II IMbark study will be continued without modifications based on the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed during the third internal review. However, J&J is planning to amend the protocol of the study to allow long-term treatment of patients. A decision on the continuation of the study is expected to be announced in the third quarter of 2018.We note that J&J did not provide any update on imetelstat when it reported first-quarter results last month.Investors are solely banking on the continuation and success of these two studies. We expect the company to provide an update on the path forward for imetelstat development on the first-quarter conference call.Surprise HistoryGeron’s performance in the last four quarters was mixed, with the company surpassing expectations twice, meeting the same once and missing once. The average positive surprise over the last four quarters is 3.75%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Geron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 4 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Geron’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Geron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Geron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteStocks That Warrant a LookHere are some biotech stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Aptevo Therapeutics Inc.

1797,JNJ,"Last year turned out to be pretty good for pharma and biotech stocks as far as FDA decisions are concerned. The regulatory body approved 46 novel drugs, easily surpassing 2016’s total tally of 22.Landmark decisions last year include the approval of a couple of gene-based therapies for cancer – Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Kymriah and Gilead Sciences’ (GILD  -  Free Report) Yescarta. These therapies have the potential to change the way we look at cancer treatments.With just a quarter gone by this year, the FDA has already granted approval to six new treatments. Key approvals include J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor Erleada (apalutamide) for pre-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC), Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated’s (VRTX  -  Free Report) third medicine to treat the underlying cause of CF, Symdeko, which is a combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor, Gilead’s once-daily single tablet HIV regimen Biktarvy and Novartis’s Lutathera for certain gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming, plus requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Let’s take a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of April.Note that this month, the FDA has already approved Pacira Pharmaceuticals’s Exparel for a new indication as a nerve block for regional analgesia and Clovis Oncology’s PARP inhibitor Rubraca as maintenance therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.Second Indication for Novartis’ Kymriah: On Apr 30, the FDA is expected to give its decision on Novartis’ supplemental biologics license application (BLA) looking for approval of Kymriah for its second indication. With the latest filing, Novartis is looking to get Kymriah approved for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBLC) — most common form of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma — who have failed two or more prior therapies. Kymriah was approved for the treatment of a deadly cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia last August. According to the company’s annual report, 10-15% of DLBLC patients do not respond to initial therapy or relapse within three months of treatment, indicating the significant market potential for Kymriah in the DLBLC indication.FDA Decision on Mallinckrodt’s Label Expansion of Amitiza in Children: Mallinckrodt plc’s (MNK  -  Free Report) supplemental new drug application (sNDA) looking to get its constipation drug Amitiza approved for paediatric functional constipation between six and 17 years, is under review. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Apr 28. Amtiza was added to Mallinckrodt’s portfolio with the February acquisition of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.Amitiza is already approved for chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in adults, irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) among adult women and opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in patients with chronic non-cancer pain. According to the company’s press release, Amitiza, if approved for paediatric functional constipation, would be the first and only prescription medication specifically approved for such patients, who have limited treatment options to address their disease.Will an FDA Panel Back GW Pharmaceuticals’ Epidiolex and Incyte/Lilly’s Olumiant? An FDA panel is expected to give its opinion on GW Pharmaceuticals’ lead cannabinoid pipeline candidate, Epidiolex, next week. GW Pharmaceuticals is looking to get Epidiolex approved as an adjunctive treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (“LGS”) and Dravet syndrome. Both are highly treatment-resistant forms of childhood-onset epilepsy.With the FDA granting priority review to Epidiolex’s NDA, a response from the FDA is expected by Jun 27, 2018. Epidiolex represents blockbuster potential especially if it is approved across all possible indications.An FDA panel is also expected to give its opinion this month on Incyte/Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) Olumiant (baricitinib) for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. In April 2017, the companies had received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for baricitinib. The FDA required additional clinical data. TheNDA for Olumiant was re-submitted in January. Olumiant has already been launched in select European countries and in Japan, and fetched sales of $46 million in 2017.Although the FDA takes the recommendations of its panels/advisory committe into account while reviewing applications, it is not bound to follow the same.FDA Decisions for Rigel’s Tavalisse and Ultragenyx’s Burosumab on April 17: The FDA is expected to give its decision on Rigel Pharmaceuticals NDA for Tavalisse (fostamatinib) for the treatment of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) on Apr 17. Rigel is preparing for the launch of this oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor in the second quarter, if approved. Existing therapies to treat chronic ITP include steroids, blood platelet production boosters (TPOs) and splenectomy. However, still the disease remains inadequately treated in many patients. This means that if approved, Tavalisse should enjoy significant market potential.Another FDA decision expected on Apr 17 is on Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical’s BLA for burosumab to treat pediatric and adult patients with X-Linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH). Burosumab was approved for treating XLH by the trade name of Crysvita in the EU in February.FDA to Decide on Prometic’s Ryplazim: This FDA decision, expected on Apr 14, will be on Canadian biotech Prometic Life Sciences’ biologics license application (BLA) for Ryplazim for the treatment of congenital plasminogen deficiency. Ryplazim enjoyed Orphan Drug and Fast Track Designations by the FDA for the said indication.Bristol Myers’ Opdivo+Yervoy Combo to Get FDA Approval? Bristol Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) has filed an sBLA looking get its blockbuster drug Opdivo approved in combination with its another cancer drug Yervoy in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). The FDA decision is expected in Apr 16.In clinical studies, the combination has demonstrated superior overall survival (OS) compared with the current standard of care sunitinib in intermediate- and poor-risk patients. This bodes well for the drug given the potential in the targeted market.The PD-1 inhibitor is presently approved in several countries including the United States, the EU and Japan for several cancer indications. Label expansion should boost Opdivo’s sales further. Opdivo generated sales of almost $5 billion in 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1798,JNJ,"The FDA’s refusal to review Alkermes plc’s (ALKS  -  Free Report) depression candidate ALKS 5461 this week was a major setback for the company. The decision sent Alkermes’ stock tumbling more than 21%.ALKS 5461, a once-daily oral medication has been developed for the adjunctivetreatment of major depressive disorder (“MDD”) in patients, who have not responded to standard antidepressant therapies.The FDA refused to review the candidate stating that the new drug application (“NDA”) did not have enough evidence that the oral medication will work. The FDAwas of the opinion that additional studies should be conducted to ascertain the drug’s effectiveness for the proposed indication.It goes without saying that unexpected pipeline setbacks like these, shift investors’ focus to companies that market or are developing drugs for the treatment of depression. Alkermes’ latest pipeline setback has shifted investors’ focus to this market. Depression and Types Depression is a medical condition that affects the brain. Individuals with depression feel melancholic and have intricacy in enjoying routine activities. Factors such as stress and brain chemistry are the most common causes of depression. It can also be genetic.There are different forms of depression such as persistent depressive disorder, perinatal depression disorder, psychotic depression, seasonal affective disorder and bipolar depression. Psychotic depression, persistent depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are the most severe forms of depression. According to WHO as of May 30, 2016, an estimated 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression and have been seen to carry suicidal tendencies. Thus, there rose a pressing need to develop drugs for this condition. Known as antidepressants, these drugs are instrumental in identifying the signs and symptoms of the ailment.Several pharma and biotech companies are involved in developing and selling of anti-depressantdrugs.4 Stocks in FocusLet us look at some of the companies that are actively pursuing the development of treatment for various types of depression.Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report): This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, looks well-positioned in the depression market. The company has quite a few products in its portfolio including Vraylar (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder), Viibryd (major depressive disorder) and Saphris (bipolar I disorder). These drugs are also in several label expansion studies. Earlier this week, Allergan announced that a pivotal study evaluating Vraylar for the treatment of adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression) met the primary endpoint.Moreover, Allergan moved rapastinel, its NMDA receptor modulator, into phase III development for major depressive disorder. Rapastinel, a potentially game-changing treatment, is expected to be launched in 2021. The drug is expected to generate revenues of $1-$2 billion. Rapastinel was granted breakthrough therapy status for adjunction major depressive disorder by the FDA in 2016.Allergan is also evaluating its flagship product, Botox, for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Allergan has outperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares have moved up 1.7% against the industry decline of 4.7%.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report): Healthcare giant, J&J has a strong presence in the neuroscience segment, which is one of its core therapeutic areas. While the company has products like Risperdal Consta (schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder) in its portfolio, one of the most promising candidates in J&J’s pipeline is esketamine, an investigational antidepressant medication with blockbuster potential. Esketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, which has a novel mechanism of action, got breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide in 2016. Esketamine has been granted breakthrough therapy designation for treatment-resistant depression and a regulatory application for this indication in the United States is expected to be filed this year.J&J, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, has underperformed the industry year to date. The company’s stock has lost 6.7% compared with the industry decline of 3.3%.

The company’s shares have declined 6.9% compared with the industry’sdecline of 3.2%.Sage Therapeutics, Inc. (SAGE  -  Free Report): Sage is another company working on the development of CNS treatments.

1799,JNJ,"Major bourses made a remarkable comeback on Apr 4, with the Dow Jones gaining more than 700 points from trough-to-peak. Initially, the bourses had plunged below key technical levels after China retaliated with threats to impose tariffs on a number of American goods.But stocks rebounded after investors gauged that the tariffs threats are merely negotiating tactics and both the sides won’t risk a full-blown trade war. After all, trade conflicts dent corporate profits and impede economic expansion. President Trump also downplayed fears over tariffs announced by both China and the United States.As trade war worries dissipate and the broader market moves north, investing in stocks making the most of the recovery seems judicious.Wall Street’s Massive RecoveryThe Dow Jones rebounded from 510 points, or 2.1% plunge, to finish the session up about 230 points, or 1% on Apr 4. The blue-chip index, thus, registered its best single-session comeback since Feb 6, when blue chips had slipped 2.33% to end at 2.33%.The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq staged their biggest intraday turnarounds since Feb 9, when the S&P tumbled 1.9% but ended with a gain of 1.5% and the Nasdaq logged a gain of 1.4% after being down 2.2% on that day.On Apr 4, the S&P gained 30 points, or 1.2%, while the Nasdaq rose 101 points, or 1.5%, eventually erasing steep opening losses. With such gains, the S&P closed above its 200-day moving average for the second-straight day, indicating encouraging long-term trends. The S&P, in particular, gained in back-to-back sessions for the first time since Mar 9. The Nasdaq, in the meanwhile, ended in the positive territory for the year.What Led to the Initial Losses?Concerns about a potential trade war between the United States and China had unnerved investors. China’s Ministry of Commerce plans to impose tariffs on 106 U.S. products, including soybeans and airplanes, affecting $50 billion worth of goods.American soybean manufacturers are likely to face steep losses, as they export almost $13 billion out of the $20 billion yearly agricultural sales to China. Investors are also selling shares of airline manufacturer The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. CAT. These behemoths have huge business operations in China, thus, their revenues and profits are vulnerable to trade disputes.China retaliated after the Trump administration levied duties on 1,300 Chinese exports, worth $50 billion. The list includes video monitors, electromagnets used in MRI machines, aerospace products, and machinery. U.S. levied tariffs on China to punish the second-largest economy for theft of trade secrets including software and patents.Trade War Worries LessenBut, investors soon realized that the countries do not want a full-blown trade war despite the tit-for-tat tariff threats. After all, a trade war is a big worry for corporate America as its profits will be hurt if trade restrictions are put. It may also deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.Lest we forget, market pundits expect Q1 earnings results to be quite impressive, while Trump’s economy is in good shape with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Total earnings for the S&P companies are estimated to improve 16% from the same period last year on 7.4% higher revenues, the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in seven years. Such an uptick will follow 13.5% earnings growth on 8.5% revenue improvement last quarter (read more: Looking Ahead to the Q1 Earnings Season). The White House also played down the notion of a trade war. Trump’s chief economic advisor, Larry Kudlow told reporters that he is willing to resolve the trade disputes with minimum hassle.And when it comes to Trump, we all know that his actions are not as tough as his rhetoric. How can we forget that he was supposed to impose hefty tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum? But, he chose to give exemptions to countries like Mexico, Canada, the European Union, South Korea, Australia, Brazil and Argentina after his top allies threatened retaliation.Top 5 Winners Not only did major indices end up more than 1% in the last trading session, but these also have the scope to scale higher on reduced trade war fears. We have, thus, selected five stocks that can make the most of the encouraging trend. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc.

Other growth drivers were core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga and Invega Sustenna. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).In the quarter, J&J recorded pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) revenues of $610 million. The $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion in June last year diversified J&J’s revenues to the PAH category and added 4.2% to sales growth in 2017.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 28% due to higher managed care discounting. Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), declined 9.7% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 8.5% and international sales declining 18.7% due to biosimilar competition.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including approval for Tremfya (guselkumab) in the EU (November) for plaque psoriasis and Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) - the first dual treatment for HIV – in the United States.

Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta  faced generic competition, we believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion led to better sales trends in the second half of 2017 compared to the first half. The 2018 profit outlook is also quite upbeat.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1801,JNJ,"Alzheimer’s, a fatal illness that causes progressive decline in memory, has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made in spite of significant investments (both funds and resources).On Tuesday, Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and its Swiss partner AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) said they are discontinuing two late-stage studies on their Alzheimer’s disease candidate, lanabecestat, on recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). The IDMC said that the two studies were unlikely to meet their primary goals upon completion. This prompted the decision of stalling the studies on the oral beta secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitor.Several companies have failed to develop safe and effective treatment options for this deadly brain disease.In May this year, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) halted development of atabecestat, its investigational BACE inhibitor, which was being developed for preclinical stage AD due to safety concerns.In February this year, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) discontinued the second late-stage study evaluating its BACE inhibitor verubecestat for the treatment of prodromal AD as its success was unlikely. In February last year, Merck discontinued a late-stage study evaluating verubecestat for mild-to-moderate AD due to lack of efficacy.In January, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas. Long back, Pfizer had shelved its late-stage AD candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies.In late 2017, Biogen’s (BIIB  -  Free Report) AD study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive results, which raised investors’ concerns about the candidate’s chances of success.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational AD candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of AD.Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.This may be somewhat because the underlying causes of severe neurological ailments like Alzheimer’s may not be as clear as diseases like cancer. Also, Alzheimer’s progress may go unnoticed for years.  By the time, the symptoms of the ailment become evident, significant functions may be already lost, which makes developing drugs to treat this disease difficult.Interest Still Alive in the AreaDespite the setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments, given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Eisai, AstraZeneca and Amgen are presently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises mid as well as late-stage candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE 1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.Lilly and AstraZeneca are also developing another treatment for Alzheimer's disease, an antibody targeting beta amyloid in early-stage studies.Earlier this year, the FDA proposed new guidelines, which are aimed at lowering the clinical study goals of Alzheimer’s disease drugs aimed to treat earlier-stage patients who have not yet displayed functional disability or clinical abnormality. This strategy is part of FDA’s ongoing efforts to expand access to safe and effective treatment options for many serious conditions. These efforts by the FDA may also reinvigorate research efforts for Alzheimer’s drugs after repeated failures.Lilly and Merck carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1802,JNJ,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.05 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents by 6.1%. Earnings rose 19.3% year over year attributable to slightly higher sales and lower R&D costs in the quarter.Including a $1.4 billion charge related to the formation of a collaboration with Eisai, first-quarter 2018 earnings per share were 27 cents compared with earnings of 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.Revenues for the quarter rose 6% year over year to $10.04 billion. Sales, however, slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.12 billion. Currency movement positively impacted revenues by 3%. Excluding currency impact, sales rose 3% year over year.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $8.92 billion, up 9% (up 4% excluding Fx impact) year over year mainly as strong sales of PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda, Gardasil  and Bridion offset lower sales of other key therapies – RotaTeq, Zepatier (hepatitis C) and Zostavax (prevention of shingles). As in the previous quarters, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.Keytruda, the largest product in the Merck portfolio, brought in sales of $1.5 billion in first-quarter 2018, up 12.9% sequentially and 151% year over year. Sales continued to be driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in first-line setting.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.The Keytruda development program is also progressing well in 2018 with several regulatory decisions for new indications in the United States as well as in Europe pending for the year. The label expansion, if approved, will expand the patient population, which should drive sales higher.Zepatier brought in sales of $131 million, down from $378 million in the year-ago quarter, due to increased competition and declining volume, which is expected to continue in 2018.Bridion (sugammadex) Injection generated sales of $204 million in the quarter, up 38% year over year, driven by strong global demand.Meanwhile, combined sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cancidas (lost exclusivity in Europe in 2017), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) declined almost $200 million in the quarter.Remicade sales declined 27% to $167 million in the quarter. Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the United States while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug within the country.Cancidas sales plunged 25% to $91 million in the quarter. The Zetia/Vytorin franchise recorded sales of $471 million, down 18% due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin.Sales of Isentress declined 8% to $281 million in the quarter. The Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise sales rose 7% to $1.4 billion as higher international sales were partially offset by lower U.S. sales due to continued pricing pressure.Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales rose 24% to $660 million as lower sales in the United States were offset by commercial launch in China and strong growth in Europe. Continued transition to two-dose regimens impacted volumes unfavorably in the United States.Zostavax sales declined 58% to $65 million in the quarter as it faced strong competition from Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) newly approved shingles vaccines, Shingrix.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1.1 billion, up 13% (up 7% excluding Fx impact) from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products, and growth in the ruminants and poultry business.Gross Margins Decline & R&D Costs Increase                    Adjusted gross margin came in at 75.7%, down 170 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Marketing and administrative (M&A) expenses were $2.5 billion in the reported quarter, up 2%. Research and development (R&D) spend decreased 1% to $1.8 billion in the quarter due to lower licensing costs, partially offset by increased investment in pipeline and early drug development.2018 Guidance RaisedMerck raised its outlook for 2018 revenues to the range of $41.8 billion – $43.0 billion (previously $41.2 billion – $42.7 billion). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $41.83 billion. The revenue guidance includes approximately 2% positive impact from currency fluctuation.The company now expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.16–$4.28, raising it from the previous guidance of $4.08–$4.23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.18 per share. The adjusted earnings guidance includes approximately 1% positive impact from currency fluctuation.Adjusted operating expenses are still expected to increase year over year at a low- to mid-single digit rate.Our TakeMerck’s first-quarter results were mixed as the company beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. It also raised its guidance for 2018.Shares were down 1.5% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Merck’s shares have outperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have risen 4.6% in the period, against a 4.4% decrease for the industry.All eyes were on the performance of Keytruda, which is being touted as a key long-term growth driver for Merck. The drug continued its robust performance on strong demand trends. With several label expansions slated for this year, sales are expected to increase further. However, the significant decline in sales of Zostavax and Zepatier due to rising competitive pressure remains a concern. Meanwhile, generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line.Merck & Co., Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Merck & Co., Inc.

PTG-100 was the most advanced candidate in the company’s pipeline.Shares of the company fell 57.2% following the news. In fact, Protagonist’s shares are down 57.9% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s decline of 5.9% in that period.The discontinuation decision was based on a planned interim analysis of PROPEL study by an independent Data Monitoring Committee. The committee deemed that the study will not be able to achieve its primary endpoint of clinical remission. The interim analysis was done on data from first 65 patients who had completed the 12-week treatment with PTG-100. The total patient population of the study was 240.However, the company is conducting an extensive review of the data from the study. It has notified that it will stop further treatment of patients currently in the study.Protagonist has also postponed its decision to initiate a phase II/III on PTG-100 in patients with chronic pouchitis, as it awaits full review of the interim data from the PROPEL study.Apart from PTG-100, the company is developing two candidates – PTG-200 and PTG-300 – in two separate phase I studies for the treatment of Crohn's disease and beta-thalassemia, respectively.The company has a worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) for the development of PTG-200.

1804,JNJ,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has withdrawn from the race to buy Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Consumer Healthcare segment.Last October, Pfizer had said that it was exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and it may ultimately opt to retain the businessGlaxo’s chief executive officer, Emma Walmsley said that management is interested in deals that will improve the company’s returns and not “compromise on its priorities for capital allocation”.Pfizer is having a tough time finding a buyer for its Consumer Healthcare segment, Last week, British company Reckitt Benckiser Group also pulled out of the discussion with Pfizer to buy the latter’s Consumer Health segment. After, Reckitt Benckiser backed out, Glaxo was seen as the frontrunner to buy Pfizer’s unit.Shares of Glaxo were up around 3.5% on Friday in response to this positive news. Glaxo’s stock has risen 7.3% this year so far, against a decline of 4.6% for the industry.In a separate press release, Pfizer announced that its shingles vaccine, Shingrix has gained regulatory approval in Japan and EU. Please note that Shingrix was approved in the United States and Canada in October last year. Also, Shingrix enjoys preferential recommendation from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Last year, the ACIP recommended thepreferentialuse of Shingrix for prevention of shinglesover Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Zostavax.In yet another release, Glaxo announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of Europe has granted a positive opinion, recommending approval of Juluca,a two-drug regimen(dolutegravir and rilpivirine), once-daily, single pill for HIV.Juluca becomes the first two-drug pill to be approved in Europe.

1805,JNJ,"Alkermes plc (ALKS  -  Free Report) announced submission of a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA for its pipeline candidate, ALKS 5461. The NDA seeks an FDA approval for the candidate’s usage in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). If approved, this would be the first therapeutic option for patients with depression with a novel mechanism of action.We remind investors that in October 2013, the FDA had granted a Fast Track status to ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in patients with an inadequate response to the standard antidepressant therapies. The Fast Track designation from the FDA facilitates the development and expedites the review of drugs that are intended to treat serious conditions and address medical needs.Alkermes’ shares have underperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has gained 4.5% compared with the industry’s increase of 4.9%. Notably, the NDA submission was supported by encouraging efficacy and safety data package from more than 30 clinical trials conducted on more than 1,500 patients with the aforementioned indication. The candidate has demonstrated antidepressant activity, safety and tolerability across all development programs.In June 2017, the company initiated a phase IIIb study on MDD patients evaluating ALKS 5461. The subjects enrolled in the trial had earlier shown inadequate response to commonly prescribed depression drugs.Per the company’s press release, around 17 million are annually diagnosed with MDD in the United States of which, a large number does not get sufficient relief from the first-line standard antidepressant therapy. Hence, approval of this drug will provide the company with access to a huge patient population base looking for a new treatment to apprehend this serious mental illness.Allkermes’ revenues continue to be driven by proprietary products, Vivitrol and Aristada, and partnered products namely Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta, Invega Sustenna/Xeplion, Invega Trinza/Trevicta, Acorda Therapeutics’ (ACOR  -  Free Report) Ampyra/Fampyra and AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Bydureon.Notably, the company’s progress with pipeline candidates targeting major CNS (central nervous system) disorders such as, schizophrenia, addiction, depression and multiple sclerosis, has been impressive. Successful development and subsequent commercialization of other interesting candidates like ALKS 3831 (phase III – schizophrenia), ALKS 8700 (phase III – multiple sclerosis) and ALKS 6428 (phase III – to help physicians transition patients from physical dependence on opioids to Vivitrol) would lend a huge boost to the company.Alkermes PLC Price Alkermes PLC Price | Alkermes PLC Quote Zacks RankAlkermes carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1806,JNJ,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that it received a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency, recommending addition of an updated overall survival (OS) data from a phase III head-to-head study on the label of its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis (carfilzomib).The phase III ENDEAVOR study was conducted on 929 patients. Data from the trial demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone (Kd) led to superior overall survival when compared with Takeda Pharmaceutical’s Velcade plus dexamethasone (Vd) in second-line multiple myeloma setting. Findings showed that the combination therapy reduced the risk of death by 21% and increased OS by 7.6 months compared with Vd in the given patients’ population.Importantly, in January 2018, Amgen announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to include OS data from the ENDEAVOR program on Kyprolis’ label. The FDA’s decision comes much earlier than expected, initially expected in April this year.Note that the Kd regimen is already approved in the United States, EU and other countries based on the primary analysis of a progression-free survival in the ENDEAVOR study. This overall survival data, if approved, can help drive the usage of Kyprolis and boost its sales.We remind investors that Kyprolis is also approved in the United States as a single agent for treating patients with multiple myeloma, who have received at least two prior therapies including Velcade and an immunomodulatory agent.Significantly, Amgen collaborated with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) in November 2016 to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for addressing the case of multiple myeloma. Under the terms of the agreement, the first study — a phase III registrational trial, evaluating the combo therapy of Kyprolis/Darzalex and dexamethasone compared with Kyprolis and dexamethasone alone on patients with multiple myeloma, having undergone one, two or three prior lines of therapy — has been initiated.Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry in a year’s time. The stock has rallied 22.1%, comparing favorably with the industry’s increase of 8%. Incidentally, Kyprolis, which became part of Amgen’s portfolio following its acquisition of Onyx, registered sales of $608 million in the first nine months of 2017, up 18.9% compared with the year-ago figure. The drug’s label expansion would immensely expand the patient population as well as its commercial potential.Per the company’s press release, multiple myeloma is an aggressive disease, accounting for approximately one percent of all cancers. Moreover, around 39,000 patients are annually diagnosed with multiple myeloma in Europe, of which, almost 61.5% of the cases proves to be fatal. Hence, the market opportunity of the combination therapy is huge in the EU to cater to the unmet need of patients with an additional option to apprehend the life-threatening disease.Amgen Inc.

1807,JNJ,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) adopted a positive opinion for the marketing authorization of the proposed biosimilar of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade (infliximab).The CHMP recommended the approval of the biosimilar for all the indications of the branded drug across gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology. We note that Remicade is approved to treat Crohn's Disease in adults and children, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and plaque psoriasis.The positive opinion was based on a comprehensive data package that is expected to confirm the biosimilarity of infliximab to the original drug with analytical, preclinical and clinical data matching across quality, efficacy and safety.Earlier, the phase III confirmatory study in rheumatoid arthritis (REFLECTIONS B537-02) met its primary endpoint, demonstrating equivalent efficacy of proposed Sandoz biosimilar infliximab to the reference medicine as measured by the American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20) response at week 14.  Novartis’ shares have declined 4.5% over a year, compared with the industry’s fall of 3.7%.Novartis generic arm, Sandoz, is a leader in biosimilars with five marketed products. The marketed biosimilars include — Omnitrope, a human growth hormone; Binocrit, an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent used to treat anemia; filgrastim for neutropenia under the brand names Zarzio outside the United States and Zarxio in the United States; Rixathon (biosimilar rituximab), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases (also approved in the EU as Riximyo under a duplicate marketing authorization); and Erelzi (biosimilar etanercept), approved in Europe in 2017 to treat multiple inflammatory diseases.  The FDA also approved biosimilar Erelzi in 2016. However, the launch is pending in the United States due to an ongoing litigation with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report).EMA is due to review CHMP’s opinion.  We note that Sandoz acquired the biosimilar of infliximab from Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) in February 2016 for the 28 EU countries plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein that form the EEA. Per the terms, Pfizer retains commercialization and manufacturing rights to infliximab (PF-06438179) in countries outside the EEA.Meanwhile, Sandoz has quite a number of biosimilars in its pipeline. A tentative approval will further boost the company’s generic division. The company has also filed for approval of a biosimilar of adalimumab and pegfilgrastim in the EU.Apart froma strong generic portfolio, Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu, and Kisqali. The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR-T therapy space.Zacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1812,JNJ,"Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a line extension for its IL-17A inhibitor drug, Cosentyx, in moderate-to-severe scalp psoriasis. The FDA approval comes on the back of positive efficacy and safety outcomes from a dedicated phase III study – SCALP – in patients with scalp psoriasis.We note that the drug was approved for a similar indication in Europe in June 2017. It is already approved for the treatment of plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ankylosing spondylitis (“AS”).Per the press release, scalp psoriasis is one of the difficult to treat forms of psoriasis, which affects about half of the approximately 125 million patients with the disease. The line extension of the drug is an important achievement as treatment of scalp psoriasis with topical agents or phototherapy is challenging due to the presence of hair and other factors.Novartis’ shares have returned 13.7% in the past year, compared to the industry’s gain of 14.1% in the same period. The SCALP study evaluated the subcutaneous administration of Cosentyx (300 mg) for 12 weeks. Data showed significant improvement in patients compared to placebo.Cosentyx’s performance was impressive in 2017. It achieved multi-blockbuster drug status on the back of strong growth in all the approved indications. Sales of the drug increased 82% in 2017 to surpass the $2 billion mark.The drug has shown superiority in clinical studies to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Amgen’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in treating psoriasis. Novartis is also conducting head-to-head clinical trials – EXCEED and SURPASS – to evaluate the superiority of Cosentyx versus AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira in PsA and to a proposed biosimilar of Humira in AS, respectively.The superiority of the drug over Stelara and Enbrel has helped it gain market share. Potential superiority over Humira and its biosimilar along with this line extension in scalp psoriasis will certainly boost the prospect of the drug.Novartis AG Price  Novartis AG Price | Novartis AG QuoteZacks RankNovartis carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1813,JNJ,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 98 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents by 4.3%. Earnings rose 10.1% year over year as slightly higher sales, lower taxes and higher other income made up for higher R&D costs in the quarter.Including a $2.6 billion provision related to U.S. tax reform, fourth-quarter 2017 loss per share was 32 cents compared with a loss of 22 cents per share in the fourth quarter of 2016.Revenues for the quarter rose 3% year over year to $10.43 billion. Sales, however, slightly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.45 billion. Currency movement positively impacted revenues by 1%. Excluding currency impact, sales rose 2% year over year.Lost sales in some markets due to a network cyber-attack in June hurt the top line. However, sales in the quarter were boosted by the addition of sales from the terminated (December 2016) vaccine joint venture with Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) in Europe (approximately $140 million).Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $9.29 billion, up 4% (up 3% excluding Fx impact) year over year as continued strong sales of PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda  and Bridion offset lower sales of key vaccines - HPV vaccine Gardasil/Gardasil 9 in the United States and Zostavax (prevention of shingles). As in the previous quarters, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.Keytruda, the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio, brought in sales of $1.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2017, up 23.5% sequentially and 169% year over year. Sales continued to be driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer as it is the only anti-PD-1 approved in the first-line setting.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with regulatory approvals for six new indications in the United States, four in Europe and three in Japan. The approvals expanded the patient population, driving sales higher.Zepatier brought in sales of $296 million, down from $468 million in the previous quarter.Bridion (sugammadex) Injection generated sales of $209 million in the quarter, up 50% year over year, driven by strong demand.Meanwhile, combined sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cancidas (lost exclusivity in Europe in 2017), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) declined $500 million in the quarter.Remicade sales declined 31% to $186 million in the quarter. Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the United States while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug within the country.Cancidas sales plunged 37% to $95 million in the quarter. The Zetia/Vytorin franchise recorded sales of $509 million, down 42% due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin.Sales of Isentress also declined in the quarter while the Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise remained soft in the quarter.The Januvia/Janumet franchise recorded sales of $1.52 billion in the quarter, up 1% from the year-ago quarter as higher global volumes partially offset the impact of continued pricing pressure.Isentress sales declined 9% in the quarter to 308 million. Lower volumes/demand due to competitive pressure hurt sales of Isentress.Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales rose 17% to $633 million as lower sales in the United States were offset by commercial launch in China and strong growth in Europe. Unfavorable timing of public sector purchasing and partial replenishment of borrowed doses of Gardasil/Gardasil 9 into the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) stockpile adversely impacted Gardasil’s sales in the United States. However sales rose in Europe were boosted by the addition of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi.Zostavax sales declined 45% to $121 million in the quarter as it faced strong competition from Glaxo’s (GSK  -  Free Report) newly approved shingles vaccines, Shingrix.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $981 million, up 11% (up 14% excluding Fx impact) from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products, primarily Bravecto, companion animal vaccines and growth in the ruminants business.Gross Margins Decline & R&D Costs Increase                     Adjusted gross margin came in at 74.6%, down 20 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter.Marketing and administrative (M&A) expenses were flat at $2.6 billion in the reported quarter Research and development (R&D) spend increased 18% to $2.1 billion in the quarter due to increased investment in pipeline and early drug development. Higher business development expenses also raised R&D costs in the quarter.2017 ResultsFull-year 2017 sales of $40.12 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $40.23 billion. Revenues were within the guidance range of $40.0 billion – $40.5 billion. Sales rose 1% year over year.Adjusted earnings for 2017 were $3.98 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.95 per share as well as the guidance range of $3.91–$3.97. Earnings rose 5.3% year over year.2018 GuidanceRevenues are expected in the range of $41.2 billion – $42.7 billion in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $41.28 billion. The revenue guidance includes approximately 1% positive impact from currency fluctuation.The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.08–$4.23. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.09 per share. The adjusted earnings guidance includes approximately 1% negative impact from currency fluctuation.Adjusted operating expenses are expected to increase year over year at a low- to mid-single digit rate.Merck also said that on expectation of an improved cash position following the tax reform, it plans to invest approximately $12 billion over the next five years in capital expenditures. Approximately $8 million of this investment will be made in the United States.Our TakeMerck’s fourth-quarter results were mixed as the company beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. It also issued in-line guidance for 2018.Shares were down slightly in pre-market trading. In the past year, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have declined 6.9% in the period, comparing unfavorably with a 20.8% increase for the industry.All eyes were on the performance of Keytruda, which is being touted as a key long-term growth driver for Merck. The drug continued its robust performance on strong demand trends. However, the significant decline in sales of Zostavax due to rising competitive pressure was a concern. Meanwhile, generic competition for several drugs and pricing pressure will continue to be overhangs on the top line.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1814,JNJ,"Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of 94 cents per share exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 85 cents and the year-ago quarter earnings of 84 cents.Total revenues of $5.19 billion were slightly higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.18 billion and increased 5% from $4.93 billion recorded in the year-ago period. Strong sales of Opdivo and Eliquis contributed to the top line in the reported quarter.Shares of the company were up almost 0.5% in pre-market trading, possibly on better-than expected earnings. However, Bristol-Myers’ shares have declined 17% so far this year, which compares unfavorably with the industry’s decrease of 4.9%.Quarterly DetailsRevenues were up 1% year over year when adjusted for foreign exchange impact. Revenues increased 1% to $2.8 billion in the United States and 10% outside the country. Ex-U.S. revenues were up 1% when adjusted for foreign exchange impact.Leukemia drug Sprycel raked in sales of $438 million, down 5% year over year. U.S. sales for the drug were down 13% to $214 million. A label expansion of the drug in pediatric patients in the United States last November presumably did not have much impact on sales.Rheumatoid arthritis drug, Orencia, was up 11% in first-quarter 2018 to $593 million. Melanoma drug, Yervoy contributed $249 million to the top line during the reported quarter, down 25%. U.S. sales for the drug were down 33% to $162 million.Opdivo, which is approved for multiple cancer indications, generated revenues of $1.51 billion, up 34% from the year-ago period.Sales of cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, were $1.51 billion during the reported quarter, up 37% year over year. Multiple myeloma drug, Empliciti recorded sales of $55 million, up 4% year over year.However, the performance of key drugs in the Virology unit continues to disappoint. Sales of Baraclude declined 20% to $225 million. The Reyataz and Sustiva franchises deteriorated 36% and 54% year over year to $124 million and $84 million, respectively. The Hepatitis franchise lost 98% of its year-ago quarter sales and contributed a mere $3 million to revenues.Research and development (R&D) expenses in the quarter decreased 4.1% to $1.25 billion. Marketing, selling and administrative expenses declined 9.7% to $980 million.Gross margin was 69.5% in the quarter compared with 74.3% in the year-ago quarter due to change in product mix.Regulatory UpdateSubsequent to the quarter in April, the FDA approved Opdivo+Yervoy combination regimen for treating intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in patients who have not received any prior treatment. In March, the FDA had granted priority review to a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) seeking approval of the combination regimen for treating microsatellite instability-high or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer.Also, in April, the FDA granted priority review to the sBLA seeking approval of Opdivo monotherapy in patients with small cell lung cancer in third or later line setting. A new dosing regimen for Opdivo, 480 mg every four weeks, was also approved for the majority of indications.CollaborationsIn April 2018, Bristol-Myers collaborated with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, to develop and commercialize its Factor Xia inhibitor program, including BMS-986177, for treating major thrombotic conditions. In the same month, Bristol-Myers and privately-held Illumina, Inc. announced a collaboration to utilize the latter’s next-generation sequencing technology.In February, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report) entered into a strategic development and commercialization collaboration for Nektar’s lead immuno-oncology program, NKTR-214. Per the collaboration, the companies will develop and commercialize NKTR-214 in combination with Opdivo and Opdivo plus Yervoy in more than 20 indications across nine tumor types, as well as potential combinations with other anti-cancer agents from either of the respective companies and/or third parties. Both the companies plan to initiate studies in renal cell carcinoma and melanoma in mid-2018.Pipeline UpdateIn April 2018, Bristol Myers announced data from a phase III study, Checkmate-227, which showed superior progression-free survival in first-line non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) treated with Opdivo – Yervoy combination compared to chemotherapy. In January 2018, Bristol-Myers announced positive data from Phase II CheckMate-142 study evaluating the combination of Opdivo and Yervoy in patients with DNA mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC).The company also announced data from the phase III study, CheckMate-078, evaluating Opdivo in Chinese population. Data showed that the drug achieved superior overall survival in previously-treated patients with NSCLC as compared to docetaxel.Data from a long-term follow up phase III study – CheckMate -141 – showed that Opdivo reduced risk of death by 32% in metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck after a minimum two years of follow-up compared to standard chemotherapy.In March, Bristol-Myers along with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced data from a real-world data analysis of different direct oral anticoagulants including Eliquis, J&J’s Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. Data showed that Eliquis achieved significantly lower rates of both stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding compared to both Xarelto and Pradaxa.2018 Guidance UpdatedBristol-Myers increased its adjusted earnings expectations for 2018. The company now projects earnings in the range of $3.35 to $3.45 per share (previously $3.15 to $3.30). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $3.22. The company expects worldwide revenues to increase in mid-single digits.Our TakeBristol-Myers beat earnings expectations, primarily on robust sales of Opdivo and Eliquis in the quarter. The increase in 2018 guidance for adjusted earnings was also encouraging. We are positive on Bristol-Myers’ efforts to develop its pipeline, especially Opdivo. Several label expansion applications for Opdivo are under review in the United States and Europe. Potential approval will further boost the prospects of this blockbuster drug. Also, superiority of Eliquis in real world data analysis is expected to further boost sales of the drug.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteBristol-Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The stock hit the new high probably on a Reuters news which states that some Chinese bidders are planning to buy a J&J’s diabetes care unit in the country in a deal which could be worth $4 billionAs it is, J&J stock has had a great run in the past year. Shares of J&J have rallied 28.1% over a year while the industry has registered an increase of 21.5%. Promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions over a year kept the stock on a growth trajectory.

1816,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, will report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.56%.J&J’s shares have gained 28.7% in the past year, outperforming the 21.9% increase witnessed by the industry it belongs to.Its earnings beat expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.12%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderWe believe that strong performance of the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from acquisitions like Actelion and Abbott Medical Optics should pull up J&J’s top line in the fourth quarter. However, higher investments in product launches may put pressure on profits as in the third quarter.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017.  However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see a continuation of the positive trend in the fourth quarter and probably in 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelaraand Darzalex and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech Actelion, which J&J bought in June 2017 will support the top line.However, biosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of key arthritis drug, Remicade outside the United States.Two new drugs were approved last year. These include Tremfya (guselkumab) in the United States (July) as well as in the EU (November) for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States (November). Juluca is under review in the EU.Regarding Tremfya, J&J said on the third-quarter conference call that it has been well received by physicians and patients. The drug is likely to contribute to sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter. We expect an update on the commercialization plans of Juluca on the fourth quarter conference call.In the Medical Devices segment, sales will continue to gain mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition. Diabetes Care unit is however expected to remain weak.The hurricanes in Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico hurt sales growth in the last reported quarter due to lost surgery days. On the third-quarter call, the company had said that though supply disruptions were not anticipated, it was not clear at that time if the surgical procedures missed in the third quarter could be recovered in the fourth. Some pricing issues in India and system outage in Europe also hurt sales to an extent. It remains to be seen if the issues were resolved this time around.In the Consumer segment, global consumer category slowdown across many of the company’s markets will continue to hurt sales. However, recent acquisitions as well as new products are likely to provide some support.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that J&J is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.09%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the large-cap pharma sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Feb 2.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jan 30. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.30% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1817,JNJ,"The Dow endured a volatile week during which the index hit a fresh record high. A fall in bank shares led to losses for the index on Monday. The index slipped on Tuesday following positive news from a major component. Surging treasury yields led to losses for the index on Wednesday. Ultimately, the index surged to a record high on Thursday following investor optimism over economic growth.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.9% last Friday due to optimism built around the implementation of the GOP Tax Bill. Such broad-based gains ensured an improvement for three major benchmarks, negating the effects of dismal economic data.Nonfarm payrolls for the month of December came in at 148,000, lower than the consensus estimate of 190,000 job additions. Further, the U.S. trade deficit increased 3.2% in November to settle at $50.5 billion. This is its highest deficit since January 2012. The ISM Services Index for December declined 1.5 points to 55.7%.The index added an impressive 220.7 points on Friday to finish the session above the 25,000 milestone for the second straight day. This marked its third-straight record close in last four trading sessions — its best opening week since 2006. Gains for the blue-chip index were rather broad based.Over last week, the index gained 2.3%. This marked the Dow’s best weekly run since Dec 1, 2017. During this period the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time. This was the index’s fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896.Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains. Favorable economic data, including an upbeat manufacturing report and record construction spending boosted markets.The Dow This WeekThe index lost almost 0.1% or nearly 13 points on Monday due to a fall in bank shares that snapped its winning run. This marked an end to its four-day streak of gains. The blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 25,311.99 earlier in the session but suffered broad based losses to finish in the negative territory.Shares of major banks such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) declined by 1.5% and about 0.4% respectively and weighed on the Dow. Bank shares declined after analysts estimated that there would be one-time charges to the fourth quarter earnings that the banks would suffer due to the implementation of tax reforms.The index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following reports that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow.The index lost 0.1% on Wednesday after yields on the 10-year benchmark note surged following reports that China was considering halting purchase of U.S. Treasuries. Markets also suffered losses after reports from Canada surfaced that its government expects Trump to pull out of NAFTA soon. Meanwhile, cost of imported goods in the United States surged to a six year high.The index gained 0.8% or 205 points on Thursday hitting another all-time high following investor optimism over economic growth. Shares of Boeing gained 2.4%, emerging as the largest contributor for the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer will likely be one of the major beneficiaries of higher economic growth. Meanwhile, the PPI index declined by 0.1%, moving lower for the first time in more than a year.  Components Moving the IndexBoeing’s 2017 deliveries show a 2% rise in commercial shipments and 5.9% decline in defense shipments, on a year-over-year basis.

1818,JNJ,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) has been hogging the limelight for developments in the flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system — FreeStyle Libre System.The company has been witnessing solid growth in the global Diabetes Care business, primarily on the back of solid contributions from FreeStyle Libre. Accordingly, it is leaving no stone unturned to cash in on the growing popularity of this CGM system that eliminates the need for daily finger sticks.Developments in FreeStyle LibreFollowing the FDA approval in September 2017 for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system, Abbott recently achieved another major milestone after U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) granted FreeStyle Libre approval for Medicare coverage. Post approval, FreeStyle Libre has become the only no- user calibration CGM device, under the Medicare coverage, available for around 30 million people with diabetes in the United States.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its Diabetes Care segment. Last September, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 21 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System in June 2017. This drove the Diabetes Care segment, which saw revenue growth of 37.6% in third-quarter 2017 on continued acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We believe the latest CMS reimbursement grant will boost the company’s performance in the domestic arena as well.We expect Freestyle Libre to contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry approved national reimbursement for the device last May.Market PotentialAn ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare are likely to drive growth further in the diabetes market. Moreover, per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the recent regulatory approvals for FreeStyle Libre have come at an opportune moment.However, this market is dominated by well-established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Share Price MovementMoreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last three months, the company’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 7.8%, in comparison with the broader industry’s 5.2% gain.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical sector are Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.

1819,JNJ,"Focus this week was on the 36th annual JPMorgan healthcare conference where several biotech and pharma companies provided a preliminary look at their results for 2017 and also provided pipeline updates as well as their outlooks for 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesKey Takeaways from JPMorgan Healthcare Conference: Several pharma companies were present at the 36th annual JPMorgan healthcare conference, the largest and most informative healthcare investment symposium in the industry. Among key updates, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) said that it expects 2018 to be a rich data delivery year. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) also provided a look at its pipeline including opportunities for Opdivo. The company also said that business development remains an important priority with the focus being on deals that make sense from a financial perspective and where the assets and technologies are strategically aligned to its priorities and are potentially transformational. Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) is also on the lookout for business development deals while exercising financial discipline. The company said that it is looking at opportunities through licensing deals and bolt-on acquisitions to add drugs/technology that address unmet medical needs (Read more: Key Takeaways from Pfizer & 3 Other Drug Stocks at Healthcare Conference). Allergan was also present at the conference with its preliminary financial outlook for 2018 (Read more: Allergan's Sales Guidance for 2018 Lower Than Expected). GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report), meanwhile, is looking to strengthen its pharma pipeline by prioritizing its development capital focus on two core (respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases) and two potential therapy (immuno-inflammation and oncology) areas. Glaxo is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novo Nordisk Goes Public With Ablynx Proposal: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) confirmed that it is looking to acquire Belgium-based biopharma company Ablynx. Novo Nordisk had initially proposed to acquire Ablynx for €26.75 per share in cash. However, the company came back with a revised offer when Ablynx rejected the first proposal. Novo Nordisk’s latest offer includes an upfront cash payment of €28 per share plus a contingent value right (“CVR”) worth up to €2.50 per share (total equity valuation of approximately €2.6 billion). This offer, too, has been rejected by Ablynx with the company’s Board announcing that the proposal fundamentally undervalues Ablynx and its growth prospects.A look at Ablynx’s pipeline shows that the company could well be in a position to launch its first product, caplacizumab (anti-vWF; acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - aTTP), this year. Caplacizumab is currently under review in the EU while a regulatory application will be filed in the United States in the first half of 2018. The estimated annual market opportunity for aTTP, a life-threatening blood clotting disease, is expected to be about €1.2 billion. The company also has a broad range of partnerships with the potential to generate more than €10.6 billion in milestones plus royalties. Other pipeline candidates also address significant market opportunities. While currently there are no rumors about additional bidders, the EU approval of caplacizumab could well change this scenario.As far as Novo Nordisk is concerned, the acquisition would make sense with caplacizumab being a good fit for the company’s hematology portfolio. The deal would also give a boost to Novo Nordisk’s pipeline especially given the continued pricing pressure within diabetes care, particularly in the United States (Read more: Novo Nordisk Confirms Bid for Ablynx But Faces Rejection).Sanofi & Regeneron Boost R&D Investment in Dupixent and Cemiplimab: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron have decided to boost their investment in the development of cemiplimab (a PD-1 antibody) in oncology and Dupixent (an IL-4/IL-13 pathway-blocking antibody) in type 2 allergic diseases. Based on this decision, investment in cemiplimab will shoot up to at least $1.64 billion, an increase of approximately $1 billion from the initial agreement, with both companies contributing equally. Cemiplimab is being studied as monotherapy as well as in combination with other therapies in a wide range of cancers including advanced skin cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, cervical cancer and lymphomas. Regulatory applications for cemiplimab in advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma are scheduled to be submitted in the European Union and the United States in the first quarter of 2018.  Meanwhile, Dupixent, currently approved for eczema, has the potential to be evaluated for additional indications including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peanut allergy and grass allergy and in patients who have multiple allergic conditions. This is in addition to ongoing development in pediatric atopic dermatitis, pediatric asthma, eosinophilic esophagitis and nasal polyposis. Regeneron and Sanofi are currently seeking FDA approval for Dupixent in uncontrolled, persistent asthma in patients at least 12 years old.Another candidate that should benefit from the additional investment is REGN3500, an IL-33 antibody, with potential in atopic dermatitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Development Updates from Merck: Merck provided late-stage data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, as monotherapy for surgically resected high-risk melanoma. Keytruda met the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (“RFS”).Merck also announced that the FDA has accepted its regulatory applications for doravirine, its investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (“NNRTI”) for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults. A response from the agency is expected by Oct 23, 2018.The FDA also granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to Eisai’s Lenvima (lenvatinib) in combination with Keytruda for the treatment of patients with advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s) (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Combo Gets Breakthrough Therapy Status).Merck’s stock is down 7.4% over the last one year, compared to the 18.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% over the last five trading sessions. Among major stocks, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was up 3% while Pfizer declined 0.6%.

Nevertheless, we will see many major reports from noteworthy consumer-facing brands in other industries, so investors will want to be paying attention to all the news.In the coming weeks, we will see reports from the world’s biggest and most relevant companies, meaning that investors need to be prepared for the ensuing movement that is likely to occur throughout the market.According to the latest report from Sheraz Mian, the head of the Zacks Equity Research department and an acknowledged earnings expert, earnings growth is expected to be positive for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors—and growth rates are projected to hit the double digits for our Energy, Technology, Construction, Industrial Products, Basic Materials, and Automotive groups.Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you. Using the Earnings Calendar, we looked ahead to next week and selected some of the biggest reports to watch. Make sure to keep an eye on these companies as they prepare to report during the week of January 22.Johnson & Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report)Personal healthcare and pharmaceuticals behemoth Johnson & Johnson is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results before the market opens on January 23. The company basically never missed earnings estimates, and shares have gained a respectable 29% over the past year. JNJ is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as it approaches its report date.Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect to see Johnson & Johnson report earnings of $1.72 per share and revenues of $20.22 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 9% and 12%, respectively. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex, and contributions from recent acquisitions should support the company's top line. Ford Motor Company (F  -  Free Report)Automotive manufacturing giant Ford is slated to announce its latest quarterly earnings results after the market closes on January 24. The company has met or surpassed estimates in three consecutive quarters, but the stock has dropped in the wake of management's warning that 2018 profits will be softer than expected. Still, Ford is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), primarily because of favorable near-term outlook.Based on our current consensus estimates, Ford is expected to post earnings of $0.44 per share and revenues of $37.15 billion, which would mark growth of 47% and 3%, respectively, from the year-ago period. Nevertheless, an update on the company's forward-looking guidance will likely be what drives the stock in the wake of the report. Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report)Coffee king Starbucks is scheduled to release its latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell on January 25. Starbucks is a pretty consistent earnings performer, but year-over-year comparisons have tightened and the stock has gained just 6% over the past 52 weeks. SBUX is sporting a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) as we approach the release of its report.According to our latest consensus estimates, Starbucks is projected to post earnings of $0.57 per share and revenues of $6.15 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 10% and 7%, respectively. Digital initiatives like mobile pay, delivery services, and third-party loyalty partnerships can stimulate stronger sales trends in the Americas, while China will remain a key growth market for the company. Want more stock market analysis from this author?

1821,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) has one of the most diverse revenue streams in the industry within the pharmaceutical division, which accounts for almost half of its revenues. The company has several multi-million dollar drugs covering a broad range of areas such as neuroscience, cardiovascular and metabolism; immunology; oncology; pulmonary hypertension; and infectious diseases/vaccines. However, several products in this segment are facing generic competition.J&J’s shares have gained 28.7% in the past year, outperforming the 23.3% increase witnessed by the industry it belongs to.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017.  However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see, a continuation of the positive trend in the fourth quarter and probably in 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Pharmaceutical segment is $9.61 billion. Last quarter, segment sales beat the consensus estimate.We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech, Actelion which J&J bought in June, will support the top line. The Pharma segment will also continue to benefit from easier comps in the second half of 2017 compared with the first. Continued share gains are likely to drive sales of Imbruvica (cancer indications) and Stelara (psoriasis). Strong adoption for the newer indication of Crohn's disease is expected to contribute to Stelara growth. Also, strong adoption in outside U.S. markets and accelerated adoption in the United States across all lines of therapy are likely to drive sales of multiple myeloma product, Darzalex. These positives will offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions in  the second and third quarters of 2017 —  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. The line extensions can expand the eligible patient population of these drugs and drive their sales in the fourth quarter.Two new drugs were approved last year. These include Tremfya (guselkumab) in the United States (July) as well as in the EU (November) for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States (November). Juluca is under review in the EU.Regarding Tremfya, J&J said on the third-quarter conference call that it has been well received by physicians and patients. The drug is likely to contribute to sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter. We expect an update on the commercialization plans of Juluca on the fourth quarter conference call.However, biosimilar competition is expected to hurt sales of key arthritis drug, Remicade outside the United States. Please note that J&J markets Remicade in partnership with Merck (MRK  -  Free Report).Overall, strong performance of the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from acquisitions like Actelion and Abbott Medical Optics should pull up the top line in the quarter. Meanwhile, higher investments for product launches will continue to hurt profits as had been the case in the third quarter.

Sandoz and Biocon both have had some success in the biosimilar space. Sandoz’s portfolio includes five biosimilars marketed in various countries across the world. The company is currently seeking FDA approval for its biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster immunology drug, Humira. The regulatory application for the biosimilar was recently accepted for review by the FDA.Pfizer-Gilead in Clinical Trial Collaboration: Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has entered into a clinical trial collaboration with Kite, a Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) company, under which the safety and efficacy of Kite’s CAR-T cell therapy, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel), will be evaluated in combination with Pfizer’s utomilumab, a fully humanized 4-1BB agonist monoclonal antibody, in patients with refractory large B-cell lymphoma.

1823,JNJ,"Investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks seems judicious as they are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows for the investor.The drug sector had a good run in 2017, bouncing back after drug pricing issues dampened its performance in 2016. Importantly, the sector saw a considerable increase in new drug approvals last year. The FDA approved 46 novel drugs last year, more than double of 2016’s tally of 22.The Large Cap Pharma industry witnessed an impressive rally in 2017, up 16.3% against a decline of 5.2% in 2016. The run was propelled by encouraging quarterly results, increased demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion. Strong clinical study results and continued strong performance of legacy products also boosted the sector.These factors are expected to play an instrumental role in 2018 as well, which may take the large-cap drug sector to new highs. The industry is already up 3.9% so far this year.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #100, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.The passing of the tax overhaul bill by the Congress is a cherry on the top. The slashing of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% is likely to further boost profit margins.Moreover, the cash repatriation window allowed in the bill will help companies to bring in cash stashed in foreign locations, leaving these companies with extra cash in hand. This may lead to strategic deals like merger and acquisitions this year, which were relatively fewer in 2017.Most drug companies with a large market cap have seen their share price rise in 2018 so far. Here we present four companies, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report), Zoetis Inc. (ZTS  -  Free Report) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), which outperformed the industry last year and have the potential to repeat the same performance in 2018.Johnson & JohnsonThe company's stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The company’s shares were boosted by the approval of two drugs, Tremfya for plaque psoriasis and Juluca for HIV, along with several line extensions to its major drugs including Xarelto, Simponi Aria, Stelara and Imbruvicain 2017.The trend is expected to continue in 2018. J&J has several regulatory applications for label expansion of its key drugs under review. Potential approval to these line extensions will certainly boost the company’s growth prospects. Meanwhile, there are several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones lined up for 2018.Moreover, J&J’s pharma segment’s growth accelerated in third quarter of 2017 after slowing down in the first half due to a number of factors including competition for some key drugs like Remicade and Concerta. The upside is expected to continue in 2018.AbbVieThe stock of the company was up 54.4% in 2017. The company holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In 2017, the company reported a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies, regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica and settlement of its Humira patent disputes with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report).AbbVie also expects several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones in 2018, which is expected to further aid the company. The data readout from the pivotal phase III TRINITY study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer will be an important catalyst for the stock. Moreover, a FDA decision is expected on the new drug application (""NDA"") for elagolix for endometriosis, which was granted priority review in October last year.AbbVie’s blockbuster drug, Humira, has been performing well despite competitive pressure. The company expects the drug’s performance to continue, which will boost the topline. Imbruvica is also doing consistently well with multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.Novo-NordiskShares of the company increased 49.7% in 2017. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3.This company was granted approval to expand the label of its diabetes drug, Victoza, to include treatment of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes in August 2017. Moreover, a new diabetes drug, Fiasp, received approval in September 2017 for treating adults with diabetes. In December 2017, the FDA approved Ozempic, a semaglutide once-daily pre-filled pen to improve glycaemic control in type II diabetes patients. It also received approval for Rebinyn for hemophilia B in the United States and Refixia for the treatment of adolescents and adults with the same indication in Europe.In 2018, the company expects a U.S. launch of Ozempic and an approval for the same in Europe, which will certainly boost the company’s revenues.Moreover, the company serves almost half of the insulin market and a quarter of the diabetes market. The growing diabetes market will certainly boost the topline.ZoetisThe company's shares rose 34.6% in 2017. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The company has a diversified portfolio of livestock and companion animal products. In2017, the company increased its share of the dermatology products for dogs market to 59%. The companion animal business has been performing well, along with the launch of Apoquel and Cytopoint. The company acquired Nexvet Biopharma last year, which boosted its pipeline of solutions for chronic pain management in dogs and cats. The company also expanded the reach of its poultry diagnostics products into major European markets.In 2018, Zoetis topline is expected to benefit from Cytopoint, which was launched in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company expects cattle herd size to increase in 2018, which will drive growth.ConclusionWith a strong product portfolio, consistently successful pipeline developments and anticipated growth in demand for drugs, these companies will likely attract investor attention this year as well.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1824,JNJ,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its regulatory application to include overall survival (OS) data from the head-to-head ENDEAVOR study on the label of its multiple myeloma drug, Kyprolis. Please note that the FDA’s decision comes much earlier than expected. It was initially expected in April.Amgen had submitted the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) to the FDA in July last year. The regulatory application in the EU seeking approval to include OS data from ENDEAVOR study was also submitted in the same month.Data presented from the ENDEAVOR study earlier had demonstrated that a combination of Kyprolis plus dexamethasone led to superior overall survival when compared to Takeda’s Velcade plus dexamethasone in second-line multiple myeloma setting. The Kyprolis plus dexamethasone arm reduced the risk of death by 21% and increased OS by 7.6 months compared to the combination of Velcade plus dexamethasone.While Kyprolis is already approved for this patient population, the overall survival data should help drive usage and boost sales.Other ongoing studies for Kyprolisinclude a phase III ARROW study, which is evaluating a weekly dosing regimen of Kyprolis in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients and a phase III ASPIRE study evaluating a triple combination regimen of Kyprolis plus Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid (lenalidomide) and dexamethasone (KRd) in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma compared to Revlimid and dexamethasone (Rd).Amgen has also formed collaboration with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) to study the combination of Kyprolis and J&J’s Darzalex in multiple clinical studies for the treatment of multiple myeloma.Kyprolis generated sales of $207 million in the third quarter of 2017, recording year-over-year growth of 13% driven by higher demand and robust uptake from outside U.S. markets.Shares of Amgen were up more than 1% on Wednesday. In the past year, Amgen’s shares have returned 22.2%  compared with 3.8% increase registered by the industry.Amgen carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked biotech stock is Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1825,JNJ,"The fourth-quarter 2017 earnings season is in full swing with financial figures from 133 S&P 500 members or 26% of the index already out as of Jan 26, 2018 per the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these index members jumped 12.3% from the year-ago quarter, driven by 8.8% improvement in revenues. The beat ratio was 81.2% for the bottom line and 78.9% for the top line.On a positive note, the ongoing earnings phase seems to have begun well for the Drug/Biotech sector. Among major large cap players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off the season with earnings beating estimates while sales slightly missing the same. A few other large pharma companies released their earnings results last week and the picture looks quite encouraging.The pharma bigwigs having reported last week are Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), which surpassed both earnings and sales estimates in the quarter under review. While Novartis raised its sales guidance for 2018, AbbVie increased its previously issued earnings expectations for the year.Of the major players in the biotech sector, Biogen (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced a mixed performance in the reported period with earnings lagging estimates while sales exceeding the same. However, Celgene Corp. (CELG  -  Free Report) outpaced both the metrics’ expectations during the fourth quarter.Drug/biotech stocks remained on a growth trajectory in 2017, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals, rise in demand for new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical reports as well as a continued robust performance of legacy products. Moreover, these impressive factors, along with regular acquisitions, are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018 as well.Also, per the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 4.9% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 4.2% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Two pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Jan 31. Let's see how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly is scheduled to release fourth-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 1.94% last quarter. Lilly’s earnings performance has been modest with earnings missing expectations in three of the last four quarters while beating the same in the remaining one, thus bringing the average beat to 1.68%.Our proven model shows that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Lilly’s Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP as a solid Zacks Rank, and a positive Earnings ESP of +0.47% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the impending report. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $1.08 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.We expect a sturdy uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo. This upside is likely to make up for the decline in sales of established products like Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient in the fourth quarter. (Read More: Lilly to Report Q4 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)Vertex is slated to release fourth-quarter earnings after the market closes. The company’s track record has also been impressive so far. It delivered a positive surprise in each of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 32.67%. In third-quarter 2017, Vertex came up with a positive surprise of 43.24%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Vertex is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -4.00% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Vertex’s cystic fibrosis (CF) drugs, Kalydeco & Orkambi, performed consistently in the first three quarters of 2017.

Other news included a purchase offer for J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) diabetes device unit and successful study results announced by Heron Therapeutics (HRTX  -  Free Report) and Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report).Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesAbbVie’s Rova-T Falls Short in Key Lung Cancer Study: AbbVie’s promising cancer candidate, rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T fell short of expectations in a phase II TRINITY study evaluating it in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC). AbbVie said it will not seek accelerated approval of Rova-T in the third-line setting after consulting with the FDA. Rova-T was added to AbbVie’s portfolio, following the $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016. AbbVie had significant confidence in Rova-T’s potential. The failure of TRINITY has raised skepticism on Rova-T’s potential and has brought into question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal.

A decision regarding the same is expected to be made this year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business. Glaxo also said it has withdrawn from the race to buy Pfizer’s unit.Heron’s HTX-011 Succeeds in Phase III: Heron Therapeutics’ pipeline candidate, HTX-011 met the primary endpoint in two pivotal phase III studies, evaluating it in post-operative pain control, following bunionectomy and hernia repair, respectively. Top-line data from both the studies showed that treatment with HTX-011 led to statistically significant reductions in pain intensity and opoid use through 72 hours following surgery.

1827,JNJ,"The Dow traversed rough waters once again this week, a period which was marked by troubles for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and the Fed’s latest policy statement. Concerns over Facebook’s data security policies arose following a whistleblower’s damaging revelations this week. Investors also remained focused on the central bank’s latest policy meeting. Trade war related concerns also surfaced with China preparing to retaliate against Trump’s latest actions on this front.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased 0.3% last Friday following better than expected readings for industrial output. Industrial production surged 1.1% in February, comfortably surpassing the consensus estimate of 0.3% for the period.This marked its highest reading since October 2017.Investors braced for higher volatility due to Friday being a quadruple-witching day. Meanwhile, news surfaced that Trump will soon fire his national security advisor H.R. McMaster.The index lost 1.5% last week.  During this period, President Trump fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, former CEO of Exxon Mobil Inc. (XOM  -  Free Report). Further, special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly subpoenaed Trump Organization for Trump’s business-related documents.This factor along with trade war fears weighed on investor sentiment. President Trump was expected to levy fresh tariffs on Chinese imports and announced that U.S.’s trade deficits with China will be reduced significantly in the process.The Dow This WeekThe index decreased 1.4% on Monday following concerns over Facebook’s policies regarding privacy of user data. Shares of Facebook declined 6.8% in a single session on Monday to post its worst dip in a day since March 26, 2014. The Dow lost 335.6 points to finish in negative territory, with all of its 30 components save for Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), finishing in the red.With this decline the blue-chip index turned negative for 2018, trading at -0.4%. Shares of Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) declined 2.8%, emerging as the worst performing Dow component. Meanwhile, market watchers also speculated over the possibility of a rate hike post the culmination of the Fed’s two-day FOMC meet on Wednesday.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday, supported by a rally in energy shares after oil prices settled at their highest level for the month. Meanwhile, investors closely followed the FOMC’s policy meeting. Shares of Facebook continued to decline after the Federal Trade Commission decided to probe the data debacle which has taken markets by storm.The Dow gained 119 points on Tuesday to end in positive territory a day after losing more than 300 points earlier in the session. The day’s gains for the blue-chip index were buoyed by a surge in the shares of Boeing and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), which gained 1.8% and 1.7%, respectively.The index increased 0.2% on Wednesday following the much expected quarter-point rate hike by the Fed. However, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) adhered to its December forecast of three rate hikes for 2018.The central bank also increased its GDP projection for 2018, paving the way for future rate hikes. Meanwhile, existing home sales rebounded in February following back-to-back declines in the two months prior to the current period.The Dow lost almost 45 points to end in negative territory on Wednesday. Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined 2.3%, adding to the blue-chip index’s woes. However, the Dow surged more than 250 points at its session highs.The index slumped 2.9% on Thursday after the specter of a damaging trade war with China triggered a broad selloff. Consequently, the Dow finished at its lowest point since Feb 8, the second lowest close recorded so far this year. Currently, the index is 10% lower than the all-time high achieved earlier this year.Additionally, the Fed’s latest policy statement raised questions about the path of interest rate hikes. Also weighing on markets were ongoing troubles at Facebook, a factor which dragged tech stocks lower.

1828,JNJ,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced disappointing results from a pivotal phase II study, evaluating its promising cancer candidate rovalpituzumab tesirine or Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC).AbbVie said it will not seek accelerated approval of Rova-T in the third-line SCLC setting after consulting with the FDA.AbbVie’s stock crashed more than 12% on Thursday in response to the news. The stock has returned 2.1% this year so far, comparing favorably with a decrease of 0.2% recorded by the industry.The TRINITY study is a single-arm study without a comparator. It is evaluating the efficacy of Rova-T for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC with high expression of the protein DLL3 and who have received at least two previous treatment regimens, including at least one platinum-based regimen. SCLC is characterized by poor outcomes with very few treatment choices available.In the study, the best overall response rate was 29% while the objective response rate was only 16%. The median duration of response was 4.1 months. The median overall survival rate was 5.6 months while the probability of survival at 12 months was 17.5%. The results were much lower than what the company had hoped for and not significant enough to be prioritized for accelerated approval.However, phase III studies of Rova-T in the first- and second-line settings, MERU and TAHOE, respectively, are ongoing. However, investor concerns about the success of these remaining studies increases after the failure of TRINITY.Rova-T was added to AbbVie’s portfolio following the $5.8 billion acquisition of Stemcentrx in June 2016. AbbVie had significant confidence in Rova-T’s potential and believed the candidate had blockbuster potential. AbbVie had, in the past, guided peak sales for Rova-T at $5 billion. The failure of TRINITY has raised scepticism on Rova-T’s potential and has brought into question the viability of the Stemcentrx deal.  Rova-T is also being evaluated in an early-stage eight-arm ""basket study"" in neuroendocrine tumors.Rova-T was a key candidate in AbbVie’s oncology pipeline. AbbVie’s key cancer drug at present is Imbruvica, marketed in partnership with J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report). Imbruvica, currently approved for quite a few indications, has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand Imbruvica’s label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.AbbVie is also conducting studies on another cancer drug, Venclyxto/Venclexta to expand the label to address the broader relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patient population, expand into earlier lines of therapy, and broaden into other hematologic malignancies like multiple myeloma and AML. Data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL presented in September last year showed that the combination led to a profound improvement in progression free survival compared to Teva Pharma’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) Treanda plus Rituxan. Regulatory applications seeking approval for this combination use are under review in the United States.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Consumer Staples sector--about 19.70% of the portfolio.

1830,JNJ,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (VRTX  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 61 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents and came ahead of the year-ago earnings of 35 cents. Strong product revenues led to higher profits in the quarter and lower operating expense ratio year over year.Vertex reported revenues of $651.6 million in the fourth quarter, up almost 42% year over year driven by strong product revenues. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $596.13 million.Fourth Quarter Sales StrongVertex’s fourth-quarter revenues consisted of sales from cystic fibrosis (“CF”) products — Kalydeco and Orkambi, collaborative ($29.1 million) and royalty revenues ($1.3 million). CF product revenues were $621.2 million in the fourth quarter, up 37% year over year.Kalydeco sales surged 44% to $256 million following approvals to treat an expanded population.In May 2017, Kalydeco was approved for use in CF patients 2 years and older who have one of 23 residual function mutations in the CFTR gene. In August 2017, Kalydeco was approved in CF patients (2 years and older) who have one of five residual function mutations that result in a splicing defect in the CFTR gene. These line-extensions increased the eligible patient population for Kalydeco.Orkambi (lumacaftor/ivacaftor) delivered sales of $365 million, up 32% year over year. The growth was supported by continued uptake globally, especially in pediatric patients in the United States.Costs RiseAdjusted research and development (R&D) expenses increased 20.3% to $249.2 million in the fourth quarter due to higher costs related to development of triple combination CF regimens. Adjusted selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 20% to $105.5 million.2017 ResultsVertex’s full-year revenues increased 46.2% year over year to $2.49 billion mainly driven by upfront payment of $315.2 million earned from Germany-based Merck KGaA  and strong CF portfolio sales. The upfront payment was part of a collaboration agreement per which Vertex out-licensed four oncology programs to Merck KGaA. Adjusted earnings for 2017 were up 129% year over year to $1.95 per share.Adjusted R&D expenses increased 10.8% year over year to $1.33 billion. However, it excluded an upfront payment of $160 million related to acquisition of a CFTR potentiator, VX-561, from Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CNCE  -  Free Report). Adjusted SG&A expenses increased 9% year over year to $375.3 million, which included costs related to the potential launch of tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination in the United States. The increase was also due to increased investment to support the global commercialization of Orkambi and Kalydeco.Stock Repurchase ProgramConcurrent with the earnings release, Vertex announced that the board has authorized a share repurchase program to buy back its common stock to the tune of $500 million in 2018 and 2019.2018 GuidanceVertex provided 2018 guidance for combined operating costs.Combined adjusted research and development (R&D) and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses in 2018 are anticipated in the range of $1.50 to $1.55 billion.The increase in operating expense reflects anticipated costs related to development and commercialization of triple combinations for treating CF and planned launch of tezacaftor/ivacaftor combination.Pipeline & Regulatory UpdatesIn December 2017, Vertex announced data from phase III study – ARRIVAL – evaluating Kalydeco in children (age 1-2 years)who have one of 10 mutations in the CFTR gene. It showed improvement across multiple endpoints, including measures of pancreatic function. Based on this data, Vertex plans to file regulatory applications for approval of Kalydeco in children aged one to two years in the first quarter of 2018.In January 2018, the European Commission approved a line extension for Orkambi to include use in children with CF aged between six and 11 years and have two copies of the F508del mutation. The approval increases the targeted patient population by about 3,400 patients. The company has plans to file regulatory applications for approval of Orkambi in children aged two to five with CF who have two copies of the F508del mutation in the first quarter of 2018.Vertex is also seeking approval for a combination of tezacaftor and Kalydeco (ivacaftor) in CF patients aged 12 and older who have two copies of the F508del mutation or who have at least one residual function mutation. Regulatory applications are under review in the United States and Europe. A decision is expected in the United States on Feb 28, 2018 and in Europe in the second half of 2018.The company is also developing triple combination regimens for treating CF, which are capable of treating almost 90% of patients. Vertex has selected two out of four next-generation correctors – VX-659 and VX-445 – for advancing into two separate phase III triple combination studies. The candidates will evaluated in combination with tezacaftor and Kalydeco.Apart from CF, Vertex is also developing treatments for sickle cell disease, thalassemia, influenza and pain management. During the fourth quarter, the company initiated a phase III study on pimodivir in combination with standard-of-care treatment in patients with influenza. This study is being conducted in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Our TakeVertex’s fourth-quarter results reflect strong performance of the CF products. The company beat estimates on both counts as sales of its CF drugs rose.Shares rose over 6% in after-hours trading in response to the strong quarterly results. In the past year, Vertex’s share price has increased a massive 100.9%, comparing favorably with an increase of 6.8% for the industry.Vertex’s CF pipeline is quite strong with a broad portfolio of next-generation CF correctors. Its triple combination CF regimens are considered crucial for long-term growth. If the triple-combo regimes are successful, Vertex can address a significantly larger CF patient population — almost 90% of the patients — in the future. However, competition is increasing as several major companies are expressing interest in CF.Vertex carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This apart, a successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals, a consistently sturdy performance of key products, growing demand for drugs, especially to address rare-to-treat diseases, an ageing populace and an increased healthcare expenditure are some of the factors that should keep the sector well in place.Also, according to the Earnings Preview, the broader Medical sector (inclusive of drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is likely to record 6.8% year-over-year growth in revenues and a 9.4% rise in earnings in the period under discussion.Three pharma/biotech giants are scheduled to report earnings numbers on Apr 24. Let's see, how things are shaping up for the companies in the upcoming releases.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company Quote Lilly is slated to release first-quarter earnings before the market opens. The company delivered a positive surprise of 5.56% last quarter. Moreover, the company’s performance has been impressive in the recent past with its earnings surpassing expectations in all the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.08%.However, our proven model does not conclusively show that Lilly is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESPof -0.48% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company requires a positive ESP to be confident about a probable surprise. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly earnings is pegged at $1.13 per share.Lilly’s strong uptake of new products like Trulicity, Taltz, Basaglar, Cyramza, Jardiance and Lartruvo should compensate the sales decline of its established products, namely Zyprexa, Alimta, Cialis, Strattera and Effient. We expect this uptrend to find reflection in the results of the soon-to-be reported quarter. (Read More: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report)Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Biogen Inc. Quote Biogen is also slated to release first-quarterearnings before the market opens.

However, Biogen came up with a negative surprise of 3.31% in fourth-quarter 2017.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively show that Biogen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Though the company’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) increases the predictive power of ESP, its Earnings ESP of -0.51% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $5.93 per share. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sales of Biogen’s multiple sclerosis drugs improved. Patient growth across major European markets as well as growth in the strong emerging market drove international Tecfidera sales while inventory build in the quarter benefited U.S. sales.

(AMGN  -  Free Report)Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Amgen Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Amgen Inc. Quote Amgen is scheduled to release first-quarter earnings after market close. The company delivered a negative surprise of 4.93% in the previous quarter. Amgen’s earnings performance has been quite robust with the metric beating expectations in three of the last four quarters while missing the same in the remaining one with an average beat of 2.93%.Our proven model shows that Amgen is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. The combination of Amgen’s Zacks Rank of 3, which increases the predictive power of ESP and a positive Earnings ESP of +3.34% makes us confident about an earnings beat in the upcoming report. The consensus mark for the quarter to be reported is pegged at $3.23 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Amgen’s latest products like Prolia, Kyprolis, Xgeva and Blincyto are likely to perform well backed by higher demand. This upside might make up for the weak sales on stiff competition of mature brands such as, Enbrel, Aranesp, Epogen, Neulasta and Neupogen in the to-be-reported quarter.(Read More: Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) to Report Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Cards?).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1834,JNJ,"The market rally is heating up this year with the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones indices breaching new milestones.

1836,JNJ,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers – including some large deals - may be in the cards in 2018 now that the tax reforms are in place. The tax bill was signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in December last yearThe tax rate for corporates will now go down from 35% to 21%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%. Also the tax cuts are expected to prevent inversions, which were rampant in the drug industry.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of 2017.This week, senior executives from some of the largest pharmaceutical/biotech companies discussed the impact of tax reform on mergers and acquisition and their plans to use the excess cash at the JP Morgan HealthCare conference.What the CEOs Said?Brent Saunders, chief executive officer (CEO) of Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) said that the first half of the year is likely to see smaller deals such as the one by Celgene (CELG  -  Free Report) while the bigger high profile mergers of large pharmaceuticals/biotech companies would probably happen in the latter half of the year or next year.Last week, Celgene announced that it has offered to buy a small cancer drug developer, Impact Biomedicines. (Read More: Celgene to Acquire Impact Biomedicines to Boost Pipeline).Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) CEO Dave Ricks and J&J’s Chief Financial Officer, Dominic Caruso said that with the tax cuts, American companies can compete better with their foreign counterparts, which operate in better tax environments. Caruso said the new tax law provides “more flexibility and ease of analysis in terms of getting a transaction done”.Along the same lines, Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) CEO, Meg Tirrell, said that having access to overseas cash will give it more financial flexibility to “think about different ways to go about the M&A transactions”. Tirrell, however, confidently said that even before the new tax law was implemented, the company had “enough power in their balance sheet” to make the bolt-on acquisitions it wanted to do.Michel Vounatsos, Biogen's (BIIB  -  Free Report) CEO, smartly argued that though the tax overhaul may spur some M&A activity, the rationale behind any M&A activity should not be the cash available. He went on to say that they are looking at “all sets of potential targets”.Gilead CEO, John Milligan, said that the tax reform is good for the company as it “allows to plan for the long term” since the FDA approval process is quite lengthy. Meanwhile, it maintained its goal of investing in M&A to replenish the pipeline. He also said that the excess cash will allow it to clean up its balance sheet by repaying debt.Conclusion Overall, it is quite clear that the drug industry is optimistic that the tax reform will fuel greater M&A activity in 2018.As it is, major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buyouts. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines. What matters for companies looking to buy a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of the latter’s drugs/products, prospects of sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1837,JNJ,"The Alzheimer’s disease (“AD”) area is in focus once again with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) saying that it will be dropping its plans to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. According to news sources, Pfizer expects its decision to result in the elimination of 300 positions from the neuroscience discovery and early development programs. We expect additional details to be available at the company’s presentation at the 36th Annual JPMorgan Healthcare Conference today.Pfizer has had a long association with the Alzheimer’s disease research area. In 2015, the company became a part of the Dementia Discovery Fund, which was formed to speed up the development of new treatments for neurological diseases by bringing together major pharma companies, the UK government and Alzheimer’s Research UK. The Fund is involved in the financing of new, early stage drug development projects.However, Alzheimer’s has always been a highly challenging area with not much progress being made despite the investment of a lot of funds and resources. In fact, Pfizer itself had faced a major setback way back in 2012 in its development efforts for an Alzheimer’s disease treatment. The company and its partner, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), decided to discontinue the development of bapineuzumab IV following a late-stage failure.Other companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) have also stumbled in their efforts to develop treatments for Alzheimer’s. Lilly decided in November 2016 that it would not seek approval for its investigational AD treatment, solanezumab, following disappointing results from a late-stage study. The candidate was being evaluated to see whether it can slow the progression of memory problems associated with amyloid, a protein that forms plaques in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s.Meanwhile, the evaluation of Merck’s investigational Alzheimer’s disease treatment, verubecestat, was halted in a phase II/III study (EPOCH) in February 2017 based on an interim analysis by an external Data Monitoring Committee (eDMC) that the study might fail. Another study is ongoing with results expected in February 2019.Biogen also suffered a setback recently when an Independent Data Monitoring Committee said that BAN2401 did not meet the criteria for success based on a Bayesian analysis at 12 months as the primary endpoint in the phase II study. The failure to show an early positive result came as a major disappointment for Biogen which is developing the candidate in association with Eisai.Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Axovant Sciences (AXON  -  Free Report) suffered a major setback in September 2017 when its investigational Alzheimer’s disease candidate failed to meet the co-primary efficacy endpoints in a late-stage study. The company decided to discontinue development of the 35 mg dose for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Over the last one year, the company’s shares are down 59.7% compared to the 1.7% decline of the industry it belongs to.According to the Alzheimer's Association, in the 10 years from 2002-2012, 244 drugs were tested for Alzheimer’s in studies registered with clinicaltrials.gov out of which only one succeeded and went on to gain FDA approval.The Road AheadDespite all these setbacks, several companies continue to invest heavily in developing Alzheimer’s disease treatments given the high commercial potential in this market. Success in this area means huge returns considering more than five million Americans are living with Alzheimer’s disease with the numbers expected to triple by 2050 (Data: Alzheimer's Association). It is considered to be one of the biggest burdens of society and is the sixth leading cause of death across all ages in the United States. The market has immense commercial potential and companies coming out with new treatments could rake in billions of dollars in sales.Companies that are currently working on Alzheimer’s disease treatments include Biogen, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), AstraZeneca, Eisai and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report). Biogen’s aducanumab is one of the most important candidates in the company’s pipeline with the candidate currently in a couple of late-stage studies. Biogen is also working on elenbecestat (E2609), a BACE inhibitor in a phase III program. These candidates are being developed in collaboration with Eisai.  Lilly also has quite a few Alzheimer’s disease candidates in its pipeline including lanabecestat, which is being developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca with data readout expected in 2019. Meanwhile, Novartis and Amgen are collaborating for BACE1 inhibitor, CNP520, which has fast track status in the United Status. Roche is also collaborating with AC Immune for the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments.While companies like Pfizer, Lilly and Merck are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1838,JNJ,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) focuses on three core businesses – Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare. Glaxo enjoys strong fundamentals in the form of its diversified base and presence in different geographical areas.This UK-based company reshaped its business, following the completion of the three-part, inter-conditional transaction with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) in March 2015. Under the deal, Glaxo sold its oncology assets to Novartis and acquired Novartis’ Vaccines business (excluding influenza vaccines).Here are four reasons why you should invest in the stock this year.Good Rank and Solid VGM Score: Glaxo carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a favorable VGM Score of A. Back-tested results show that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Rising Share Price and Estimates: After underperforming the broader industry in 2017, Glaxo’s shares have picked up this year. Glaxo’s stock has risen 5.4% this year so far, which compares favorably with a flat trajectory for the industry.Meanwhile, estimates for 2018 and 2019 rose 1.4% and 1.7%, respectively in the past 30 days.This pharma giant has been consistently beating earnings expectations. Its earnings surpassed expectations in three of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.12%.New Drugs/Vaccines Doing Well: Glaxo’s newer respiratory/HIV drugs and vaccines are all doing well and will continue to boost revenues. These new products generated 22% of Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccine sales in 2016 and 30% in 2017 and should continue to boost revenues significantly.Glaxo had expected the new pharmaceutical and vaccine products including contributions from Shingrix to deliver sales of £6 billion per annum by 2020.  However, these products almost reached the £6 billion target in 2017.Significant Progress with Pipeline: Glaxo has made significant progress with its late-stage pipeline. In 2017, Glaxo received approvals for three key new drugs, Shingrix vaccine for shingles, which enjoys preferential recommendation from ACIP; Trelegy Ellipta, which provides three medicines in a single inhaler to treat COPD and Juluca (dolutegravir and rilpivirine), the first 2-drug regimen, once-daily, single pill for HIV.  Back-to-back approvals of three new products have strengthened Glaxo’s competitive position.Juluca has been developed by Glaxo and partner Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) HIV-focused company, ViiV Healthcare, in partnership with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report).Glaxo is also working on expanding the label of marketed products like Nucala into additional indicationsConclusionGlaxo faces its share of challenges like stiff competition, genericization and pricing pressure along with slowing growth in emerging markets.Meanwhile, its top-selling respiratory product, Advair is also expected to face generic competition in the United States this year, which will hurt sales.However, it looks like Glaxo’s strong pipeline, consistent outperformance of new HIV drugs and vaccines, three new products, and cost cuts can bring it back on track this year.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio? Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

1839,JNJ,"Emerging market investment has taken a backseat of late, thanks to the nonstop blows to the economy. The lingering geopolitical tension in Gulf, debt and policy related hazards in Latin America or the missile tests in North Korea have led stock investors to reconsider their outlay in these markets, earlier proclaimed to offer better growth opportunities than the United States.Going by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, the last five-year annualized growth rate was just 5.02%. On the other hand, GDP per capita growth rate over the last five years for the United States was 5.83% (International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook Database).In the face of such adversities, Goldman Sachs’ statement to Bloomberg last week, addressing emerging market stocks as world’s best bet, has created quite a stir in the investment world. According to the report, following the selloff in February and unlike other market corrections, investors are keen to put money in riskier assets of the emerging economy this time around.Although the MSCI Index has not shown any significant improvement since then, the comment by Sheila Patel, chief executive officer of International GSAM, has forced investors to think all over again before taking their assets out of this market.Going by the Bloomberg report, Goldman Sachs is particularly betting on Indian healthcare firms, Mexican consumer stocks and Argentine debt. “She expects India’s government will boost spending on public health under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. And although political risks can’t be ignored investors’ pessimism toward Mexico and Argentina is overdone”- the report says.Emerging Market Healthcare Scenario Way Better Than the United StatesWhile Patel particularly talked about the growing prospects of the Indian healthcare market, data shows that the prospects of the broader emerging market are equally encouraging. On the contrary, the healthcare scenario in the United States is muddled.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last July revealed that U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. Following the new healthcare reform announcement in December, a Gallup poll the next month stated that the past decade marked the biggest increase in the uninsured rate. Whatever the new healthcare reform may bring in, the near-term scenario remains pretty unclear as of now.Meanwhile, with exploding population, rising middle class and increasing governmental awareness of health issues, emerging geographies are facing huge demand for modern but cheaper healthcare options. Going by a report in The Guardian, International Finance Corp’s (IFJ) data shows that developing countries account for 80% of global deaths from chronic diseases indicating enormous market opportunity.Emerging Market Openings for MedTechPer a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India, the fifth largest MedTech market in the world, currently records 17% annual growth. At this pace, India may emerge as a strong competitor to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographical regions, Latin America, even in the face of economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare between 2008 and 2014.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in India, China and Brazil. The company’s emerging markets medical device segment continues to grow three to four times faster than the developed markets.Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region. In the recent quarters, sales in key emerging markets were up in double digits, driven by strength in BRIC as well as strong growth in several countries throughout Latin America, including Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Argentina.At Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, businesses in China, Latin America, and Southeast Asia showed sustained strength, growing in double digits. Overall, Medtronic’s long-term outlook on emerging markets is encouraging.Boston Scientific’s (BSX  -  Free Report) emerging markets’ business registered 13% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017, reflecting a significant increase from 8% growth in 2013. Business in China was once again remarkable (up 19% year over year).ConclusionThe growth pace of the emerging market has declined from the pre-financial crisis years. However, this market has historically played a crucial role for large corporations by hedging their international trade risk.  According to a BCG report, going forward, emerging market GDP is projected to grow around 2% faster than that of developed economies. The market will account for around 40% of total consumer spending — more than $20 trillion by 2020. From an investor point of view, it will be imprudent to disregard the immense growth potential of the emerging economy due to the occasional rough spots.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1840,JNJ,"Markets finished at record levels on Tuesday after banks and healthcare stocks rallied. Further, reports that Boeing had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Both, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased for the sixth consecutive sessions. Meanwhile, a report from the National Federation of Independent Businesses showed that small-business optimism declined in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.4% to close at 25,385.80. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,751.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,163.58, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased almost 6.3% to close at 10.12. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Gains for Boeing Push the Dow HigherShares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) surged on Tuesday following reports that the aero-giant delivered a record 763 commercial airplanes in 2017. This marks a fresh record for the airplane maker as it surpassed its earlier record in 2015 by one unit.The company also announced that it had booked orders for 912 commercial airplanes, which is its seventh highest annual total. This led to its highest ever order backlog, which rose to 5,864 airplanes by the end of 2017. Such a backlog is worth around seven years of production. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points on Tuesday to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow.

(JBHT  -  Free Report), which gained 1.7% and 1.9%, respectively.S&P 500 and Nasdaq Post Record ClosesThe S&P 500 gained 3.6 points to close at a record for the sixth straight session. The marks its best start to a year since 1987. Of the 11 major sectors of the broad-market index, only five ended in the positive territory with healthcare and financials leading the advancers and real estate the laggards.However, losses from real estate were more than made up by gains from financial and healthcare stocks. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) and Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) gained 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.Meanwhile, Nasdaq added 6.2 points to also close at a record for the sixth straight session — its highest since the period between 1992 and 1999. Gains for the tech-laden index were broad-based. Markets also gained traction due to optimism surrounding the strong market rally that kicked off 2018.Economic DataOn the economic data front, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reported that the index of small-business optimism tanked 2.6 points to 104.9 for the month of December. Such a decline comes right after the Republican Tax Bill was implemented.The decline can be owed to sluggishness and imbalance in the labor market which has impacted hiring in the United States. Moreover, the capex for December increased only marginally, which further dampened the small-business sentiment.Stocks That Made HeadlinesUnited Continental December Traffic Up, Q4 Guidance AlteredUnited Continental Holdings, Inc.’s (UAL  -  Free Report) wholly owned subsidiary, United Airlines, reported dismal traffic numbers for December.

1841,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reportedly said in a statement that it will end R&D efforts in the Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease areas, which will result in about 300 layoffs.The decision to end the neuroscience-discovery program will mainly affect employees at facilities in Andover and Cambridge,  MA, and Groton,  CT. Pfizer, however, intends to continue development of pain candidate, tanezumab, which it is developing in late-stage studies in partnership with Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report), label expansion efforts for pain drug Lyrica and its rare disease program.Shares of Pfizer have risen 10.2% in the past year, comparing unfavorably with a 16.5% increase for the industry.The successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in this regard.In fact Pfizer itself shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.In November 2016, Lilly’s anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lillyalso suffered a major setback in August 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate, semagacestat.Last month, Biogen, Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced that an Alzheimer’s disease study on BAN2401 failed to show early positive which raised investor concern about the candidate’s chances of success.Pfizer plans to use savings from the terminated programs to re-allocate spend on potentially more fruitful pipeline projects.Pfizer expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, of which around 15 products have blockbuster potential. These include line-extensions for cancer drugs, Xtandi and Ibrance as well as rheumatoid arthritis drug, Xeljanz.

1842,JNJ,"Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) announced a new 208-week (4-year) follow-up data from the phase III RESPONSE study of Jakafi. The study compared the efficacy and safety of Jakafi with best available therapy (BAT) in patients with polycythemia vera (PV), who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea (HU).The primary response was a composite endpoint of the proportion of patients, who achieved both hematocrit (Hct) control (defined as no phlebotomy eligibility from week 8 through week 32) and a spleen volume reduction of at least 35% from baseline at week 32. The study met the primary endpoint showing that Jakafi was superior to BAT at controlling hematocrit (Hct) and reducing spleen volume at week 32.The data from this study showed that durable primary response to Jakafi in patients with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of HU and overall safety profile for Jafaki remained consistent with the 80-week RESPONSE data published earlier. In fact, the 80 week follow up from the RESPONSE study confirmed that among patients who initially responded to Jakafi treatment have probability of maintaining primary and hematocrit (Hct) responses for greater than 80 weeks was 92% and 89%, respectively. Thus confirming that Jakafi could be an effective long-term treatment option for patients with PV who are HU-resistant or intolerant.So far this year, Incyte’s shares have declined 3.7%, as against the industry’s growth of 2.6%.Jakafi is Incyte’s sole marketed product and is a first-in-class JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor. It is approved in the United States for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV), who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. Also, Jakafi is approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF) including primary MF, post-PV MF, and post-essential thrombocythemia MF.While Incyte markets the drug in the United States, it is marketed by Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) as Jakavi outside the country. Its label has been updated several times since approval. In March 2016, the FDA approved supplemental labeling for Jakafi to include additional safety data as well as efficacy analyses from the RESPONSE study that assessed the durability of response in Jakafi-treated patients after 80 weeks.Incyte Corporation Price Incyte Corporation Price | Incyte Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderIncyte has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1843,JNJ,"At the beginning of 2017, expectations were pretty high that the pharma and biotech sector would finally see lots of mergers and acquisitions (M&As). However, that did not happen. While a few high-value deals were announced, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.According to Mergermarket’s Global Pharma, Medical & Biotech trend report for Q317, M&A in the global pharma, medical and biotechnology sector was in the range of $207.6 billion spanning 1,040 deals so far this year, declining 9.9% from the year-ago period. The dip was mostly attributable to the pharma and medical sectors.Key deals announced this year include the Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report)-Kite and the Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)-Actelion acquisitions, which boosted the value of M&A transactions in the biotech sector. Biotech stocks continue to command hefty premiums where M&A is concerned.The key question now facing the sector is - will M&A activity remain sluggish in 2018 or will there be a surge in M&A deals?  With tax reform in the works, M&A activity is expected to increase in the upcoming quarters. Tax reform and cash repatriation are expected to lead to a boost in this area with biotech remaining a highly sought-after sector. Companies with innovative technologies and pipelines remain in demand with disease areas like nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), immuno-oncology, gastrointestinal and central nervous system diseases seeing quite a bit of activity. Treatments for orphan diseases and gene editing technology are also in demand.There are several large drugmakers that are on the lookout for deals – while some of these companies are looking to replace sales of blockbuster products that are facing loss of patent exclusivity, others are looking to build their pipelines both through acquisitions as well as licensing agreements.Expectations are high that big players like Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report), Pfizer, Merck and Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) will announce M&A deals in 2018. Companies like J&J and Gilead are also expected to be on the lookout for additional acquisition targets. A major deterrent, however, could be high valuations and bidding wars which could keep some of the key players on the sidelines.   In this backdrop, here is a look at three biotech stocks that could find themselves on the radar of companies on the lookout for acquisition targets in 2018.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report): Wilmington, DE-based Incyte is a company that is often considered an attractive acquisition target thanks to its flagship product, Jakafi, and a promising pipeline. Jakafi – a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor – looks well-positioned for growth. Jakafi revenues are expected in the range of $1,125-$1,135 million in 2017. Incyte is also working on expanding Jakafi’s label into additional indications including steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease (“GVHD” – data expected in the first half of 2018) and essential thrombocythemia (“ET”), a rare blood cancer that can lead to life-threatening complications.The company has several catalysts lined up for 2018 including the potential approval of baricitinib (resubmission of the new drug application for moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis expected by January 2018) as well as the advancement of its immuno-oncology pipeline.The company’s immuno-oncology pipeline includes IDO1 inhibitors (epacadostat), PI3K-delta inhibitors (INCB50465), and JAK inhibitors (itacitinib, INCB52793) among others. Epacadostat, which is in late-stage development for melanoma with data due in the first half of 2018, has immense commercial potential. Epacadostat is being evaluated for several other types of cancer as well.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. : Biopharmaceutical company, Juno’s shares have been on an upward trend following the Gilead-Kite acquisition announcement earlier this year. With Juno being focused on the development of innovative cellular immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer, the company is considered a potential acquisition target. Juno’s cell-based cancer immunotherapies are based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor technologies. The company has several cell-based candidates in its pipeline targeting a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as multiple solid tumors and multiple myeloma.Although the company suffered a major setback with the development of its erstwhile lead pipeline candidate due to safety issues (including patient deaths), Juno is now focusing on JCAR017, a next-generation CAR-T cell product that targets CD19. JCAR017 is currently in a registrational study for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (""NHL""). The company expects to file for approval in the second half of 2018.  Juno’s shares are up 211.1% year to date, compared to the 2.7% gain recorded by the industry it belongs to.bluebird bio, Inc. (BLUE  -  Free Report): bluebird is another clinical-stage company working on developing gene therapies for serious genetic diseases and T cell-based immunotherapies for cancer. The company’s pipeline includes Lenti-D, currently in a phase II/III study, for the treatment of cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, and LentiGlobin, currently in five studies for the treatment of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia and severe sickle cell disease. The company’s lead oncology programs, bb2121 and bb21217, are anti-BCMA CAR T programs which are being developed in collaboration with Celgene.While Incyte, Juno and bluebird are all Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks, you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1844,JNJ,"This week was ruled by cancer data presentations by drug companies at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Chicago. Other than that, J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 pharma earnings on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first quarter of 2018.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J Beats on Q1 Earnings, Raises Sales Guidance: J&J’s first-quarter 2018 earnings came in at $2.06 per share while sales were $20 billion. Both the numbers increased 12.6% year over year. Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta faced generic competition, we believe that new products like plaque psoriasis drug, Tremfya (guselkumab), cancer drugs, Darzalex, Imbruvica and Zytiga, currency tailwinds and contribution from acquisitions helped J&J deliver strong sales and profit in the first quarter of the year and led it to raise the sales outlook for the whole year. (Read more: J&J Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates, Raises Sales Guidance).Novartis’ first-quarter earnings came in at $1.28 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25. Revenues increased 10% year over year to $12.7 billion and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion. Strong performance of key drugs Cosentyx and Entresto led to the impressive performance in the quarter. Novartis re-iterated the previously issued guidance for 2018. (Read more: Novartis Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1).Merck Presents Successful Keytruda Data: At AACR, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) presented full data from the pivotal KEYNOTE-189 study, which evaluated Keytruda, in combination with Alimta (pemetrexed) and platinum chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin) for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-squamous NSCLC regardless of PD-L1 expression. The data showed that the Keytruda combo significantly improved overall survival, reducing the risk of death by half (51%) compared to chemotherapy alone.In January, Merck had announced that the study met both its primary endpoints, progression-free survival (PFS) and OS (co-primary endpoint).Notably, in May 2017, this combination therapy was granted an accelerated approval by the FDA for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on tumor response rate and PFS data from the KEYNOTE-021 study. Hence, the positive readouts from the KEYNOTE-189 confirmatory study will help the company gain continued approval for the combo therapy, which should support uptake and sales.  (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Betters Survival in Lung Cancer Combo Study).Merck also presented updated data from the phase III EORTC1325/KEYNOTE-054 study, which evaluated Keytruda monotherapy in high-risk stage III melanoma patients in the adjuvant setting. Data from the study demonstrated that as an adjuvant treatment, Keytruda increased recurrence free survival (“RFS”), reducing the risk of disease recurrence or death by 43% over placebo after surgery in such patients. (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Reduces Death Risk in Melanoma Patients).Separately, Merck and AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) announced final overall survival (“OS”) data from a phase III study evaluating PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, in metastatic breast cancer at the AACR. The median OS was 19.3 months in the Lynparza arm, compared to 17.1% for chemotherapy.Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo in Focus: Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) presented initial results from the phase III study, CheckMate-227, which evaluated a combination of its PD-L1 inhibitor Opdivo plus Yervoy for the first-line treatment of advanced NSCLC in patients with high tumor mutational burden. The initial results showed that the one-year PFS rate was more than triple with the combination versus chemotherapy (43% vs. 13%). However, while the results were encouraging, investors were disappointed as Merck’s Keytruda seemed to have fared better than Opdivo and Yervoy combination. (Read more: Bristol-Myers Down as Merck NSCLC Study Fares Better).Opdivo also demonstrated a statistically significant overall survival (primary endpoint) benefit compared to chemotherapy in a late-stage study (CheckMate-078) evaluating it in a predominantly Chinese population with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer. Opdivo reduced the risk of death by 32% versus chemotherapy. (Read more: Bristol-Myers Reports Positive Data in NSCLC Trial on Opdivo).In another development, Opdivo was approved in combination with Yervoy for the treatment of intermediate- and poor-risk advanced renal cell carcinoma in previously untreated patients. Also, Bristol-Myers’ supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) to expand the use of Opdivo monotherapy to previously-treated patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) was granted priority review by the FDA. The FDA is expected to give its decision on Aug 16, 2018. Separately, Bristol Myers struck a collaboration with Illumina, Inc. to develop and commercialize companion diagnostics for Bristol Myers’ oncology immunotherapies.Bristol-Myers also inked a deal with Johnson & Johnson for the development and commercialization of Bristol Myers’ factor XIa (FXIa) inhibitor, BMS-986177 for the prevention and treatment of major thrombotic conditions. Both companies are expected to advance BMS-986177 into phase II trials in the second half of 2018.Roche’s Hemlibra Gets BTD for New Indication: Swiss pharma giant Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) haemophilia drug, Hemlibra was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors based on positive data from the phase III HAVEN 3 study.Hemlibra (emicizumab) was approved for routine prophylaxis of bleeding episodes in people with haemophilia A with factor VIII inhibitors in EU in February and in the United States in November last year. It has been successfully launched in the United States. (Read more: Roche Hemophilia Drug Gets Breakthrough Therapy Designation).Shire Agrees to Sell Oncology Unit: Shire announced a definitive agreement to sell its Oncology business to French company, Servier for $2.4 billion. The Dublin, Ireland drug giant plans to return the proceeds from the sale to its shareholders through a share buyback. Japan’s Takeda considered taking over Shire and the latter’s oncology business was one the key areas of interest to Takeda. (Read More: Shire Sells Oncology Unit Ahead of Takeda's Potential Offer). Shire, however, on Thursday, rejected Takeda’s third offer of 46.50 pounds per share as well saying that it undervalued Shire’s growth prospects and pipeline.Meanwhile, Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) issued a press release on the same day saying that it is in the “early stages of considering a possible offer for Shire”.  However, later in the day, it issued another press release saying it does not intend to make an offer for Shire.Bayer Sells Stake to Singapore’s Temasek: Germany’s Bayer has struck a deal to sell its 3.6% stake to Singapore's investment company Temasek for total gross proceeds of 3 billion euro. With the latest purchase, Temasek will own approximately 4% of Bayer’s stock. The equity sale raises funds for Bayer’s upcoming merger with seed maker Monsanto Company.AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso Gets FDA Nod in First-Line Setting: AstraZeneca’s lung cancer drug Tagrisso gained FDA approval for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors have EGFR mutations. The sNDA was based on data from the phase III FLAURA study.A similar label expansion application is under review in the EU. Until now, Tagrisso was approved in the United States, European Union, Japan and China as a second-line treatment option for patients with EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC.

1845,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off pharma earnings season on a strong note beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales in the first-quarter 2018. J&J’s performance was driven by continued positive momentum since the second half of 2017 and improvement in Consumer segment sales.How Did J&J Perform in Q1?J&J’s earnings of $2.06 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.01. Quarterly revenues were $20 billion, which also beat the consensus mark of $19.48 billion. Buoyed by its strong performance, the company upped its previously issued sales outlook for 2018. (Read More: J&J Tops Q1 Earnings Estimates, Raises Sales Guidance).J&J’s Pharmaceutical segment sales grew 19.4% year over year in the first quarter of 2018 due to strong sales in both domestic and international markets and favorable currency impact. Sales in the U.S. market rose 9.9% in the quarter while international sales grew 33.1%.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Oncology sales increased 45% during the quarter to $2.3 billion, constituting almost a quarter of the pharmaceutical sales. Core products like Xarelto, Stelara, Zytiga, Simponi/Simponi Aria and Invega Sustenna also contributed to growth. Imbruvica sales rose 43.5%. The drug is marketed by J&J in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).Edurant sales rose 40.9% while Prezista sales increased 11.2%.However, Concerta sales continue to decline due to generic competition. Sales of Risperdal Consta also fell 5.3%. Sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 12.7% due to higher managed care discounting, while blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) fell 16.9%.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including FDA approvals of prostate cancer drug, Erleada for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and line extension of already marketed prostate cancer drug, Zytiga in combination with prednisone in the first-line setting.These will certainly boost sales in 2018. J&J now expects revenues in the range of $81.0 to $81.8 billion, higher than $80.6 billion to $81.4 billion expected previously.Overall, in 2018, J&J expects the Pharmaceutical segment to remain strong while the Consumer and Medical Device segments will continue to improve. We expect other companies like Merck, Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Pfizer and Lilly to follow suit.Novartis Reports Encouraging Q1 ResultsNovartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) also reported this week. The Swiss pharma giant beat earnings and revenue estimates driven by strong performance of key drugs, Cosentyx and Entresto. Novartis reported core earnings of $1.28 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.25 and up from $1.13 recorded in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 10% to $12.7 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.3 billion. (Read more: Novartis Beats Earnings and Revenue Estimates in Q1)Sales of the Innovative Medicines division grew 6% to $8.4 billion driven by volume growth of Cosentyx and Entresto. However, entry of generics for Gleevec in the United States and Europe impacted sales unfavorably.Cosentyx sales increased to $580 million, up 35% driven strong growth in all indications and expanded access. Entresto’s sales increased 126% to $200 million driven by increased uptake.Oncology franchise (excluding Gleevec) grew 6% driven by Promacta/Revolade, Tafinlar + Mekinist, Jakavi and recent launches. However, sales at the Sandoz division were $2.5 billion, down 4% due to price erosion in the Unites States.However, this year so far, J&J’s shares have lost 8.8% and Novartis’ shares are down 6% against 4.3% decrease witnessed by the industry.Will Other Pharma Bigwigs Report Solid Results Too?PfizerPfizer's top line is expected to be favorably impacted by new products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain), Chantix (smoking cessation) and Eliquis (blood thinner) in the soon-to-be reported quarter. Moreover, line extension of Xeljanz, Sutent and Bosulif received in the fourth quarter of 2017 is also expected to bring in more sales.However, loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for Pristiq in the United States and Lyrica in Europe, and product shortages for legacy Hospira will likely affect sales negatively. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales should continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.In 2018, the company’s sales are expected to increase in low single digits from 2017 levels. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $13.03 billion and 73 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in 2018 currently stands at $54.52 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 3.7%. Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).MerckMerck’s blockbuster drug, Keytruda, along with Lynparza and Bridion Injection is expected to boost revenues in the first quarter. Keytruda sales are gaining momentum through approval and launch of Keytruda in new indications, especially in first-line lung cancer.However, rising competitive and pricing pressure are expected to hurt sales of Zostavax, Zepatier, Januvia and Isentress.Animal health franchise sales are likely to remain strong in the first quarter.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $10.11 billion and 99 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is $41.81 billion, representing a 4.2% year-over-year increase.Eli Lilly (LLY)Sales of Lilly’s diabetes drugs, Trulicity and Jardiance are expected to grow driven by market share gains. Other new drugs such as Cyramza, Taltz, and Lartruvo are also expected to boost the top line due to continued strong demand. Verzenio is also expected to generate higher sales in the first quarter.However, patent expiry in some countries for Cymbalta, Strattera, Effient, Axiron, Zyprexa, Evista and competitive pressure mainly from immuno-oncology agents for Alimta will hurt sales of these drugs.We expect strong uptake of new products to offset decline in sales of established products this quarter too.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.52 billion and $1.13, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales stands at $23.43 billion, representing a rise of 2.4% year over year. Lilly carries a Zacks Rank #2.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY)Several label expansions of Bristol-Myers’ blockbuster cancer drug, Opdivo, drove the company’s sales last year and is expected do so this year as well. Moreover, cardiovascular drug, Eliquis, also demonstrated strong performance in 2017. We expect this trend to continue this quarter. Label expansion of leukemia drug, Sprycel, approved in November 2017 should bring in more sales for the drug. Moreover, continued strong performance of Yervoy and Orencia will have a favorable impact.However, genericization of Plavix, Avapro/Avalide and Baraclude in the United States due to loss of exclusivity is significantly hurting the company’s top line. The company also faces stiff competition in the immuno-oncology space. The HIV business continues to face competitive pressure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales and earnings for Q1 is pegged at $5.17 billion and 84 cents, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 sales is pegged at $21.69 billion, representing a rise of 12.7% year over year. Bristol Myers carries a Zacks Rank #3.ConclusionThe new products of the majority of these companies are doing well and are expected to offset declining sales of legacy drugs due to loss of exclusivity. Moreover, most of these companies boast a deep and promising pipeline. Also, the new tax law boosts the prospects of strategic mergers and acquisitions and in-licensing deals/collaboration with smaller companies, which will strengthen the companies' product portfolio.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1847,JNJ,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares are expected to be northbound in 2018, carrying on the momentum achieved last year. The stock was up 54.4% in 2017, comparing favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news. AbbVie met primary endpoints in several pivotal studies – the key phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia; three phase III studies evaluating oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib for rheumatoid arthritis and also a phase IIb study in atopic dermatitis; and four pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis.Meanwhile, AbbVie gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine Mavyret and FDA approval for the sixth indication for cancer drug Imbruvica in 2018.AbbVie also settled its patent disputes with Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report), which delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares. Moreover, the agreement gave AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Factors Likely to Support the Rally in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock should continue in 2018. An important catalyst for the stock will be data from a pivotal phase III (TRINITY) study on Rova-T in third-line or later small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the first half of the year. An important regulatory milestone will be the FDA decision on elagolixin the second quarter. Please note that the new drug application (NDA) for elagolix for endometriosis was granted priority review by the FDA in October last year.Importantly Humira has been generating strong sales. Despite new competition, AbbVie raised its long-term target for Humira sales in October based on strong demand trends for the drug. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Treating advanced gastric cancer is a challenge, which is further underscored by the fact that no major advances over chemotherapies have been achieved for treating metastatic gastric cancer.Moreover, initial data from another phase III study on Cyramza presented at ESMO 2017 Congress showed that the drug met PFS endpoint in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma.Per the press release, gastric cancer is the fifth most common form of cancer in the world.

1851,JNJ,"Roche Holding AG’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member, Genentech announced that the FDA has converted accelerated approval for Avastin (received in May 2009) for previously treated glioblastoma, most aggressive form of brain cancer, to full approval.The full approval was based on data from the phase III EORTC 26101study in which Avastin-based treatment increased the time to disease progression or death compared to chemotherapy alone. The study, however, did not meet the primary endpoint as there was no significant increase in overall survival with Avastin-based treatment.However, it showed that patients were able to completely stop intake of corticosteroids while on treatment in the Avastin arm compared to the control arm. The evidence from the study, which showed that Avastin treatment delayed disease progression and reduced the need for corticosteroids, led to the conversion of the provisional approval to a full one.Apart from the recent approval, the drug is already approved in the United States  for various indications that include- first- or second-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer, advanced nonsquamous non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic kidney cancer and advanced cervical cancer and recurrent ovarian cancer.So far this year, shares of the company have increased 8.4% compared with the industry’s gain of 15%.However, the drug has been facing competition and has been witnessing declining sales. In September 2017, Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and its partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Avastin for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer.

Steglatro has also been approved for use in combination with metformin under the brand name Segluromet and with Januvia under the brand name Steglujan.Priority Review for AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso Label Expansion: AstraZeneca’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of Tagrisso (osimertinib), for the first-line treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) whose tumors have EGFR mutations has been granted priority review by the FDA. Approval for this indication would expand the patient population significantly (Read more: AstraZeneca's Tagrisso Label Expansion Filing Accepted by FDA).J&J’s Janssen in CAR-T Deal, Priority Review for Apalutamide: J&J’s Janssen Biotech has inked a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Legend Biotech USA Inc. and Legend Biotech Ireland Limited, subsidiaries of Genscript Biotech Corporation, for the development, manufacture and commercialization of a chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T-cell drug candidate, LCAR-B38M. LCAR-B38M, which specifically targets the B-cell maturation antigen (“BCMA”), is currently under regulatory review in China for multiple myeloma (“MM”).Meanwhile, clinical studies are being planned for the United States. Under the terms of the deal, global net trade sales, excluding the Greater China area, will be recorded by Janssen. The companies will split costs and profits equally except in Greater China, where Janssen and Legend will have a 30/70% cost-sharing/profit-split arrangement. The deal terms also include a $350 million upfront payment from Janssen and additional payments on the achievement of development, regulatory and sales milestones.This is the latest agreement in the field of CAR-T, which has been attracting a lot of interest in recent quarters.Janssen also announced that it got priority review status from the FDA for its New Drug Application (“NDA”) for apalutamide, the company’s investigational, next-generation oral androgen receptor (“AR”) inhibitor for the treatment of men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (“CRPC”). With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out in April 2018. Given that there are no FDA-approved treatments currently available for this patient population, timely approval would be a boost for the company’s cancer portfolio.J&J has gained 22.4% year to date, compared to the 16.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Allergan Provides Updates on Vraylar & Seysara: Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) provided a couple of updates on the pipeline front. The company and its partner Gedeon Richter said that Vraylar (cariprazine) met the primary endpoint in a late-stage in adults with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression). The companies plan to seek label expansion into this indication in the second half of 2018 (Read more: Allergan's Vraylar Positive for Bipolar Disease in Phase III).Allergan also announced that the NDA for Seysara has been accepted for review. Allergan and partner Paratek Pharmaceuticals are looking to get the antibiotic approved for the treatment of moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients 9 years of age and older. Approval could come in the second half of 2018.FDA Expands Label of Pfizer’s Bosulif, Grants BTD to Bavencio: The FDA has given its nod for the label expansion of Pfizer’s Bosulif for its use in newly-diagnosed chronic phase Ph+ chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph+ CML) patients. Bosulif‘s initial approval was for use in patients with chronic, accelerated or blast phase Ph+ CML with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy.The expanded indication will increase the addressable patient population significantly. According to the American Cancer Society, about 9,000 new CML cases were diagnosed in the United States in 2017.Pfizer also announced that the FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation (“BTD”) for Bavencio (avelumab) for use in combination with Inlyta in treatment-naïve patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (“RCC”). Avelumab is partnered with Merck KGaA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation helps fasten the development and review of drugs which are being evaluated for the treatment of serious conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may be substantially better than existing treatments on clinically significant endpoint(s).This is the second time that Bavencio has received BTD for a hard-to-treat cancer, the first time being for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) whose disease has progressed after at least one previous chemotherapy regimen.Label Expansion and Clinical Trial Collaboration for BMY’s Opdivo: Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, Opdivo, gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The regulatory agency granted approval to Opdivo for intravenous use for the adjuvant treatment of patients with completely resected melanoma with lymph node involvement or metastatic disease. Opdivo is already approved for a wide range of indications alone as well as in combination with other agents and is currently in several studies as well.In fact, the company also announced a clinical trial collaboration with TARIS Biomedical for the evaluation of the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of TARIS’ TAR-200 (GemRIS) in combination with Opdivo. A phase Ib study will evaluate the combination in patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer (“MIBC”) who are scheduled for radical cystectomy. Opdivo is one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’s portfolio with the product bringing in sales of $3.6 billion in the first nine months of 2017.Bristol-Myers is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up slightly (0.4%) over the last five trading sessions.

1853,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) stock was up 21.3% in 2017, which compared favorably with a gain of 16.3% recorded by the industry.Last year’s share price surge was supported by a series of positive news including promising data from several pivotal studies and rapid progress with its pipeline and line extensions. The positive trend is likely to continue this year as well.What Drove the Stock in 2017?Two new drugs were approved last year - Guselkumab/Tremfya in the United States as well as in the EU for plaque psoriasis and the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (dolutegravir + rilpivirine) in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) in the United States. Juluca is under review in the EU.J&J also gained FDA approval for several line extensions -  a lower dose of Xarelto, two new indications of Simponi Aria, use in adolescents for Stelara, combination use of Darzalex with Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) multiple myeloma drug Pomalyst and the sixth indication for Imbruvica, among others. Please note that J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).The line extensions can expand the eligible patient populations of these drugs and drive their sales higher in future quarters.In 2017, J&J also submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of key drugs including Darzalex (in first-line setting for multiple myeloma), Xarelto (for chronic coronary artery disease and/or peripheral artery disease), Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication), Zytiga (for earlier stages of metastatic prostate cancer). It might get FDA nod for these line extensions this year.Factors Likely to Support the Rally in 2018With several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run of the stock is likely to continue in 2018.This year J&J expects to file for approval of depression candidate, esketamine while apalutamide for pre-metastatic prostate cancer and Symtuza, a darunavir-based once-daily single-tablet regimen for HIV could be approved by the FDA.J&J’s domestic Pharma segment sales decelerated in the first half of 2017 as a number of key growth drivers like Remicade and Concerta faced competition. However, sales growth accelerated in the third quarter and we are likely to see the positive impact of the trend in fourth-quarter results and probably in 2018. We believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica, Xarelto, Stelara and Darzalex and contribution from recent acquisitions - mainly Actelion – will support top-line growth. All these factors bode well for the stock.

1854,JNJ,"Sanofi, Inc. (SNY  -  Free Report) announced that a head-to-head study comparing Toujeo (insulin glargine), a long-acting insulin to Novo Nordisk’s (NVO  -  Free Report) Tresiba long-acting insulin (insulin degludec) has met the main objective. The study showed that the extent to which Toujeo lowered blood glucose levels in adult patients with diabetes was similar to Tresiba.Other than assessing the similarity and difference in efficacy, the secondary objective of the BRIGHT study involves the evaluation of an important safety aspect such as the total number of participants with low blood sugar events. Full results from the study are expected to be presented next year.Sanofi’s shares have risen 9.2% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 16.5% recorded by the industry.Toujeo is already marketed in the United States and EU. The injection recorded sales growth of 45% in the first nine months of 2017 and is a key new product in Sanofi’s portfolio. Please note that Sanofi’s Diabetes franchise is under significant pressure with key product, Lantus, facing increasing competitive pressure at the payor level and biosimilar competition in several European markets and Japan. Moreover, a biosimilar version of Lantus hit the U.S. markets in December last year.In 2017 so far, Lantus sales have declined 24.9% in the United States due to lower average net price and due to exclusion from the CVS Health Corporation (CVS  -  Free Report) and United Health formulary plans. U.S. diabetes sales have declined 20.2% so far in 2017.In fact, U.S. diabetes franchise sales are expected to decline at an accelerated rate in the fourth quarter due to CVS/United Health formulary exclusion plans, continued lower average pricing and difficult comparisons with the last year.Sanofi carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can seethe complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked large-cap pharma stock is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of J&J have risen 20.7% this year so far while 2018 earnings estimates have gone up 1.3% in the past 60 days.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1855,JNJ,"Amgen, Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its regulatory application seeking approval to include data from the cardiovascular outcomes study, FOURIER, on the label of its PCSK9 inhibitor, Repatha.With the label expansion, Repatha can now be prescribed to prevent heart attacks, strokes and coronary revascularizations in patients with established cardiovascular disease.This year so far, Amgen’s shares are up 21.2%, better than 2.6% increase registered by the industry.  Data from the phase IIIFOURIER study, presented in the first quarter, had revealed significant reduction in myocardial infarctions and strokes on treatment with Repatha compared with the current best therapy alone.Repatha significantly reduced risk of hard MACE (heart attack, stroke or cardiovascular death) by 20% compared to the standard treatment with statin therapy. For individual components, risks of heart attack, stroke and coronary revascularization were nominally reduced by 27%, 21% and 22%, respectively, with Repatha.However, Repatha did not show any improvement in cardiovascular death risk, which had raised investor concerns then.Notably, Repatha gained an FDA approval in August 2015, for the treatment of patients, incapable of managing their LDL cholesterol at acceptable levels. It is approved in over 50 countries, including the United States, Japan, Canada and overall, 28 member countries of the European Union for the given indication.However, uptake of the drug has not been very encouraging so far due to higher pricing and re-imbursement issues/payer restrictions. Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) also faced similar issues with their PCSK9 inhibitor, Praluent.The FOURIER data holds the key to the commercial success of Repatha as it will broaden the use of the drug. With the cardiovascular indication approved to be included in Repatha’s label, patient access to the drug should improve.Amgen filed regulatory applications in both the United States and EU to include FOURIER data on Repatha’s label in June 2017. In July, the FDA had granted priority review forthe regulatory application.Amgen currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked large-cap pharma stock is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Shares of J&J have risen 21.5% this year so far while 2018 earnings estimates have gone up 0.7% in the past 60 days.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

1856,JNJ,"Shares of Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) declined 4.4% in 2017 against the large cap pharma industry’s surge of 16.3%.The industry’s rally was backed by strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance of legacy products. All these played a pivotal role in bringing the large-cap drug sector back on track last year. Pharma giants AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) led from the front and outperformed the industry.However, Merck missed out on the opportunity as it suffered some notable pipeline setbacks in 2017. In October, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings.In October, the company also announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This raised investor concern, as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain strength in the lung cancer market.In October, Merck also withdrew a regulatory application in Europe, which was looking to get Keytruda approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer.In September, Merck discontinued the development of two of its HCV combination programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold, following reports of death in Keytruda groups in July. Keytruda is seen as a key long-term growth driver at Merck and such setbacks do not bode well for the company.It remains to be seen if the strong performance of its new drugs, particularly Keytruda, its strong vaccines and animal health business and cost saving efforts can help Merck pick up in 2018.Keytruda, the second-largest product in the Merck portfolio, is gaining strong momentum from new indication of first-line lung cancer. In fact, Keytruda is continuously growing and expanding into new indications and markets globally. The Keytruda development program also significantly advanced in 2017 with several key regulatory approvals which should further drive sales in 2018.Merck’s global restructuring program aims at reducing the cost structure and increasing efficiency. It intends to reduce the number of manufacturing sites, including animal health sites, and consolidate other facilities. The company expects annual savings of about $4.0−$4.6 billion once the restructuring program is completed.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1857,JNJ,"The pharma/biotech industry was plagued by drug pricing issues last year. However, it bounced back and made a considerable headway this year, courtesy of a slew of FDA approvals. Particularly, large-cap players in the industry raked in stellar returns, up 16.5%, not to forget that the same space posted a decline of 5.2% in the year earlier.Upbeat quarterly results, rise in demand on new product sales, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results as well as a continued strong performance of legacy products propelled the large-cap drug sector to new highs this year. Moreover, these encouraging factors are expected to drive the sector’s growth in 2018.Meanwhile, jubilant Republicans passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Such tax reduction is likely to further boost profit margins of these companies in the large-cap pharma sector with more cash left in hand. This, in turn can also be used for striking strategic deals. It is to be remembered that mergers/acquisition activities lagged in the previous year.Notably, the Large Cap Pharma sub-industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of #104, placing it among the top 39% of the 265 plus Zacks industries. Our backtesting shows that the top 50% of the Zacks ranked industries outperforms the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one.Banking on such positive trends, investing in sound large-cap pharma stocks seems judicious. To top it, such stocks are fundamentally lucrative and ensure a steady stream of cash inflows. We have hence selected four such companies that have outperformed the broader S&P 500 index this year and are also poised to continue their winning streak heading into the New Year.Johnson and Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report)The New Jersey-based biotech giant Johnson and Johnson has outperformed the S&P 500 this year. Shares of the company have rallied 22% while the broader market has increased 20.2%. The stock’s earnings are further expected to grow 7.8% in 2018.The company’s track record of product launches has been impressive this year. It is making a fast progress toward achieving its goal of more than 10 approvals for new blockbuster products by 2021. Moreover, the company is targeting more than 50 line extensions of both its existing as well as new drugs. In October, J&J received an FDA approval for two line extensions of Simponi Aria for psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.Additionally, contribution from recent acquisitions, mainly Actelion, generated positive sentiments among investors. Continuous developments have led to a consistent rise in shares. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report)This Illinois-based biopharmaceutical company also outperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. Shares of the company have surged 56.1% during the period. This rally price movement was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen. The stock’s earnings are further estimated to increase 18.2% in the next year.AbbVie’s eight-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, secured approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the third quarter of 2017. Additionally, in August, AbbVie clinched a nod from the regulatory agency for Imbruvica to address its sixth indication among others.Meanwhile, the company announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus Roche's (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL in September. Later in October too, AbbVie announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies, evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara and Humira, for treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.Several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones are expected in 2018. Besides, all the above-mentioned factors bode well for the stock. The company is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report)The UK-based biopharmaceutical giant outperformed the S&P 500 this year. The company’s shares increased 24.8% during the period. It has announced quite a few progressions on the regulatory and pipeline front this year, driving a steady appreciation in share price. AstraZeneca also has a promising late-stage pipeline including immuno-oncology candidates.  Imfinzi, approved for bladder cancer and currently being evaluated for multiple cancers, is a key drug in the pipeline. The company has about 11 new molecular entities in a phase III trial or under a regulatory review apart from several lifecycle management programs.Last month, Fasenra/benralizumab has been approved in the United States for treatment of asthma. It is under review in the EU for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This month, FDA has accepted its application for the label expansion of its marketed drug, Tagrisso (osimertinib), for the first-line treatment of adult patients with metastatic NSCLC. Additionally, the regulatory filing for Tagrisso’s label expansion is accepted in the EU in November for a similar indication.In December, AstraZeneca also announced positive top-line data from a phase IV study, evaluating its marketed drug, Tudorza Pressair, for an expanded indication (COPD with cardiovascular risk factors).The company carries a Zacks Rank of 3.Novo-Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report)Novo-Nordisk has been in news for the past few months based on the encouraging progress of its diabetes pipeline. Constant improvements and corresponding approvals have led to a regular surge in shares. The company is a #3 Ranked player. Shares of the company have soared 49.9% so far this year, outpacing the S&P 500 index. The stock’s earnings are further projected to rise 5.3% in 2018. In October, the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee of the FDA voted in the 16-0 ratio in favor of the approval of semaglutide to improve glycaemic control in adults with type II diabetes. Meanwhile, late last year, the company also filed for semaglutide in the EU for the given indication. Moreover, in September, the FDA approved Fiasp (fast-acting insulin aspart) for treating adults with diabetes.In August, the FDA approved a label expansion for the company’s diabetes drug, Victoza. The drug is now approved to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type II diabetes. In the same month, the label expansion for the lessened risk of severe hypoglycaemia with Tresiba was endorsed by Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use in the EU. Tresiba’s label update should boost the company’s sales.ConclusionA series of data readouts plus upsides on both regulatory and pipeline fronts for the above stocks this year are likely to help continue the bullish run next year and surpass the broader market as well.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1858,JNJ,"Last week, we issued an article where we mentioned that mergers and acquisitions, which were quite lean in 2017, may pick up significantly in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved.The reforms aim to cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. The change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes will definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. Also, with focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and large drug/biotech companies struggling with organic growth, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in large M&As in 2018.Given that it takes several years and millions of dollars to develop new therapeutics from scratch, large pharmaceutical companies sitting on huge piles of cash may prefer to buy innovative small/mid cap biotech companies to build out their pipelines.In this article, we discuss some mid- and large-cap names that may be logical acquisition targets next year for companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and others. What matters for buying a drug/biotech stock is the current sales performance of its drugs/products, prospects of future sales growth, and the quality of the pipeline.The four companies we discuss have most of these factors going in their favor. Acquisitions of small-cap drug/biotech companies are very difficult to predict and quite frequent. Hence, these have been excluded from the discussion.BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc. (BMRN  -  Free Report)Companies whose product/pipeline portfolio includes rare disease drugs are in great demand as it is a less competitive space and the expensive treatments can bring in huge profits. BioMarin is one such drug developer. Its market cap is around $14 billion.BioMarin’s key orphan disease drugs – Vimizim and Kuvan – continue to do well, backed by strong underlying patient demand trends. BioMarin expects sustained growth in both the drugs. Brineura’s earlier-than-expected approval this year for the treatment of children with CLN2 disease, a form of Batten disease, was also a huge boost for BioMarin.Its impressive rare disease pipeline is also progressing well with approval for pegvaliase for the treatment of phenylketonuria expected in 2018. On the pipeline, we believe both late-stage candidates – vosoritide - for achondroplasia, the most common form of dwarfism, and BMN27 – for hemophilia A -  have blockbuster potential.BioMarin has already been the target of takeover speculation. Companies like Gilead (GILD), Amgen (AMGN) and Roche may be interested in buying BioMarin.Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (VRTX  -  Free Report)For Vertex, 2017 so far has been a tremendous year with positive data read-outs and regulatory approvals leading to an increase in eligible patient population for its two approved cystic fibrosis (CF) - Kalydeco & Orkambi. CF is Vertex’s main area of focus. With a consistent expansion in patient population, Vertex’s CF product revenues have increased quarter to quarter throughout 2017.The company is optimistic that the positive trend of CF sales will continue in 2018 as it gains additional reimbursement approvals for Orkambi in ex-U.S. markets and gets approval to launch tezacaftor(VX-661)/ivacaftor combination medicine.Meanwhile, the company has also made decent clinical progress across multiple CF studies this year and has meaningful pipeline catalysts. The market cap of Vertex is around $36 billion.Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) Incyte’s strong oncology portfolio makes it a lucrative target for companies like Gilead, Amgen and Bristol Myers. The market cap of Incyte is more than $20 billion.The primary reason why Incyte is ripe for buyout is its two products on the market, Jakafi and Iclusig.Jakafi, a JAK inhibitor, is the first and the only product to be approved by the polycythemia vera (PV) and myelofibrosis (“MF”) – two rare blood cancers. Jakafi is seeing strong sales performance driven by strong patient demand for both indications.  In order to expand the patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug, the company is working on expanding its label further. Iclusig is approved for chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Incyte’s pipeline boasts candidates like immune therapy epacadostat — being studied in combination with anti-PD-L1 agents of Merck, Bristol Myers and others — and Olumiant for rheumatoid arthritis – approved in Europe and regulatory application to be filed in the United States in January 2018.Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ALXN  -  Free Report)Like BioMarin, Alexion is also focused on the development and commercialization of life-transforming drugs for the treatment of patients with ultra-rare disorders. Its key drug is Soliris, approved for two severe and ultra-rare disorders — paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) — have been consistently doing well. Meanwhile, Alexion is working on expanding the drug’s label to include additional indications, which if approved, can boost further sales growth. It has two other drugs for rare diseases called Strensiq and Kanuma, which are emerging as growth drivers. Alexion also has a robust pipeline of several candidates under development including Soliris follow-up candidate, ALXN1210.Roche, Pfizer, or Novartis may be interested in buying Alexion. The market cap of Alexion is more than $25 billion.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1859,JNJ,"World AIDS Day takes place every year on December 1 with people across the world coming together to fight against HIV, to support those living with HIV and to commemorate those who have died from an AIDS-related disease.Everybody CountsThe slogan for this World AIDS Day is “Everybody Counts”. The goal is to ensure access to affordable and high quality care and services for people with HIV, a strong health care system, as well as the integration of HIV, tuberculosis and hepatitis services.According to information provided by the World Health Organization (“WHO”), more than 35 million people have lost their lives due to HIV so far while one million people died last year from HIV-related causes. At the end of 2016, approximately 36.7 million people were living with HIV. Number of newly-infected HIV patients was 1.8 million in 2016.Currently Available TreatmentsWhile there is no cure for HIV at present, the virus can be controlled through the use of effective antiretroviral (“ARV”) drugs. According to WHO, 54% of adults and 43% of children with HIV are currently on lifelong ARV - 19.5 million people living with HIV were receiving antiretroviral therapy (“ART”) in 2016. Combination ART (combining 3 or more ATV drugs) has been found to be effective in suppressing viral replication within a person's body thereby allowing the immune system to strengthen and regain the capacity to fight off infections.The HIV drug landscape has evolved over the years with drugs with varying mechanisms of action being approved over the years. These include multi-class combination products (Atripla, Complera, Stribild), nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs – Combivir, Epivir, Truvada, Viread), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs – Edurant, Sustiva), protease inhibitors (PIs – Prezista, Reyataz, Norvir), HIV integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI - Isentress, Tivicay) as well as fusion inhibitors and entry inhibitors (CCR5 co-receptor antagonist).According to WHO, new HIV infections fell by 39% between 2000 and 2016 while HIV-related deaths declined by one-third with ART saving 13.1 million lives. However, with only 70% of HIV-infected people being aware of their status, there remains significant need to spread awareness about the disease and the availability of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), which detect the presence or absence of HIV antibodies.  According to GlobalData, the HIV market across the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the UK, Japan, Brazil, and China, is expected to grow from $16.3 billion in 2015 to $22.5 billion by 2025.There is significant need for new alternative ARV treatment options that come with better tolerability, higher efficacy, and lower rates of treatment discontinuation. Here is a look at a few key players in the HIV market.4 Drug Stocks in FocusJohnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report): J&J is a key player in the HIV market with the company introducing several transformational medicines in this therapeutic area over the last 25 years. The company and its partner GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) recently gained FDA approval for  Juluca, the first, complete, single-pill, two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in certain adults living with the disease who are virologically suppressed.The once-daily, antiretroviral is a combination of Tivicay (INSTI) and Edurant (NNRTI) which maintains the safety and efficacy of a traditional three-drug regimen without an NRTI. Simpler treatment regimens will make compliance easier for HIV patients who need to stay on a consistent treatment regimen in order to keep their viral counts low.The company is currently seeking FDA approval with partner Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) for a darunavir-based single tablet regimen (“STR”). The once-daily regimen comprises darunavir 800mg/cobicistat 150mg/emtricitabine 200mg/tenofovir alafenamide 10mg (D/C/F/TAF).J&J is also working on an HIV vaccine. The company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine. There is significant unmet need for a vaccine for HIV – although a lot of progress has been made in treating and managing the disease, almost two million people become infected every year. Developing a vaccine for HIV has proved to be challenging due to the unique properties of the virus including its ability to mutate rapidly. Moreover, genetic diversity with multiple strains and subtypes prevalent in different parts of the world are additional hurdles.J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The stock has gained 20.9% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Gilead Sciences, Inc.: HIV is one of the primary areas of focus at Gilead. The company’s HIV portfolio includes drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Descovy, Odefsey, Complera and Stribild which contributed approximately $9.5 billion to total sales in the first nine months of 2017. Gilead’s TAF-based products like Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey remain key growth drivers. Gilead is currently seeking FDA approval for an investigational, fixed-dose combination of BIC/FTC/TAF with the FDA expected to respond on Feb 12, 2018. Meanwhile, the company expects to complete a 6mg cohort phase I study on GS-9620 (TLR-7 agonist, HIV cure) by year end. A late-stage study evaluating Descovy for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is scheduled to complete in the third quarter of 2018.With the company’s hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) franchise seeing declining sales, Gilead is focusing on its HIV franchise for growth. The company’s non-HCV products are expected to generate sales of $16 - $16.5 billion in 2017. However, competition in this market is intense. Moreover, the company is facing competition from generic products as well.Gilead is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. The stock has gained 4.4% year to date, compared to the 2.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.GlaxoSmithKline: Glaxo is a majority stakeholder in ViiV Healthcare, a global specialist HIV company, which was set up in partnership with Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) in 2009 and now has Shionogi as a shareholder as well. Key products in the HIV portfolio include Triumeq and Tivicay. Glaxo is working on bringing new growth drivers into the HIV business with Juluca being a recent addition. Glaxo is exploring new treatment paradigms (two drug regimens), new modalities (long-acting injectables) and new mechanisms of actions (including maturation inhibitors and broadly neutralising antibodies). The company is working on a dolutegravir – lamivudine combination which will also be for naive patients and a long-acting cabotegravir plus rilpivirine combination.ViiV has commenced a late-stage study on long-acting cabotegravir for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women. The study will compare cabotegravir injections given every two months to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Glaxo, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has declined 8.9% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.Merck (MRK  -  Free Report): Merck has a presence in the HIV market in the form of Isentress/Isentress HD, HIV integrase inhibitors for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents. The company’s HIV franchise brought in sales of $896 million in the first nine months of 2017, down 15% from the year-ago period mainly due to lower demand in the United States due to competitive pressures.Merck’s HIV pipeline has a couple of late-stage candidates - MK-1439 (doravirine, NNRTI) and MK-1439A (doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate – DOR/3TC/TDF). The company expects to file for regulatory approval of doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and as a fixed-dose combination tablet (DOR/3TC/TDF) by year end.Merck, a Zacks Rank #3 stock, has declined 6.1% year to date, compared to the 16.3% rally of the industry it belongs to.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

1860,JNJ,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has announced the start of a large late-stage African study on an experimental long-acting injection for the prevention of HIV. ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), said that the phase III study, HPTN 084, will evaluate long-acting cabotegravir monotherapy for the prevention of HIV infection in sexually active women.ViiV Healthcare is conducting the study under a public private funding collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. While NIAID, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is sponsoring the study, ViiV Healthcare and Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) are providing the medicines. The study will enrol more than 3,000 women between the age of 18 and 45 from sub-Saharan African countries.In order to prevent HIV infection, uninfected people, at present, use oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day. Compared to these, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months, if approvedGlaxo’s shares have declined 9% this year so far, underperforming the 16.2% increase witnessed by the industry.ViiV Healthcare is already conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravir in HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, also under co-funding with NIAID. Meanwhile, cabotegravir is also being evaluated in three late stage studies as a two drug regimen with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Edurant/rilpivirine, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Last week Glaxo and partner J&J announced FDA approval of the first dual treatment for HIV, Juluca (Tivicay/dolutegravir + Edurant/rilpivirine). Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.HIV has been a key therapeutic area for Glaxo. Its two new HIV drugs, Tivicay and Triumeq have been recording consistently strong sales while gaining market share. Glaxo’s HIV sales rose 16% at constant exchange rate in the first nine months of 2017. Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures goes toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Glaxohas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1861,JNJ,"This week, companies like Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) were in the news with both providing regulatory updates. While Novo Nordisk gained approval for a new type II diabetes drug, the FDA expanded the label of Lilly’s Taltz.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesNovo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Nod: Novo Nordisk got a major boost with the FDA approving the company’s new type II diabetes drug, Ozempic. Ozempic, a once-weekly GLP-1 agonist, is approved for use as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type II diabetes mellitus. Approval comes shortly after an FDA advisory panel had voted in favor of approving the drug.Although Ozempic will enter a highly crowded market, it has been shown to lead to clinically meaningful and statistically significant reductions in HbA1c compared with placebo, Januvia (sitagliptin), Bydureon (exenatide extended-release) and Lantus (insulin glargine U100). Ozempic is also associated with weight loss. Ozempic is expected to enter the market in early 2018 and represents blockbuster potential (Read more: Novo Nordisk's Semaglutide Gets FDA Approval for Diabetes).Positive Data on J&J and AbbVie’s Imbruvica-Rituxan Combo for WM: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner, AbbVie presented data on a combination of their BTK inhibitor, Imbruvica, and Rituxan for the treatment of both newly and previously-treated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (“WM”). The primary endpoint of progression-free survival (“PFS”) was achieved in the late-stage study. Imbruvica is approved for different indications including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, previously treated mantle cell lymphoma and WM as well as chronic graft-versus-host-disease (Read more: AbbVie/J&J's Imbruvica Succeeds in Combo Study with Rituxan).J&J is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. The stock has gained 21.5% year to date, compared to the 14.7% rally of the industry it belongs to.Sanofi Presents Toujeo Head-to-Head Data, Ends c. difficile Vaccine Development: Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) presented positive data on Toujeo from a head-to-head study versus insulin degludec. The effect of Toujeo on blood sugar levels was found to be similar to that of insulin degludec (Read more: Sanofi's Toujeo Meets Key Objective in Head-to-Head Study). Sanofi also announced that it has decided to end the development of its clostridium difficile vaccine based on a planned interim analysis which showed that the chances of the vaccine meeting the primary endpoint in a late-stage study were low.This is the latest blow for the company’s vaccine segment which is facing issues with its dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia, due to safety concerns. Earlier this week, the Philippines FDA asked the company to suspend the sale/distribution/marketing of Dengvaxia and withdraw it from the market pending compliance with the directives of the agency.Second Indication Approved for Lilly’s Taltz: Lilly’s Taltz (ixekizumab) gained FDA approval for its second indication with the agency giving its nod for the use of the drug for the treatment of adults with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA). Taltz was initially approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. Taltz works by specifically targeting IL-17A, a protein that plays a role in driving underlying inflammation in psoriasis (Read more: Lilly's Taltz Gets Approval for Label Expansion in US).FDA Nod for First Herceptin Biosimilar: The FDA granted approval to Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Biocon’s biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) blockbuster cancer drug, Herceptin (trastuzumab). We remind investors that earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Ogivri has been approved for all indications of the reference product, Herceptin, which includes the treatment of HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers. PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined 1.6% over the last five trading sessions.

1862,JNJ,"Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PTLA  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has extended the review period of its biologics license application (BLA) for the reversal agent of Factor Xa inhibitors, AndexXa (andexanet alfa), by 90 days. As a result, the regulatory body will now announce its decision by May 4, 2018 instead of the previously set deadline of Feb 3, 2018.Notably, AndexXa has been developed for patients treated with a direct or indirect Factor Xa inhibitor when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.Portola’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has soared 144.5% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 9%.The review date was extended to accommodate the resubmission of additional data provided by Portola in August. The resubmission was requested by the FDA in a complete response letter issued to Portola last August. In the letter, the FDA had requested for extra information related to product manufacturing.Importantly, the regulatory body had also asked for more data to support the inclusion of direct Factor Xa inhibitor, Lixiana (edoxaban), and indirect Factor Xa inhibitor, Lovenox (enoxaparin), on the product label. Hence in view of this, the FDA has logically asked for additional time to review the application.We remind investors that the BLA was based on positive data from two phase III ANNEXA studies that have evaluated the safety and efficacy of AndexXa in reversing the anticoagulant activity of the Factor Xa inhibitors, Xarelto (rivaroxaban), of Johnson and Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Eliquis (apixaban) of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) in older healthy volunteers.Significantly, AndexXa enjoys an Orphan Drug Status in the United States.AndexXa is also under review in the EU with a marketing application filed in the third quarter of 2016. A response from the regulatory body is expected in the first half of 2018.Per the company’s press release, more than 90,000 U.S. patients treated with oral Factor Xa inhibitors in 2016 were admitted to hospital due to excessive bleeding. It has also been estimated that more than 150,000 patients taking the injectable Factor Xa inhibitor, Lovenox, in the United States could benefit from an antidote annually.With no currently approved antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors yet, there is an urgent, gaping unmet need for the same in the market.Going ahead, we expect investors’ focus to remain on further details of AndexXa’s regulatory aspects.Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1863,JNJ,"Shares of Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) declined by almost 3.3% after the company’s Alzheimer's candidate, BAN2401, failed to meet the criteria for success based on a 12-months interim analysis as the primary endpoint in a mid-stage trial. The company is developing the candidate in collaboration with Eisai Co., Ltd.So far this year, shares of Biogen have gained 13.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 3%.The phase II study (Study 201) involves 856 patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease and positive biomarkers for brain amyloid pathology. The study uses Bayesian Adaptive Randomization Design which allows automatic changes to the design during the study. For early success, Study 201 will explore efficacy and the dose response of BAN2401 with 16 interim analyses, a 12-month evaluation based on Eisai's in-house developed Alzheimer’s disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) and an 18-month comprehensive assessment of treatment with placebo or 5 active arms. The Bayesian analysis at 12 months indicated that ""success was judged as an 80% or higher probability of achieving"" at least a 25% reduction in the rate of decline of ADCOMS versus placebo.The 16 interim analyses assessed potential for futility or stopping for safety. Neither of these conditions was met and the study continues to a full analysis at 18 months.Biogen stated that the 18-month blinded study will continue further analysis, following the predefined study protocol.  A comprehensive final analysis will be conducted at 18 months looking to demonstrate clinically significant results.  Data from the study are expected in the second half of 2018.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Notably, the company’s Alzheimer's disease (AD) pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168-with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November 2016, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate — solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Consequently, Lilly decided to drop the development of the candidate.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen Inc.

1864,JNJ,"While reports about tech giant Amazon meeting generic drugmakers made the rounds, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.’s (TEVA  -  Free Report) were in the news with the former reporting late-stage data and the latter announcing leadership and organizational changes.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesIs Amazon in Talks with Generic Drugmakers? According to a CNBC report, tech giant Amazon is in preliminary discussions with generic drugmakers including Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) and Novartis’s generic arm, Sandoz, about entering the pharmacy market. With not much information being available, there is a lot of speculation and discussion among industry watchers about the way the tech giant is planning to enter the market – as a drug wholesaler or a retailer.Pfizer, Merck KGaA’s Bavencio Fails in Late-Stage Study: Pfizer and Merck KGaA suffered a setback in their efforts to expand the label of their checkpoint inhibitor, Bavencio (avelumab) with the therapy failing to meet the primary endpoint of superior overall survival (“OS”) compared with physician's choice of chemotherapy. The late-stage study was being conducted to evaluate Bavencio for the third-line treatment of unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (“GEJ”) adenocarcinoma patients whose disease progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens, regardless of PD-L1 expression.The companies continue to evaluate Bavencio in the first-line switch maintenance setting for gastric cancer. According to information provided by the companies, gastric cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third most common cause of cancer death. With survival in advanced disease being poor and usually less than a year, the third-line setting is a difficult-to-treat population (Read more: Pfizer/Merck KGaA's Bavencio Fails in Gastric Cancer Study).Leadership & Organizational Changes at Teva: Teva’s new CEO has announced changes in the organization as well as leadership structure of the company. A key change is that the generics and specialty medicines segments will now operate as a single segment across three regions – North America, Europe and Growth Markets. The Generic R&D and Specialty R&D organizations will also be merged into one global group while a newly formed Marketing & Portfolio function will be set up. With these changes, Dr. Michael Hayden, Dr. Rob Koremans and Dipankar Bhattacharjee will be exiting Teva effective Dec 31, 2017. Several new appointments were also announced while a detailed restructuring plan will be unveiled in mid-December.Teva has many challenges ahead – paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track. Generic competition for Copaxone 40mg is another major setback for the stock.Teva has lost 59.1% of its value year to date versus the 29.2% decline recorded by its industry.Mylan’s Biosimilars under EU Review: Mylan and partner Biocon said that the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) has accepted their marketing applications for biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (trastuzumab) and Amgen’s Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). While Herceptin is used for the treatment of certain HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers, Neulasta is used for the reduction of the duration of neutropenia (low count of neutrophils, a type of white blood cells) and the incidence of fever associated with neutropenia in adult patients treated with chemotherapy in certain types of cancer.Both marketing applications had been withdrawn earlier following an audit that was conducted by the European inspecting authority of Biocon's drug product facility. Biocon said that it has completed the Corrective and Preventive Actions (CAPAs) based on the audit – these will be verified during inspection as part of the regulatory review process.Meanwhile, the companies should get a response from the FDA for their regulatory application for their biosimilar version of Herceptin by December 3. Earlier this year in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (“ODAC”) had voted in favor of approving the biosimilar. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the recommendations of its advisory panels.J&J and Partners Commence HIV Vaccine Efficacy Study: With focus on World AIDS Day today, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health has initiated the first efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine.

1865,JNJ,"Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) member Genentech, announced interim results from a phase III study evaluating Tecentriq and Avastin plus chemotherapy for first-line treatment of advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).The III IMpower150 study showed that Tecentriq and Avastin plus chemotherapy reduced the risk of their disease worsening or death by 38% compared with those who were treated with Avastin plus chemotherapy. Earlier in November, Roche had already mentioned that the III IMpower150 study had met its co-primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).Concurrent with the present release, the company also announced that the 12-month landmark PFS rate — the percentage of lung cancer patients who survived in a year without their disease progressing — was almost double (37%) in the Tecentriq, Avastin plus chemotherapy arm compared with the Avastin plus chemotherapy arm where the same was 18%.The secondary endpoint of the study was overall response rate (ORR) — the rate of tumor shrinkage. For the combination of Tecentriq, Avastin plus chemotherapy, tumor shrinkage rate was 64% compared with 48% in the Avastin plus chemotherapy arm.The Tecentriq study is the first phase III combination trial of a cancer immunotherapy to show improvement in progression-free survival for the first-line treatment of advanced lung cancer.The company expects to submit these encouraging results to the regulatory authorities for a potential label expansion of Tecentriq. Also, Roche expects to present results from the co-primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) in the first half of 2018.So far this year, shares of the company have increased 9.8% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.7%.In a separate release, Roche also announced positive interim results from the phase III HAVEN 4 study evaluating Hemlibra (emicizumab) prophylaxis dosed once every four weeks in adults and adolescents (12 years of age or older) with haemophilia A with and without inhibitors to factor VIII.The study showed that Hemlibra prophylaxis administered by injection under the skin once every four weeks showed meaningful bleed control in people with haemophilia A compared with the current treatment regimens that require more frequent intravenous infusions.Roche Holding AG Price  Roche Holding AG Price | Roche Holding AG Quote Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderRoche has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1866,JNJ,"Quite a few pharmaceutical industry mergers may be in the cards in 2018 if the proposed tax reforms are finally approved. The U.S. Senate passed an amended tax reform bill last week, thereby successfully passing the second stage. The bill will now be presented to a conference committee where representatives from the House and Senate will come together to draft the final bill.The tax reforms propose to cut the tax rate for corporates from 35% to 20%, which can boost profits of large drug/biotech companies. Meanwhile, the change in tax code will also allow companies to bring back huge cash held overseas at a one-time tax rate of 10%.These changes should definitely leave more cash in the hands of drug/biotech companies. The cash can be invested for mergers/acquisitions, which have been few in 2017 compared to 2016. Contrary to expectations of increased pharma and biotech mergers and acquisitions (M&A) in 2017, the focus was mostly on small bolt-on acquisitions and licensing deals and agreements.Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) nearly $12 billion acquisition of Kite Pharma and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion were the only two noteworthy deals of this year.With rising investor expectation that Trump's action on drug prices may not be as onerous as previously feared, there is a lot of chatter about a possible increase in M&As.Meanwhile, the major drug/biotech players struggling with organic growth need an infusion of new growth drivers in their pipeline/product portfolios — either from internal development or from buying assets. Strategic M&A and licensing deals are therefore inevitable for innovation starved drug/biotech companies looking for growth in a highly competitive and global marketplace.Drug/biotech companies have regularly tried to merge or acquire competitors in mega-merger deals to achieve critical mass both in R&D and sales and marketing. Meanwhile, smaller biotech research firms investigating new therapies or interesting pipeline candidates have also attracted the attention of larger counterparts in the last few years.With focus on drug pricing taking a backseat and possibility of repatriation of funds, hopes are high that M&A activity will pick up. Companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), and J&J are expected to take the lead supported by their robust cash flow and balance sheet.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1867,JNJ,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) and partner Janssen, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) pharmaceuticals subsidiary, announced that a combination study evaluating their key cancer drug Imbruvica in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WM), a rare form of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, met the primary endpoint.Interim data from the phase III iNNOVATE study showed that a combination of Imbruvica and Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan led to improved progression-free survival (PFS) in treatment-naive and previously-treated patients with WM compared to Rituxan alone. Based on the early positive results, the Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) recommended an unblinded study. AbbVie and J&J plan to discuss the positive interim data with regulatory authoritiesImbruvica is already approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of WM. In fact, including WM, Imbruvica is presently approved for six distinct patient populations including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).Imbruvica was added to AbbVie’s pipeline with the May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. It has become a key revenue driver for AbbVie. In 2017, AbbVie expects to record Imbruvica global revenues of more than $2.4 billion with sales in the United States expected to cross $2 billion. In the first nine months of 2017, Imbruvica had recorded sales of $1.87 billion, representing growth of 41.2% year over year.  In fact, AbbVie expects Imbruvica peak sales of more than $7 billion and revenues of about $5 billion in 2020At present, the CLL segment is the largest revenue contributor to Imbruvica's growth while expansion into non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) and other indications will be major growth drivers in the future.Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and AbbVie is exploring the potential to expand its label into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. Imbruvica is in phase III studies for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma. AbbVie is positioning Imbruvica as a “pipeline in a molecule” with the treatment featuring in several company-sponsored studies.AbbVie’s shares have gained 52.3% so far this year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 15% recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret; received FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvicaand settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen, Inc.

1868,JNJ,"AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) announced that a fourth pivotal phase III study evaluating its investigational IL-23 inhibitor, risankizumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.Top line data from the IMMhance study showed that a significant portion of patients treated with risankizumab achieved high levels of skin clearance. Nearly half (47%) of the patients treated with risankizumab achieved complete skin clearance versus placebo (1%) after 16 weeks of treatment.On continuous treatment with risankizumab, at week 28, 87% of the risankizumab patients maintained this response for one year. This data shows that patients can achieve better disease improvement over time on continuous treatment with risankizumab rather than withdrawing from the therapy after an initial response. Results from this study will support regulatory filings for the candidate.The 16-week results from this study were presented at the 8th International Congress of Psoriasis from Gene to Clinic meeting in London.AbbVie had in-licensed risankizumab from Boehringer Ingelheim in 2016. AbbVie is responsible for the future development and commercialization of the candidate.We remind investors that in October, AbbVie had announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and AbbVie’s Humira, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints. Top-line data presented from the studies showed that risankizumab achieved significantly greater response of clear or almost clear skin versus Stelara and Humira or placebo after 16 weeks of treatment.Risankizumab is also being evaluated in phase II studies for other immunological disorders like Crohn’s disease and psoriatic arthritis.AbbVie’s shares have gained 52% so far this year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 16.5 % recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained regulatory approvals in the United States, Europe, and Japan for its competitive HCV medicine, Mavyret, received FDA approval for the sixth indication for Imbrivicaand settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen, Inc.

1869,JNJ,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for label expansion of its schizophrenia capsule, Vraylar (cariprazine), for maintenance treatment.Notably, Vraylar is already approved in the United States for acute treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. It is also approved in Europe for the given indication.Shares of Allergan have declined 16.9% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 31.5%.The FDA approval was based on new data from a 72-week study in the prevention of relapse in adult patients with schizophrenia. Data from the study demonstrated that long-term treatment with Vraylar delayed time to relapse compared with placebo over the course of up to 72 Weeks.Significantly, Vraylar has performed above expectations in 2016, recording sales of $94.3 million in the year. The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top-line growth in 2017.Per the company’s press release, approximately 2.4 million people are affected by schizophrenia in the United States. Also, the disease relapses in 60-70% patients within a year if no maintenance treatment is taken. Hence, Vraylar’s label expansion as a maintenance therapy will cater to the hugely unmet need of patients, requiring a long-term treatment option for the disease.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market are AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc's (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.Allergan PLC.

1870,JNJ,"Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its psoriasis drug, Taltz, to include the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults.We note that Taltz is presently approved for treating moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who can have systemic therapy or phototherapy.The drug has grown more than 50% in the first nine months of 2017 and contributed significantly to revenues and volumes. This approval for an expanded label in the United States is expected to further boost its growth.Lilly’s stock price has increased 26.9% in the past one year, outperforming the industry’s gain of 20%.Coming back to the news, the FDA’s approval for Taltz’ label expansion was based on data from two phase III studies – SPIRIT-P1 and SPIRIT-P2 – evaluating the drug in active PsA patients, who have not received any  antirheumatic drug therapy or who have failed one or two  tumor necrosis factor (“TNF”) inhibitors, respectively.The drug achieved a reduction of 20% or more in a composite measure of disease activity (ACR20) in more than half of the patient population in both the studies at 24 weeks.The drug (80 mg/mL) can be injected as single agent or in combination with any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug like methotrexate.However, Taltz will face competition from several drugs, especially Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx, as both the drug works by targeting IL-17A. Cosentyx is also approved for PsA and plaque psoriasis.PsA is a chronic form of inflammatory arthritis, which is painful and progressive as well.

1871,JNJ,"Every year, World Aids Day is celebrated on Dec 1 to raise public awareness about Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, popularly known as AIDS. The day is observed to make people aware about proper cure and prevention of the disease. In this regard, this year, the theme for the day this year is ""Right to Health."" This day also commemorates those who have died from an AIDS-related illness.World AIDS Day is one of the eight official global public health campaigns marked by the World Health Organization (WHO). According to WHO, globally, about 36.7 million people were suffering from HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children less than 15 years old.AIDS is a pandemic disease caused due to the infection of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections, eventually leading to AIDS. Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Currently, companies are investigating new medicines to treat, prevent and ultimately cure HIV. Scientists also are exploring new treatment paradigms like two drug regimens, making therapies/drugs drugs with improved long-term safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, this disease still has limited treatment options. In 2016, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses, totaling to 35.0 million since the start of the epidemic.Based on these statistics, it is not surprising that several healthcare companies are investing a significant amount of their R&D expenditures on developing treatments and devices for HIV and AIDS.Stocks to Watch For On World AIDS Day, here are some of the key pharma companies in the HIV market that investors can rely on.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) has a long-standing commitment to HIV and AIDS. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, which was the first medicine approved to treat HIV. The sales of older HIV products — Epzicom and Selzentry — have been declining. However, the newer HIV drugs —Triumeq and Tivicay — are witnessing a consistent increase in sales and gaining market share.Meanwhile, a significant portion of its R&D expenditures are being used toward developing HIV medicines to treat/prevent HIV.Last week, Glaxo and partner Johnson & Johnson announced the FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Edurant/dolutegravir and J&J’s Tivicay/rilpivirine into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen to be approved that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.This week ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), announced the start of a large late-stage African study that will evaluate long-acting cabotegravirinjection for the prevention of HIV in sexually active women. If approved, cabotegravir injections will be administered every two months as opposed to presently available oral anti-retroviral medication, which needs to be taken every day.Already, ViiV Healthcare has started conducting a HPTN 083 study on cabotegravirin HIV-uninfected men and transgender women who have sex with men, under co-funding with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Meanwhile, cabotegraviris also being evaluated in three late stage studies as atwo drug regimen withEdurant, with the third study initiation announced earlier this week.Furthermore, Glaxo is developing two drug regimen ofdolutegravir + lamivudine.Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. In fact, Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product, Genvoya, happens to be a bestseller surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Currently, Gilead’s bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February 2018.The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. This combination is also under review in the EU.Another company working towards developing HIV drugs is Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). The company along with partner Glaxo recently received FDA approval for first two-drug regimen- Juluca, as discussed above. Further, the company along with The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and National Institutes of Health is conducting an efficacy study for an investigational mosaic HIV-1 preventive vaccine.The study will evaluate whether the vaccine is safe and is able to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among women in sub-Saharan Africa.  HIV has a significant unmet need and women and girls account for about 60% of people living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa.OthersSome other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report), Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) also recently received a tentative FDA approval for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.Meanwhile, Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, doravirine both as a single-entity tablet and in combination (fixed dose tablet) with other antiretroviral agents — lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). The company plans to file regulatory applications for the same before the end of 2017.ConclusionAIDS/HIV is a life threatening disease which has limited medical cure. However, there are numerous companies that are developing drugs for the treatment and care for people suffering from HIV and for them who are at risk of becoming infected with HIV, thereby making the space competitive.While Johnson & Johnson sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both Glaxo and Gilead carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1872,JNJ,"Minerva Neurosciences, Inc.(NERV  -  Free Report) announced that it has initiated a phase III study, MIN-101C07, to evaluate its lead pipeline candidate as monotherapy for the treatment of negative symptoms in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.Minerva’s share price has declined 51.9% so far this year, while the industry witnessed a gain of 7.5%.The phase III study design is a 12-week, placebo-controlled, monotherapy study testing two doses of MIN-101 — 32 mg and 64 mg — in schizophrenia patients with negative symptoms. The patients are required to have moderate to severe negative and stable positive symptoms over six months prior to enrollment The patients are also required to have a specified minimum threshold baseline score (>20) on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (“PANSS”) negative sub-scale in order to be eligible for the study.The primary endpoint of the study is to achieve an improvement in PANSS score. Top-line data from the study is expected in the first half of 2019.The 12-week study will be followed by an open-label extension study for period of 40 weeks.The design of the phase III study is similar to the successfully completed phase IIb study. The phase IIb study showed improvement in schizophrenic patients with negative symptoms treated with MIN-101 compared to placebo.With no approved products in its portfolio, Minerva is dependent on the progress of its pipeline. Moreover, with no major collaboration agreements the company doesn’t have a source of funds while it continues to burn cash for the research and development process. The company expects to incur operating losses going forward. The cash available is expected to fund operations for the next 12 months only.Any setback in the development of MIN-101 will adversely impact Minerva’s shares.Meanwhile, Minerva has a license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), for co-development of orexin-2 receptor antagonist, MIN-202, for treating schizophrenia.Minerva Neurosciences, Inc Price Minerva Neurosciences, Inc Price | Minerva Neurosciences, Inc QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderMinerva Neurosciences carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector include Celldex Therapeutics, Inc.

1873,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Germany-based partner Merck KGaA  announced that a phase III study evaluating their key pipeline candidate, avelumab, for the treatment of gastric cancer in the third-line setting, failed to meet the primary endpoint.The JAVELIN Gastric 300 trial study evaluated avelumab monotherapy for the treatment of unresectable, recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma in patients whose disease progressed following two prior therapeutic regimens, regardless of PD-L1 expression. The study failed to demonstrate superior overall survival – the primary endpoint – of avelumab treatment over chemotherapy.Though this study evaluating avelumab use in a hard-to-treat patient population failed, the other gastric cancer study — JAVELIN Gastric 100 — continues. It is evaluating avelumab in the first-line switch maintenance setting.Shares of Pfizer have risen 10.4% this year compared with a 15.3% increase for the Large-Cap Pharma industry. Avelumub, a human anti-PD-L1 antibody, received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare form of skin cancer, in March and for advanced bladder cancer in May, to be marketed by the trade name of Bavencio. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCC.Meanwhile, avelumab is being evaluated for different types of cancers both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets. Pfizer has also initiated avelumab double/triple combination studies for chemotherapy and targeted therapies and has eleven avelumab combination therapies with immuno-oncology agents under development.Currently, avelumab is being developed for more than 15 types of tumors including gastric/gastroesophageal junction, head and neck, Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung, ovarian, renal cell carcinoma and others.

1875,JNJ,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to its lead factor D inhibitor candidate, ACH-4471, for the treatment of C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G), a serious renal disorder.We note that the orphan drug designation is granted to drugs capable of treating rare diseases that affect less than 200,000 people in the United States. The status makes ACH-4471 eligible for seven years of marketing exclusivity in the United States, following an approval for C3G. The designation also makes the company eligible for certain other benefits, including tax credits related to clinical trial expenses, exemption from the FDA user fee and assistance from the FDA in clinical trial design.Shares of Achillion have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 31.7% in contrast to the industry’s gain of 3%.Preliminary data announced last month from a phase II study evaluating ACH-4471 demonstrated potential in treating C3G by reducing proteinuria, excess proteins in urine, by 50% over the treatment duration of 14 daysAchillion also announced the initiation of a phase I bioavailability study that will evaluate extended release oral tablet formulationsof ACH-4471. The endpoint of the study is to achieve once or twice daily dosing regimens of ACH-4471 with interim results expected by mid-2018.Apart from C3G, the company is also developing ACH-4471 in a phase II study in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”).The candidate also enjoys orphan drug status for this indication.Achillion has plans to initiate a phase II study in the first half of 2018 to evaluate the long-term potential of ACH-4471 in combination with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris for treating PNH.We remind investors that Achillion faced a major setback when Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) sold its stake in Achillion last month, following the termination of the global license and collaboration agreement for developing hepatitis C treatments in September.

1876,JNJ,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report), along with partner Gedeon Richter, announced positive top-line results from a second pivotal phase III study on its schizophrenia drug Vraylar.The study evaluated Vraylar (cariprazine) for treatment of adult patients with major depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (bipolar I depression).Notably, Vraylar is already approved in the United States and the EU for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder as well as for schizophrenia. Additionally, the FDA approved the drug last month for an expanded use as a maintenance therapy for treatment of schizophrenia.Shares of Allergan have declined 18.6% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 26%.The phase III (RGH-MD-54) study was investigating two doses of Vraylar (1.5 mg and 3 mg) in a total of 488 patients with bipolar I depression. The study met its primary endpoints and showed a significant improvement in patients compared with placebo. The drug was generally well-tolerated in the study. However, we also note that of the total number of patients, around 5.0% being treated with Vraylar discontinued the trial due to adverse events in comparison to 2.5% treated with placebo.Based on the above reported data, the company is planning to submit regulatory applications to the FDA in the second half of 2018.Significantly, Allergan has a licensing agreement with Gideon Richter, a Hungarian multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company, to co-develop and market Vraylar in the United States as well as Canada.Vraylar has performed well in the first nine months of 2017, recording sales of $200.1 million compared with $51.1 million, registered in the same period a year ago. The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top line in 2018.Per National Alliance of Mental Illness, bipolar disorder is one of the most common mental diseases and the third most common cause of hospitalization in the United States for both youth and adults aged between 18 and 44 years. Moreover, 2.6% of adults in the country live with bipolar disorder. Hence, approval of the drug for the expanded indication will provide the company with access to a wider patient population base with bipolar issues.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market include AstraZeneca plc's (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc's (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.Allergan PLC.

1877,JNJ,"U.S. equities have had a stellar run on strong growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump’s tax reform. However, latest developments in the political landscape in the United States spell trouble for the Republicans.Positives for TrumpGDP growth for the United States was revised up to 3.3% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the previous quarter. The third quarter reading was revised from an initial reading of 3%. This was the strongest quarterly growth reading in three years. Non-farm payrolls increased 228,000 in November, per the Labor Department.Moreover, unemployment rate came in at 4.1%, a 17-year low. This comes as a positive for Trump, who seeks to brand himself as a leader of the masses.Risks InvolvedHowever, all’s not well for the Trump administration. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy S. Moore in the Senate election in Alabama, a deep red state which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the November 2016 Presidential election. Moore had been accused of sexual abuse and child molestation, which might have been a factor for the relatively low support he received.“We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,” Jones said. “This entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law,” he added.The GOP Senate majority has slimmed to 51-49 after Moore’s defeat. This might create difficulties for the Trump administration to pass its key legislations.Although the Senate passed the Republican tax reform, there are increased concerns around the differences in the versions of the House and Senate. Moreover, geopolitical risks weigh on the markets. Last month, North Korea launched a Hwasong-15 missile with improved technology that flew over Japan in a latest show of force.Owing to the high uncertainty in the markets, we believe it is best to opt for low volatility. Hence, we will now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the low volatility space of the U.S. equity markets.iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF that provides exposure to U.S. companies with low risk.It has AUM of $15.1 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

1878,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) recently announced FDA approval for Juluca — a combination of Glaxo’s Tivicay/rilpivirine and J&J’s Edurant/dolutegravir into a single tablet — for the treatment of HIV.Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen. The approval of Juluca has shifted investor focus to the HIV disease space. Let’s see how companies are trying to tap into this huge market.A Note on HIVHIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens the immune system by destroying cells that fight diseases and infections and can eventually lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Medicines for the treatment of HIV are called antiretroviral therapy (ART) that slow or put a check on the progression of the virus.Globally, about 36.7 million people were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2016. Of the total, 2.1 million were children (less than 15 years old).Despite improved medical understanding of HIV and its prevention and treatment as well as significant efforts made by leading government and medical bodies, HIV and AIDS still has no cure. Notably, 1 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses in 2016, reaching the total number since the start of the epidemic to 35.0 million.Companies Developing HIV DrugsMarketed Therapies for HIVSeveral pharmaceutical companies are marketing drugs/therapies to treat HIV. Gilead (GILD  -  Free Report) is a dominant player in the HIV market with an impressive portfolio. The company was the first to introduce a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the treatment of HIV — Atripla. Gilead’s other STRs for HIV include Complera/Eviplera and Stribild. Its TAF-based product Genvoya is a bestseller, surpassing both Truvada and Atripla since fourth-quarter 2016.Another company, GlaxoSmithKline has a long-standing commitment to HIV and infectious diseases. The company had developed the widely used antibiotic amoxycillin around 40 years ago, and developed the first medicines approved to treat HIV (AZT). The company’s other marketed HIV drugs include Triumeq and Tivicay.Other popular marketed HIV drugs are AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Kaletra and Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Isentress.Another pharmaceutical company Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) has received a tentative approval from the FDA for its combination tablet, comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, to treat HIV.What’s in the Pipeline?Companies are working on developing new drugs to treat, prevent and possibly cure HIV. Scientists are exploring new treatment paradigms like two-drug regimens, making therapies/drugs with improved safety profiles and new mechanisms of actions.Gilead’s STR bictegravir for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision next February. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone.Merck is developing an investigational non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor MK-1439, doravirine for HIV -1 infection and plans tofile regulatory applications for fixed-dose combination of the same,both as a single-entity tablet and a fixed-dose combination tabletconsisting of  fixed-dose combination of doravirine (DOR), lamivudine (3TC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) n late 2017.Glaxo is also developing two drug regimens are dolutegravir + lamivudineand cabotegravir + rilpivirine.As an increasing number of companies are developing drugs to treat this life threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space. Meanwhile, it is to be seen how Juluca fares in the market.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake. The original article, issued Tuesday, Nov 24, 2017, should no longer be relied upon.)

1879,JNJ,"U.S. Senate Republicans revealed a tax plan that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year. Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump’s ability to pass laws, aggravated by the Wall Street ending an eight-week winning streak. After all, lowering of taxes was one of the major campaign promises made by Trump that helped push the major indices to a series of record highs since the 2016 presidential election. Add to this the high valuations and corporate debt plaguing the broader markets and the decade-long Bull Run is without a question nearing an end.In the wake of such uncertainty, picking stocks isn’t easy. But there are ways to reduce the chances of making a bad investment. In such a scenario, stocks that are undisturbed by market gyration provide steady earnings growth and have higher market capitalization, making solid bets.Tax Overhaul AmbiguityThe Senate seeks to delay the tax reduction plan until 2019. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as lowering of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% can strengthen the labor market and revitalize the economy. It will also encourage the world’s ingenious entrepreneurs to establish their business in the United States.On top of it, the Senate added that the plan will impose a minimum of 10% on income from intangible assets like intellectual property. Multinational companies that generate a significant portion of non-U.S. profits from intellectual properties were in the line of fire. Notable among them are companies from the tech sector. Tech & Banks Affected the MostTech companies, in the meanwhile, benefit immensely from the lowering of the tax rate. Their after-tax earnings improve leading to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and developments, and mergers and acquisitions. Hence, a possible delay in the much-anticipated corporate tax cuts resulted in a bout of selling of tech stocks.Banks weren’t spared either. This is because lowering of corporate taxes will bolster investments and will be a boon for lenders. Adding to the trouble for banks was a flattest yield curve for a decade, which will affect an already weak interest income at the nation’s largest lenders.Eight-Week Winning Streak Comes to an EndIn fact, the broader equity market registered its first weekly loss in two months as investors remained wary after the congressional Republicans failed to make inroads with passing tax cuts. The 30-stock Dow Jones fell 39.73 points to close at 23,422.21 on Nov 10 and the S&P 500 index declined 1%, finishing at 2,582.3. Both the indices recorded an eight-week winning streak, their longest since 2013. Meanwhile, the index of small-cap stocks, the Russell 2000, fell 1.3% and posted its steepest weekly decline since August.Volatility has crept back into the markets. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge which uses options-trading data to measure implied volatility of S&P 500 stocks, jumped 9.6% to close at 11.51. VIX also ended the week slightly above its 2017 average after touching a record low the week earlier.Other Potential Red FlagsNot only the delay in tax reforms, markets are flashing several warning signs. The biggest roadblock is lofty valuations. The bull market already stretches back to March 2009 as a result the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of the S&P 500 is well above 31, the second-highest valuation in a century as per Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, in Atlantic City, NJ. It now lags valuations seen in the late 1990s dot-com bubble.We should also remember that there is too much risk in the Bull Run as the gains are concentrated on certain stocks. According to David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers and portfolio manager of Wintergreen Fund such stocks include Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), eBay, Facebook, Microsoft Corp., Netflix, Priceline (PCLN), Salesforce (CRM) and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), all have gained an average of 29% so far this year. They have also contributed almost a third of the S&P 500’s return since the end of 2014.Last but not the least, corporate debt ceiling is on the rise. As per JP Morgan’s recent ‘Guide to Markets’, corporate debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) touched 45% the highest in recent history.Time to Buy Ultra-Safe Stocks: 5 Solid ChoicesWith the markets apprehending a healthy pullback after a strong run, investing in stocks that are immune to market gyrations seems judicious. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of ultra-safe stocks.They essentially have a low beta, which makes them less volatile than the markets they trade in. In this case, a low beta ranges from 0 to 1. They also have large market capitalization (a market capitalization value of $10 billion or more), which helps them provide steadily-increasing earnings growth without having much risk of collapsing. Additionally, such stocks flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) explores for and produces crude oil and natural gas. Recently, the company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.84. Exxon Mobil’s expected growth for the current year is 52.7%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 23.1%. The company’s expected growth for the next year is a solid 12.3%.Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report) operates as a payments technology company. Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.97. Visa’s expected growth for the current year is 16.4%, more than the industry’s projected growth of 5.4%. The company’s expected growth for the next year is a steady 15.6%.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) researches and develops, manufactures, and sells various products in the health care field. The company currently possesses a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.82. Johnson & Johnson’s expected growth for the current year is 8.2%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 6%. The company’s expected growth for the next year is a promising 7.7%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) manufactures and markets skin care, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #1 and a beta of 0.68. Estée Lauder Companies’ expected growth for the current year is 19.4%, more than the industry’s projected growth of 11.6%. The company’s expected growth for the next year is a steady 11.5%.Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) operates variety retail stores. The company has a Zacks Rank #2 and a beta of 0.59. Dollar Tree’s expected growth for the current year is 22.3%, higher than the industry’s projected growth of 14.9%. The company’s expected growth for the next year is a solid 8.5%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1880,JNJ,"Impax Laboratories Inc.  reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 23 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 19 cents. However, earnings were down 37.8% from 37 cents in the year-ago period due to higher costs and expenses.Total revenues decreased 9.4% year over year to $206.4 million mainly due to lower Generic division sales.Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $203.66 million in the reported quarter.Impax’s shares fell almost 4.5% on Thursday, following the earnings announcement. Nonetheless, year to date, Impax shares are up 29.5% against the industry’s decline of 31.5%.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Impax Generic division revenues decreased 13.8% from the year-ago quarter to $151.1 million. The decrease in revenues was due to lower sales of metaxalone, fenofibrate, oxymorphone ER, partially offset by higher sales of epinephrine auto-injector, products acquired from Teva Pharmaceuticals and new product launches.However, revenues from the Impax Specialty Pharma division were up 5.1% year over year to $55.3 million, largely due to higher sales of Rytary. Zomig sales were down 8.9% to $13.9 million.Adjusted research and development (R&D) expenses fell 21% to $15.4 million in the reported quarter due to closure of research and development facility in Middlesex, NJ.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased 5.5% to $50 million.Other DetailsIn July, the company received approval for generic versions of two attention deficit hyperactivity disorder drugs – Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Focalin XR (25 and 35 mg) and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Concerta (18, 27, 36 and 54 mg) – from the FDA. The approval of generic Focalin XR complemented its portfolio of generic Focalin XR, which included 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 mg capsules. These are already marketed.Concurrent with the earnings release, the company announced the completion of a phase IIb study on its Parkinson's disease candidate, IPX203. The candidate is an extended-release formulation of carbidopa-levodopa (CD-LD), which achieved an average 2.2 hours reduction in off time as compared to immediate-release CD-LD.Subsequent to the quarter in October, Impax and privately held generic drug maker, Amneal Pharmaceuticals entered into an all-stock deal to merge and form a new publicly traded company, Amneal Pharmaceuticals Inc. The combined company will have a diverse pipeline with more than 300 products either filed with the FDA or in active stages of development. The deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2018, will add to Impax’s standalone adjusted earnings in the first 12 months and generate double-digit revenues and earnings growth in the next three years.Meanwhile, the FDA approved the company’s abbreviated new drug application seeking approval for Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) chronic kidney disease drug, Renvela.2017 Outlook UpdatedThe company updated its full-year adjusted earnings expectation in the range of 60 cents to 65 cents per share (previously 55 cents to 70 cents per share.)The company expects adjusted gross margin in the range of 47% (previously 47% to 49%).Adjusted research and development expenses, including patent litigation expenses, across the generic and brand divisions are forecast to be in the range of $84 million to $88 million (previously $93 million to $97 million).The company maintained its adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses estimate in the range of $190 million to $195 million.Our TakeImpax’s generic division has been unfavorably impacted by pricing pressure prevailing in the U.S. markets. However, the company’s cost control initiatives announced early this year have improved margins and are expected to bring in more improvement. Moreover, its merger with Amneal will also bring in synergies. Moreover, approval for the full dose range of generic Concerta as well as generic Renvela is expected to have a positive impact on Impax’s revenues going forward.Impax Laboratories, Inc.

However, given its prevalence, it could become the third leading cause of death by 2020.Glaxo has also filed for FDA approval of Nucala for the treatment of adult patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (“EGPA”).Roche Lung Cancer Drug Gets FDA Nod for First-Line Setting: Roche gained FDA approval for its lung cancer drug, Alecensa (alectinib), for the first-line treatment of people with a specific type of lung cancer. The label expansion was based on phase III data which showed that Alecensa significantly extended the time that people lived without their disease worsening compared to Xalkori (crizotinib). The risk of the cancer spreading to or growing in the brain or central nervous system was also significantly lower in the Alecensa arm. This approval expands the patient population for Alecensa significantly with the treatment previously being approved in the second-line setting.Roche also gained FDA approval for its melanoma drug, Zelboraf, for the treatment of Erdheim-Chester disease (“ECD”), a rare blood disease.Roche has gained 1.1% year to date, compared to the 15.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index declined marginally (0.2%) this week.

1882,JNJ,"Total earnings for 95.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 7.6% on revenue growth of 4.6%. Though earnings growth appears solid compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 72.5% and 58.8%, respectively, look disappointing.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on Oct 17, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on Oct 24 and Oct 26, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), reported on Oct 27 and Oct 31, respectively.

Earnings per share came in at $1.90, 10 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 13.1% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 10.3% year over year to $19.65 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.28 billion. Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.25-$7.30 from $7.12-$7.22 and revenue guidance to $76.1-$76.5 billion from $75.8-$76.1 billion (read: Healthcare ETFs in Focus on Johnson & Johnson Q3 Earnings).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant came up with an earnings beat and in-line revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in a couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $13.7 billion were in line with the estimate of $13.17 billion. On a year-over-year basis, earnings per share and revenues rose 10% and 1%, respectively. For 2017, Pfizer narrowed the revenue guidance range to $52.4-$53.1 billion from $52-$54 billion while raised the earnings per share guidance range to $2.58-$2.62 from $2.54-$2.60.Merck Earnings in FocusMerck beat the earnings estimate while missed on revenues.

Merck raised its revenue guidance to $40-$40.5 billion from $39.4-$40.4 billion and earnings per share guidance to $3.91-$3.97 from $3.76-$3.88 for this year.Bristol-Myers Earnings in FocusBristol-Myers missed on earnings while beats on revenues. It reported earnings per share of 75 cents, a couple of cents below the estimate. Revenues grew 7.1% to $5.25 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.19 billion. The company raised its earnings per share guidance to $2.95-$3.05 from $2.90-$3.00 (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Eli Lilly Earnings in FocusEli Lilly topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.05 outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by couple of cents and came in 19% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 9% to $5.66 billion and beat the $5.52-billion estimate. Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.4-$22.7 billion compared with the previous expectation of $22.0-$22.5 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.15-$4.25 versus $4.10-$4.20 expected previously.ETF AngleThe string of earnings beat failed to boost pharma ETFs as they saw rough trading over the past one month.

1883,JNJ,"Pipeline and regulatory updates were the focus this week with the FDA approving the first two-drug HIV treatment in the United States and the European Commission (“EC”) granting approval to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya and expanding the label of Novartis’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Tasigna.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J, Glaxo HIV Drug Gets FDA Nod: J&J and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) gained FDA approval for the first two-drug HIV treatment in the United States. Juluca combines two approved HIV drugs - Tivicay (50 mg) and Edurant (25 mg) – into a single, once-daily pill for the maintenance treatment of virologically suppressed HIV-1 infection. The companies expect to make the drug available in U.S. pharmacies from December 11.Juluca marks the beginning of a new era in HIV treatment with other companies like Gilead also working on bringing better treatments to the market (Read more: J&J & Glaxo Get FDA Approval for First Two-Drug HIV Regimen)..EU Nod for J&J Psoriasis Drug: Janssen-Cilag International NV, a J&J company, gained EU approval for its psoriasis drug, Tremfya, for use in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy. Approval was expected considering the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) had adopted a positive opinion in September. The drug was approved in the United States earlier this year in July.Although the psoriasis market is pretty crowded, about 125 million people across the world are estimated to suffer from psoriasis including 14 million Europeans. 20% of these cases are considered moderate to severe. Tremfya is currently in late-stage development for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.Johnson & Johnson is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Roche Presents Data on Hemophilia and Cancer Drugs: Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) presented positive data on its recently approved hemophilia drug, Hemlibra, from a late-stage study (HAVEN 3) in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years or older) with hemophilia A without inhibitors to factor VIII. The study met its primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints with Hemlibra significantly reducing bleeds.Roche also presented positive data on a combination of its two cancer drugs, Tecentriq and Avastin, in patients with a type of advanced lung cancer. The drugs plus chemotherapy were found to significantly cut down the risk of disease worsening or death in the first-line treatment of these patients. Roche intends to submit this data to the FDA as well as other regulatory agencies. Although the data is not fully mature, Roche said that initial observations show encouraging overall survival (“OS”) data. The next OS analysis is scheduled for the first half of 2018 (Read more: Roche Reports Positive Data From Tecentriq Combination Study).Label Expansion for Novartis Cancer Drug: The EC has expanded the label of Novartis’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”), Tasigna (nilotinib), so that it can be used for the treatment of pediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (Ph+ CML-CP) and pediatric patients with Ph+ CML-CP with resistance or intolerance to prior therapy including Gleevec (imatinib). Approval for this indication was expected given a positive CHMP opinion issued in September.

1884,JNJ,"The Dow experienced a relatively sluggish holiday shortened week, suffering losses during two trading sessions. Investors continued to remain concerned about the Trump administration’s ability to push through tax cuts. Meanwhile, tech stocks notched up strong gains. Also, the Fed’s November minutes reflected the central bank’s concern about sluggish inflation.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow declined by 0.4%, or 100.12 points last Friday. Investors remained cynical over the Trump administration’s ability to pass the bill in the Senate by the end of this year. This was mainly because the Senate’s version of the tax plan was quite different from that of the House panel's in several ways. Along with the tax cut woes, news of a probe into Russia’s interference in 2016 U.S. election also weighed on the Dow.The index lost 0.3% over last week, marking its second successive weekly decline. While tax woes continued to worry investors, gains were capped further after shares of General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) plummeted to a five-year low after releasing weak EPS guidance for 2018 and halved its dividend.Moreover, oil prices declined after the IEA slashed its global crude-demand forecasts. Meanwhile, the Senate Finance Committee announced major amendments to its version of the tax bill. Strong earnings results from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. WMT and Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) helped curb gains for the index.The Dow This WeekThe index gained 0.3% on Monday. Verizon Communications Inc’s (VZ  -  Free Report) shares increased 1.7% after Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche raised the telecom giant’s price target from 48 to 50. Fritzsche also projected stronger dividend outlook for the company. Meanwhile, investors continued to focus on the prospects of Republicans’ tax overhaul plans.The index increased 0.7% on Tuesday following gains in the technology and healthcare sectors. Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) increased 1.9% yesterday while other tech giants like Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) gained 1.8% and 1.5%, respectively. Existing homes sales rose 2% in October from September to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.48 million.The index lost 0.3% on Wednesday after Fed minutes hinted that a near term rate hike was more or less certain but future hikes could occur at a slower than expected pace due to sluggish inflation. The minutes took on a more dovish tone than previous discussion, indicating that members were concerned that persisting with soft interest rates could build up a financial bubble. Markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.Components Moving the IndexApple has purchased Canada-based AR headset maker Vrvana for $30 million to boost its augmented reality efforts, per a TechCrunch Report.

1885,JNJ,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, Xeljanz (tofacitinib), for two doses — 5 mg twice daily and 11 mg once-daily extended-release (XR) formulation.With this latest approval, Xeljanz can now be administered for treating adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), who had an inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs) and tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, respectively.Notably, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) is approved in the United States as a second-line treatment option for patients with moderate-to-severely active rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”), who have had an inadequate response to or cannot tolerate methotrexate (MTX). The drug was approved in Europe and China in March for RA. Significantly, this is the first and only JAK inhibitor approved in the United States for both moderate to severe RA and an active PsA.Shares of Pfizer have gained 12.3% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 16.5%.A supplemental new drug application (sNDA) for Xeljanz was filed with the FDA in May this year for the aforementioned indication. The approval was based on encouraging data from two phase III OPAL (Oral Psoriatic Arthritis TriaL) studies — Broaden and Beyond — on Xeljanz.Both OPAL Broaden and OPAL Beyond trials evaluated the efficacy and safety of Xeljanz on adult patients with PsA. The programs achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of a statistically significant improvement with twice-daily Xeljanz 5 mg compared with placebo at three months as per measurement by American College of Rheumatology 20 response and the change from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index score.Overall safety results from these studies were found to be consistent with those observed in the broader rheumatology development program for Xeljanz.We remind investors that the company is also looking to get the drug’s label expanded to include treatment of adult patients suffering from moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. A response from the FDA is expected in March next year.Additionally, Pfizer is conducting a phase IIIb/IV head-to-head study comparing Xeljanz with AbbVie's (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. In February, the company announced top-line results from the assessment. Outcomes from the trial demonstrated non-inferiority of combo therapy comprising Xeljanz plus MTX compared with the other combo agents Humira plus MTX, thus meeting the primary endpoint.We are encouraged by Pfizer’s label expansion efforts. Xeljanz’s U.S. sales surged 44% year over year to $935 million in the first nine months of 2017. The drug’s label expansion should boost further the sales.Blockbuster drugs approved to treat PsA and RA include Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) Remicade and Amgen, Inc.'s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel that Pfizer markets outside the United States and Canada.In another Pfizer press release, the company announced that it has started a phase III study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of its once-daily janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor, PF-04965842, for treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This initiation surfaces as the first trial in the JAK1 Atopic Dermatitis Efficacy and safety global development program.Pfizer, Inc. Price Pfizer, Inc. Price | Pfizer, Inc.

1886,JNJ,"After months of discussions, House Republicans has finally passed the much-controversial $1.5-trillion tax-reform bill by a vote of 227 to 205 on Nov 16. The members of the Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 12 to approve their version of the tax package on Nov 16. This paves the way for the full Senate to hold a debate on the bill once the session resumes post-Thanksgiving. However, Republicans are going to make every effort to get the bill signed by President Trump before Christmas.Overwhelmed with the House victory, Trump said before a cabinet meeting that, “We’re going to give the American people a huge tax cut for Christmas — hopefully that will be a great, big, beautiful Christmas present.”Meanwhile, investors keen on the MedTech space are closely following the developments with the hope that the final tax stature may result in the abolition of the infamous MedTech tax. Before delving deeper into that, let us take a look at the primary objectives of the bills.A Brief on the House and Senate BillsAs per an article by Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport, published in The New York Times, the House bill proposes a reduction in corporate tax rates to 20% from 35%. It also shrinks the number of tax brackets from seven to four. Alongside, the bill intends to introduce an international tax system for the nation, more consistent with the tax structure of the rest of the world.It might also revoke or scale back many well-accepted deductions, including one for state and local taxes. The bill also focuses on doubling the standard deduction claimed by most tax payers. At the same time, it roots for the lifting of the child tax credit from $1,000 to $1600. Simultaneously, it calls for complete eradication of the estate tax and allowance of roughly $10,000 in property tax deduction.Meanwhile, the Senate Bill raises the child tax credit to $2,000. It also cuts the top marginal tax rate from 39.6% to 38.5%. Also, the tax cuts for individuals are supposed to expire by the end of 2025. At the same time, the plan does not propagate a complete repeal of estate taxes. In fact, it calls for the abolishment of the Individual Mandate provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) under which majority of the people will be required to have health insurance or pay a penalty.Considering the differences in the bills, it is a challenging task for the Republicans to come to a neutral ground and decide on the final structure.Tax Reform Bills: Boon or Bane for MedTech?According to a Business Insider report, the Republican tax plan repeals an itemized deduction that applies to healthcare expenses. This will affect families with high healthcare expenditure as these expenses will not be deducted from their taxes. Hence, most people will refrain from opting for expensive healthcare or MedTech procedures.  A report by The Hill says that the Section 4303 of the Republican tax bill plan imposes a 20% excise tax on goods manufactured overseas by subsidiaries of U.S. companies. Under the U.S. tax code, Puerto Rico is considered a foreign land which implies that U.S. parent companies will have to pay excise taxes if they purchase from their subsidiaries in the island. In this regard, the FDA recently found that around 30% of Puerto Rico’s gross domestic product was driven by pharmaceuticals and medical devices in 2016. Undoubtedly, the latest tax plan has created an uproar among MedTech players who might witness a huge reduction in their turnover following the approval of the bill.While the reduction in corporate taxes will lead to extensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, the question over its effectiveness looms large. This is because with a higher number of uninsured and lesser deductions on healthcare expenses, the industry is likely to witness a shrink in customer base post-enactment, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.No matter how the policy shapes up, it will prove beneficial to some and challenging to other players in the MedTech space. Meanwhile, it’s best for investors to stay on the sidelines until the tax situation stabilizes.Bills Mum on Medical Device Tax RepealThe community has been hopeful since Trump proposed policies that entailed the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. This dreaded tax, which was commonly addressed as ‘fund of the ACA’, dealt a heavy blow to the medical device industry since its enactment in 2013. This tax is imposed on the selling price instead of net profit, amounting to a stupendous sum, wiping out almost a quarter of the profit for medical technology companies.Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it for two years at the beginning of 2015. Thus, the reimposition of the tax on Jan 1, 2018 is much feared by medical device stalwarts.A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) made a payment of $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Medtronic plc (MDT  -  Free Report), Covidien and Smith & Nephew plc (SNN  -  Free Report) shelled out $112 million, $60 million and $25 million, respectively, in that year.  The situation for smaller companies has been much worse.In this context, ABIOMED, Inc.’s (ABMD  -  Free Report) CEO Michael Minogue quote (in an article by Cheryl Swanson published by The Motley Fool) is quite pertinent. He stated ""I don't think taxing the innovators and taxing the group of companies that provide innovation for healthcare is a smart idea, but the biggest concern I have, and what's unprecedented, is to tax companies that are not yet profitable, and in our industry where 70% of the companies are not yet profitable, this is going to have detrimental effects in their job growth, in their survival.""  Per data provided by the medical device trade group (in a Ken Blackwell article published by The Daily Caller), the partial two-year repeal of the MedTech tax had resulted in around an 83% rise in research and development (R&D) investments by MedTech players. The comeback of the tax will lead to a $15-billion rise in taxes in 2018, largely discouraging R&D activities.Undoubtedly, the future of the U.S. MedTech industry depends on the Republicans’ decision on the 2.3% medical device tax.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1887,JNJ,"AstraZeneca plc (AZN  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 core earnings of 56 cents per American Depositary Share (ADS), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents. Core earnings declined 17% year over year at constant exchange rates (CER). Lower product sales and gross margins and higher SG&A costs hurt profits in the quarter.Total revenue rose 10% at CER to $6.23 billion in the reported quarter. Revenues also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.75 billion. Revenues, however, gained mainly from the $997 million payment from Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) for the oncology collaboration the companies announced in July to jointly commercialize and develop Lynparza/selumetinib.Meanwhile, product sales declined in the quarter due to generic competition facing some legacy products.Key growth platforms (representing 66% of total revenues) were up 6% in the quarter at CER. Among the key growth platforms, Emerging Markets, New Cardiovascular & Metabolic Diseases (CVMD), New Oncology and Japan performed well in the quarter. However, Respiratory sales declined 2% in the reported quarter.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at CER.Product Sales DeclineProduct sales declined 2% in the quarter to $4.88 billion due to lower sales in the United States as well as Europe, which offset strong performance in emerging markets and in China.Crestor sales declined 14% to $580 million with sales in the United States and Europe down due to the entry of multiple generic versions of the drug in the market.Seroquel XR sales declined 68% to $62 million due to competition from generic launches.In the quarter, Onglyza sales declined 25% to $127 million due to competitive pressure in the DPP-4 class.Symbicort sales were down 4% in the quarter to $668 million due to lower sales in the United States and Europe. U.S. sales declined in the due to continued pricing pressure from managed-care access within the ICS/LABA class and also competition from other class like LAMA/LABA combination medicines.Nexium recorded sales of $469 million, down 7%. However, some legacy products that recorded growth in the quarter include Farxiga/Forxiga (up 29% to $285 million), Daliresp/Daxas (up 26% to $53 million), Faslodex (up 16% to $241 million), Iressa (up 10% to $137 million), Pulmicort (up 9% to $242 million) and Atacand (up 11% to $80 million).Among the newer medicines, Lynparza sales rose 36% to $81 million. While sales in the United States gained from the label expansion approval in August for the treatment of second-line ovarian cancer, in Europe, sales were pushed higher by a number of successful launches.Brilinta/Brilique sales were $284 million in the reported quarter, up 36% year over year and 4.4% sequentially. Brilinta maintained its leadership position in the U.S. branded oral anti-platelet market. In the United States., Europe and China, Brilinta continued to display an impressive performance.Tagrisso, launched in 2015, recorded sales of $248 million, up 7% sequentially. Another new medicine, Movantik/Moventig recorded sales of $30 million in the quarter, less than $32 million in the previous quarter.Bevespi, a LAMA/LABA in a pressurized metered dose inhaler launched commercially in the United States in January 2017, recorded sales of $4 million in the quarter, less than $3 million in the second quarter as the LAMA/LABA class grew more slowly than anticipated.PD-L1 inhibitor Imfinzi, launched for second-line bladder cancer in the United States in May, did not generate any sales in the third quarter against $1 million in the second quarter. A regulatory application seeking label expansion of Imfinzi to treat an earlier stage of lung cancer was granted priority review by the FDA last month.Imfinzi is a key candidate in the company’s immuno-oncology pipeline,which is beingevaluated for multiple cancers, either alone or in combination with other regimens. Last month, AstraZeneca expanded its clinical trial collaboration with Incyte (INCY  -  Free Report) to evaluate Incyte’s investigational selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, epacadostat, in combination with Imfinzi, compared to Imfinzi alone in early lung cancer.Regional PerformanceProduct sales declined 10% to $1.39 billion, primarily due to generic competition for Crestor and Seroquel XR and pricing pressure for Symbicort in the United States. European markets witnessed an 8% decline in sales to $1.19 billion. Revenues from Emerging Markets were up 10% to $1.52 billion primarily on the back of strong growth in China (up 14% to $723 million). In Established ROW market, sales were flat at $793 million.Other DetailsAstraZeneca’s core gross margin declined 400 basis points (bps) to 79.6%. Core selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses rose 4% to $1.95 billion.In the quarter, core research and development (R&D) expenses were flat at $1.34 billion.2017 OutlookWhile AstraZeneca retained its previously issued sales outlook for 2017, it slightly refined the core earnings guidance.AstraZeneca continues to expect total revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single-digit percentage range in 2017. However core earnings in 2017 are expected toward the favorable end of the previously issued guidance of a decline in low-to-mid teen percentage. Based on the average exchange rates in the first half, currency movements are still expected to adversely impact the top line by a low single-digit percentage but minimally impact core EPS.Our TakeThough AstraZeneca’s third-quarter performance was mixed, shares rose around 1.4% in pre-market trading on Thursday as the company brightened its 2017 earnings outlook. Moreover, the company has announced quite a few positive developments on the regulatory and pipeline front so far this year. The latest such development is the accelerated approval of Calquence for the treatment of mantle cell lymphoma, an aggressive form of blood cancer, last month.Backed by the positive news flow, so far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 22%, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14.8%. Astrazeneca PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Astrazeneca PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Astrazeneca PLC QuoteAstraZeneca currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1888,JNJ,"Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Ixifi its second biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) drug, Remicade (infliximab). Notably, Ixifi is a chimeric human-murine monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor.Ixifi received the nod for all approved indications of Remicade including RA, ulcerative colitis, plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn’s disease.Shares of Pfizer have risen 12.8% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s rally of 17.7%.The approval was based on an encouraging data from phase III study, REFLECTIONS B537-02. A biologics license application was filed with the FDA in April.Notably, in February 2016, Pfizer had divested the rights to development, commercialization and manufacturing of Ixifi in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to Novartis' generic arm, Sandoz. However, Pfizer retains the commercialization and manufacturing rights to Ixifi in all countries outside the EEA.We remind investors that Pfizer’s first biosimilar product to Remicade, Inflectra, was launched last November in the United States. The company has exclusive commercialization rights to Inflectra in the United States and on certain other territories.In September, Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that J&J is resorting to unfair practices to prevent the sale of Inflectra, available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost, which is 19% lower than J&J’s referenced product.Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J&J has entered into biosimilar-exclusion contracts with U.S. insurers. These contracts boost insurers not to cover Inflectra, thus making it difficult to access by patients and protecting its referenced product.Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts with discounts were offered to hospitals on purchase of Remicade on condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions. Pfizer claims that these unfair practices benefit sales of J&J’s referenced product, a key revenue generator for the latter.Pfizer is evaluating 13 biosimilar molecules in various stages of development.

1889,JNJ,"Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (REGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has accepted for review the company's supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the label expansion of Eylea Injection. The company is seeking approval a for a 12-week dosing interval of Eylea (aflibercept) Injection in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) based on physician's assessment. The action date set by the FDA is Aug 11, 2018.So far this year, shares of the company have rallied 3.9% compared with the industry’s gain of 3%.We note that Eylea  (aflibercept) is approved in the United States, the EU, Japan and other countries for the treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME), macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, which includes macular edema following central retinal vein occlusion and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion.Eylea injection is indicated for the treatment of patients with-neovascular (Wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first 12 weeks (3 months), followed by 2 mg once every 8 weeks (2 months).Eylea may be dosed once per month, but in most patients, additional benefit was not seen with this dosing plan. It is also approved for the treatment of macular edema following Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO). The recommended dose for Eylea is 2 mg administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly).It also treats people suffering from diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in patients with DME. The recommended dose is 2 mg administered by intravitreal injection every 4 weeks (monthly) for the first five injections, followed by 2 mg once every 8 weeks (2 months).The sBLA submission is based on an integrated analysis of two-year results from — VIEW 1 and VIEW 2 — two phase III studies that investigated the treatment of Eylea in patients with wet AMD. The integrated studies found that 51% of patients in the study had their Eylea dosing interval extended to every 12 weeks at the beginning of the second year (week 52) of treatment.The patients were able to maintain this every 12-week dosing interval and their best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) gains when they were assessed at the end of the second year (week 96). The second year results confirmed the sustainability of the vision gains achieved by EYLEA with a less than monthly dosing frequency. Thus, if approved for this indication it will mean that the patients will have to take fewer injections of Eylea than before.Label expansion into additional indications would give Eylea access to higher patient population and increase the commercial potential of the drug.Meanwhile, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) is developing brolucizumab for treating neovascular (wet) AMD. The candidate in November 2017, demonstrated non-inferiority to Eylea in phase III studies for long-lasting effects in patients. Moreover, it has shown superior improvement in reductions in retinal thickness due to fluid accumulation versus Eylea. A potential approval of brolucizumab will hurt Regeneron’s product sales.Ophthotech Corp. (OPHT  -  Free Report) is also developing its pipeline candidate, Zimura, in a phase IIa study for treating wet AMD with data expected late next year.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1890,JNJ,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) shares have gained 32.1% so far in the second half of the year, comparing favorably with a gain of only 3.8 % recorded by the industry.The share price surge was supported by a series of positive news in the past few months. AbbVie presented promising data from several pivotal studies, gained key regulatory approvals and settled its Humira patent disputes with Amgen.Resolution of Amgen LawsuitAbbVie announced the resolution of a patent dispute with Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) in September, which has delayed the launch of the latter’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s blockbuster arthritis drug, Humira in the United States to 2023 and in most countries in the EU to October 2018.This agreement has removed a major overhang on AbbVie’s shares though the company is still facing a patent challenge from Boehringer Ingelheim, which gained approval for its biosimilar version of Humira, Cyltezo, in August. Moreover, the agreement gives AbbVie ample time to focus on developing its pipeline and launching new products that will help make up for the loss of revenues once biosimilar Humira enters the market.Key Regulatory ApprovalsAbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the third quarter of 2017. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.In August, AbbVie gained approval for the sixth indication for Imbruvica. The drug was approved for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), a serious and potentially life-threatening condition with high unmet medical need. cGVHD is the first indication of Imbruvica outside of cancer. Also, Imbruvica is the first treatment specifically approved for cGVHD.Positive Data from StudiesAbbVie announced positive data from the phase III MURANO study of Venclexta plus plus Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) Rituxan in relapse/refractory CLL last month. The data showed that Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”).  Label expansion for this indication should expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential.AbbVie’s oral JAK-1 selective inhibitor, upadacitinib (ABT-494) met primary endpoints in a phase III study for the treatment of RA with highly statistically significant and clinically meaningful results for both the doses (15 mg and 30 mg) of upadacitinib compared to placebo. Upadacitinib also met primary endpoints in a phase IIb study for the treatment of adult patients with atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema. The company plans to advance the candidate into phase III studies next year. Data from both the upadacitinib studies were announced in September.In October, AbbVie announced that three pivotal head-to-head phase III studies evaluating risankizumab versus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara and Humira, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis, met all co-primary and secondary endpoints.ConclusionWith several pivotal data readouts and regulatory milestones expected in 2018, the bullish run in the stock should continue next year. Importantly Humira has been generating strong sales. Despite new competition, AbbVie raised its long-term target for Humira sales in October based on strong demand trends for the drug. Imbruvica, AbbVie’s second most important drug, is also doing consistently well and has multibillion dollar potential. AbbVie is exploring the possibility of label expansion into solid tumors and autoimmune diseases. All these factors bode well for the stock.AbbVie carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1891,JNJ,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space.

1892,JNJ,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies offering high dividends.JPMorgan U.S. Dividend ETF JDIV tracks the JP Morgan US Dividend Index.Fund CharacteristicsThe fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility and yield. It has AUM of $25.2 million and seeks to provide exposure to higher-yielding equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in Dowdupont Inc DWDP, Hollyfrontier Corp (HFC  -  Free Report) and Digital Realty Trust Inc DLR, with 1.1%, 0.8% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all just a little over 7.5% is allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Utilities, Financials and Consumer Goods, with 15.9%, 15.0% and 14.2% exposure, respectively (as of Nov 20, 2017).Market ImpactMoreover, markets anticipate an interest rate hike in the December meeting of the Fed. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 91.5% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike and 8.5% chance of a 50 basis point rate hike in December. This fund is expected to be significantly impacted because higher interest rates reduce the appeal of dividend-focused funds. However, Janet Yellen has warned that faster rate hikes might cause inflation to go below the Fed’s 2% target. Moreover, newly elected Fed chair, Jerome Powell, is seen as a dovish lead, who will not steer much from the current policy.There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s tax reform and deregulation plans.

1893,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the submission of regulatory applications to the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (""EMA"") seeking label expansion of its multiple myeloma (“MM”) drug Darzalex in the first-line setting.A potential approval will allow Darzalex to be used in combination with J&J’s proteasome inhibitor MM drug Velcade (bortezomib), melphalan and prednisone to treat MM in treatment-naïve patients who cannot have autologous stem cell transplantation in bone marrow. If approved, this will be the fifth indication for the drug.We are encouraged by J&J’s efforts to expand Darzalex’s label further, a drug which generated one-sixth of the company’s total oncology sales in the first nine months of 2017. We note that Darzalex was first approved in November 2015 as monotherapy for MM in patients treated with at least three prior lines of therapy, followed by approvals in the past two years as combination therapy in second and third-line settings.J&J’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The company’s shares have gained 20.1% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.8%.J&J has submitted top-line data from the phase III ALCYONE study to support its regulatory applications in both the geographies. Data from the study showed that the Darzalex combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50% when compared to treatment with bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (standard of care) alone.J&J will present the data at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology scheduled to be held between Dec 9 and Dec 12.We note that J&J licensed Darzalex from Genmab through its subsidiary, Janssen, in 2012. J&J holds the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize the drug and has to pay milestone payments to Genmab.Per the National Cancer Institute, 30,280 new patients are likely to be diagnosed with MM and it will cause 12,590 deaths in the United States in 2017 alone.Darzalex competes with other approved and marketed treatments for MM, which include Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Revlimid, Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Kyprolis and Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Emplicti.Johnson & Johnson Price  Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJ&J carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1894,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and partner GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) announced FDA approval for Juluca, a two-drug complete regimen of Tivicay/rilpivirine and Edurant/dolutegravir as a single tablet for the treatment of HIV-1 infection.Tivicay, a novel investigational integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI), is marketed by ViiV Healthcare, an HIV company majorly owned by Glaxo and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report). Edurant, on the other hand, is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) marketed by Janssen, J&J’s pharma arm. Juluca has been developed under a partnership between ViiV Healthcare and Janssen.This year so far, J&J’s share price is up 20.1%. This compares favorably with 14.1% increase witnessed by the industry.Coming back to the latest news, Juluca’s approval was based on data from two phase III SWORD studies. Data from these studies published in February this year showed that the combination of dolutegravir/rilpivirine antiretroviral was as effective as a three- or four-drug antiretroviral regimen as a maintenance therapy in HIV patients who have already achieved viral suppression.Juluca, the first two-drug regimen to be approved, reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.We remind investors that Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) bictegravir single table regimen (STR) for HIV treatment is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February next year. The STR is a fixed-dose combination of bictegravir, an INSTI, and emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (FTC/TAF), a dual-NRTI backbone. The combination is under review in the EU as well. Gilead’s HIV franchise is a major contributor to sales with approved drugs like Genvoya, Truvada, Atripla, Stribild, Descovy, Odefsey and Complera.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1895,JNJ,"Tax reform has been grabbing headlines since the election campaign last year. However, the plan has been modified quite a few times. With a Congressional vote expected this week to move the tax reform bill forward, let’s revisit some aspects of the bill and their impact on the biotech/pharma industry.Corporate Tax CutThe bill in its current form proposes to cut the tax rate for corporates from 35% to 20%. Although it is higher than the originally proposed 15%, a 15-point cut will also help companies to save a considerable amount in tax payment in the United States.The bill also proposes a full exemption on future dividend/income from a company’s foreign subsidiaries.Currently, if foreign income is repatriated, it is taxed at 35% with a full credit of the local levies. However, the change will allow foreign subsidiaries to send the cash back to the parent company after just paying local taxes.This will leave some extra cash in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share buybacks among others. The lower tax rate and inflow of foreign income may lead to a rise in mergers & acquisitions (M&A), which have been relatively low so far in 2017. Pharma sector acquisitions so far this year include Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) buyout of Actellion and Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) takeover of Kite Pharma.Minimum Tax on Foreign EarningsWhile the bill cuts tax rates and removes tax on dividends from foreign subsidiaries, it proposes to implement “minimum tax” on foreign incomes. Under the current tax plan, the companies can defer tax payment by parking its foreign profits in the host country. However, if minimum tax is imposed, there will be no deferral route to skip taxes. The companies will have to pay taxes (difference of minimum tax & local taxes) every year, which will increase the tax bill of U.S. based companies.This proposed tax may improve the competitiveness of foreign pharma companies like Swiss giants AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) against their U.S.-based counterparts.However, the rate of this tax has yet to be decided.Cash Repatriation WindowThe current tax plan allows multinational companies to keep their foreign cash in the host country and thereby defer tax liability in the United States. However, the proposed minimum tax will stop the deferral system. The companies that have hoarded cash in low-tax countries will be allowed to repatriate at a much lower rate.This move will also increase domestic cash for the companies. The biotech companies may utilize the extra cash to fund their clinical studies or make a strategic acquisition to strengthen their portfolio.DeductionsThe tax reform proposes to expense capital expenditure excluding costs for structures like plants and warehouses in the current year rather than deferring it over 5-15 years as allowed currently. The large pharma companies areexpected to have a huge pile of cash available with them upon a potential tax reform.Any acquisition or setting up of a manufacturing facility will help the companies to lower the tax bill in the near term. However, the reform will partially limit the deduction of interest on debt in tax calculation. The deduction limit is yet to be set.Moreover, presently the companies can claim a tax credit for half of the research cost related to development of drugs for rare diseases. This credit may get eliminated if the reform passes. This will hurt the small biotech companies, which could have recouped some of their development costs.Although the Senate budget committee has voted the bill for a full vote of the house, many are still sceptical about the tax reform. Many still believe that this will add to the country’s fiscal deficit. Some also argue that lower federal revenues, a result of lower taxes will strain healthcare funds.Moreover, healthcare costs are expected to increase in the future as the United States will see an increase in the number of aged people, which will further dent healthcare funds. Congress is still divided on the impact of the tax reform over the long term.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

1896,JNJ,"In an effort to enhance its shareholders' value, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) declared a 2.1% hike in quarterly dividend to 48 cents from 47 cents per share paid last quarter.The increased dividend will be paid on Jan 8, 2018 to shareholders of record as of Dec 15, 2017.The raised dividend rate brings Merck’s annual dividend to $1.89 per share, implying a yield of 3.5%, which is better than the industry average of 2.6%.Concurrently, the board of directors of Merck also sanctioned a new $10 billion stock buyback plan. Notably, during the first nine months of 2017, the company completed the purchase of $2.3 billion of its equity.Merck’s financial strength enables it to continue with its repurchase program and initiate dividend payouts. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents were $7.9 billion. The increased repurchase authorization and new dividend payouts are expected to boost investors’ confidence in the stock. Merck’s strategy to return wealth to the shareholders demonstrates its growth potential and a stable liquidity position.Meanwhile, Merck has a global restructuring program in progress, aimed at reducing the cost structure and increasing the company’s efficiency. It intends to decrease the number of manufacturing sites including the animal health one and consolidate other facilities instead. The company expects annual savings of about $4.0-$4.6 billion, once the restructuring program is completed.Merck has also divested segments like the Consumer Care business so that it can focus on its core areas of expertise.However, Merck’s shares have declined 6.2% this year so far, underperforming the industry’s16.2% rally. The company has also suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year, hurting the share price performance. In October, Merck decided not to seek an approval for its CETP inhibitor, anacetrapib, for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support the regulatory filings.Last month, the company also postponed the readout from an important lung cancer study to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study on Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This raised investors’ concern as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain strength in the lung cancer market.In October, Merck also withdrew a regulatory application in Europe, which was looking to get Keytruda approved as a first-line combination therapy for lung cancer.In September, Merck discontinued the development of two of its HCV combination programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — citing the HCV market to be extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies on Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in Keytruda groups in July. The drug is seen as a key long-term growth driver at Merck and such setbacks do not bode well for the company.It remains to be seen if the strong performance of the company’s new drugs, particularly Keytruda, its strong vaccines, animal health business and cost-saving efforts can help Merck pick up from here.Merck & Company, Inc.

1897,JNJ,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has given a positive opinion recommending marketing approval of its respiratory disease candidate, benralizumab. AstraZeneca is looking to get benralizumab approved as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults.The candidate is also under review in the United States with a response from the FDA expected this year. Meanwhile, benralizumab is also being evaluated for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in late-stage studies.The CHMP opinion was based on positive data from pivotal studies, SIROCCO and CALIMA, which showed significant reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function on treatment with benralizumab. Meanwhile, another phase III study, ZONDA, showed that adding benralizumab to standard of care led to statistically-significant and clinically relevant reduction in daily maintenance oral corticosteroid (OCS) use with two benralizumab dosing regimens compared with placebo.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 20.4% comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14.5%.AstraZeneca’s respiratory products on the market include Symbicort, Pulmicort Tudorza, Duaklir and others. Sales of its respiratory portfolio have declined 5% so far this year.Other than benralizumab, promising respiratory treatments in the pipeline include tralokinumab,in phase III studies for severe asthma, and PT010, also in phase III studies for the treatment of COPD. It remains to be seen if these candidates can improve AstraZeneca’s respiratory sales upon approval.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported a loss of 15 cents per share.The company generated no revenues in the reported quarter as was the case in the year-ago quarter.Shares of Achillion have underperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares lost 3.2% whereas the industry registered an increase of 2.3%.Research and development expenses decreased nearly 6.6% from the year-ago period to $15.6 million due to lower costs related to preclinical studies and manufacturing of ACH-4471 and lower legal fees as well. General and administrative expenses remained flat year over year at $4.8 million.Pipeline UpdateThe company is developing its most advanced candidate, ACH-4471, in – paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN) and C3 glomerulopathy (C3G) –  in the United States.A phase II study on its factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471 for the treatment of patients with PNH is ongoing. An interim analysis has shown clinically meaningful complement inhibition of factor D and a favorable tolerability profile for ACH-4471. The company expects to announce updated interim results by the year end.Another phase II study on ACH-4471 is expected to start in the first half of 2018. The study will evaluate the candidate in combination with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris for potential long-term treatment in PNH patients already being treated with Soliris.Moreover, the company initiated a phase II study in September on ACH-4471 in patients with C3G to evaluate the effect of a factor D inhibitor on the complement pathway. The company has plans to start another phase II study in the first half of 2018 to evaluate the candidate in patients with biopsy-confirmed C3G or IC-MPGN.Achillion will evaluate the potential of extended release formulations of ACH-4471 in phase I study, which is expected to start later this year.Meanwhile, Achillion is planning to advance a number of next-generation factor D inhibitors in preclinical or clinical studies including a phase I study on ACH-5228 expected to start by 2017 end.In September, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) terminated its worldwide license and collaboration arrangement with the company related to development of its hepatitis C treatment.

1899,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 4 cents per share in the third quarter of 2017, which was narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents. In the year-ago quarter, the company had recorded a loss of 2 cents.Quarterly revenues were significantly down to $0.16 million from $5.11 million in the year-ago quarter. However, revenues in the year-ago quarter included a $5 million upfront payment from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary Janssen related to a licensing agreement. Revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.59 million. Revenues comprised royalty and license fee revenues received under various non-imetelstat license agreements.Shares fell 1.8% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. However, so far this year, Geron’s shares have outperformed the industry, rising 4.9% during the period compared with the industry gain of 2.7%.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 39.5% to $2.6 million due to lower costs for the proportionate share of clinical development costs for imetelstat. General and administrative expenses rose 2.1% to $4.7 million due to increased stock-based compensation.The company ended the quarter with $112.7 million in cash and investments compared with $117.2 million at the end of the second quarter.Pipeline UpdateGeron develops anti-cancer therapies based on telomerase inhibitors. The company’s sole pipeline candidate, imetelstat, is in mid-stage studies and is being evaluated in hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Geron is conducting the studies in collaboration with J&J.Last year, Janssen announced unfavorable findings from the planned internal reviews of initial data from two studies of imetelstat — IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of MF and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of MDS.Following an internal review in April this year by J&J, the two studies, IMbark (phase II) on MF and IMerge (phase II/III) on MDS, evaluating imetelstat were continued unmodified.In the fourth quarter, 20 more patients will be enrolled in part 1 of IMerge in refined MDS indication to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier. Discussions are currently on with the FDA on data package and proposed refinements to the trial design for part 2 of IMerge. If J&J decides to proceed to Part 2 of IMerge (a larger, 170 patient, phase III study), patient enrollment is expected to begin in the fourth quarter.Last month the FDA granted fast track designation to imetelstat based on data from part 1 of IMerge.Meanwhile, for the IMbark study, the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed during internal review, supported continuation of thestudy without modifications. Data from the study is expected in the third quarter of 2018.Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteZacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderGeron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A couple of better-ranked stocks in the pharma sector includes Agenus Inc.

1900,JNJ,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) along with partner Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) announced that its HIV-focused company, ViiV Healthcare, has initiated a phase III program to evaluate combination of long-acting, injectable cabotegravir and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) rilpivirine for treating adults with virally suppressed HIV-1 infection.Shares of GlaxoSmithKline have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 7.7%, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s 15.3% rally during the period.The ATLAS-2M trials comprise the third phase III study undertaken by ViiV Healthcare to investigate a two-drug regimen for the treatment of HIV. The phase III program is designed to evaluate non-inferior antiviral activity of the combination regimen at 48 weeks when administered every 8 weeks versus every 4 weeks. The study will also evaluate pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of the combination therapy. Preliminary data from the study is anticipated in 2019.Notably, ViiV Healthcare was formed in November 2009 by GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer. The partners were later joined by Shionogi in October 2012.We remind investors that another phase III ATLAS study is already evaluating the monthly dosing of the combination regimen in virally suppressed patients, while the FLAIR study is evaluating the combination in the first-line setting. Outcomes from the study are expected in 2018.Notably, last week, GlaxoSmithKline and partner J&J (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced the FDA approval for Juluca, a two-drug complete regimen of Tivicay/rilpivirine and Edurant/dolutegravir as a single tablet for treating HIV-1 infection. Most medicines for HIV treatment are made up of three or more antiretroviral drugs. Juluca is the first two-drug regimen that reduces the number of medicines HIV patients take without compromising on the efficacy of a conventional three-drug regimen.Meanwhile, several companies are working on developing drugscombination regimens to treat HIV. Gilead's (GILD  -  Free Report) bictegravir single table regimen (STR) is under priority review in the United States. The FDA is expected to announce its decision in February next year.To the uninitiated, Mylan has received a tentative approval to treat HIV from the FDA for its combination tablet comprising efavirenz, lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate.With companies increasingly developing drugs to treat this life-threatening disease, competition has intensified manifold in the space.GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteZacks RankGlaxoSmithKline carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1901,JNJ,"After the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year, the drug/biotech industry, except for a small correction recently, has witnessed a turnaround this year. Stocks with large market cap have done particularly well. After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 15.3% this year so far with a number of things going in its favor.Strong quarterly results, new product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals and continued strong performance of legacy products played a pivotal role in bringing the large-cap drug sector back on track this year.Most drug companies with a larger market cap have seen their share price rising this year. AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report), Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) have even outperformed the industry. However, a couple of large-cap pharma companies have witnessed a downside this year. We discuss them below.Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report)While Merck was one of the very few companies whose shares were up last year notwithstanding the industry’s decline, it’s the other way round this year. Shares of Merck have declined 7.3% this year so far.Merck has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year. In October, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings.Last month, the company also announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study to 2019. This was due to the inclusion of overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer. This raised investor concern, as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain strength in the lung cancer market.In October, Merck also withdrew a regulatory application in Europe, which was looking to get Keytruda approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer.In September, Merck discontinued the development of two of its HCV combination programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in Keytruda groups in July. Keytruda is seen as a key long-term growth driver at Merck and such setbacks do not bode well for the company.It remains to be seen if the strong performance of its new drugs, particularly Keytruda, its strong vaccines and animal health business and cost saving efforts can help Merck pick up from here.GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report)Shares of Glaxo are down 7.7% this year so far.The stock was on a rising trajectory till the announcement of third-quarter resultson Oct 25. On the third-quarter conference call, Glaxo expressed its interest to purchase Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) consumer healthcare business, which the latter plans to put up for sale. However, Glaxo’s interest in buying Pfizer’s unit raised investor concerns about the acquirer possibly sacrificing a portion of its dividend payment due to the potential buyout. Shares declined sharply thereafter.Meanwhile, persistent challenges like stiff competition, genericization, pricing pressure and slowing growth in emerging markets have been hurting sales. Pricing pressure and competitive dynamics are hurting sales in Glaxo’s respiratory franchise, particularly the older products. Meanwhile, its top-selling product, Advair is also expected to face generic competition in the United States next year, which will further hurt sales. The slowdown in sales of the Consumer Healthcare segment this year is also a concern.We would like to see if Glaxo’s strong pipeline, consistent outperformance of new HIV drugs and vaccines, three new products — Trelegy Ellipta, Shingrix and Juluca — that have boosted its portfolio lately, and cost cuts can bring it back on track next year.Both Merck and Glaxo have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1902,JNJ,"U.S. equity markets are going through a rough patch. There is a lot of political uncertainty as markets predict the odds of the timely passing of President Donald Trump’s tax reform bill. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing (read: 5 Ways to Play Growing Dividends With ETFs).Trump’s ImpactThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, uncertainty over the tax reform has pushed markets lower. Per Washington Post reports, Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one-year delay in reforms.Although the House approved their version of the bill, there are significant differences in the bill from the Senate’s version. Markets are therefore worried that this could create hindrance in the timely passing of the legislation (read: House Passes Tax Bill: Likely ETF Winners & Losers).Trump aims to cut down on stringent regulations to improve ease of doing business. He especially targets to cut a lot out of the Dodd Frank Act as he thinks it restricts business growth. However, there has been no major development in the space and markets are worried about his ability to pass his promised legislation.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. Although the North Korean supreme has been relatively silent over the past few weeks, there has been other developments in the global markets that has been concerning investors.Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman looked at tightening his grip on power by ordering a crackdown with arrests of royals, ministers and investors. Moreover, Houthi forces in Yemen fired a missile toward Riyadh’s international airport. The missile was intercepted midway and debris landed near the airport.“We see this as an act of war,” the Saudi foreign minister, Adel Jubair, told CNN. Saudi Arabia accused Iran of providing necessary support to the rebels. Increased geopolitical risks have led to an increase in the price of oil and investors’ appeal for safety.In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends, while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

1903,JNJ,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported that the FDA has granted six months pediatric exclusivity to its pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Adcirca (tadalafil). This will delay generic competition for the drug for an additional six months.The pediatric exclusivity has pushed back patent expiry of the oral PDE-5 inhibitor to May 2018. The patent was otherwise set to expire this month. This means a generic version of the drug cannot be approved until then.Shares of United Therapeutics were up 2.6% on Monday, in response to the positive development. However, a look at United Therapeutics’ share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. United Therapeutics stock has declined 12% during this period, while the industry rose 2%.We remind investors that United Therapeutics bought exclusive rights to commercialize Adcirca for the treatment of PAH in the United States from Eli Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) in November 2008. Tadalafil is also sold by Lilly as Cialis for erectile dysfunction.The additional exclusivity for Adcirca was based on some study data submitted by Lilly to the FDA.Separately, United Therapeutics will be required to pay higher royalties on sales of Adcirca, effective from next month, per a previously announced amendment to the licensing agreement. The royalty rate on Adcirca sales is up from 5% to 10%. United Therapeutics also has to make milestone payments of $325,000 for each $1,000,000 in net product sales.Adcirca generated sales of $300.4 million in the nine months of 2017, up 15.8% year over year.Meanwhile, the company has three more PAH products in its portfolio – Remodulin, Tyvaso and Orenitram. With these products, United Therapeutics has a varied range of therapies targeting the PAH market.Lately, growth of Orenitram, Tyvaso and Remodulin has slowed down due to competition, mainly from Actelion’s new drug, Uptravi (selexipag). Actelion is now part of Johnson & Jonson (JNJ  -  Free Report). Also some patients are staying longer on front-line oral AMBITION combination therapy (Adcirca + Gilead’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Letairis) and delaying the transition to inhaled/injectable therapies like Tyvaso/Remodulin, thereby hurting their demand.Meanwhile, Remodulin, which accounts for more than 35% of United Therapeutics’ total sales, could start facing generic competition after June 2018.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1904,JNJ,"There was not much activity in the U.S. cancer space this week. However, we saw two drugs getting regulatory nod from the European Commission (""EC""). Zejula received approval as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer patients. It is set to give AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report)/Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) Lynparza a run for its money in the PARP-inhibitor space in Europe. On the other hand, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Tasigna received approval for label expansion in the first-line setting for paediatric patients with chronic myeloid leukemia.Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) submitted regulatory applications for label expansion of Darzalex as first-line therapy for multiple myeloma in both the United States and Europe. Moreover, Roche Holding (RHHBY  -  Free Report) announced encouraging results from a phase III study evaluating Tecentriq in combination with chemotherapy in stage IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (""NSCLC"").Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesTESARO’s Zejula Approved in Europe: The European Commission has granted marketing authorization to Zejula as maintenance treatment for women with recurrent ovarian cancer. It is the first PARP inhibitor to receive approval in Europe, which does not require BRCA mutation or other biomarker testing. The drug is already marketed in the United States in the same indication.Zejula will now compete with Lynparza that is already approved in Europe. However, Zejula has an edge as Lynparza requires BRCA-mutation status in Europe. Zejula has performed well in the United States since launch. Similar adoption of the drug in Europe will aid the company. (Read more: TESARO Ovarian Cancer Drug Zejula Gets Approval in EU)TESARO, Inc. Price  TESARO, Inc. Price | TESARO, Inc.

1905,JNJ,"After a weak performance in 2016 due to drug pricing issues, the pharma industry has bounced back this year except for a minor correction recently. While Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) was one of the very few companies whose shares were up last year notwithstanding the industry’s decline, it’s the other way round this year.Shares of Merck have declined 7.6% this year against a 14.8% increase for the Large-Cap Pharma industry. Let us discuss why.Merck has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year. In October, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings.Last month, the company also announced a delay in the readout from an important lung cancer study. It said that since it was including overall survival as a co-primary endpoint in the KEYNOTE-189 phase III study of Keytruda in first-line lung cancer, it will delay the readout from the study to 2019. This raised investor concern, as the delay in the readout can give competitors a chance to gain strength in the lung cancer market.In October, Merck also withdrew a regulatory application in Europe, which was looking to get Keytruda approved as first-line combination therapy for lung cancer. Please note that since October, shares of Merck are down 15.1% -- the result of these back-to-back pipeline setbacks.In September, Merck discontinued the development of two of its HCV combination programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in Keytruda groups in July. Keytruda is seen as a key long-term growth driver at Merck and such setbacks do not bode well for the company.It remains to be seen if the strong performance of its new drugs, particularly Keytruda, its strong vaccines and animal health business and cost saving efforts can help Merck pick up from here.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1906,JNJ,"The FDA, which approved 22 novel drugs last year, has given its approval to 34 drugs so far in 2017 including three in September. Key approvals this year include Novartis’s Kymriah (the first gene therapy in the United States), Lilly’s Verzenio (advanced or metastatic breast cancer), Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Quite a few of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of October.Will Flexion Gain Approval for its First Drug?Specialty pharma company, Flexion Therapeutics (FLXN  -  Free Report) is awaiting FDA approval of its first product, Zilretta. The company, which is focused on the development and commercialization of novel, local therapies for the treatment of patients with musculoskeletal conditions, beginning with osteoarthritis (“OA”), expects a decision from the agency on Oct 6, 2017. Flexion is looking to get Zilretta approved for the treatment of OA related knee pain. Zilretta, a non-opioid, could provide OA patients with a new and alternative treatment option on approval. Flexion already has a sales leadership team in place and said that the pre-approval inspection of the Patheon manufacturing facility was concluded without any observations.Flexion stock has gained 27.1% year to date, substantially outperforming the 3.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Alexion’s Soliris Label to be Expanded Again?Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN  -  Free Report) is working on expanding the label of its flagship product, Soliris (eculizumab). Soliris, currently approved in the United States for serious ultra-rare disorders like paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), brought in sales of $1.6 billion in the first half of the year. Alexion has a key catalyst coming up with a decision from the FDA expected by Oct 23, 2017 regarding the approvability of Soliris for refractory generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). EU approval for this indication came in August making it the first and only complement-based therapy approved for an ultra-rare subset of gMG. The gMG indication represents incremental growth opportunity for Soliris.Alexion’s shares are up 14.7% year to date, compared to the industry’s 16.2% rally. Alexion is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CRL Likely for PTC’s TranslarnaPTC Therapeutics (PTCT  -  Free Report) is expecting a decision from the FDA regarding the approval status of Translarna for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD). While approved in the EU, Translarna is yet to gain approval in the United States. The company had initially filed a new drug application (“NDA”) in the United States in December 2015. However, in February 2016, the FDA issued a refusal to file (“RTF”) letter saying that the NDA was not sufficiently complete to allow a substantive review. The company was told that both the phase IIb and phase III ACT DMD studies were negative and did not provide sufficient evidence of effectiveness and adequate information about the abuse potential of Translarna. PTC filed a NDA in the first quarter of 2017 and was assigned an FDA action date of Oct 24, 2017.However, chances of gaining approval seem low considering Translarna failed to gain the support of an FDA advisory panel last week. While the panel found the drug to be effective, they found the submitted data inconclusive and said that more data would be needed to support efficacy. Given this situation, we believe the FDA will issue a complete response letter (“CRL”) and ask for additional data.PTC’s shares are up 83.4% year to date, compared to the industry’s 3.6% rally.Apart from the above three companies, quite a few other companies are awaiting decisions from the FDA. Industry bellwether, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is seeking FDA approval for a 10mg dose of Xarelto for reducing the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). With the FDA granting priority review, a response should be out on Oct 28, 2017.Cancer-focused company, TESARO (TSRO  -  Free Report) is expecting a decision from the FDA for its intravenous (“IV”) formulation of rolapitant on Oct 25, 2017. The company had received a CRL earlier this year for the IV formulation.Specialty pharma company, AcelRx Pharmaceuticals (ACRX  -  Free Report) expects a response from the FDA regarding its NDA for Dsuvia (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) on Oct 12, 2017. Dsuvia is under review for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain in medically supervised settings.Meanwhile, Aerie Pharmaceuticals’s (AERI  -  Free Report) Rhopressa will be evaluated by an FDA advisory panel for the treatment of patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension on Oct 13, 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1907,JNJ,"AstraZeneca, plc (AZN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has granted approval to a new indication for its breast cancer drug, Faslodex.The label of Faslodex will now be expanded to include combination use with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) new CDK4/6 inhibitor Verzenio/abemaciclib to treat women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy.The FDA approval was based on the MONARCH 2 study data, which showed that Faslodex+Verzeniosignificantly improved progression-free survival (16.4 months) compared to Faslodex+ placebo.Shares of this London, United Kingdom based pharma giant have gained 22.2% so far this year, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 14%.In August, Faslodex had received FDA approval for a label extension in the first-line monotherapy setting for the treatment of postmenopausal women with HR+ advanced breast cancer. Until this approval, Faslodex was only approved for advanced breast cancer in later lines of treatment.We believe that the FDA approval for two new indications for Faslodex in three months can improve sales of the drug in the future quarters. The drug has generated sales of $703 million in 2017 so far, up 16% year over year.Also, please note that this is the second time that Faslodex has been approved for use in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor. It is already marketed in combination with Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Ibrance.AstraZeneca carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1908,JNJ,"With third quarter earnings season drawing to a close, the focus is back on deals, regulatory approvals and pipeline updates. This week, companies like AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report) and Bayer (BAYRY  -  Free Report) were in the news with the former announcing the FDA approval of its severe asthma drug while Bayer signed a cancer-focused deal with Loxo Oncology.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Approval for AstraZeneca Severe Asthma Drug: AstraZeneca continues to deliver on its pipeline with the company scoring a couple of FDA nods this week. The regulatory body granted approval to the company’s respiratory biologic, Fasenra (benralizumab), for the add-on maintenance treatment of severe asthma patients (aged 12 years and above) whose disease is driven by eosinophilic inflammation (Read more: AstraZeneca's Asthma Drug Benralizumab Approved by FDA). Moreover, AstraZeneca got a positive opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) for Fasenra (Read more: AstraZeneca Gets Positive CHMP Opinion for Asthma Candidate).AstraZeneca also gained FDA approval for the use of its cancer drug, Faslodex, in an expanded patient population. Faslodex can now be used in combination with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) CDK4/6 inhibitor, Verzenio (abemaciclib), in women with HR+, HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) whose disease has progressed after endocrine therapy. Study results had shown 16.4 months of progression-free survival (“PFS”) on the combination treatment.This marks the second FDA approval for Faslodex with a CDK4/6 inhibitor – the treatment is already approved for use in combination with Pfizer’s CDK4/6 inhibitor, Ibrance (palbociclib).FDA Advisory Panel Meeting for Pacira’s Exparel sNDA: Specialty pharma company, Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PCRX  -  Free Report) announced that its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Exparel for its use as a nerve block for regional analgesia will be discussed by the FDA’s Anesthetic and Analgesic Drug Products Advisory Committee (AADPAC).

The deal, which could see Bayer shelling out up to $1.55 billion, will see the companies collaborating for the global development and commercialization of Loxo’s highly selective TRK inhibitors, larotrectinib and LOXO-195, for patients with TRK fusion cancers.The agreement terms include a $400 million upfront payment. Loxo could receive another $450 million on the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones and an additional $200 million for milestones related to LOXO-195. Development costs will be split equally by the companies. The companies will co-promote in the United States while Loxo will receive tiered, double-digit royalties on net sales, and sales milestones totaling $475 million for ex-U.S. territories. Larotrectinib is scheduled to be filed for FDA approval in late 2017/early 2018.J&J’s Janssen Biotech in Licensing Deal with Zymeworks: Janssen Biotech, a Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) company, has entered into a licensing agreement with Zymeworks for the development and commercialization of next generation bispecific antibody therapeutics.Under the deal, Janssen will get a worldwide, royalty-bearing license to research, develop, and commercialize up to six bispecific antibodies using Zymeworks’ Azymetric and EFECT platforms.

Merck is seeking EU approval for Prevymis for the prevention of cytomegalovirus (“CMV”) reactivation and disease in adult CMV-seropositive recipients of an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (“HSCT”). With the CHMP giving a positive opinion, chances of gaining approval look high. A decision regarding EU approval is expected within two months (Read more: Merck Gets CHMP Nod for Infection Candidate Prevymis).Updated Data on Bristol-Myers’ Immuno-Oncology Combination: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) announced updated results on a combination of Opdivo and BMS-986205, a selective, once-daily oral IDO1 inhibitor, from an ongoing phase I/IIa dose escalation and expansion study.

1909,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) presented new data from a large CANVAS outcomes program on its type II diabetes drug, Invokana (SGLT2 inhibitor), demonstrating an improved renal outcome. The data was presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions in California and published in the Circulation.So far this year, Johnson & Johnson’s share price has increased 21.1%, comparing favorably with the 14.4% rally of the industry it belongs to.This new analysis of CANVAS showed a reduction in the risk of the composite renal endpoint in both patient groups — with a history of CV disease (secondary prevention) and those with only risk factors for CV disease (primary prevention). Also, Invokana demonstrated reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to heart failure (HHF) in both patient groups. No new adverse events were reported during this additional analysis.We remind investors that in June, the company reported data from the CANVAS program, which demonstrated that Invokana was successful in reducing the risks of cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in type II diabetes patients, who have established cardiovascular (CV) disease or are at a risk for CV disease. Invokana reduced major adverse CV events or MACE by 14% compared with placebo. MACE is a composite endpoint of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke. However, the study also showed that the drug increased the risk of amputations.Last month, J&J submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for the label expansion of Invokana to include the cardiovascular indication based on the data from the CANVAS program.Many pharma companies are working hard to get the labels of their diabetes medicines updated to include the cardiovascular benefits. With death from cardiovascular diseases being significantly higher in adults with diabetes compared with those without it, the addition of positive CV outcomes on labels of diabetes drugs can give sales a shot in the arm.Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) received both FDA and EU approvals last year to include the CV risk reduction data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study on the label of Jardiance. Additionally, in August, Novo Nordisk’s (NVO  -  Free Report) Victoza (liraglutide) was approved by the FDA for a new indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.However, in May, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) was denied an approval by the FDA to include cardiovascular outcomes data from the TECOS trial on the labels of its DPP-IV inhibitor, Januvia (sitagliptin) and other medicines containing Januvia.AstraZeneca’s Bydureon also failed to reduce the cardiovascular risk in a phase IIIb/IV cardiovascular outcomes study, EXSCEL.Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteZacks RankJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1910,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 1 after market closes.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 20%.Geron’s shares have underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has lost 1.4% while the industry witnessed a gain of 3.7% in the said time frame.Pipeline Remains in FocusGeron’s revenues solely comprise license fees and royalties as it has no approved product in its portfolio. Moreover, it has only one candidate in its pipeline, imetelstat. Hence, investor focus will remain on any updates related to it.Geron is developing imetelstat in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) for treating patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (""MF""), myelodysplastic syndromes (""MDS"") and acute myelogenous leukemia (""AML"").Two late-stage studies for imetelstat are ongoing – IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of MF, and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of MDS.Following second internal review of data from IMbark and IMerge in April by J&J the studies continued unmodified. Part 1 of IMerge will enroll 20 more patients in fourth quarter in refined MDS indication to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed earlier.Janssen will decide on continuation of the part 2 of IMerge based on ongoing FDA interactions on data package and proposed refinements to the trial design submitted in April and data from expanded part 1.For IMbark, the results suggested that the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed supports continuation of the trial without modifications. Janssen is expected to evaluate maturing data from the IMbark study during next year, including an assessment of overall survival.An internal review of the data is expected in the first quarter of 2018. However, the continuation of the study will depend on a protocol-specified primary analysis, which will be done in the third quarter of 2018 or on reaching a pre-specified number of deaths.We expect the company to provide an update on the path forward for imetelstat development at the third quarter conference call.Surprise HistoryGeron’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and meeting the same once. The average positive surprise over the last four quarters is 25.84%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Geron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Geron’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Clovis Oncology, Inc. (CLVS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Nov 1 after market close. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.01% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1911,JNJ,"The third-quarter earnings season is off to a strong start.  The results of the companies that have reported numbers show that earnings and revenue growth pace is accelerating from the first two quarters. In particular, revenue growth has shown significant momentum as evident from the proportion of positive revenue surprises. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index for the third quarter are expected to be up 3% on 4.9% higher revenues.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 companies which account for 24.7% of index’s total market capitalization have reported results. Results reveal that earnings for these companies are up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% increase in revenues. Among these, 71.3% beat earnings estimates while 70.1% beat revenue estimates.Medical Sector PerformanceThe Medical sector has performed relatively well till date and this quarter is not going to be any different as per estimates. Of the 5.4% companies that have reported so far, 66.7% beat on revenues while all the companies surpassed earnings expectations. Going forward, the sector is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 1.9% in earnings in Q3.The bellwether of the sector, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its outlook. Swiss giant Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) too beat on both earnings and sales on the back of new drugs like Cosentyx and Entresto. Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results in the third quarter.Here we have four major biotech giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 26. Let's see how things are shaping up for these:Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) is expected to beat expectations when it reports after the market closes. Per the Zacks model a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Gilead’s track record is pretty mixed, with the company beating estimates in two of the last four and missing in two. Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 17.4%. Overall, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +0.57%. The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Strong HIV performance and other antiviral product sales are being driven by continued uptake of tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) based products — Genvoya, Descovy and Odefsey. We expect the trend to continue in the third quarter as well. Genvoya has already become the most prescribed regimen for both treatment-naïve and switch patients since its launch. This should drive the non-HCV product sales.  The TAF-based regimens now represent 51% of total Gilead HIV prescription volume following the launch of Genvoya and Odefsey and Descovy in 2016. Specifically, Genvoya is now the company’s bestselling HIV product with a treatment-naïve patient share of 41%. The Zacks Consensus estimate for Genvoya stands at $919 million. Strong uptake for Truvada for use in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting is also expected to boost sales.  (Read more: Is Gilead Poised for a Beat This Earnings Season?)Gilead Sciences, Inc.

Moreover, in June, Bristol-Myers announced the availability of subcutaneous administration option for Orencia in patients with moderately to severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

The combination of Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat.We expect the company to beat estimates once again on the back of strong performance of key drug Revlimid.  The drug performed well in the first half and combated the challenges of uneven buying patterns and coverage gap. Continued momentum in core indication, label expansion and global launches should help the product to keep contributing to the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the drug currently stands at $2.1 billion.

(ALXN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. In the last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, Alexion’s track record is excellent as it has consistently beaten expectations in the last four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 11.12%. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 with an ESP of -0.81%. This makes surprise prediction difficult. Alexion’s blockbuster drug, Soliris, continues to perform well.

1912,JNJ,"Anthem Inc.’s (ANTM  -  Free Report) third-quarter 2017 adjusted net income per share of $2.65 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.41 by 10%. The bottom line also jumped 8.2% year over year.Operating revenues of $22.1 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.1%. The top line, however, grew 4.6% year over year due to premium rate increases as well as higher enrollment in the Medicaid, Medicare, and Local Group insured and self-funded businesses.Operational UpdateMedical enrollment increased 0.9% year over year to 40.3 million members. The rise was primarily recorded by commercial & specialty business as well as fully insured and self-funded Local Group businesses. Medicare and Medicaid enrollment also contributed to the appreciation. This upside was partially offset by a decline in membership in the National Account and Individual businesses.Total expenses increased nearly 5.1% to $21.3 billion in the reported quarter, mainly due to a 7% rise in benefitexpenses and 3% increase in selling expenses, both on a year-over-year basis.Anthem’s benefit expense ratio of 87% deteriorated 150 basis points (bps) from the prior-year quarter. This was largely due to the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. However, the impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business and improved medical cost performance in the Individual and Large Group businesses were offsets.The Selling, General & Administrative (SG&A) expense ratio of 13.6% increased 120 bps from the year-ago quarter. This was due to one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017 and the impact of fixed cost leverage on operating revenue growth. However, the rise was partially offset by increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter.Segment UpdateCommercial & Specialty BusinessOperating revenues were $10 billion in the third quarter, up 4.1% year over year.Operating gain totaled $534.6 million, down 16.2% year over year due to increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. The decrease was partially offset by improved medical cost performance in the Local Group and Individual businesses.Operating margin was 5.3%, down 130 bps year over year.Government BusinessOperating revenues were $12 billion in the third quarter, up 5% from the prior-year quarter.Operating gain was $457.5 million, down 4.5% year over year. The downside reflected increased spend to support growth initiatives during the quarter and the impact of the one-year waiver of the health insurance tax in 2017. However, the deterioration was partially offset by the timing impact of a retroactive revenue adjustment in the Medicaid business.Operating margin was 3.8%, declining 40 bps year over year.Other  Operating revenues were $7.3 million in the third quarter, up 21.7% from the prior-year quarter.The segment reported an operating loss of $10.1 million, narrower than an operating loss of $38.5 million in the prior-year quarter.

1913,JNJ,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 31, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.08%.The pharma giant has a mixed record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.39%.Pfizer’s shares have risen 11.7% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 20.3% for the Zacks classified industry. Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) may contribute to the top line meaningfully.However, loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth.Sales of blockbuster drug Enbrel will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The lower sales trend in Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is likely to continue. Sales of Viagra are also likely to be affected by lower demand. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Prevnar and Enbrel is $1.47 billion and $565 million, respectively.At the Q2 call, management said that the penetration of Inflectra, Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, in the United States has been slower than expected as it is experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.In fact, in September, Pfizer filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that J&J wasresorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra. Though J&J did not discuss much about Inflectra’s impact on the branded drug’s sales or the lawsuit at its Q3 call, we expect an update from Pfizer at its upcoming investor call.Meanwhile, the bottom line is likely to be driven by cost savings and share buybacks. However, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are expected to hurt profits.Pfizer’s acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCCTwo leukemia treatments - Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were also approved by the FDA in the third quarter of 2017.Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June.We expect management to record sales from these new cancer drugs this quarter.Earlier this month, Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. An update on the matter is expected at the investor call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (65 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (64 cents per share), is +0.94%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteOther Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Merck & Co., Inc.

1914,JNJ,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the third quarter of 2017. The company’s revenue was driven by continued a strong performance of its newest drug Spinraza, for spinal muscular atrophy.Despite better-than-expected results, Biogen’s shares were down almost 3% in pre-market trading. This was probably due to the fact that the sales of its multiple sclerosis franchise were below expectations amid an increasingly competitive market. However, we note that Biogen’s shares have gained 15.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 9%.Third-quarter 2017 earnings per share were $6.31, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 by 10.7%. Earnings also rallied 22% year over year.Sales came in at $3.08 billion, up 4% from the year-ago period. Sales also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.04 billion by 1.6%. The top line, excluding hemophilia revenues, grew 13% year over year. The company spun off its hemophilia business in February this year.Quarter in Detail                           Biogen’s MS revenues were $2.3 billion in the quarter including approximately $65 million in royalties on the sales of Roche’s MS drug Ocrevus.Tecfidera sales increased 3% from the year-ago period to $1.07 billion. However, the drug recorded a 4% sequential drop in revenues. This included the U.S. sales of $836.3 million and ex-U.S. sales of $233.3 million. In the United States, Tecfidera Inventory levels in the third quarter were relatively flat compared with the year-ago levels, which hurt sales in the reported quarter.Third-quarter Tysabri revenues were $469 million (U.S. $266.8 million, ex-U.S. $202.6 million), which decreased 9% year over year and 5% sequentially. We believe Ocrevus’ launch has put pressure on Tysabri’s U.S. sales in the quarter.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the third quarter were $662 million (U.S. $473.3 million, ex-U.S. $188.7 million), down 7% from the year-ago period. Avonex revenues declined 7% from the year-ago period to $538 million. Plegridy contributed $124 million to third-quarter 2017 revenues, down 3% year over year and 7% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) in August last year, contributed $14 million to revenues in the third quarter, down 11% sequentially.Newly launched Spinraza brought revenues of $271 million (U.S. revenues $197.6 million) in the third quarter, registering growth of 33.5% sequentially as the drug witnesses a strong demand in the United States. The company is working on expanding access to all patients.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $101 million compared with $91 million in second-quarter 2017. The company markets Benepali, a biosimilar referencing Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel in Europe. Benepali recorded revenues of $99.2 million, registering a growth rate of 11.8% sequentially. Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Remicade, which recorded revenues of $2.2 million in the reported quarter compared with $1.9 million in the second quarter.Revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 28% from the year-ago period to $406 million in the third quarter.R&D spend decreased 15.6% in the reported quarter to $446.4 million, while SG&A spend declined 6.2% year over year to $433.8 million. Collaboration AgreementThis month, Biogen announced restructuring of collaboration arrangements with Eisai and Neurimmune to improve long-term value of Alzheimer candidate aducanumab, which is presently in a phase III study.Concurrent with the earnings release, Biogen announced a renegotiation of its agreement with Neurimmune by making a one-time payment of $150 million in exchange of a reduction in Neurimmune’s 15% royalty rate on the potential sales of aducanumab. The re-negotiated deal thus increases aducanumab’s profit potential.On Oct 23, Biogen and partner Eisai refined their existing Alzheimer collaboration. Biogen already has an agreement with Eisai to develop the phase III BACE inhibitor, E2609 and the phase II amyloid-beta antibody, BAN240 for Alzheimer’s disease. However, Biogen has announced that Eisai has exercised the option to jointly develop and commercialize aducanumab. The company will now receive 55% of aducanumab’s potential profits in the United States, 68.5% in Europe and 20% in Japan.Biogen Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Biogen Inc.

1915,JNJ,"Biotech stocks bounced back strongly this year after a poor show last year despite challenges like rising competition, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. Strong clinical results, faster FDA approvals, success of new products and significant contributions from established drugs have led to the rally in the biotech sector.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 24.6% so far this year. This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the index was down 22%.However, despite the strong performance, investors are keen to know whether the rally will continue and what factors will drive the same.These companies are likely to see continued demand for their products, given an accelerated increase in aging population and the proportionate increase in diseases.Moreover, the FDA has approved far more drugs so far in 2017 than it did in the whole of 2016. Hence, a faster drug approval process along with strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support further growth in the sector.Though the momentum in the biotech sector is likely to continue, it’s a good idea to avoid a few stocks that will possibly lose their momentum soon despite significant year-to-date gains.3 Small Biotech Stocks to Avoid Avoiding stocks that have represented significant share price gain could be a bit tricky. However, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks, which may stop rallying in the near term. To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of biotech sector, we have picked stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).Moreover, we have also taken into consideration stocks that witnessed negative estimate revisions for the current year over the last 60 days as these are likely to plunge further and should be dumped.Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report): This New York-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on treating patients suffering from renal disease. The company’s shares have risen 20.1% so far this year. However, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4. Further, over the last 60 days, the loss per share estimates widened by 92.5% for 2017. Though the company’s label expansion efforts for its only marketed drug, Auryxia bode well for growth, supply interruption of Auryxia, may hurt sales in future quarter.Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Price | Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteJuno Therapeutics, Inc. : This Washington-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on the development of immuno-oncology treatments. The company’s shares have gained a significant 132.4% so far this year. Shares of the company mainly rose in September this year on the speculation that it will be acquired soon after the acquisition of Kite Pharma by Gilead. However, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 and has a VGM Score of D. Further, over the last 60 days, its loss per share estimates widened almost 3% for 2017.Although Juno is among the major players in the field of T-cell-based immunotherapy, there are several other companies that are looking to develop and bring immunotherapy treatments to market. The CAR space has many companies including Novartis, Kite Pharma, bluebird bio, Intrexon, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) working on treatments. We note that Juno lags Kite Pharma and Novartis in the race to bring a CAR T product to the market. Hence, competition in the immunotherapy space may weigh heavily on the stock in the near term.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price | Juno Therapeutics, Inc. QuoteAbeona Therapeutics Inc. (ABEO  -  Free Report): This Delaware-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on developing gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases.

The company’s lead gene therapies EB-101 and ABO-201 recently received breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designation, respectively from the FDA. Abeona’s share significantly rose in July 2017 after the company announced that it has received guidance from the FDA to commence pivotal phase III for EB-101. However, many companies are working on bringing gene therapies to the market. Therefore, these candidates may face intense competition in the targeted space, if approved.Abeona Therapeutics Inc.

1917,JNJ,"Markets enjoyed a month of spectacular gains powered by a strong earnings performance and hopes surrounding tax reforms. Significant progress was made on the new tax law during the month, further raising the hopes of investors.Meanwhile, bullish tech earnings were the highlight of the thirdquarter earnings season characterized by notable revenue growth. The ECB cut its bond purchases but extended the duration of its monetary stimulus package.October’s PerformanceLast month, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 4.3%, 2.2% and 3.6%, respectively. While, the Dow and the S&P 500 posted their seventh straight month in gains, this was Nasdaq’s fourth straight monthly gain. All the three benchmarks have posted their biggest monthly rise since February. Moreover, this also happens to be the Dow’s longest streak of such gains since April 2012 and also the longest for the S&P 500 since May 2013.Meanwhile, the House of Representatives passed a $4.1 trillion budget bill for 2018. Moreover, the House of Representatives cleared the budget blueprint with majority of the Republicans voting in favor of the move.Further, the ECB announced plans to extend the quantitative easing program. Also, the release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes clearly hinted at a rate hike in December. President Trump chose not to certify Iran’s compliance with a nuclear deal struck in 2015.Dow Breaches 23,000The Dow gained 40.48 points on Oct 17 and surpassed the 23,000 psychological milestone in midday trading for the first time. This also marked the Dow’s fastest ascent to 1,000-point milestone since mid July. In its history spanning over a century, the Dow has registered the fourth 1,000-point increase within a year for the first time.Economists believe that such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index has partially been due to optimism built around hopes of tax cuts after the new tax code was formulated by President Trump. Gains have also been in part due to a strong corporate earnings and broadly encouraging economic conditions.Bullish Domestic DataEconomic data released during August was largely encouraging in nature. The ISM manufacturing index soared to 60.8% in September, up from 58.8%, marking its highest increase since 2004. ISM Services Index for September came in at 59.8%, marking its highest level since Aug 2005. Construction Spending surged 0.5% in the month of August, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.2% for the period. With this, the index gained 2.5% from last year.PPI for September increased by 0.4% while CPI increased by 0.5%. Retail sales in the United States for the month of September increased 1.6%, marking its highest increase in more than two years.Consumer spending surged 1%, in September, marks its highest level in almost 8 years. Such a rally can be attributed to the fact that the residents of hurricane ravaged Texas and Florida replaced their flood-damaged automobiles.First Estimate for Q3 GDP Looks PromisingThe U.S. economy expanded at a solid 3% seasonally adjusted annual rate in the third quarter of 2017, according to Commerce Department data. Such an expansion came on the heels of 3.1% growth in the second quarter. It also marks the first time of two consecutive quarters of 3% growth or more since mid-2014 for the economy. However, the report did not specify as to how much of an impact hurricanes Harvey and Irma had on the growth of the economy in Q3.Economists commented that the primary factor behind such a growth was an increase consumer spending, backed by broadly encouraging economic conditions and strong government outlays. The main engine of the economy grew at 2.4% over the quarter after a 3.3% gain in the second quarter.Moreover, business investment increased 3.9% while inventories rose 0.7%. Also, the trade sector advanced by 0.4%. The PCE Price Index increased by 0.3%, logging an annual gain of 1.3% which was an improvement from the 0.9% pace recorded in the second quarter.Hurricanes Cause Job Losses, Unemployment SlipsAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. economy lost about 33,000 jobs in the month of September. This marks the first time since 2010 that the economy has lost jobs within a month. Economists stated that two devastating hurricanes Harvey and Irma were the primary reasons behind such job losses.Analysts commented that as many as 1.5 million people were out of jobs — the highest figure in last 20 years. The worst affected sector was the restaurant industry where as many as 105,000 people lost jobs. Meanwhile, the government raised its estimates on job openings in the month of August to 169,000 from 156,000 initially.The unemployment rate decreased to 4.2% in September from 4.4% in August. The consensus estimate for the period showed that the unemployment rate would remain unchanged. Unemployment is now at its lowest level since 2000 and the report by BLS stated that the metric was not affected by the hurricanes.Third-Quarter Earnings Coming to third-quarter earnings, there is clear momentum on the revenue front, with growth notably accelerating from other recent periods. Total revenues for the 272 S&P 500 members that have reported results, as of Friday, Oct 27, are up 6.7% from the same period last year, which compares to 5.5% top-line growth for the same group of companies in the preceding quarter. (Read: All-Around Strength in Q3 Earnings Season)Impressive third-quarter 2017 earnings by tech heavyweights such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Intel Corp. INTC have been the highlight of this earnings season. Shares of IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) soared 9% on Oct 18, after the company posted better-than-expected earnings results. Shares of Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) surged 1.6% on Oct 16, after the company reported strong third-quarter 2017 earnings.Health care stocks were sent higher on Oct 17, by gains for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), shares of which gained 3.4% and 5.5%, respectively, after the two companies posted earnings beat in the latest quarter.Among notable disappointments, JPMorgan (JPM  -  Free Report) declined on Oct 12 after the company’s fixed income trading revenue dipped around 27% to come in at $3.2 billion in the third quarter of this year. Meanwhile, Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) declined after the company’s cost of credit increased 15% due to global consumer banking as well as high credit reserve build. On Oct 24, shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) nosedived 6.3% after missing the third-quarter earnings estimate by a wide margin despite top-line growth.Tax Reforms Make ProgressAround the end of September, President Trump and his aides unveiled tax reforms which effectively lower taxes on businesses and individuals. The proposal seeks to decrease the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%. Moreover, the pass-through business taxes would be slashed to 25%.In its first definitive move toward tax reforms, the House of Representatives passed $4.1 trillion 2018 budget legislation on Oct 5. However, a few members from President Trump’s team voted against the bill along with Democrats, objecting to parts of the tax reform proposal. The Democrats opposed the passage of the Bill, terming the move as ""a vehicle for achieving partisan tax reform.""In a 51-49 vote late on Oct 19, the Senate approved the budget blueprint for fiscal year 2018. Such an outcome “unlocks” a procedure using which the tax code can be changed using only Republican votes. Moreover, the tax Bill can now be used to lower the projected revenue by almost $1.5 trillion over a ten-year period.Ultimately, House of Representative passed the budget blueprint on Oct 27. Reports from Bloomberg surfaced on Oct 30 that legislators from the House who are involved in the formulation of the new tax code were considering a possible ‘phasing-in’ of the corporate tax-rate cut. This would effectively reduce the current rate of corporate tax — at 35% — to 20% by 2022.FOMC MinutesMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), released on Oct 11 confirmed that a rate hike would take place in December, the third instance in 2017. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates reasoned that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% might cause major setbacks for the U.S. economy.After the meeting ended, the Fed chose to leave the interest rates unchanged in the range of 1-1.25% and decided to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The much anticipated unwinding of the humungous balance sheet of the Fed was announced at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee last month. The Fed is slated to begin the gradual unwinding process this month and plans to trim assets by $10 billion each month.However, the Fed panel announced one rate hike before 2017 ends and three further hikes in 2018. Experts therefore speculate that this would come in December when Fed meets for the final time before the year ends.4 Star Performers for OctoberI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or equal to 20%Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

Powering these gains are expectations surrounding tax reforms and strong third quarter earnings results. Some of this momentum is likely to continue during the month of November. Economic data and GDP numbers in particular have also remained strong. Going forward the only likely impediment for markets are sluggish inflation levels and the initial reaction to the next rate hike. Barring a few minor hiccups over these issues, stocks will likely continue their record busting streak during November.  More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1918,JNJ,"We issued an updated report on Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX  -  Free Report) on Sep 15.Catalyst Pharma is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies targeting rare neurological diseases and disorders such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and Tourette syndrome.At present, this Coral Gables, FL-based company has two candidates under development, Firdapse and CPP-115.Catalyst Pharma’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has surged 129.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.9% in the same time frame.The company expects to report top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in the second half of 2017 and resubmit a new drug application (NDA) before the end of 2017. Earlier in 2016, it received a refusal to file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Firdapse.Notably, the agency determined that the company’s NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review. Consequently, Catalyst Pharma was required to conduct additional studies as per the agency’s requirements, in addition to the results of its previously submitted phase III data.In October 2016, it reached an agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analysis approach to be taken in its second phase III study evaluating Firdapse.Meanwhile, the company is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. In February 2016, Catalyst initiated an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG.  In March 2017, the company reported top-line data from the phase II/III trial.The potential approval of Firdapse, along with its label expansion, will help in generating revenues for the company.Additionally, Catalyst Pharma is exploring the possibility of developing CPP-115 (a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and the treatment of other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette’s disorder.However, the market for epilepsy treatments is highly competitive and crowded given the presence of products like Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Neurontin and Lyrica, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Topamax, and Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Trileptal.Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1920,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) kicked off third quarter earnings season for the pharmaceutical sector on a strong note with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. While focus remained on J&J’s strong earnings results, companies like Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) were also in the news regarding patent litigation.   Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesJ&J Q3 Results Impress, Raises Outlook: J&J’s Q3 earnings results were strong with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. All three segments (Consumer, Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals) did well with oncology recording robust growth. Results included contribution from pulmonary hypertension products which became a part of the company’s portfolio following its acquisition of Actelion.

Patients receiving Dupixent weekly reported a significant improvement in the ability to swallow versus placebo (Read more: Sanofi/Regeneron's Dupixent Succeeds in Phase II Study). The market could be huge for Dupixent if it gains timely approval given the lack of any FDA-approved treatments. Dupixent has orphan drug status in the United States for this indication.Dupixent, which has blockbuster potential, is currently approved for eczema and is being evaluated for additional indications apart from eosinophilic esophagitis. In fact, last month, the companies had announced positive top-line data from a late-stage study on Dupixent for uncontrolled persistent asthma.  Regeneron and Sanofi are also collaborating with Aimmune Therapeutics, a clinical-stage company focused on the development of treatments for potentially life-threatening food allergies. Under the clinical collaboration, Aimmune’s AR101 will be evaluated with adjunctive Dupixent in peanut-allergic patients in a mid-stage study that is scheduled to commence next year. The study will be sponsored by Regeneron while Aimmune will provide clinical supply of AR101 and food challenge materials.Data on Merck’s Keytruda, Priority Review for Lynparza sNDA: Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) presented updated overall survival (“OS”) data on its anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, for the first-line treatment of patients suffering from metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with high levels of PD-L1. The company said that the additional six months of available data continued to show a reduction in the risk of death by 37% for Keytruda compared to chemotherapy. Keytruda more than doubled median OS compared to chemotherapy after two years of follow up.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017.Merck and partner AstraZeneca also announced that they have been granted priority review by the FDA for their supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the use of PARP inhibitor Lynparza tablets in patients with gBRCA, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (“MBC”) who have been previously treated with chemotherapy either in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant or metastatic settings. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018.Novo Nordisk Diabetes Drug Gets FDA Panel Support: Novo Nordisk (NVO  -  Free Report) got a boost with an FDA advisory panel (the Endocrinologic and Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee) voting unanimously (16-0) in favor of approving once-weekly semaglutide for use in type II diabetes patients. Given the favorable vote, chances of gaining FDA approval look pretty high. On its second quarter call, Novo Nordisk had said that it expects a decision from the FDA by year end. Semaglutide’s approval would be a major positive for the company with the drug expected to be a key growth driver.Novo Nordisk is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Priority Review for BMY Drug Label Expansion: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) immuno-oncology therapy, Opdivo, has been granted priority review by the FDA for label expansion into the treatment of melanoma patients who are at high risk of disease recurrence following complete surgical resection. Opdivo, one of the prioritized brands in Bristol-Myers’ portfolio, brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017 (Read more: Bristol-Myers Gets Priority Review for Opdivo Label Expansion).Adverse Ruling for Allergan in Restasis Patent Litigation: Allergan continues to make headlines related to its blockbuster eye drug, Restasis. This time round, the company announced that it has received an adverse ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas regarding four patents covering the drug. The court found the patents to be invalid. Allergan intends to appeal the ruling and said that the FDA is yet to approve any generic version of the drug. However, ophthalmology-focused company, Imprimis Pharmaceuticals, announced that it is working on making lower-cost alternatives to Restasis available. The company said that initial prescriptions will be 99 cents for a one month supply while refills will start at $79 per month, including shipping.According to Allergan, the Restasis patents are scheduled to expire on Aug 27, 2024. Allergan, which entered into a settlement agreement with a generic challenger recently (InnoPharma), has been adopting different ways to protect Restasis from generic competition. The company came under fire for entering into an agreement with the Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, with lawmakers questioning the unconventional move adopted by the company to protect the drug from generic competition. Restasis is Allergan’s second best-selling drug bringing in sales of almost $1.5 billion in 2016. Lawmakers pointed out that the sovereign status of Native American tribes would make any patent challenges lengthy and complex as tribes may be immune from the legal claims made by generic drug makers to challenge patents. The deal has basically raised concerns that it will curb generic competition in the pharmaceutical industry and discourage generic drugmakers from making cheaper copy-cat versions of expensive drugs.Impax to Combine with Amneal: Specialty pharma company Impax Laboratories  will be merging with privately-held generic company Amneal Pharmaceuticals in an all-stock transaction. With this merger, the combined company will have high-value generic product pipelines and a growing specialty business. The deal is expected to boost Impax’s stand-alone earnings per share in the first 12 months and generate double-digit revenue and earnings per share growth over the three years following the close of the transaction. Annual cost synergies of about $200 million are expected to be achieved within three years. The merger is expected to go through in the first half of 2018 (Read more: Impax Laboratories and Amneal Pharmaceuticals Agree to Merge).PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index was up 1% this week with the sector reacting positively to J&J’s Q3 results.

1921,JNJ,"The healthcare sector has been in the spotlight lately. President Donald Trump targeted drug companies and accused them of charging extremely high prices (read: ETFs in Focus as IMF ups Global Growth Forecast).Market Movers""Prescription drug prices are out of control. The drug prices have gone through the roof,"" Trump said in a meeting, adding, ""The drug companies frankly are getting away with murder. We want to bring our prices down to what other countries are paying.""In a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses.The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. However, changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first.“The solution will be for about a year or two years; it’ll get us over this intermediate hump” Trump said. Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the healthcare sector.Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $17.6 billion and charges a moderate fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 62 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 50% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings (read: Should You Keep Your Portfolio Healthy with Biotech ETFs?).From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Health Care Providers & Services, with 33.6%, 21.9% and 19.1% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) and Unitedhealth (UNH  -  Free Report) with 11.1%, 6.8% and 6.1% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).  The fund has returned 17.9% in a year and 19.0% year to date (as of Oct 16, 2017). XLV currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Healthcare ETF (VHT  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Health Care 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $7.2 billion and charges a moderate fee of 10 basis points a year. It has 360 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 45% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Pharmaceuticals, Biotech and Health Care Equipment, with 30.5%, 24.6% and 17.9% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Unitedhealth with 9.6%, 5.9% and 5.2% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017).  The fund has returned 19.6% in a year and 20.6% year to date (as of Oct 16, 2017). VHT currently has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineXLV is more popular than VHT, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VHT may be more appealing to investors, owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  VHT also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.Moreover, VHT outperformed XLV both on a year to date basis and in a year. VHT returned 1.6% more than XLV so far this year whereas in a year, it returned 1.7% more than XLV.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

Earlier this year in June, JNJ in its biggest ever acquisition  bought Swiss biopharmaceutical company Actelion for $30 billion.Johnson & Johnson reported non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) of $1.9 for third-quarter 2017, up 13.1% year over year and 3.8% on a sequential basis. It beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.8.Segment Sales and OutlookThe company reported increase in sales by geographical segments. U.S. sales increased 9.7% to $10.3 billion from $9.4 billion, while International sales increased 10.9% to $ 9.4 billion from $8.4 billion.Moreover, on a business-segment basis, the company reported improvements in all the three segments. Consumer, Pharmaceutical and Medical devices revenues increased 2.9%, 15.4% and 7.1% respectively.The company increased its revenue guidance for full-year 2017 to the range of $76.1-$76.5 billion and updated its adjusted EPS guidance to $7.25-$7.30.Industry FactorsIn a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses. Moreover, Trump took a dig at drug pricing and accused companies of getting away with murder by charging sky high drug prices.The uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. However, changes in the deal might be in the cards as it has to be passed by the Congress and signed by Trump first.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have a relatively high exposure to Johnson and Johnson (see all Health Care ETFs here).Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to healthcare stocks and tracks the Health Care Select Sector Index.

1923,JNJ,"GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) and partner Innoviva, Inc.  announced that their triple combination therapy was granted marketing authorization in the EU as maintenance therapy for the treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).The once-daily single inhaler triple therapy will be marketed by the trade name of Trelegy Ellipta. It is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe COPD in patients who are already being treated with a combination of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA) but require additional bronchodilation.Trelegy Ellipta was approved in the United States in September this year. The EU approval was expected. This is because the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had granted a positive opinion recommending marketing approval of Trelegy Ellipta in September.Trelegy Ellipta, a combination of fluticasone furoate – an ICS, umeclidinium –   a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and vilanterol – a LABA therapy, will provide patients with a convenient dosing option by removing the need for multiple inhalers. The product is expected to bring in blockbuster sales. Trelegy Ellipta will be delivered in Glaxo’s Ellipta dry powder inhaler.Glaxo’s shares have declined 8.6% this year so far, underperforming the 14.7% increase witnessed by the industry.Please note that shares of Theravance Biopharma, Inc. (TBPH  -  Free Report) were up more than 6% on Thursday as the biotech has an economic interest on the royalties that Glaxo will pay to Innoviva on global sales of Trelegy Ellipta.Glaxo has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the large-cap pharma sector is Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1924,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 10% year over year driven by slightly higher sales and lower costs and share count.The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $13.17 billion, which were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenues rose 1% from the year-ago quarter on a reported as well as operational basis.Sales in DetailCurrency movement hurt Pfizer’s third-quarter revenues slightly ($54 million) while the divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business hurt sales by 2% in the quarter. In February 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS)business to ICU Medical, Inc. (ICUI  -  Free Report). Excluding currency headwinds and HIS revenues, sales rose 4%.Strong performance of newer products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) offset lower sales of Enbrel, Viagra and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products.International revenues rose 2% (up 3% an operational basis) to $6.63 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.53 billion.Segment DiscussionPfizer’s reporting segments are Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 11% on a reported and operational basis from the year-ago period to $8.12 billion. Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the United States.While Ibrance revenues rose 60% to $878 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 48% to $348 million. Lyrica sales rose 10% to $1.15 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 43% to $644 million.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug, Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the September 2016 Medivation acquisition, also contributed to U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $150 million in the quarter compared with $141 million in the second quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in the United States and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 13% to $613 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis (RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the United States and Canada. Total Viagra (IH+EH) sales declined 20% to $308 million. Lower demand and wholesaler destocking ahead of the potential generic competition in December hurt sales of Viagra.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 1% to $1.52 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 4% in the United States due to continued decline in revenues for the eligible adult patient population. However, Prevenar 13 revenues rose 5% in international markets due to favorable timing of government purchases in some emerging markets.Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 4% to $829 million. Global Oncology revenues surged 46% to $1.62 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues rose 1% to $1.65 billion. Internal Medicine rose 9% to $2.46 billion. The Inflammation & Immunology franchise rose 4% to $1 billion. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 3% to $569 million.Earlier this month, Pfizer said that it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision is expected next year.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 12% (down 11% operationally) to $5.05 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products primarily Pristiq in the United States and Vfend and Lyrica in Europe, lower revenues from legacy Hospira products due to product shortages and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars and emerging markets did well in the quarter.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck’s blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $34 million in the United States and $112 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $28 million (down 16%) from outside the U.S. markets. Emerging markets revenues grew 7% operationally.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses declined 1% (operationally) in the quarter to $3.48 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses also declined 1% to $1.85 billion.2017 Guidance UpdatedWhile Pfizer raised its adjusted earnings guidance, it tightened the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52.4 billion to $53.1 billion compared with $52 billion to $54 billion expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $52.65 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.58 - $2.62 compared with $2.54 - $2.60 expected previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.56 per share.At the mid-point, adjusted EPS is expected to increase 8% (previously 7%).Research and development expenses are expected in the range of $7.5–$7.8 billion (previously $7.5–$8.0 billion), while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $14.0–$14.5 billion (previously $13.7–$14.7 billion).Our TakePfizer’s third-quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but delivered in-line sales. However, the company raised its adjusted earnings guidance for the year. Shares were down 0.5% in pre-market trading. So far this year, Pfizer’s shares are up 8.2%, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 14.6% for the industry. Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition, which are hurting the top line. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance.Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects a “multiyear wave of potential new product launches and product line extensions.” Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in March this year and for advanced bladder cancer in May. Bavencio was also approved in EU and Japan in September for MCC.Two other leukemia treatments — Besponsa/inotuzumab ozogamicin for relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and Mylotarg for newly diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) — were also approvedby the FDA in the third quarter. Besponsa was also approved in the EU in June.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Pfizer, Inc.

1925,JNJ,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B and MK-3682C — as the market is becoming extremely crowded.MK-3682B was an all-oral, triple combination regimen (3682/uprifosbuvir, in combination with grazoprevir and ruzasvir1) developed for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. MK-3682C was a combination of ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir.Merck’s shares have risen 9.2% this year so far compared with a 16.4% increase for the industry.The company will now focus on growing sales of its key HCV drug in the market, Zeptier, which is approved for use with ribavirin to treat chronic HCV genotype 1 or 4 infection. Zepatier, a once-daily, fixed-dose combination tablet containing the NS5A inhibitor elbasvir and the NS3/4A protease inhibitor grazoprevir, is gradually becoming a key top-line driver for Merck along with cancer drug Keytruda.The medicine recorded sales of $517 million in the second quarter of 2017, much higher than $378 million in the first quarter, attributable to strong underlying demand trends in the United States, Europe and Japan as the company continues to launch Zepatier globally. However, we remind investors that at the second quarter conference call, management had warned that Zepatier uptake, going forward, may be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.The HCV market is getting crowded and is thus seeing increased pricing pressure. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.Moreover, other companies are also looking to bring new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to market.AbbVie’s pan-genotypic shorter-duration HCV regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), Mavyret, received approval in the United States., Canada and the EU in July/August. Meanwhile, Gilead already markets Epclusa, an all-oral, pan-genotypic, single tablet HCV regimen since 2016. Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Merck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1926,JNJ,"U.S. equity markets are going through turbulent times. There is a lot of volatility and uncertainty owing to rising geopolitical risks and political uncertainty. This has increased the appeal of dividend investing.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. North Korea conducted its seventh nuclear test, an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile that flew over Japan, on Sep 14, 2017. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created huge unrest in a number of Asian economies and the United States.In response to continuous missile tests, President Donald Trump in his maiden UN General Assembly speech threatened to completely destroy North Korea. This prompted North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un to warn the United States of the ""highest level of hard-line countermeasure in history”.Moreover, North Korea’s foreign minister stated that Trump’s comments indicate that the United States has declared war against North Korea. ""Since the U.S. declared war on our country, we will have every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down the U.S. bombers even when they are not yet inside the airspace border of our country,"" foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said. However, the White House has rejected the accusations.This latest development made investors flock to safe haven investments and led to a decline in tech stocks (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain Amid Latest North Korea Threats).Trump’s ActionsThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, there are renewed doubts over the capabilities of the Trump administration.Trump introduced a new travel ban with restrictions on citizens from eight nations, six of which are Muslim majority. Starting Oct 18, citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Somalia, and North Korea will be banned from traveling to the United States. However, people holding permanent residency or visas are exempted from the ban, but cannot renew their visas once they expire.Moreover, the Trump administration is being highly criticized. In a separate development, six advisers to Trump have been found to be using personal email addresses for official government purposes. This is ironical given Trump’s stance on the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal server prior to the 2016 Presidential elections (read: Trump Widens North Korea Sanctions: ETFs in Focus).In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.FlexShares Quality Dividend Index Fund (QDF  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies providing high dividends while maintaining a quality factor and utilizing constraints to minimize risk.It has AUM of $1.8 billion and charges a fee of 37 basis points a year.

1927,JNJ,"Benchmarks finished higher on Tuesday after a slew of strong corporate earnings led gains for healthcare stocks. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 closed at record levels, with the blue-chip index touching the psychological 23,000 milestone for the first time in its 120-year history. Meanwhile, industrial production for September rebounded after two straight months in the lull.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,997.44, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.1% to close at 2,559.36. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,624, decreasing a little below half a point. A total of 5.5 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 5.9 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 1.37-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by 1.72-to-1 ratio. The CBOE VIX increased 4.1% to close at 10.32.Dow Breaches 23,000The Dow gained 40.48 points on Tuesday and surpassed the 23,000 psychological milestone in midday trading for the first time. The blue-chip index also hit a fresh intraday record of 23,302.20. This also marked the Dow’s fastest ascent to 1,000-point milestone since the mid of July. In its history spanning over a century, the blue-chip index has registered the fourth 1,000-point increase within a year for the first time — the largest so far.Economists believe that such a stellar showing by the blue-chip index has partially been due to optimism built around hopes of tax cuts after the new tax code was formulated by President Trump. Gains have also been in part due to a strong corporate earnings and broadly encouraging economic conditions.Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) have contributed the most toward Dow’s significant 1,000-point ascent since Aug 2 — when blue–chip index surpassed the 22,000 mark for the first time, adding 142 and 121 points, respectively. For the year, the two stocks have rallied 65.9% and 41.2%, respectively, so far. The most recent exuberance of the Dow, however, was supported by shares of Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) and Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), which added 87 points and 97 points, respectively. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Strong Earnings Catapults Markets HigherA slew of strong quarterly earnings set the tone for gains for broader markets. Investors are also observing whether such high stock valuations actually support earnings. Strong earnings from bank and healthcare stocks also contributed significantly toward gains. The S&P 500 advanced 1.72 points to close at a record high. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven ended in the positive territory with healthcare stocks leading the gainers. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) gained 1.3% on Tuesday.Health care stocks were sent higher by gains for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), shares of which gained 3.4% and 5.5%, respectively, after the two companies posted earnings beat in the latest quarter.Johnson & Johnson reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. The drug and consumer products giant raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook, which sent its shares up 1.5% in pre-market trading.In fact, this year so far, J&J’s share price is up 18.1%. This is almost in line with the 18.2% increase witnessed by the industry. (Read More)Meanwhile, UnitedHealth Group Inc. reported third-quarter net operating earnings per share of $2.66, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.57 and increasing 22.6% year over year. Higher revenues, strength in both its segments, UnitedHealthcare and Optum, and membership growth led to the outperformance.UnitedHealth has a tradition of guiding conservatively and then beating its own estimates to surprise investors. The company surpassed expectations in 25 out of 28 reported quarters and the quarter under review was no exception. (Read More)Economic DataIndustrial production for the month of September surged 0.3%, surpassing the consensus estimate of an increase of 0.1%. The figure rebounded in September after suffering two consecutive declines earlier. Industrial production was pushed higher by increase in outputs of construction and utilities sectors. Output from the chemical industry was hampered by hurricanes Harvey and Irma, which stunted production in Texas and Florida. This led chemicals lower by 0.3%. Overall, manufacturing production gained 0.1% in September. Meanwhile, capacity utilization increased to 76% from 75.8% in August. Stocks That Made HeadlinesCanadian Pacific's Q3 Earnings In Line, Revenues MissCanadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) reported in-line earnings and lower-than-expected revenues in third-quarter 2017.

(MRK  -  Free Report), declined 7.6% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 1.3% and international sales declining 6.9% due to biosimilar competition. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court recently. In the lawsuit, Pfizer alleged J&J of resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra — Pfizer’s biosimilar version of Remicade — that was launched in the United States in November last year.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter including label expansions in the United States for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) drug, Tracleer for pediatric use and Imbruvica for chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) – the drug’s first indication outside of cancer. J&J markets Imbruvica in partnership with AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report).At the call, the company also mentioned that it will not file global regulatory applications for rheumatoid arthritis candidate, sirukumab. We remind investors that last month, J&J received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA for sirukumab for want of additional safety data.  Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.6 billion, up 7.1% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 6.6% and positive currency movement of 0.5%. Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition, which added 5.2% to operational sales growth. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.2%.Domestic market sales rose 4.6% year over year to $3.19 billion. International market sales increased 9.6% (operational increase of 8.6%) year over year to $3.41 billion.Operational growth was driven by wound closure products in the General Surgery business, electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.36 billion in the reported quarter, up 2.9% year over year(operational increase of 1.6%). Foreign currency movement positively impacted sales in the segment by 1.3%. Sales in the domestic market declined 0.5% from the year-ago period to $1.29 billion.Slower growth in baby care products due to competitive pressure was partially offset by growth in beauty and over-the-counter products and international smoking cessation aids.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded an increase of 5.1% to $2.07 billion, reflecting an operational increase of 3% and a positive currency impact of 2.1%.2017 Guidance RaisedJ&J raised its adjusted earnings and sales outlook for the year.J&J expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.25 - $7.30 compared with $7.12 - $7.22 expected previously.The revenue guidance was raised to a range of $76.1 billion to $76.5 billion compared with $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion expected previouslyOur TakeAs indicated last quarter, J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. The Actelion acquisition added an impressive 7.9% to operational sales growth in the quarter.Though quite a few key products in J&J’s portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition, we believe that new products in all segments, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion could lead to better sales trends, going forward.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1929,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) and its Japanese partner Astellas announced that their prostate cancer drug Xtandi met the primary endpoint in a late-stage study, which can expand the label of the drug to include early-stage patients.Top-line data from the phase III PROSPER study showed that treatment with Xtandi plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) led to a statistically significant improvement in metastasis-free survival (MFS) – the primary endpoint - in men with castration-resistant non-metastatic prostate cancer (CRPC) compared to ADT alone.Many prostate cancer patients with non-metastatic CRPC – an earlier stage of prostate cancer – can experience disease progression despite ADT. However, presently no FDA approved treatment options are available to cater to this condition until these patients develop metastatic disease.Xtandi is presently approved for the treatment of metastatic CRPC in patients who have previously received docetaxel. If approved for the non-metastatic patient population, the label of Xtandi can be expanded to cover all patients with CRPC.Shares of Pfizer were up almost 2% in response to the positive news. However, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 10% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16% for the industry.Pfizer plans to discuss the PROSPER study data with the FDA and other regulatory authorities and also present detailed data at a future medical meeting.Xtandi was added to Pfizer’s portfolio with the acquisition of Medivation in September. While Pfizer sells Xtandi in the United States in partnership with Astellas, the latter owns the marketing right outside U.S. markets. Pfizer recorded Xtandi alliance revenues of $141 million in the second quarter and $131 million in the first.In December 2016, Pfizer and Astellas had announced that a phase IV study — PLATO — evaluating the efficacy and safety of continued treatment with Xtandi did not meet the primary endpoint. The PLATO study evaluated Xtandi plus Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Zytiga and prednisone compared to Zytiga and prednisone alone.Xtandi is a key drug in Prizer’s oncology portfolio/pipeline. The New York-based pharma giant is aggressively working on expanding the labels of its marketed cancer drugs like Xtandi, Ibrance and Xalkori.Xtandi is in several studies including late-stage studies in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. It is also in mid-stage development for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1930,JNJ,"Amgen (AMGN  -  Free Report) and partner Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA approved their biosimilar version of Roche’s (RHHBY  -  Free Report) cancer drug, Avastin (bevacizumab), for treatment of five types of cancers including lung cancer, colorectal cancer, glioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma and cervix cancer. The biosimilar will be marketed by the trade name Mvasi.Mvasi is the first cancer biosimilar approved in the United States. It is also the first bevacizumab biosimilar in the country. Notably, Amgen has also submitted regulatory applications for the same in the EU.We remind investors that in July, the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee had unanimously voted to recommend approval of Mvasi.Amgen’s shares have outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has plunged 29.6% versus the broader industry’s 15.4% rally.The approval was supported by a comprehensive data package that demonstrated similarity of Mvasi with bevacizumab. Data also included results from a phase III comparative efficacy, safety and immunogenicity study, confirming no clinically meaningful difference between Mvasi and the reference product.Amgen and Allergan are also developing biosimilar versions of Roche’s Herceptin (ABP 980 — under review in the United States and the EU) and Rituxan (ABP 798 in phase III).Amgen’s biosimilar version of AbbVie’s Humira Amjevita, was approved by the FDA in September last year. However, Amjevita has not been launched yet due to an ongoing litigation. Others under development include Amgen’s biosimilar versions of Alexion’s Soliris, Lilly’s Erbitux and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report)/Merck’s Remicade. Interestingly, biosimilar endeavors offer a lucrative opportunity of annual revenues worth $3 billion above for Amgen. The company has also collaborated with Japan’s Daiichi Sankyo for commercialization of nine biosimilars in Japan.With accelerating approvals of biosimilars, a number of pharmaceutical and biotech companies are working on to bringing biosimilars in the market.  Though many biosimilars are marketed in the EU, very few are available in the United States. Last November, Pfizer had launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Remicade. Sandoz also markets Zarxio, the first biosimilar to be approved in the United States. The product is in turn a biosimilar of Amgen’s Neupogen. In July 2016, Merck had launched Reneflexis, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the United States.In August last year, Sandoz had gained an FDA approval for Erelzi, a biosimilar version of Amgen’s Enbrel. However, the product is on hold due to ongoing litigation and is yet to be unveiled in the United States.Amgen Inc. PriceAmgen Inc. Price | Amgen Inc.

1931,JNJ,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump had stressed on tax reforms and promised that bringing down corporate tax would be his top priority as the President of the United States. Keeping his words, Trump proposed changes in tax rates for both individuals and corporates to stimulate economic growth as well as employment growth.Tax ReformsThe plan proposes to lower the current corporate tax rate of 35%, one of the highest in the world, to 15%. This is expected to favorably impact the post-tax earnings of companies. A territorial tax system (tax on only domestic income) has also been proposed for American companies so as to create a level playing field. It also suggests the elimination of special tax breaks for companies. Another major reform proposed is the repatriation of trillions of dollars held as cash reserve overseas by the companies with global operations for one-time tax (reportedly 10%). A similar tax move was made for bringing in overseas cash reserves by the Bush administration in 2004 for one-time tax of 5.25%. A number of companies repatriated an amount exceeding $300 billion.The current tax code allows tax repatriation at 35% rate. However, it gives tax credit for the amount of tax paid in overseas country.Anticipated ImpactThe reforms have been proposed to create new jobs and aid economic growth through expanded investment as more cash will available to companies through tax cuts and repatriation. However, the extent to which these steps will be successful is uncertain. A large portion of the repatriated cash in 2004 was used to fund share buybacks and dividend payments. Though the buybacks fueled a stock rally, there was no actual economic growth.The tax reforms are expected to benefit companies which have operations around the globe. A similar buyback this time is also expected to help the stocks grow.  Large cap pharma companies based in the United Sates with major operations worldwide including J&J, Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report), Gilead Sciences and others are sitting on huge pile of cash reserves stashed in overseas countries. The repatriation will benefit these large drug/biotech companies more than the tax savings due to rate cutsMoreover, repatriation of cash held overseas will create a surplus in domestic cash reserve, which may fuel merger & acquisition (M&A) in the sector. The industry has seen only two major acquisitions this year, Actelion by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Kite Pharma, Inc.  by Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report), which is expected to close by 2017 end.Let’s discuss the impact of tax reform on the some drug/biotech giants.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson is a well-known brand all over the world catering to a wide variety of medical needs. The company has paid tax at an effective rate of 16.5%, 19.7% and 20.6% for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Therefore, a revision of tax rate to 15% will not bring a huge positive change in post-tax earnings. As of June end, J&J had $12.9 billion in cash reserve, down almost 70% from 2016 year end. The company has used a major chunk of its cash reserves in 2017. Hence, J&J is expected to be least impacted by these reforms.AmgenThe company has a strong presence in the oncology/hematology, cardiovascular disease, inflammation, bone health and nephrology markets. The effective tax rate for Amgen in 2016, 2015 and 2014 were 15.7%, 13% and 7.6%, respectively. Hence, a tax rate cut will have minimal effect. Amgen had nearly $35 billion in overseas cash as of 2016 fiscal end, per a Bloomberg report. The total cash reserve of the company has changed minimally in the first six months of 2017. So, the repatriation reform may initiate a buyback. Moreover, after 10% tax, it will have more than $30 billion in domestic cash reserve, if the total overseas cash is repatriated. This increase in domestic cash can also be used in acquiring new drug technologies like CAR-T therapy.Gilead SciencesGilead recently announced its plan to acquire Kite Pharma for nearly $12 billion, adding the latter’s CAR-T therapy candidate to its pipeline. Gilead is planning to complete the acquisition through a combination of cash and debt. Per a Bloomberg report, Gilead had $29.3 billion of cash reserves in overseas countries at the end of 2016. A repatriation will help the company to pay off the debt quickly. The effective tax rate has been between 16% and 21%, which suggests a minimal impact due to tax rate cut.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1932,JNJ,"On Sep 26, we issued an updated research report on Impax Laboratories, Inc. . Impaxis a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of obesity treatments and is based in Hayward, CA.Impax’s anaphylaxis treatment, epinephrine auto-injector has shown notable growth in sales along with its opioid analgesic, oxymorphone ER, boosting its growth prospects. We note that Impax had acquired certain generic products from Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. (TEVA  -  Free Report) last year. Meanwhile, the launch of generic version of Merck & Co., Inc’s (MRK  -  Free Report) cardiovascular drug, Vytorin, in April 2017 is expected to further boost Impax’s revenues. The drug registered sales of $423 million in the first six months of 2017. The approval of the generic version of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Concerta in July should also help in sales growth.At the end of June 2017, the company had 19 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDA) pending FDA approval. With these ANDAs and its generics pipeline, Impax will likely be able to take advantage of the upcoming patent expirations in the pharma industry.In May 2017, in its effort to save costs Impax initiated several processes to improve efficiencies and margins, and focus on growth opportunities. The company has started consolidating and stopping its manufacturing and packing facilities. The company is also modifying its generic portfolio so as to eliminate low-value products and streamline operations.The company expects the above actions to save annualized costs to the tune of $130 million by the end of 2019.However, the generics industry is facing pricing pressure since 2016 which has negatively impacted the revenues of the companies marketing generic drugs. Impax has lowered earnings guidance for 2017 than 2016 in anticipation of dampened revenues.4 Stocks to Watch after the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1933,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has denied approval to its investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, sirukumab, an IL-6 inhibitor, for want of additional safety data.The FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for J&J’s Biologics License Application (BLA) for sirukumab which was filed in September last year.The company is looking to get sirukumab approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Regulatory applications are under review in EU and Japan as well. The proposed trade name for sirukumab is Plivensia.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 13.8%, comparing unfavorably with a gain of 17% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The CRL was somewhat expected as last month, FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee had not recommended approval of sirukumab, raising some safety concerns. The panel was concerned with the increased mortality rates for both the evaluated doses of (50 mg and 100 mg) of sirukumab.The FDA in its CRL has asked for additional clinical data to further evaluate the safety of the candidate. J&J plans to meet with the FDA for a follow-up discussion. The CRL is expected to delay the drug’s approval, which was previously expected to happen this year.In July this year, J&J’s partner for sirukumab, U.K. based drug giant GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report), informed the termination of its collaboration with J&J.We remind investors that Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and partner Incyte Corporation (INCY  -  Free Report) had also received a CRL for their experimental JAK inhibitor, baricitinib to treat RA as the FDA demanded additional data.However, in August, the companies informed that they will re-submit the NDA for baricitinib much faster than previously expected as they will not be required to conduct an additional study. The NDA is expected to be re-submitted in January next year.RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the United States.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1934,JNJ,"Key highlights in the pharma sector include a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (“RA”) treatment and FDA approval for Merck’s (MRK  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s (BMY  -  Free Report) cancer drugs.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesCRL for J&J RA Drug: J&J’s Janssen Biotech got a CRL from the FDA for sirukumab for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA. The agency has asked for additional data on the safety of sirukumab. This does not come as a surprise considering the investigational treatment failed to get the support of an FDA advisory panel last month. Given the safety concerns raised by the panel, the request for additional data was more or less expected. J&J intends to meet with the agency to determine the requirements for gaining approval for the IL-6 inhibitor.Meanwhile, the company has submitted a new drug application (“NDA”) for the first darunavir-based single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV. Approval would make this combination the only complete regimen with the potential to deliver the advantages of a single table regimen with the high genetic barrier to resistance of darunavir and the demonstrated safety profile of TAF.Another FDA Nod for Merck’s Keytruda: Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, Keytruda, has gained FDA approval for yet another indication. The cancer therapy, which is already available for a wide range of indications, can now be used in previously-treated patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1. This marks the tenth new indication for Keytruda over a three-year period.Keytruda is a key product in Merck’s portfolio with the drug bringing in sales of $1.5 billion in the first half of 2017. The company is working on expanding the label of the drug which is currently in more than 550 studies covering a wide range of cancers and treatment settings (Read more: Merck's Keytruda Gets FDA Nod for Advanced Gastric Cancer).Merck is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

Allergan also reaffirmed its commitment to increase its cash dividend every year while reiterating its commitment to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and paying down $3.75 billion of debt in 2018.The company also announced the departure of Tessa Hilado, executive vice president and chief financial officer (""CFO""), who will be retiring from the company once a successor is appointed.Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo Gets Another Approval: Bristol-Myers also gained approval for another indication for its immune-oncology therapy, Opdivo. With the latest approval, Opdivo can now be used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma patients previously treated with Nexavar (sorafenib). This makes Opdivo the first and only immuno-oncology agent to be approved for this patient population (Read more: Bristol-Myers Opdivo Gets Approval for Liver Cancer).The company also gained approval in Japan for the use of Opdivo for the treatment of unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer which has progressed after chemotherapy. Gastric cancer is highly prevalent in Asian countries and is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in Japan.Bristol-Myers also entered into a clinical trial collaboration with AbbVie under which a combination of Opdivo and AbbVie’s investigational antibody drug conjugate ABBV-399 will be evaluated in c-met overexpressing non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Bristol-Myers stock has gained 8.1% year to date, compared to the 17.1% rally of the industry it belongs to.Priority Review for Aradigm Drug: Aradigm got priority review for Linhaliq for the treatment of non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (NCFBE) patients with chronic infections with pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa). A response from the agency regarding the approval status of the drug should be out by Jan 26, 2018. NCFBE, a severe, chronic and rare disease, affects more than 150,000 people in the United States and over 200,000 people in Europe.

1935,JNJ,"Allergan plc (AGN  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has issued a refusal-to-file (RTF) letter to its supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for Vraylar (cariprazine). The company is looking to get Vraylar’s label expanded to include new data, which supports the drug’s use as a maintenance treatment.Vraylar is presently approved in Europe for treatment of schizophrenia.Allergan’s share price is down 2.5% this year so far, comparing favorably with the industry’s decrease of 22.3%.The FDA said that the sNDA was not sufficiently complete to allow a substantive review. The company plans to meet the FDA officials to understand what additional information will be required.We remind investors that earlier in March, the FDA had accepted the company’s sNDA for Vraylar. The sNDA was based on data from a phase III study, evaluating Vraylar for maintenance of efficacy in adults with schizophrenia. Data from the study showed that Vraylar has significantly delayed the time to relapse compared with placebo. Also, relapse occurred in nearly twice as many placebo patients (47.5%) in comparison to those treated with Vraylar.Vraylar has performed above expectations in 2016, recording sales of $94.3 million in the year. The drug is likely to be a key driver of Allergan’s top-line growth in 2017.Other players in the bipolar disorder and schizophrenia treatment market include AstraZeneca plc’s (AZN  -  Free Report) Seroquel XR, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Risperdal Consta and Alkermes plc’s (ALKS  -  Free Report) Aristada.In a separate press release, Allergan announced new data from the CENTAUR phase IIb study, evaluating its pipeline candidate cenicriviroc (CVC) for treating liver fibrosis in adult patients with NASH.These phase IIb data supports continued development of cenicriviroc (CVC) in the ongoing phase III AURORA study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the candidate for liver fibrosis in adult patients with NASH.The CENTAUR study demonstrated no significant difference in fibrosis improvement being observed between CVC and placebo in the second year for patients administered with CVC for a couple of years. Some patients switched over to CVC in year two after remaining on placebo for a year. 20% of such patients receiving CVC achieved the combined endpoint of reduction in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH. This find lies in straight comparison to 13% of those remaining on placebo.Allergan PLC. Price Allergan PLC. Price | Allergan PLC. QuoteZacks RankAllergan currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1936,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) said it is exploring strategic alternatives for its Consumer Healthcare segment including a partial or a full separation through a spin-off, sale or other transaction. A decision regarding the same is expected to be made next year and it may ultimately opt to retain the business.Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 12.1% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 18% for the industry.The Consumer Healthcare segment includes several over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare medicines, vitamins, and personal care products, which can be sold without prescriptions. Important products among these are Advil pain relief tablets and Centrum multivitamins, which are two of the top-selling consumer healthcare brands globally. The segment recorded sales of almost 1.7 billion in the first half of 2017, representing growth of 2% year over year.Chief executive officer (CEO) Ian Reed said that the consumer unit is not core to its prescription drug business and its potential value will be “more fully realized outside the company”. Regarding its core pharmaceuticals business, in August, Pfizer said that it expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential. These include line-extensions for Xtandi, Ibrance & Xeljanz/XR. Half of these potential blockbusters are expected to receive approval by 2020.The funds from the potential spin-off of the non-pharmaceutical Consumer Healthcare business may make it easier for the company to achieve this goal.It is being apprehended that consumer health biggies like Nestle, Reckitt Benckiser, Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) may be interested in buying the unit that Pfizer may put on sale.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1937,JNJ,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) announced long-lasting skin clearance rates of Cosentyx in plaque psoriasis patients from a phase III study, which evaluated the drug for five years. Cosentyx is the first and only fully human IL-17A inhibitor to achieve sustained skin clearance rates over five years, reinforcing its long-term favorable impact.Data from the study showed that Cosentyx maintained 100% Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 and PASI 100, a measure of skin clearance, from year one to year five in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from this study were presented at the 26th European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) Congress in Geneva, Switzerland.Shares of the company have outperformed the industry, having surged 17.4% so far this year, while the industry increased 16%.The drug is approved in the United Sates for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis, active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Since its launch, the drug has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016, recording $1.1 billion in sales. In first-half 2017, it generated solid sales of $900 million.The long-term safety and efficacy data of the drug is expected to further boost its growth.Meanwhile, in the second quarter, the drug was granted approval in Europe for a label update to include 52-week data from the CLEAR study. It demonstrated the long-term superiority of Cosentyx compared to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara in psoriasis. Also, patient recruitment is underway for the new head-to-head clinical trial, EXCEED, to evaluate the superiority of Cosentyx versus AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira in PsA.Novartis expects the next growth phase to begin in 2018 driven by Cosentyx (in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis indications), Entresto, Kisqali and a deep pipeline with candidates like BAF312, AMG 334, RTH258. Moreover, the approval of Kymriah (CTL019) in August made Novartis the first company to bring CAR-T cell therapy to treat cancer.

1938,JNJ,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of national reimbursement for the FreeStyleLibre glucose monitoring system from National Health Service (NHS) Business Services Authority in the U.K. Notably, this was a major breakthrough in its diabetics business.The development has widened this Illinois-based medical device major’s customer base in diabetes management. Beginning Nov 1, Abbott’s flagship glucose monitoring system will be available for reimbursement through the NHS across England and Wales, NHS Scotland, and the Health and Social Care in Northern Ireland.Per Abbott, the grant of reimbursement will also make FreeStyleLibre system widely available to around 3.5 million people in the U.K.who are diagnosed with diabetes. Also, management expects that there may be roughly 549,000 people in the U.K.who have diabetes but are yet to be diagnosed.This reimbursement approval in U.K. marks another milestone where Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre system stands partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan. Notably, FreeStyle Libre system is presently under review by the FDA and awaits approval in the United States.Meanwhile, Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in Japan.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.This apart, in July, the company partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%.Considering the market potential and Abbott’s slew of latest developments in the diabetes care segment, the recent national reimbursement grant in U.K. will accelerate the top line.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results.

1939,JNJ,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) recently signed a definitive agreement to sell the company’s certain neurosurgery assets to healthcare products and services provider Natus Medical Incorporated (BABY  -  Free Report) for a total deal value of $47.5 million. This forms part of the company’s efforts to fulfill certain closing conditions toward the proposed $1.05 billion acquisition of Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Codman neurosurgery business.Integra has decided to sell the global Camino ICP monitoring product line, including its San Diego manufacturing facility, to Natus Medical. Natus will also get hold of the U.S. rights related to Integra’s fixed pressure shunts as well as U.S. rights to Codman’s DURAFORM dural graft implant, standard EVD catheters and CSF collection systems.While announcing this entire set of divestiture, Integra has also discussed its imminent financial impact. Per the company, in 2016, approximately $50 million of revenues were earned from the neurosurgery product lines associated with these divestitures. Taking net of divestitures and the Codman acquisition into account, the company on a preliminary basis, estimated fourth-quarter 2017 revenue contribution of approximately $60-$65 million. For full-year 2018, Integra expects Codman Neurosurgery to contribute between $290 million and $300 million in revenue and net of divestitures.Overall, the Codman Neurosurgery business is expected to remain accretive toward Integra’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share and contribute at least 22 cents. However, for full-year 2017, Integra expects minimal contribution from Codman Neurosurgery to adjusted earnings per share.Notably, Integra’s proposed acquisition of Codman, declared in February, will provide the company with the global reach in Neurosurgery which connotes the core expertise within Integra’s Specialty Surgical Solutions.Per Integra, Codman Neurosurgery’s existing portfolio and new product pipeline in advanced hydrocephalus, neuro-critical care and electrosurgery are going to complement the acquirer’s leading products and pipeline in tissue ablation, dural repair and cranial stabilization. Post the completion of this acquisition, the consolidated portfolio will offer complete solutions for neurosurgery and the scale to invest and bring in new technologies to the table for patients worldwide.Notably, per a report by Radiant Insights, the global neurosurgery market is expected to witness an estimated CAGR of around 10-12% during 2015-2019. Taking into consideration the huge growth prospects, we believe Integra’s initiative to strengthen its foothold in this particular niche to be well-timed.Overall, Integra Lifesciences has been consistently trading above the broader industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 22.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 5.9% gain of the industry.Zacks Rank & Key PickIntegra currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Data from the study announced in April demonstrated that the treatment regimen has the ability to shorten treatment duration in patients. Moreover, JNJ-4178 demonstrated a 100% cure rate after only six weeks of therapy, as published in the Journal of Hepatology. Janssen will complete this study as planned and stop further development thereafter.Achillion stated that it will now focus on developing its factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471 for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The interim results from the study, announced in August, showed clinically meaningful complement inhibition and a favorable tolerability profile for ACH-4471.Multiple phase II studies are planned for evaluating ACH-4471 in the second half of 2017. The studies will include PNH patients with sub-optimal response to Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris or patients with C3G, a rare renal disorder.In a separate press release, Achillion announced the promotion of current executive vice president, Joseph Truitt as chief operating officer and appointed Avner Ingerman as senior vice president and head of ophthalmology.

1941,JNJ,"U.S. equity markets are going through turbulent times. There is a lot of volatility and uncertainty owing to rising geopolitical risks and political uncertainty. This has increased the appeal for dividend investing.Geopolitical RisksNorth Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test, that of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an Inter Continental Ballistic Missile, on Sep 3, 2017. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created huge unrest in a number of Asian economies and the United States.U.S. President Donald Trump has been suggesting that Kim Jong-Un’s threats will be met with military actions if he threatens to harm U.S. territories or any of its allies. US ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, said that North Korea is “begging for war” and has urged the U.N. to impose strictest sanctions on the rogue nation (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Political RisksThere is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s ability to pass the promised legislations relating to tax reform and deregulation. Although economic fundamentals have been strong, there are renewed doubts over the capabilities of the Trump administration.Economic growth in the United States was better than initially expected by the markets. Per the Commerce Department, economic growth was 3% in second-quarter 2017 compared with its earlier estimate of 2.6% (read: ETFs to Watch on Oil Price Rise and Debt Limit Deal).However, in a latest show of bipartisanship, Trump sided with the Democrats, to increase the debt ceiling and fund the government till mid-December. This came as a disappointment for fellow Republicans, who were pushing for a longer extension. Hours before the deal was passed Paul Ryan stated that a shorter debt limit extension would give the Democrats immense leverage over the Republicans, once the debate starts all over again in mid-December.In such a scenario, dividend-paying securities provide consistent income to investors. The uniqueness of these securities is their increase when political uncertainty weighs on markets, more so because apart from high dividend, these securities exhibit less volatility as they are stable and mature companies.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. equities with relatively high dividend yields.Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG  -  Free Report)This fund is a low-cost ETF that seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends.It has AUM of $30.8 billion and charges a fee of 8 basis points a year.

1944,JNJ,"Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $1.11 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 by 7.8%. Earnings rose 3.7% year over year.Among other items, adjusted earnings exclude a charge related to its new oncology collaboration with Britain's AstraZeneca (AZN  -  Free Report).Revenues for the quarter declined 2% year over year to $10.33 billion. Sales also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.51 billion. Currency movement positively impacted revenues by 1%. Excluding currency impact, sales declined 3% year over year.Lost sales in some markets due to a network cyber-attack in June hurt the top line in the quarter. Meanwhile, unfavorable comparisons with the third quarter of last year hurt sales.Quarter in DetailThe Pharmaceutical segment generated revenues of $9.2 billion, down 3% (down 4% excluding Fx impact) year over year as continued strong sales of PD-1 inhibitor, Keytruda were offset by lower sales of key products like diabetes drug Januvia and HPV vaccine Gardasil/Gardasil 9. As in the previous quarters, loss of market exclusivity for several drugs also hurt the top line.Keytruda brought in sales of $1.05 billion in third-quarter 2017, up 21% sequentially and 194% year over year. Sales continued to be driven by the launch of new indications globally. Keytruda sales are gaining particularly from strong momentum in the indication of first-line lung cancer.Keytruda is already approved for many types of cancers and treatment settings including lung cancer, melanoma, head and neck cancer, classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and bladder cancer.Meanwhile, the Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. Key recent approvals include that for advanced bladder cancer, advanced microsatellite instability-high cancers and first approval as a combination therapy with Eli Lilly’s (LLY  -  Free Report) cancer drug Alimta (pemetrexed) and carboplatin (pem/carbo) in lung cancer.The new approvals have expanded the patient population, which we believe drove sales in the third quarter.Zepatier brought in sales of $468 million, down from $517 million in the previous quarter.Bridion (sugammadex) Injection generated sales of $185 million in the quarter, up 33% year over year, driven by the strong uptake following its launch in the United States.Meanwhile, combined sales of Remicade (lost exclusivity in Europe and facing stiff biosimilar competition in the region), Cubicin (lost patent protection in the United States in June 2016), Zetia (lost market exclusivity in the United States in December 2016) and Vytorin (lost U.S. exclusivity in April 2017) declined $800 million in the quarter.Remicade sales declined 31% to $214 million in the quarter. Merck markets the branded version of Remicade outside the United States while Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) markets the rheumatoid arthritis drug within the country.Cubicin sales plunged 71% to $91 million in the quarter. The Zetia/Vytorin franchise recorded sales of $462 million, down 51% due to loss of exclusivity for both Zetia and Vytorin.Sales of Isentress and the Januvia/Janumet (diabetes) franchise also declined in the quarter. The Januvia/Janumet franchise recorded sales of $1.53 billion in the quarter, down 2% from the year-ago quarter due to continued pricing pressure.Isentress sales declined 17% in the quarter to 310 million. Lower volumes/demand due to competitive pressure hurt sales of Isentress.Gardasil/Gardasil 9 sales declined 22% to $675 million. The production shutdown following the cyber-attack resulted in supply constraints, which adversely impacted sales in the United States. However sales rose in Europe  boosted by the addition of sales from the terminated vaccine joint venture with Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) and in Asia Pacific backed by strong demand.Merck’s Animal Health segment generated revenues of $1 billion, up 16% (up 14% excluding Fx impact) from the year-ago quarter, primarily driven by higher sales of companion animal products, primarily Bravecto, companion animal vaccines and contribution from the Vallée acquisition.Gross Margins & Costs Rise                                                   Adjusted gross margin came in at 76%, up 70 basis points (bps) from the year-ago quarter,, attributable to favorable effects of product mix, which offset the costs related to the cyber attack.Marketing and administrative (M&A) expenses increased 1% to $2.4 billion in the reported quarter. Research and development (R&D) spend increased 8% to $1.8 billion in the quarter.2017 GuidanceMerck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance while raising its sales guidance marginally – for the second time this year. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $3.91–$3.97 compared with $3.76–$3.88 expected earlier. The adjusted earnings guidance includes less than 1% negative impact from currency fluctuation, comparing favorably with approximately 1% previously.Revenues are expected in the range of $40.0 billion – $40.5 billion compared with the earlier forecast of $39.4 billion – $40.4 billion, including negative currency impact of less than 1%  (versus approximately 1% previously).Operating expenses are still expected to increase year over year at a mid-single-digit rate. The increased costs are attributable to increased investments behind the ongoing launches, remediation expenses related to the cyber attack, as well as additional R&D costs associated with the new oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca.Our TakeMerck’s third-quarter results were mixed as the company beat estimates for earnings but missed the same for sales. Despite a relatively weaker sales performance, Merck raised its previously issued adjusted earnings guidance for 2017 and also upped its sales guidance marginally.Shares were down 2% in pre-market trading in response to lower sales of Merck’s multiple medicines. This year so far, Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry. Merck’s shares have risen 5.3% this year comparing unfavorably with a 16.1% increase for the industry.All eyes were on the performance of Keytruda, which is being touted as a key long-term growth driver for Merck. The drug continued its strong performance with sales crossing the $1 billion mark this quarter.However, the company has suffered some notable pipeline setbacks this year. Earlier this month, Merck decided not to seek approval for its CETP inhibitor anacetrapib for cholesterol management as its clinical profile was not strong enough to support regulatory filings. Last month, Merck discontinued development of two of its HCV programs saying that the HCV market is becoming extremely crowded. Also, three combination studies of Keytruda for multiple myeloma were placed on clinical hold following reports of death in the Keytruda groups in JulyMerck carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1945,JNJ,"While Wall Street is scaling multiple highs on Trump’s pro-growth reforms, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been an outperformer since election last year. This is because a strong rotation in leadership in the large-cap domestic space has benefited Dow Jones more than its other large-cap counterparts like the S&P 500 (read: High Beta ETFs & Stocks for Market-Beating Returns).Notably, the Dow Jones has returned 24.2% since the Election Day compared to a gain of 18.9% for the S&P 500.

1946,JNJ,"Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) markets blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, while other well-known names in this market are AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 3.2 million people in the United States are living with chronic hepatitis C infection while many remain unaware of being infected. There are about 17,000 new hepatitis C cases each year in the United States, many of which go unreported.Considering these numbers, it is not a surprise that quite a few pharma and biotech companies are working on bringing new, improved, shorter-duration HCV treatments to the market. The market is thus getting crowded and seeing increased pricing pressure.  A lot has happened in the HCV space of late.  In September 2017, Gilead Sciences’ Sovaldi received approval in China, as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. It is the first Gilead HCV drug to be approved in China.  Meanwhile, Gilead’s single-tablet regimen (STR) of Sovaldi, velpatasvir and voxilaprevir, Vosevi received approval in the United States, EU and Canada in July/August. Vosevi became the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors.Gilead’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 16.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 14.5% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Meanwhile, AbbVie’s 8-week, pan-genotypic, ribavirin-free, once-daily HCV treatment, Mavyret/Maviret, gained approval in the United States, EU and Canada in the past couple of months. Mavyret, AbbVie’s next-generation HCV program, is a combination of glecaprevir, a potent protease inhibitor and pibrentasvir, a NS5A inhibitor. Maviret has the potential to rejuvenate growth in the HCV franchise. According to AbbVie, Mavyret may be used in up to 95% of HCV patients, depending on the stage of liver disease and prior treatment history.Abbvie’s shares have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock has rallied 44% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.However, last week, pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced that it is discontinuing further development of two of its next-generation hepatitis C (HCV) programs — MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company made this decision based on review of available phase II efficacy data and a heavily crowded HCV market.Merck’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.Besides Merck, another giant Johnson & Johnson also discontinued the development of its investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir. The company took this decision considering that there are several highly effective therapies available for this indication.Johnson & Johnson’s shares have underperformed the industry year to date. The stock has gained 15.6% compared with the industry’s gain of 17.9% in the same time frame. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3.It is believed that the discontinuation of Merck and J&J’s combination HCV regimens should act in favor of Gilead and AbbVie. Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. However, the companies will continue to face challenges in the form of declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure. The lack of additional entrants in the market should also slow down the rate of decline in sales.Where Do Zacks' Investment Ideas Come From?You are welcome to download the full, up-to-the-minute list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 ""Strong Buy"" stocks free of charge.

1947,JNJ,"The pharmaceutical sector has been grabbing investors’ attention of late with the NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gaining 13.1% and the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry 20.7% year to date, outpacing 14.7% gain for the S&P 500. New drug approvals and tax reforms are expected to provide a further impetus to the stocks. However, factors like drug pricing and competition from biosimilars will continue to act as major deterrents. On the other hand, companies like Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) are resorting to workforce reduction for a leaner cost structure. On the M&A front, apart from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) acquisition of Actelion Ltd in June, nothing much has happened in this space. Merck & Co (MRK  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will acquire Germany-based Rigontec, a privately held immuno-oncology focused biotech to boost its immune-oncology pipeline. Nevertheless, the proposed tax reforms are expected to boost cash balances of the companies which in turn can be used for mergers/acquisitions.Here we have picked four of the largest drug companies which look well poised for growth and can be a prudent choice for adding to one’s portfolio:Based in Switzerland, Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) is one of the leaders in health care solutions with a wide array of drugs and services. Novartis has a presence in the field of oncology, neuroscience, ophthalmology and generics. Novartis has a strong oncology portfolio of drugs like Afinitor, Exjade, Jakavi, Zykadia, Tasigna, Jadenu and an improved formulation of Exjade.The recent FDA approval of Kisqali for advanced or metastatic breast cancer and breakthrough gene transfer treatment, Kymriah suspension for acute lymphoblastic leukemia has further boosted the portfolio. The approval is a major boost for Novartis given the potential in the CAR T therapy space.Growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto more than offset the impact of generic erosion, mainly due to Glivec. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016. We believe that the approval of new drugs and label expansion of existing ones should boost the top line going forward. Novartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Novartis’ stock has gained 21.8% year to date. Strength in oncology drugs and the approval of the first CAR T therapy should continue to boost performance. Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report), one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in the United States, focuses on the development and commercialization of a wide range of products including human and animal biologic as well as small molecule medicines and vaccines, along with consumer health care products. Pfizer is looking to drive growth through licensing deals and collaborative agreements.The company is looking to expand the labels of approved drugs like Ibrance, Xeljanz, Xalkori and Eliquis. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline. Moreover, Pfizer is evaluating various biosimilar molecules in several stages of development given the potential in the market. Shares of the company have moved up 9.3%, in the last three months comparing favorably with the industry’s gain. Pfizer presently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Earnings estimates of the company for 2017 have been static over the past 60 days. Bagsværd, Denmark-based Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is a global leader in the diabetes market. The company is also a key player in hemophilia care, growth hormone therapy, hormone replacement therapy and obesity. The company’s portfolio includes drugs like Levemir, NovoRapid, Victoza, NovoMix 30, NovoMix 50, NovoMix 70, NovoSeven, NovoThirteen and Norditropin.Additionally, obesity drug, Saxenda (liraglutide 3 mg) was launched in the United States in 2015 and its uptake has been encouraging. Victoza is currently the market leader in the GLP-1 segment and we expect Victoza to continue being a significant contributor to the company’s top line. In August, the FDA approved a new indication for Victoza to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease.We believe the label expansion of drugs will further boost the top line. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The company’s shares have rallied 40.5% year to date. The company’s earnings estimates for 2017 have moved up 3% over the last 60 days. Headquartered in Leverkusen, Germany, Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report) is a life science company with core competencies in the areas of health care and agriculture.  Bayer has been consistently making efforts to transform into a pure life science company. Drugs launched over the last few quarters are expected to continue to drive the top line.  Bayer is looking for a label expansion of its oncology drug Stivarga, which is approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors.The company has inked several strategic deals and undertook meaningful acquisitions in the recent past. Bayer is looking to acquire Monsanto in an all-cash transaction and the combined business is expected to boost Bayer’s Crop Science business and provide accretion to its bottom-line.Bayer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s shares have gained 35.1% year to date. Earnings estimates for 2017 of the company have moved north 3.2% over the last 60 days. Bottom Line  Challenges in the form of pricing pressure and competition will remain in the healthcare sector. Nevertheless, picking some outperformers from the space, backed by a solid Zacks Rank and positive price movement could lead investors to gain this earnings season.4 Stocks to Watch After the Massive Equifax HackCybersecurity stocks spiked on recent news of a data breach affecting 143 million Americans.

1948,JNJ,"Most of the healthcare community has started to rejoice over Capitol Hill’s regulatory apprise in the recent past. The way the full-Obamacare repeal proposal, Republicans’ prime agenda within their healthcare roster, fell flat on its face, was intense! And things got even stagier when the “skinny"" repeal bill also failed to get passable support at the Senate.We believe the immense support to retain the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare came on the heels of the latest cost estimate released by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation’s (JCT). While the Republican bill primarily promises improved insurance coverage from the existing law with significantly lower American premiums, the cost estimate revealed something totally contrary.Per the report, if ACA is repealed, the number of uninsured people will increase by 17 million in 2018 from the present uninsured number. This apart, average premium in the nongroup market (for individual policies purchased through marketplaces or directly from insurers) will increase 25% in 2018.Troubled Times for MedTech? While twists and turns continue to unfold at the Capitol Hill, thus boosting the chances of the existing healthcare policy, the scenario within the medical device space is getting gloomier. Amid such political conundrum, market watchers should be keeping a tab on the MedTech space.The community had been quite hopeful since the change in power as Trump’s proposed policies always talked about the abolition of the infamous 2.3% medical device sales tax. This dreadful tax, which was commonly addressed as ‘fund of the ACA’, simply took a toll on the entire medical device industry, since its enactment in 2013. This tax was imposed on the selling price instead of net profit, amounting to a stupendous sum, wiping out almost a quarter of the profit at medical technology owners.A report by FierceMedical Device released at that time revealed that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) made a payment of $180 million as medical device sales tax in 2014. Medtronic (MDT  -  Free Report), the legacy Covidien, Smith & Nephew (SNN  -  Free Report) paid $112 million, $60 million and $25 million, respectively during that year.This was the story of the industry forerunners. The position of the smaller companies was much worse. Let alone making profits, they were in fact struggling to survive.Realizing the severe linkage effect of this tax among the MedTech bigwigs as well as small players, finally, from the beginning of 2015, the U.S. House and Senate temporarily suspended it (for two years only). Now, MedTech players find themselves facing a similar situation (from the beginning of 2018 itself), if the policy remains intact.We note that voters who are in favor of the ACA are also talking about the abolishment of the Cadillac tax (40% excise tax on high-cost healthcare plans), another dreadful fiscal revenue generating means of the Democrats.Unfortunately, while the Trump administration has been targeting a complete annulment of this Cadillac tax in the near future, it has not come up with any concrete plan to replace MedTech tax yet. The future of the MedTech fraternity thus hangs in the balance.How the MedTech Community Perceived it to Be?According to the MedTech community, suspension of MedTech tax would have directly addressed issues like lack of opportunity for research and development, innovation, pipeline development and increased investments needed to accelerate patient and provider access to innovative health care products. This would have also helped in boosting job creation and quality of patient care. Accordingly, they are going all out to shelve this tax.Going by an article by Peter Sullivan (published in The Hill), following the Congress’s failure to approve the repeal of the existing healthcare law, the trade group for medical device companies is launching a new campaign to push lawmakers to repeal ObamaCare’s tax on medical devices.What Awaits MedTech Players?Amid this political cacophony, market watchers have a bearish stance toward the space. While pondering over medical device stocks that stand to gain or lose due to the political gridlock, we find that retention or repeal of Obamacare will actually create a vicious circle within the sector.On the one hand, if Obamacare stays, MedTech profit will be hit significantly, thus posing challenges for research and development, which is quite expensive.On the other hand, while the repeal of Obamacare will lead to intensive research and development and creation of expensive cutting-edge MedTech products, there are questions over its effectiveness. This is because with higher number of uninsured, the industry is likely to witness a shrinking customer base post-enactment, indicating a decline in demand for expensive medical procedures and devices.No matter how the policy shapes up, it will prove to be beneficial as well as challenging at the same time for the players within the space. Investors meanwhile can be hopeful about the fact that the overall impact of the existing policy’s amendment or retention will not be that appalling as it apparently seems.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1949,JNJ,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) announced data from a long-term study on its Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate, aducanumab. Data from the study showed a continued benefit in the rate of amyloid decline over a two/three year period in patients with prodromal or mild Alzheimer’s disease when treated with aducanumab.Shares were up 2.5% on Monday, in response to the promise shown by the anti-amyloid candidate.The company said the results from a recently conducted analysis of the long-term extension (LTE) of its ongoing phase Ib study (PRIME) of aducanumab were consistent with the previously reported data from PRIME.PRIME is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose phase Ib study being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of aducanumab in patients suffering from prodromal or mild AD.So far this year, Biogen’s shares have risen 3% while the industry recorded an increase of 7.2%.Biogen is conducting two other phase III studies (ENGAGE and EMERGE) on aducanumab for the treatment of early AD. The results from LTE study support the design of ENGAGE and EMERGE studies.Biogen is looking to strengthen its AD and other neurodegenerative disorders pipeline. Biogen’s AD pipeline comprises candidates with different mechanisms of action including anti-tau candidate (BIIB092/BMS-986168 - with potential in AD as well as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)), anti-amyloid (aducanumab) candidates as well as a BACE inhibitor (elenbecestat) program.However, the successful development of therapies for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease is challenging and we note that several companies have failed in developing treatments for the same. In November last year, Eli Lilly & Company's (LLY  -  Free Report) anti-amyloid candidate solanezumab failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage AD study. Lilly decided to drop the development of solanezumab. Lilly suffered a major setback in Aug 2010, when it had to halt the development of another phase III Alzheimer’s candidate semagacestat.Meanwhile, Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) shelved its late-stage Alzheimer’s candidate, bapineuzumab IV, after it failed two phase III studies. Pfizer was developing the candidate in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Elan Corporation.The Alzheimer’s disease market represents a huge commercial potential and a successfully developed product could generate billions of dollars in sales once launched.Biogen has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1950,JNJ,"Biotech stocks have bounced back strongly this year after a poor show last year despite challenges like rising competition, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs. Strong clinical results, faster FDA approvals, success of new products and significant contributions from established drugs have led to the rally in the biotech sector.The NASDAQ Biotechnology Index gained 24.6% so far this year. This is in sharp contrast to last year’s performance when the index was down 22%.However, despite the strong performance, investors are keen to know whether the rally will continue and what factors will drive the same.These companies are likely to see continued demand for their products, given an accelerated increase in aging population and the proportionate increase in diseases.Moreover, the FDA has approved far more drugs so far in 2017 than it did in the whole of 2016. Hence, a faster drug approval process along with strong pipelines, innovative treatments, impressive results, and increased health care spending should support further growth in the sector.Though the momentum in the biotech sector is likely to continue, it’s a good idea to avoid a few stocks that will possibly lose their momentum soon despite significant year-to-date gains.3 Small Biotech Stocks to Avoid Avoiding stocks that have represented significant share price gain could be a bit tricky. However, we have taken the help of the Zacks Stock Screener to identify stocks, which may stop rallying in the near term. To shortlist the stocks from the vast universe of biotech sector, we have picked stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).Moreover, we have also taken into consideration stocks that witnessed negative estimate revisions for the current year over the last 60 days as these are likely to plunge further and should be dumped.Keryx Biopharmaceuticals Inc. (KERX  -  Free Report): This Boston-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on treating patients suffering from renal disease. The company’s shares have risen 20.1% so far this year. However, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4. Further, over the last 60 days, the loss per share estimates widened by 33% for 2017. Though the company’s label expansion efforts for its only marketed drug, Auryxia bode well for growth, the company’s sole dependence on the product for revenue is concerning.Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Price Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. Price | Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. QuoteJuno Therapeutics, Inc. : This Washington-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on the development of immuno-oncology treatments. The company’s shares have gained a significant 139.5% so far this year. Shares of the company mainly rose in September this year on the speculation that it will be acquired soon after the acquisition of Kite Pharma by Gilead. However, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 and has a VGM Score of D. Further, over the last 60 days, its loss per share estimates widened almost 3% for 2017.Although Juno is among the major players in the field of T-cell-based immunotherapy, there are several other companies that are looking to develop and bring immunotherapy treatments to market. The CAR space has many companies including Novartis, Kite Pharma, bluebird bio, Intrexon, and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) working on treatments. We note that Juno lags Kite Pharma and Novartis in the race to bring a CAR T product to the market. Hence, competition in the immunotherapy space may weigh heavily on the stock in the near term.Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price Juno Therapeutics, Inc. Price | Juno Therapeutics, Inc. QuoteAbeona Therapeutics Inc. (ABEO  -  Free Report): This Delaware-based biopharmaceutical company focuses on developing gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. The company’s shares showed a significant gain of 245.3% so far this year. However, it currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 and has a VGM Score of F.Further, over the last 60 days, its loss per share estimates widened by 24.5% for 2017. The company’s lead gene therapies EB-101 and ABO-201 recently received breakthrough therapy and orphan drug designation, respectively from the FDA. Abeona’s share significantly rose in July 2017 after the company announced that it has received guidance from the FDA to commence pivotal phase III for EB-101. However, many companies are working on bringing gene therapies to the market. Therefore, these candidates may face intense competition in the targeted space, if approved.Abeona Therapeutics Inc.

A decline in tensions between the United States and North Korea led to gains for the index on Monday.

1952,JNJ,"As expected, a plethora of earnings reports have hit the tape this morning, including more of the bigger Wall Street banks and other household brands. Put simply, results are mostly good but ultimately mixed thus far. Let’s try to slog through what we’ve found at this hour.
"
1953,JNJ,"Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) beat estimates on both top and bottom lines, but shares are selling off following this earnings report on drastically lower fixed income revenues. Earnings of $3.95 per share beat the $3.51 in the Zacks consensus estimate, on sales of $7.887 billion, well ahead of the $7.57 billion expected. But it was the 40% drop in Fixed Income, Commodities and Currencies (FICC, a staple of Goldman Sachs’ holdings) and the second quarter in a row of poor performance in this segment.
"
1954,JNJ,"Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report) also topped estimates: 46 cents per share on $22.83 billion beat the 43 cents and $21.91 billion, respectively, in the Zacks consensus. An after-tax windfall of $103 million related to the sale of its non-consumer credit card business helped achieve the quarterly beat on the top line. This is at least the fifth quarter in a row of posting an earnings beat for the North Carolina-based bank major.
"
1955,JNJ,"Healthcare product retailer Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by 4 cents per share to $1.83 in the quarter, though revenues of $18.84 billion missed the $18.90 billion expected. However, guidance for both sales and earnings for fiscal 2017 were revised upward within the earnings report, helping JNJ shares rise 2% immediately following the results.
"
1956,JNJ,"Defense contractor giant Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) surpassed the Zacks consensus for both earnings and revenues: $3.23 per share beat the $3.10 anticipated, and quarterly sales of $12.69 billion beat the $12.46 billion expected. The company’s Aeronautics segment grew 19% year over year, helping boost Lockheed’s results in the quarter, and the shares are trading up in today’s pre-market.
"
1957,JNJ,"Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated healthcare provider United Health (UNH  -  Free Report) topped earnings estimates for its Q2, on revenues that marginally surpassed our consensus. Earnings of $2.46 per share beat by 8 cents in the quarter, and sales of $50.1 billion was a smudge above the $49.97 billion expected. The company has raised its forecast for fiscal 2017, and this marks at least the fifth quarter in a row of an earnings beat. Shares are up modestly at this hour.
"
1958,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter 2017 results. While earnings beat expectations, sales missed the same. However, the drug and consumer products giant raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook, which sent shares up more than 1% in pre-market trading.This year so far, J&J’s share price is up 14.7%. This compares favorably with the 11.3% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Earnings BeatJ&J’s second-quarter 2017 earnings came in at $1.83 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.79 and increasing 5.2% from the year-ago period.Including one-time items, J&J reported second-quarter earnings of $1.40 per share, down 2.1% from the year-ago period.Sales Miss AgainSales came in at $18.84 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion by 0.3%. Sales increased 1.9% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting an operational increase of 2.9% and a negative currency impact of 1%. Organically, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales increased 0.5% on an operational basis.Second-quarter sales grew 1.6% in the domestic market to $9.73 billion and 2.3% in international markets to $9.11 billion, reflecting 4.4% operational growth, partially offset by a 2.1% negative currency impact.Sales in DetailsPharmaceutical segment sales declined 0.2% year over year to $8.64 billion, reflecting 1% operational growth and 1.2% negative currency impact. Higher sales in international markets offset a weaker performance in the U.S.Sales in the domestic market declined 2.6% to $5.01 billion, while international sales grew 3.3% to $3.63 billion.New products like Imbruvica (cancer) and Darzalex (multiple myeloma) continued to perform well. Other growth drivers were Xarelto, Stelara and Invega Sustenna.However, sales of Invokana/Invokamet declined 23%. Also, Concerta declined 23.9% while Zytiga sales fell 7.2%.Importantly, sales of the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade, marketed in partnership with Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report), declined 14% in the quarter with U.S. sales declining 13.9% and international sales declining 5.6% due to biosimilar competition. In this regard, we would like to mention that Pfizer Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) launched its Inflectra injection, a biosimilar version of Remicade in the U.S. late last November. This did not have any significant impact on Remicade sales in the past two quarters. Management is expected to comment on the impact of the biosimilar on second-quarter sales at the conference call.J&J’s Pharma segment achieved some clinical milestones during the quarter. These included the FDA approval for Darzalex to be used in combination with Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Pomalyst (pomalidomide) and dexamethasone for the third-line treatment of multiple myeloma. Importantly, last week, J&J announced FDA approval for its pipeline candidate guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Tremfya.Meanwhile, last month J&J completed its previously announced $30 billion acquisition of Swiss biotech Actelion, which will diversify its revenuesto the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) category. Actelion’s PAH drugs added $91 million to the top line in the quarter.Medical Devices segment sales came in at $6.73 billion, up 4.9% from the year-ago period. It included an operational increase of 5.9% and negative currency movement of 1%. Sales gained mainly from the inclusion of Abbott Medical Optics acquisition. Excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures, on an operational basis, worldwide sales increased 1.1%.Sales in the domestic market rose 6.1% year over year to $3.23 billion. International market sales increased 3.9% (operational increase of 5.8%) year over year to $3.5 billion.Operational growth was driven by the Advanced Surgery business; electrophysiology products in the Cardiovascular business and Acuvue contact lenses in the Vision Care business, which made up for a weaker sales performance in the Diabetes Care unitThe Consumer segment recorded revenues of $3.48 billion in the reported quarter, up 1.7% year over year(operational increase of 2.3%). Foreign currency movement negatively impacted sales in the segment by 0.6%. Sales in the domestic market grew 7.4% from the year-ago period to $1.49 billion.Slower growth in baby care products was partially offset by growth in over-the-counter products.Meanwhile, the international segment recorded a decline of 2.2% to $1.99 billion, reflecting an operational decline of 1.1% and a negative currency impact of 1.1%.2017 Guidance RaisedJ&J raised its earnings guidance for 2017 and increased the lower end of its sales outlook.J&J expects 2017 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $7.12 - $7.22, including currency impact, compared with $7.00 - $7.15 expected previously.The revenue guidance is in the range of $75.8 billion to $76.1 billion compared with $75.4 billion to $76.1 billion expected previouslyOur TakeDespite the third consecutive sales miss, J&J looks optimistic about a better sales performance in the second half. Chief executive officer, Alex Gorsky said that J&J’s sales growth will accelerate in the second half of the year.Importantly, sales in the Medical Device segment are picking up, which made up for lower sales in the international Consumer and U.S. Pharmaceutical segments in the quarter. Sales in J&J’s domestic Pharma segment have decelerated this year as key growth drivers have slowed down due to competition. Quite a few products in its portfolio like Remicade and Concerta are facing generic competition. However, we believe that new products like Tremfya, label expansion of drugs like Imbruvica and Darzalex and contribution from Actelion could lead to better sales trends in the remaining half of the year.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1959,JNJ,"Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 core earnings of $1.22 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 but the recorded figure was a penny lower than the year-ago figure of $1.23.Revenues declined 2% to $12.2 billion as volume growth was offset by the negative impact of generic competition and pricing but beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $12.1 billionA look at Novartis’ share price movement in the last three months shows that the stock outperformed the Zacks classified Large Cap Pharma industry. Its shares have rallied 14.5% compared with the 7.2% gain recorded by the industry.All growth rates mentioned below are on a year-over-year basis and at constant exchange rates.The Quarter in DetailNovartis operates under three segments: Innovative Medicines (Pharmaceuticals), Alcon (Ophthalmology unit) and Sandoz (Generics).The Innovative Medicines division recorded sales of $8.3 billion, up 1%. Generic competition and pricing pressure impacted sales at the segment, primarily due to the entry of generics for Gleevec in the U.S and Europe. Nevertheless, growth products – Cosentyx, Entresto, Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist and Gilenya boosted sales.Psoriasis Cosentyx sales surged 90% on the back of strong growth in its three approved indications while Entresto too had solid quarter as sales benefited from continued access improvements, expansion of sales force in the U.S and reimbursement in Europe. Oncology franchise grew 9% driven mainly by Promacta/Revolade, Jakavi, Tafinlar + Mekinist.Sales at the Sandoz division were $2.5 billion, down 4% as volume growth was offset by price erosion mainly in the U.S. Sales in the U.S. declined 15% due to pricing pressure in retail generics and prior year launch timing. Biopharmaceuticals sales grew 6% to $260 million mainly driven by Zarxio in the U.S.Sales at the Alcon division were $1.5 billion, up 3%. Surgical sales increased 3% driven by growth in cataract consumables and vitreoretinal, intraocular lenses returning to growth globally. Vision Care sales were up 2% fuelled by the continued double-digit growth of Dailies Total1.2017 Outlook ReiteratedNovartis expects net sales to be broadly in line with the 2016 levels after including the impact of continued genericization of Gleevec/Glivec in the U.S. and Europe. Management had earlier estimated the impact of generic competition on sales to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2017.Pipeline UpdateNovartis’ pipeline candidates’ progress has been encouraging. The oncology portfolio continues to gain traction. Breast cancer drug Kisqali received a positive CHMP opinion as a first-line option for HR+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer in combination with any aromatase inhibitor in Europe. The drug is already approved in the U.S. The company also received FDA approval of Rydapt for the treatment of newly diagnosed FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and three types of systemic mastocytosis. In addition, Zykadia received FDA and EMA approval for first line use in ALK-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) while Tafinlar + Mekinist received FDA approval for treatment of BRAF V600E mutant metastatic NSCLC.CTL019 was unanimously recommended for approval by an FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee in July for the treatment of pediatric and young adult patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.Meanwhile, Cosentyx was granted approval in Europe for a label update to include 52 week data from CLEAR study demonstrating long-term superiority of Cosentyx compared to Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Stelara in psoriasis.Sandoz received approval and launched two major biosimilars in the EU- Erelzi, the biosimilar of Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Enbrel and Rixathon, the biosimilar version of Roche Holdings (RHHBY  -  Free Report) MabThera to treat blood cancers and immunological diseases. The EMA also accepted proposed biosimilars of adalimumab and infliximab. Sandoz’ generic version of asthma drug Advair Diskus was accepted by FDA.Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteOur TakeNovartis second-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat both earnings and sales estimates. However, Sandoz’s performance was disappointing as it battles pricing pressure.In the first half of 2017, Novartis announced that it is mulling strategic options for Alcon which includes retaining the business separation via capital market transactions such as a spin-off or an initial public offering. The company will throw more light on its plans for Alcon by the end of 2017.On a positive note, growth drivers like Cosentyx and Entresto, more than offset the impact of generic erosion, mainly due to Glivec. Cosentyx hit blockbuster status in 2016. The recent approval of Kisqali in the U.S. and FDA panel recommendation for CTL019 also bodes well for the company’s portfolio.Zacks RankNovartis currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump Policies If the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.

1961,JNJ,"U.S. stocks were little changed on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players including Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS  -  Free Report), Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), QUALCOMM, Inc. (QCOM  -  Free Report) and eBay Inc (EBAY  -  Free Report) that will be released this week. Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) is expected to report earnings after the market closes on Monday. While the Dow and the S&P 500 ended in the red after hitting record highs on Friday, the Nasdaq was able to eke out slight gains and notched a 7-day winning streak.For a look at the issues currently facing the markets, make sure to read today’s Ahead of Wall Street article.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) declined a meagre 0.04% to close at 21,629.72. The S&P 500 dropped just 0.01% to finish at 2,459.14, with utilities leading advancers and health care lagging. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index, however, gained 0.03% to close at 6,314.43.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It’s All About EarningsGiven the stock market’s record run this year, Wall Street is keeping a close eye on quarterly earnings.  This could be an excellent earnings season for the S&P 500, which in turn will boost its operating earnings per share for the trailing 12 months. Improved second-quarter economic growth, strong manufacturing and service surveys, and a moderate uptick in wage growth are expected to help Corporate America post relatively high profit margins in Q2. Earnings growth is expected to be led by energy, financials and information technology (read more: Wall Street to See Terrific Q2 Earnings: 5 Top Gainers).According to estimates, total second-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are expected to be up 6.6% from same period last year on 4.5% higher revenues. This would follow earnings growth of 13.3% in Q1 on 7% revenue growth, the highest in at least two years. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, further added that history shows the final tally will be better in Q2 “as actual EPS exceeded initial estimates in each of the last 21 quarters and have done so by an average of 3.6 percentage points.”If we move beyond Q2, total earnings for the S&P 500 cohort are anticipated to increase 6.1% on 4.5% higher revenues in Q3 and gain by 9.7% on 5.2% higher revenues in Q4. For the entire year, total earnings for the index are expected to be up 7.4% on 4.1% higher revenues. This will be way more than 1% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues recorded last year (read more: Bank Earnings in the Spotlight).Meanwhile, the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) quarterly profit came in below expectations. BlackRock reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39.

1964,JNJ,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ACHN  -  Free Report) shares fell almost 7.9% in after-market trading on Tuesday, following the announcement that Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) will sell its stake in the company.We remind investors that J&J had terminated the global license and collaboration agreement with Achillion for developing hepatitis C treatments earlier in September. The decision was taken by J&J as part of its strategy to focus on areas of greatest unmet medical need.The termination of the agreement is a major setback for Achillion, as it has no marketed drug and was dependent on J&J for funds. The company has lost out on future revenues in the form of milestone payments.Achillion’s shares are down 10.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry which remained flat in that period.In a separate press release, Achillion also announced promising preliminary data from group 1 of a phase II study on its factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471, in renal diseases. The candidate demonstrated potential in treating C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), a serious renal disease. The study is evaluating the candidate in patients with C3G or immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN).The phase II study is evaluating the candidate in two separate groups in patients with C3G or IC-MPGN. Group 1 evaluated a dose of 100 mg of ACH-4471 thrice daily for 14 days in two patients. Along with proteinuria, the study also measured the ratio of C3 fragments to intact C3 in plasma, which also decreased rapidly compared to baseline during the course of the study. Higher C3 fragments are believed to be responsible for kidney damage and loss of function seen in this disease over time.Presently, no FDA-approved therapies are available to treat C3G. However, the promise shown by the candidate is a boost for the company as it indicates a potential treatment under development.Achillion is currently selecting patients for enrollment in group 2 of the study.Moreover, the company has plans to initiate two separate phase II studies on ACH-4471 to evaluate it in C3G / IC-MPGN patients over six and twelve months during the first half of 2018.Other than C3G and IC-MPGN, Achillion is also developing ACH-4471 in paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (“PNH”), atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and dry age-related macular degeneration.In August 2017, the company had announced positive data from a phase II study in PNH patients. Achillion has plans to initiate another phase II study on ACH-4471 to evaluate the candidate in combination with Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (ALXN  -  Free Report) Soliris for potential long-term treatment in PNH patients already being treated with Soliris.Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1965,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that it has submitted a supplemental new drug application (sNDA) to the FDA for the label expansion of its diabetes drug Invokana (to include the cardiovascular indication based on data from a large CANVAS outcomes program.The application, to include the indication of risk reduction of cardiovascular events in type II diabetes patients, also applies to Invokana’s fixed-dose combinations, Invokamet and Invokamet XR.The filing was based on data from the CANVAS Program which evaluated Invokana- a SGLT2 inhibitor compared with placebo on CV events in type II diabetes patients who have established cardiovascular (CV) disease or are at risk for CV disease. The primary endpoint of the study was defined as major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), which included CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction and nonfatal stroke. The study showed that Invokana was successful in reducing the risks of heart attacks and strokes. The CANVAS program comprised two, nearly-identical large outcomes studies called CANVAS and CANVAS-R. However, the study also showed that the drug increased the risk of amputations.So far this year, Johnson & Johnson’s share price has increased 14.7% comparing unfavorably with a gain of 17.6% recorded by the industry it belongs to.Many pharma companies are working hard to get the labels of their diabetes medicines updated to include their cardiovascular benefits. With death from cardiovascular diseases being significantly higher in adults with diabetes compared to those without diabetes, the addition of positive CV outcomes on labels of diabetes drugs can give sales a shot in the arm.Eli Lilly & Company (LLY  -  Free Report) received FDA approval last year to include CV risk reduction data from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME study on the label of Jardiance. The updated label including the cardiovascular indication was launched in Jan 2017 while the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has also updated its diabetes treatment guidelines. The European Commission also approved the Jardiance label update for the cardiovascular indication in 2016.In August 2017, Novo Nordisk’s (NVO  -  Free Report) Victoza (liraglutide)  was approved by the FDA for  a new indication to reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular (CV) events in adults with type II diabetes and established CV disease. The FDA's decision was based on the results from the landmark LEADER trial, which demonstrated that Victoza statistically significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack or non-fatal stroke by 13% versus  placebo, when added to standard of care, with an absolute risk reduction of 1.9%.However, in May, Merck & Co., Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report) was denied approval by the FDA to include cardiovascular outcomes data from the TECOS study on the labels of its DPP-IV inhibitor Januvia (sitagliptin) and other medicines containing Januvia.AstraZeneca’s Bydureon also failed to reduce cardiovascular risk in a phase IIIb/IV cardiovascular outcomes study, EXSCEL.Johnson & Johnson Price Johnson & Johnson Price | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1966,JNJ,"Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation (IART  -  Free Report) has finally come up with the news of completing Codman Neurosurgery business acquisition from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report). This development was expected at the heels of last month’s major asset divestment initiative by the company. The whopping $1.045 billion purchase has been considered a major breakthrough for Integra as it will provide the company with global reach in Neurosurgery, thus connoting the core expertise within the company’s Specialty Surgical Solutions.Integra expects to complete the said asset divestment soon that forms part of certain closing conditions toward the Codman acquisition. Notably, Integra has signed a definitive agreement to sell the company’s certain neurosurgery assets to healthcare products and services provider, Natus Medical Incorporated (BABY  -  Free Report), for a total deal value of $47.5 million.The company has also decided to sell the global Camino ICP monitoring product line, including its San Diego manufacturing facility, to Natus Medical. Additionally, Natus will get hold of the U.S. rights related to Integra’s fixed pressure shunts as well as the U.S. rights to Codman’s DURAFORM dural graft implant, standard EVD catheters and CSF collection systems.Earlier, while announcing the set of divestitures to Natus, Integra had discussed its imminent financial impact. Per the company, in 2016, approximately $50 million of revenues were earned from the neurosurgery product lines associated with these divestitures. Taking net of divestitures and the Codman acquisition into account, the company on a preliminary basis, estimated fourth-quarter 2017 revenue contribution of approximately $60-$65 million. For full-year 2018, Integra expects Codman Neurosurgery to contribute between $290 million and $300 million in revenue and net of divestitures.Overall, the Codman Neurosurgery business is anticipated to remain accretive toward Integra’s 2018 adjusted earnings per share and contribute at least 22 cents. However, for full-year 2017, Integra expects minimal contribution from Codman Neurosurgery to adjusted earnings per share.Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and Consensus Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation Price and Consensus | Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation QuotePer Integra, Codman Neurosurgery’s existing portfolio and new product pipeline in advanced hydrocephalus, neuro-critical care and electrosurgery are going to complement the acquirer’s leading products and pipeline in tissue ablation, dural repair and cranial stabilization. Post the closure of this buyout, the consolidated portfolio will offer complete solutions for neurosurgery and the scale to invest as well as bring in new technologies to the table for patients worldwide.Notably, per a report by Radiant Insights, the global neurosurgery market is projected to witness an estimated CAGR of around 10-12% during 2015-2019. Taking into consideration this huge growth prospect, we believe, Integra’s initiative to strengthen foothold in this particular niche area is well-timed.Overall, Integra has been consistently trading above the broader industry in the last six months. The stock has rallied 22.3% year to date, thus substantially outperforming the industry’s 13% gain during the period.Zacks Rank & Other Key PickIntegra currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Another top-ranked medical stock is IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. (IDXX  -  Free Report), also carrying the same bullish Zacks Rank of 2.

1967,JNJ,"Late last week, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) announced its decision to discontinue the development of a couple of candidates in its hepatitis C virus (“HCV”) program - MK-3682B (grazoprevir/ruzasvir/ uprifosbuvir) and MK-3682C (ruzasvir/uprifosbuvir). The company’s decision was based on a review of available phase II efficacy data and the growing competition in the HCV market. Merck itself has a marketed product in the HCV market in the form of Zepatier (elbasvir and grazoprevir) which brought in sales of $895 million in the first six months of 2017 (including a $40 million favorable adjustment to rebate accruals due to mix of business). While Merck will continue to work on expanding Zepatier’s utilization across the world, uptake will be impacted by the ongoing decline in overall patient volumes in many markets and increased competition.Gilead and AbbVie in HCV SpotlightMerck’s announcement has now put the spotlight firmly on Gilead Sciences (GILD  -  Free Report) and AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report), two key players in this market.Gilead is the undisputed leader in the HCV market with its HCV products bringing in sales of $5.4 billion in the first half of 2017. The company revolutionized the treatment paradigm in the HCV market with the introduction of Sovaldi by cutting down the duration of treatment to as few as 12 weeks instead of the prior standard of care of up to 48 weeks. Moreover, the need for peg-interferon injections, which come with several side effects, was reduced or eliminated completely.Gilead launched Harvoni next, the first once-daily single-tablet regimen for the treatment of the most prevalent HCV genotype in the United States. This was followed by the launch of Epclusa, the first all-oral, pan-genotypic, single-tablet regimen for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. This year, Gilead gained approval for yet another HCV treatment, Vosevi.Although Gilead ruled the HCV market for quite a few years, sales are declining given intense pricing pressure, growing competition, pricing scrutiny and a declining patient population. The approval of newer HCV products has resulted in a rapid increase in the number of patients who were treated and cured followed by a decline in the number of patients seeking care and being able to access HCV treatment. Gilead expects HCV net product sales in the range of $8.5 billion to $9.5 billion in 2017 (announced with Q2 results), representing quite a drop from last year’s HCV product sales of $14.8 billion.Meanwhile, AbbVie’s HCV products include Mavyret (glecaprevir/pibrentasivr), Viekira Pak (ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir tablets co-packaged with dasabuvir tablets) and Viekira XR (dasabuvir, ombitasvir, paritaprevir and ritonavir). While Mavyret was approved recently, Viekira sales were $488 million in the first half of 2017. Mavyret, the company’s next generation HCV offering, should be a meaningful contributor to sales from 2018.Other HCV drugs include Bristol-Myers Squibb Company’s (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza (daclastavir) and Janssen Therapeutics’s Olysio (simeprevir).We remind investors that Merck is not the only company to have taken the decision to halt the development of HCV candidates. Last month, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had announced its decision to terminate a collaboration agreement with Achillion Pharmaceuticals (ACHN  -  Free Report) for HCV.J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals said that it would be discontinuing the development of the investigational HCV treatment regimen JNJ-4178, a combination of three direct acting antivirals: AL-335, odalasvir and simeprevir.With both Merck and J&J dropping their investigational HCV treatments, Gilead and AbbVie should benefit from the lack of additional competition entering the market, at least in the near term. While the companies will continue to face challenges like declining patient volume and intense pricing pressure, the lack of additional entrants in the market should slow down the rate of decline in sales.Gilead has been working on expanding the HCV market by encouraging baby boomers to get tested. According to the company, there has been an 80% increase in HCV antibody screening by baby boomers since the start of this initiative. Increased testing has led to an increase in diagnosis with about 190,000 people being newly diagnosed with HCV in 2016, up 32% from 2015. This represents a significant opportunity for the existing players in the HCV market.Both Gilead and AbbVie are Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stocks - you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1968,JNJ,"Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) recently announced the receipt of FDA approval for the FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system in the United States.The approval is likely to widen this Illinois-based medical device major’s customer base in diabetes management. The company aims at making the product commercially available to 30 million people with diabetes in the United States by the end of 2017. This flagship product will be available at major retail pharmacies for end users on a prescription basis.Meanwhile, Abbott has been steadily progressing with the development of its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced the receipt of national reimbursement for FreeStyle Libre in the U.K., marking another milestone for the company. Notably, the FreeStyle Libre system is partially or fully covered in 17 countries, including France, Germany and Japan.Moreover, the company recently announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will drive growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which saw revenue growth of 18.7% in second-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally. We believe the latest FDA nod will boost the company’s performance in the domestic arena as well.We expect Freestyle Libre to contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the U.K., Japanese and Canadian developments, the French Health Ministry has approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to reach a value of $30.25 billion by 2021, at a CAGR of 5.93%. Given the bullish market sentiments, we believe the recent regulatory approvals for FreeStyle Libre have come at an opportune moment.However, the diabetes market is dominated by many well-established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one. In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation for the development of insulin delivery systems.Share Price PerformanceAbbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistently positive results. Over the last three months, Abbott’s share price has outperformed the broader industry. The stock has gained 10.1%, in contrast to the broader industry’s decline of 0.7%. The company has also outperformed the 3.6% gain of the S&P 500 market over the same time frame. Zacks Rank & Key PicksAbbott carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked medical stocks in the medical sector are Orthofix International N.V. (OFIX  -  Free Report) and Owens & Minor, Inc.(OMI  -  Free Report). Orthofix International and Owens & Minor sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

1969,JNJ,"Key highlights this week include a lawsuit filed by Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) accusing Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) of adopting exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices to prevent biosimilar uptake. Meanwhile, companies like GlaxoSmithKline (GSK  -  Free Report) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN  -  Free Report) were in the news for regulatory/pipeline updates.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesSupernus Down on Study Update: Supernus provided an update on the first phase III study on SPN-810 which is being evaluated for the treatment of impulsive aggression (“IA”) in patients aged 6 to 12 years who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“ADHD”). Based on a planned interim analysis, the company has decided to drop the lower dose of 18 mg from the study and patients will be randomized to receive either the 36 mg dose or placebo. Investors were disappointed by the update and shares were down 23.4% (Read more: Supernus Drops SPN-810's Lower Dose Test in Phase III Trials).  CHMP Positive on J&J Psoriasis Drug: J&J’s Tremfya (guselkumab) got a positive opinion in the EU with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) recommending marketing authorization for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy.Timely approval would make Tremfya the first biologic that selectively blocks interleukin (IL)-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. According to information in the press release, about 14 million people across Europe are estimated to suffer from psoriasis.Tremfya gained FDA approval earlier this year in July.Pfizer Files Suit against J&J for Biosimilars: Pfizer has filed a lawsuit against J&J in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania related to providing patient and physician access to lower cost biosimilars. According to the lawsuit, J&J has adopted exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices to deny access to and undermine the benefits of price competition in the biologics market. In order to maintain its monopoly in connection with Remicade (infliximab), J&J was accused in the lawsuit of inappropriately excluding biosimilar competitors. Pfizer had launched Inflectra, its biosimilar version of Remicade, in late 2016. Biosimilars, while available in the EU for many years, are a relatively recent entrant in the United States and are yet to have a significant impact on reference product sales (Read more: Pfizer Sues J&J, Accuses it of Preventing Inflectra Uptake).Glaxo/Innoviva COPD Treatment Gets FDA Nod: Glaxo and partner Innoviva got a boost with the FDA approval of their once-daily, single inhaler triple therapy, Trelegy Ellipta, for the treatment of appropriate patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”).A combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (“ICS”), a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (“LAMA”), and a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (“LABA”), Trelegy Ellipta will provide patients with a convenient dosing option and is expected to bring in blockbuster sales (Read more: Glaxo/Innoviva's Triple Combo Therapy Gets FDA Nod for COPD). Glaxo stock has gained 4.7% year to date, compared to the 16.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Teva Divests Women’s Health Business: Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report), which recently got a new Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), is taking steps to get its performance back on track. The company announced the sale of the remaining assets in its specialty global women’s health portfolio. The planned divestiture of this segment will bring in total proceeds of $2.48 billion which will be used by Teva to pay down debt. The decision to sell the women’s health business is part of Teva’s efforts to divest its non-core segments and focus on its key strategic areas. The company also announced amendments to its USD and JPY term loan and revolving credit facilities. Teva is currently going through tough times with the company being hit by generic pricing erosion. The company needs to work on paying down debt, divesting non-core businesses to increase focus on core areas and generate cash, delivering on the pipeline and getting the U.S. generics business back on track.Roche/AbbVie Cancer Drug Positive in Late-Stage Study: Roche (RHHBY  -  Free Report) and partner AbbVie are looking to expand the label of their cancer therapy, Venclexta/Venclyxto. Results from a late-stage study (MURANO) showed that Venclexta plus Rituxan met the primary endpoint of prolonged progression-free survival compared with Treanda (bendamustine) plus Rituxan in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (“CLL”). An independent data monitoring committee has recommended the unblinding of the study based on the positive results. Label expansion for this indication will expand the patient population for Venclexta significantly and boost its commercial potential (Read more: Roche Announces Positive Data on Leukemia Drug).Roche is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.

However, with Plivensia failing to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns, it’s quite likely that the agency will ask for additional information before granting approval.5 Trades Could Profit ""Big-League"" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1972,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Janssen, announced data from a pivotal phase III study, showing that its blood thinner Xarelto has significantly reduced major cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary and peripheral artery disease (CAD/PAD).The study is being currently conducted to expand Xarelto’s label (rivaroxaban, 2.5 mg twice-daily) in combination with aspirin (100 mg once daily) versus aspirin alone.Xarelto is presently marketed as an anticoagulant to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), not caused by a heart valve problem. It is also approved in the United States to treat deep vein thrombosis (VTE) and pulmonary embolism.Shares of J&J have outperformed the industry year to date. The stock increased 14.4% as against the industry’s 10.9% gain during the period.The randomized phase III COMPASS (n=27,395) study, a part of the ongoing EXPLORER clinical research program, met its primary endpoints. Data from the study demonstrated that the Xarelto/aspirin combination reduced the combined risk of cardiovascular death, stroke and heart attack by 24% in patients with stable CAD/PAD compared with the aspirin alone.The findings also showed a massive 42% decrease in any stroke and 22% fall in CV death. The trial was conducted at 602 centers in 33 countries. Also, PAD patients treated with the combination therapy had significantly fewer major adverse limb events compared with those taking aspirin alone. However, the risk of major bleeding was found to be significantly higher in patients receiving treatment by Xarelto/aspirin regimen.Currently, there are eight new indications seeking studies for Xarelto as part of the EXPLORER clinical development program.notably, Xarelto has been developed by J&J in partnership with Bayer AG (BAYRY  -  Free Report). The drug is launched in more than 80 countries and is marketed by Bayer outside the United States.Per the company’s press release, CAD is found to be developing among one-third to one-half of all middle-aged populace during their lifetime in developed countries. Per an estimate, approximately 20% of adults aged above 55 years have evidence of PAD. Therefore, approval of Xarelto for these additional indications will provide the company an access to a huge globally potential market.We remind investors that in June, J&J announced that the FDA has granted priority review to a sNDA of Xarelto for label expansion to include a 10 mg dose to reduce the risk of recurrent VTE.Xarelto is currently approved in a 20 mg dose formulation. Only last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) issued a positive opinion on a label update regarding the use of 15 mg once-daily dose of Xarelto in combination with a P2Y12 inhibitor for treatment of patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF), who require oral anticoagulation and undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent placement.

1974,JNJ,"Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.(PTLA  -  Free Report) recently announced that the FDA has accepted its resubmitted biologics license application (BLA) for the reversal agent for Factor Xa inhibitors, AndexXa (Andexanet Alfa). A decision from the U.S. regulatory body is expected on Feb 2, 2018.AndexXa has been developed for patients treated with a direct or indirect Factor Xa inhibitor, when reversal of anticoagulation is needed due to life-threatening or uncontrolled bleeding.Notably, AndexXa is also under review in the EU with marketing application filed in the third quarter of 2016.Portola’s shares have significantly outperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has soared 143.8% compared with the broader industry’s decrease of 1.9%.The resubmission includes additional information requested by the FDA in a complete response letter (CRL) issued to Portola in August last year. In the letter, the FDA had requested for information related to product manufacturing. It had also asked for more data to support the inclusion of direct Factor Xa inhibitor Lixiana (edoxaban) and indirect Factor Xa inhibitor Lovenox (enoxaparin) on the product label.We remind investors that the BLA was based on positive data from two phase III ANNEXA studies that evaluated the safety and efficacy of AndexXa in reversing the anticoagulant activity of the Factor Xa inhibitors, Xarelto (rivaroxaban) of Johnson and Johnson, Inc. (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Eliquis (apixaban) of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report), in older healthy volunteers. Significantly, AndexXa enjoys an Orphan Drug Status in the United States.Per the company’s press release, more than 90,000 U.S. patients treated with oral Factor Xa inhibitors in 2016 were admitted to hospital due to excessive bleeding. It has also been estimated that more than 150,000 patients taking the injectable Factor Xa inhibitor Lovenox in the United States could benefit from an antidote each year.With no currently approved antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors yet, there is a high unmet need for the same in the market.Going ahead, we expect investors’ focus to remain on further details of AndexXa’s regulatory aspect.Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The detailed analysis of the study will be presented at a future medical meeting.The company has already initiated the phase III portion of the SEAL study where 60mg of selinexor administered to patients until disease progression or intolerability will be compared to a placebo. The FDA-approved PFS is the primary endpoint of the study. Top-line data from this study will be available in 2019.Liposarcoma is a rare form of cancer, which occurs in the soft tissues of the body, especially fatty tissues.

1976,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) has filed a lawsuit in a U.S. district court alleging that Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) is resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra - Pfizer’s biosimilar version of J&J and Merck& Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Remicade. Pfizer’s biosimilar version is available at a Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC), which is 19% lower than J&J’s referenced product.Pfizer’s shares were up 1.6% on Wednesday while J&J’s shares were down 1.5%. However, Pfizer’s shares have underperformed the industry this year so far. The stock has returned 10.8% during this period, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 16.7% for the industry.Pfizer alleged in a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania that J&J has entered into “biosimilar-exclusion” contracts with U.S. insurers. These contracts encourage insurers not to cover Inflectra, thereby making it non easily-accessible to patients and protecting its referenced product. Pfizer also claimed that anticompetitive contracts were being offered to hospitals, which encouraged discounts on purchase of Remicade on the condition that they do not buy the biosimilar versions. Pfizer claims these unfair practices benefit sales of J&J’s referenced product, which is a key revenue generator for the latter.We remind investors that at the second quarter conference call held in August, Pfizer had said that Inflectra penetration in the United States has been slower than expected as it was experiencing access challenges among national commercial payers.On the other hand, J&J had said at its second quarter conference call held in July that the rate of penetration of Inflectramay be modest. The latest lawsuit suggests that J&J could be responsible for the slow sales of Inflectra.Please note that in April this year, Samsung Bioepis’ biosimilar version of Remicade also received FDA approval.Pfizer had launched Inflectra in the United States in November last year and the biosimilar is also marketed in ex-U.S. markets. Inflectra generated sales of $23 million in the United States and $94 million globally in second quarter.Biosimilars are essentially cheaper versions of expensive biologic drugs but are complex to make unlike traditional generic drugs. While biosimilars have been available in the EU for quite a while, there was no regulatory pathway for biosimilars in the United States for a long time. However, this changed with the passing of The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act) as part of the Affordable Care Act that President Obama signed into law in March 2010.Several pharma as well as biotech companies are involved in the development of biosimilars.The first biosimilar to gain approval in the United States was Sandoz’s Zarxio, a biosimilar version of Amgen Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) Neupogen. Zarxio was launched in the United States in September 2015. Inflectra was the second biosimilar to gain approval.Other approved biosimilars in the country. include Sandoz’s Erelzi, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Enbrel (etanercept) and Amgen’s Amjevita, a biosimilar version of Abbvie’s Humira. However, these have not been launched yet due to ongoing litigation.Earlier this month, FDA approved the first cancer biosimilar, Amgen and Allergan’s Mvasi, a biosimilar version of Roche’s blockbuster cancer drug, Avastin.Biosimilars were expected to reduce health care costs and provide a large number of patients with access to much needed biologic treatments. However, so far biosimilars have not seen much commercial success and are yet to make a significant dent in referenced product sales in the United States.The fight between these two drug giants is likely to aid efforts to lower drug prices through increased biosimilar availability.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This is in contrast to the first quarter when earnings rose 5.6% on revenue growth of 5.7%.While overall sentiment towards pharma and biotech stocks has improved significantly in 2017 with investors focusing more on fundamentals than on issues like drug pricing, it would make sense to avoid drug companies that are sell ranked stocks and do not look well-positioned ahead of 2Q earnings.

1978,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, announced that the FDA has approved its pipeline candidate guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The drug will be marketed by the trade name of Tremfya.The drug was approved under an accelerated process, following the filing of a priority voucher by J&J.J&J’s shares have gained 14.4% so far this year, significantly ahead of the 11.3% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified Large-Cap Pharma industry.Coming back to the latest news, the FDA approval was based on three studies – phase III VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE – evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23 human monoclonal antibody, administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from the VOYAGE 2 trial (n=992), announced earlier, had showed that significantly higher proportions of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab achieved high rates of skin clearance compared to those receiving placebo. Around 70% of the patients receiving guselkumab achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 2.4% on placebo.The VOYAGE 2 trial evaluated guselkumab versus AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira. The study demonstrated the statistically significant efficacy of guselkumab compared to Humira at week 16, which was maintained through 24 weeks of treatment. Almost 46.8% of the patients treated with Humira achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 70% for guselkumab.The NAVIGATE (n=871) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to guselkumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who were not achieving clear or almost clear skin with J&J’s other plaque psoriasis medicine Stelara. Data from the study showed that patients who switched to guselkumab showed significantly greater improvements in skin clearance compared with patients who continued to receive Stelara.Per the company’s press release, around 7.5 million Americans suffer from this disease in which an overproduction of skin cells can cause itching, pain, burning sensation and skin tightness. Hence, an approval of guselkumab has given the company access to a wide patient population in the U.S.Guselkumab is under review in the EU and Japan for the plaque psoriasis indication. A phase III head-to-head study of Tremfya against Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is ongoing. Meanwhile, a phase II trial evaluating guselkumab in moderate-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis is also ongoing.J&J had previously mentioned that Tremfya has blockbuster potential and could rake in sales of more than $1 billion. Other than Tremfya, J&J expects another key pipeline candidate, sirukumab for rheumatoid arthritis to also gain FDA approval this year. Sirukumab is also under review in the U.S. and EU.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1979,JNJ,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is in full swing. Corporate earnings have been reassuring so far this quarter and we expect the momentum to continue going ahead.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 members, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, have reported results, according to Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these 87 index members were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% improvement in revenues. The growth in revenues is impressive, ahead of the previous quarter’s growth of 4.4% and significantly higher than the 12-quarter average of 1.1%. The beat ratio was 71.3% for earnings and 70.1% for revenues. More than half of the 87 companies have beaten both EPS and revenue estimates.Per the report, total earnings of the S&P 500 companies in the third quarter are expected to grow 2.6% year over year on 5% higher revenues. Meanwhile, the broader Medical sector (includes drug, biotech as well as Medical Device companies) is expected to record year-over-year growth of 4.8% in revenues and 2.2% in earnings in Q3.Only two big names in the biotech/pharma sector have reported thus far — Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss-based Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report).

Earnings also improved 20.5% year over year, primarily on the back of higher revenues.Operational UpdateFor the quarter, total revenues grew 10% to $11.9 billion year over year, primarily driven by growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017 and expansions and new programs in many states in 2016 and 2017.This was partially offset by the moratorium of the Health Insurer Fee in 2017 and lower membership in the commercial business in California.

1981,JNJ,"The third-quarter reporting cycle is off to a positive start as evident from an accelerating revenue growth trend. Meanwhile, the proportion of positive surprises is above average this quarter. Also, the estimate revision trend for the next quarter has been mostly favorable as Q4 estimates have actually gone up in the past couple of weeks.As of Oct 20, 2017, 87 S&P 500 members, accounting for 24.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to the latest Earnings Preview.Total earnings of these 87 index members were up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 7.3% improvement in revenues.

J&J reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results and raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook. J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter, leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year.Here we have three biotech/pharma giants that are set to report third-quarter results on Oct 24. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73% last quarter.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.03 per share.

Investor focus will also be on Spinraza’s performance (Read More: Biogen Q3 Earnings: Will it Deliver a Beat Again?)Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)The Swiss pharma giant is expected to report before market opens.

The company has an Earnings ESP of -0.96% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.25 per share.New products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. However, the loss of exclusivity of some of the key drugs in Novartis’ portfolio is expected to continue to hurt the company’s top line. Investor focus at Novartis’s Q3 earnings call will be on updates related to its newly approved CAR T therapy Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

In a latest executive order, Trump aimed at scrapping a key component of Obamacare. The President said that he wanted to end subsidies to insurers that cost $7 billion this year and help millions of low-income Americans pay medical expenses. However, the uncertainty was reduced to some extent as news of the two political parties coming to a bipartisan deal started doing the rounds. Senators of both parties said they reached a deal to stabilize Obamacare for the short term and allow insurer subsidies. This in turn led to a rally in healthcare stocks.More Gains Ahead?Currently, VHT has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium Risk outlook. Moreover, the ETF has a weighted alpha of 22.6.

1983,JNJ,"On Oct 18, 2017, we issued an updated report on ImmunoGen, Inc. (IMGN  -  Free Report).ImmunoGen is a development-stage biotechnology company, focused on developing targeted cancer therapeutics, using its proprietary antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology.ImmunoGen has made significant progress with regard to its lead pipeline candidate, mirvetuximab soravtansine. The candidate is currently in a phase III study (FORWARD I) as a single-agent therapy for treating patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, whose tumors express high or medium levels of FR alpha. Additionally, they have received up to three prior treatment regimens. Successful development and subsequent approval will be a huge boost to the company as ovarian cancer market represents a huge potential.Notably, combination regimens with mirvetuximab soravtansine in ovarian cancer are in the phase Ib/II FORWARD II study. The trial consists of cohorts assessing mirvetuximab soravtansine in combination with Roche’s Avastin and Merck’s Keytruda. ImmunoGen reported initial data from the FORWARD II study in May, demonstrating the candidate to have potential to complement currently available therapies for the indication.Notably, mirvetuximab soravtansine enjoys an Orphan Drug status in both the United States and the EU for treatment of ovarian cancer.Although the platinum-resistant ovarian cancer market provides immense commercial potential, ImmunoGen is set to face intense competition upon approval from established products like Roche’s Avastin and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Doxil. Also, several companies are working on to introduce treatments to the market, targeting this disease.Apart from mirvetuximab soravtansine, ImmunoGen is working to develop a couple of other candidates, including IMGN779 and IMGN632. Notably, IMGN779 is being evaluated in a phase I study for treating acute myeloid leukemia with data expected later this year. On the other hand, the company plans to move IMGN632 into clinical development before the year-end to treat hematological malignancies including acute myeloma leukemia (AML).ImmunoGen has agreements with several big healthcare companies including Amgen Inc., Bayer, Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report), Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), Roche, Sanofi and Takeda. These contracts in turn allow other companies to use ImmunoGen’s ADC technology and provide it with funds in the form of license and milestone fees, royalties, clinical materials revenue and R&D (research and development) support fees.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1984,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) announced that the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has granted a positive opinion recommending approval of its pipeline candidate, guselkumab for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the EU.The drug was approved in the United States in July this year and is marketed by the trade name of Tremfya for the treatment of this immune system related skin disorder. A decision from the European Commission (EC) is expected later this year.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 16.7%, comparing favorably with a gain of 16.4% recorded by the industry it belongs to.The application in the EU was based on three studies – phase III VOYAGE 1, VOYAGE 2 and NAVIGATE – evaluating the efficacy and safety of guselkumab, an anti-IL-23 human monoclonal antibody, administered by subcutaneous injection for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis.Data from the VOYAGE 2 trial (n=992) showed that significantly higher proportion of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis treated with guselkumab achieved high rates of skin clearance compared to those receiving placebo. Around 70% of the patients receiving guselkumab achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 2.4% on placebo.The VOYAGE 2 trial evaluated guselkumab versus AbbVie, Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug, Humira. The study demonstrated the statistically significant efficacy of guselkumab compared to Humira at week 16, which was maintained through 24 weeks of treatment. Almost 46.8% of the patients treated with Humira achieved at least 90% clearer skin versus 70% for guselkumab.The NAVIGATE (n=871) study evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching to guselkumab in moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis patients who were not achieving clear or almost clear skin with J&J’s other plaque psoriasis medicine, Stelara. Data from the study showed that patients who switched to guselkumab showed significantly greater improvements in skin clearance compared with patients who continued to receive Stelara.Meanwhile, a phase III head-to-head study of Tremfya against Novartis AG’s (NVS  -  Free Report) Cosentyx for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis is ongoing. Also, a phase III study evaluating guselkumab in moderate-to-severely active psoriatic arthritis is also ongoing.J&J had previously mentioned that Tremfya has blockbuster potential and could rake in sales of more than $1 billion.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA better-ranked biotech stock is Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

1986,JNJ,"The S&P 500, America’s dominant equity market index, powered past 2,500 for the first time on Sep 15, as the bull market rages on. The rally has been largely driven by a rebound in technology shares and rising bank stocks. Upbeat corporate earnings and a stable economic growth also continued to buoy investors’ sentiments.The benchmark index is on a ‘breakout mode’ right now and even North Korea’s Kim Jong-un couldn’t stall the rally. Hurricane Irma, in the meantime, lost steam and investors chose to ignore, perhaps the largest ever Equifax data breach, and the earthquake in Mexico. Banking on such bullish trends, investing in sound stocks listed in the index will be judicious.The S&P 500 Pushes Past 2,500 The S&P 500 index that flaunts some of the biggest companies on the planet including Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) – began  the day on the back foot but crawled back to end the trading session up 0.2% or 4.61 points higher at a record 2,500.23. The $21-trillion stock index also capped its biggest weekly advance since January. For the week, the S&P 500 rose 1.6%.U.S. stocks have soared more in the past eight years than in any other post-World War II time of economic growth, as per the National Bureau of Economic Research. The S&P 500 surged 172% since bottoming in July 2009, when the economy was struck by the Great Recession. This means that if you had invested $10,000 in the benchmark index during the dark days, it would be worth around $27,000 today.In fact, the index’s biggest gains were from April 1991 to March 2001, when Internet-related stocks moved north. The index also performed exceptionally well since Donald Trump was elected as the President. The S&P 500 posted a whopping $2.04 trillion in market value since Trump’s election last November, said Howard Silverblatt, senior Index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.Tech & Bank Stocks Propel Markets HigherThis time around, a rebound in technology shares and rally in bank stocks helped the S&P 500 achieve the milestone. Chipmakers gained traction, thanks to NVIDIA Corporation’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) 6.3% jump to a record high after Evercore ISI raised its price target on the stock to $250 from $180. The broader technology sector was boosted by Apple. The iPhone maker’s shares increased around 1%, its first gain since unveiling new iPhones on Sep 12.U.S. consumer prices, in the meantime, rose 0.4% in August, its biggest one-month gain since January. This has pushed the year-over-year increase to 1.9% from 1.7% in July. Inflationary pressure firmed in August and brought an end to five successive months of soft data. With inflation gradually climbing to the Fed’s target level, expectations of a future rate hike strengthened. According to the CME Group, there is a 55% chance that the Fed will raise borrowing costs at its December meeting, up from 38% a week earlier.Bank stocks gained on higher chances of an interest rate hike this month. Higher longer-term interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Focus on Robust Fundamentals Investors also continue to focus on corporate earnings that are expected to increase every year through at least 2019, while the economy continues to expand at a steady pace.Healthy Corporate EarningsTotal Q3 earnings for the S&P 500 members are expected to increase 3.3% from the same period last year on 5% higher revenues.For this year, total earnings for the S&P 500 members are expected to increase 8.1% on 5% higher revenues, which would follow a paltry 0.7% earnings growth on 2.1% higher revenues last year (read more: Q3 Earnings Season Gets Underway).Solid Economic GrowthWhen it comes to economic growth, the U.S. GDP expanded 3% in the second quarter, the fastest rate of growth in more than two years. An uptick in consumer outlays and business investment gave the economy a boost. Increased spending on goods and services pushed consumer expenditure up 3.3% in the said quarter. Consumer spending – the biggest driver of an economy – picked up on higher income for consumers and low inflation.Additionally, the Empire State factory gauge hit 24.4 this month, while the new orders component of the report came in strong, as it reached its highest point since October 2009. The NFIB small business optimism index too remained healthy with a reading of 105.3.Political Ructions, Hurricane Fears SubsideInvestors have more or less programmed themselves to ignore the North Korea tensions. The rogue nation fired a missile over Japan for the second time this month. North Korea defied efforts from global nations to force it to abandon its course. South Korea immediately responded by conducting a simulated strike on an air base near Pyongyang. The White House, in the meanwhile, wants the United Nations to impose an oil embargo on North Korea and at the same time freeze Kim Jong-un’s assets in response to his regime’s sixth nuclear test last week.Wall Street also breathed a sigh of relief after hurricane Irma shifted its direction and eased fears of widespread devastation in Florida. Irma gradually lost strength once it made landfall on the Florida Keys on Sep 10 and was downgraded to a tropical storm.5 Top S&P 500 WinnersBanking on such positives, we have selected five solid S&P 500 stocks that have not only gained significantly on Sep 15 but also have the scope of gaining further traction.

1987,JNJ,"We issued an updated report on Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (CPRX  -  Free Report) on Aug 14.In fact, Catalyst Pharma is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapies targeting rare neurological diseases and disorders such as Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and Tourette syndrome.At present, this Coral Gables, FL-based company has two candidates under development – Firdapse and CPP-115.The company expects to report top-line results from its second phase III study of Firdapse for the treatment of Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) in the second half of 2017 and resubmit a new drug application (NDA) before the end of 2017. Earlier in 2016, it received a refusal to file letter from the FDA in connection with the NDA for Firdapse.Notably, the agency had determined that the company’s NDA was insufficient after a preliminary review. Consequently, Catalyst Pharma was required to conduct additional studies as per the agency’s requirements, in addition to the results of its previously submitted phase III data.In Oct 2016, it reached an agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) for the protocol design, clinical endpoints, and statistical analysis approach to be taken in its second phase III study evaluating Firdapse.Meanwhile, the company is working on developing Firdapse for additional indications. Catalyst initiated an investigator-sponsored phase II/III study on Firdapse for the symptomatic treatment of MuSK-antibody positive MG in Feb 2016.  In Mar 2017, the company reported top-line data from the phase II/III trial.The potential approval of Firdapse, along with its label expansion will help in generating revenues for the company.Additionally, Catalyst Pharma is exploring the possibility of developing CPP-115 (a GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) for the treatment of epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and the treatment of other selected neurological indications such as complex partial seizures and Tourette’s disorder.However, the market for epilepsy treatments is highly competitive and crowded given the presence of products like Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Neurontin and Lyrica, Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Topamax, Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) Trileptal.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1988,JNJ,"We issued an updated report on Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PCRX  -  Free Report) on Aug 11.In fact, shares of the company have rallied 12.7% against the Zacks classified industry’s fall 3.4% on a year-to-date basis.Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development, commercialization and manufacture of proprietary pharmaceutical products primarily for use in hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.Notably, the company’s flagship product, Exparel, was launched in 2012. This product is a liposome injection of bupivacaine, which is indicated for single-dose administration into the surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. In January 2017, Pacira inked a co-promotion agreement with DePuy Synthes Sales Inc. to market and promote the use of Exparel for orthopedic procedures in the U.S. market. We expect this collaboration to significantly expand use of Exparel across a broad range of surgical procedures.In fact, this Parsippany, NJ-based company’s efforts to expand Exparel's label to boost sales in oral surgery and chronic pain are encouraging.In September 2016, the company had launched Exparel to the oral surgeon community to treat pain following oral and maxillofacial procedures.Currently, it expects that a label expansion of this injection into oral surgery might benefit oral and maxillofacial surgeons, prosthodontists and endodontists by giving them the ability to produce analgesia with a single-dose administration during the days following surgery.Prior to this, in April 2016, the company had initiated a randomized controlled study on Exparel for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In March 2017, the company announced positive topline data from this study.Additionally, Pacira is conducting a phase IV study of Exparel in spinal fusion surgery with results expected in the fourth quarter of 2017. Also, it is launching a series of phase IV studies in soft tissue procedures. These studies will assess the company’s flagship product as part of its multimodal protocol for C-section, colon cancer and breast reconstruction surgery.Meanwhile, Pacira remains on track to resubmit its supplemental new drug application (sNDA), to the FDA later in 2017. This, in turn, will seek expansion of the Exparel label to include the indication of administration via nerve block. The sNDA will be based on two pivotal efficacy studies.Furthermore, the company announced positive top-line data from these studies in July 2017. The company believes that the data from these two studies will meet the requirements of the FDA as stated in the complete response letter (issued in March 2015).In January, Pacira signed an agreement with DePuy Synthes Sales Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) to market and promote the use of Exparelfor orthopedic procedures in the U.S. market.However, Pacira’s drug, DepoCyt(e)’s sales have been declining. The downturn was almost 59.4% in the first half of 2017 compared with the year-ago quarter. The company also announced that it will discontinue the production of DepoCyt(e) due to persistent technical issues specific to DepoCyt.Hence, it is heavily dependent on Exparel for growth, which accounts for a significant chunk of its revenues. Hence, a decline in Exparel sales will adversely impact the company's top line. Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Price and Consensus Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.56 million. Revenues comprised royalty and license fee revenues received under various non-imetelstat license agreements.Research and development (R&D) expenses declined 45.6% to $2.5 million due to lower costs for the proportionate share of clinical development costs for imetelstat.

It is being developed for the treatment of hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (MF) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Geron has a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) subsidiary Janssen for imetelstat.In Sep 2016, Janssen announced unfavorable findings from the planned internal reviews of initial data from the two studies of imetelstat,  IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of MF and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of MDS.However, in Apr 2017, Geron informed that Janssen has completed the second internal data review of the two studies and as a result of the review, both trials are continuing unmodifiedFor IMerge, Janssen said that the benefit/risk profile of imetelstat in the treated patients supports continued development in lower risk MDS indication. Geron mentioned that if Janssen decides to proceed to Part 2 of IMerge (a larger, 170 patient, phase III study), patient enrollment will begin in the fourth quarter of this year. Last month, Geron announced that Part 1 of IMerge will be expanded to enroll additional patients in a refined MDS population to confirm the clinical benefit and safety observed from the current result.For IMbark, the results suggested that the clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed supports continuation of the trial without modifications. Janssen is expected to evaluate maturing data from the IMbark study during next year, including an assessment of overall survival.Last month, Geron said it expects Janssen, upon examining overall survival, to make a continuation decision in the third quarter of 2018.Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Geron Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteStocks to ConsiderGeron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1990,JNJ,"It was a busy week for the FDA’s Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) which reviewed several experimental treatments this week including Novartis’ (NVS  -  Free Report) CAR-T cell drug. Meanwhile, French pharma giant Sanofi (SNY  -  Free Report) announced it will be acquiring a vaccines company.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesFDA Panel Supports Novartis Car-T Drug: Novartis got a huge boost with an FDA advisory panel voting unanimously in favor of the company’s experimental CAR-T cell therapy CTL019. Novartis is looking to get the treatment approved for pediatric, young adult relapsed or refractory (r/r) B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The positive vote is a major milestone for the company which could become the first to launch a CAR-T cell therapy if the FDA follows the advisory panel’s advice. CTL019 is currently under priority review in the U.S. -- with the advisory panel issuing a positive recommendation, we believe chances of gaining approval are high (Read more: Novartis CAR-T Therapy Drug Recommended by FDA Panel).So far in 2017, Novartis has outperformed the Zacks categorized Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry with shares gaining 13.3% while the industry is up 11.3%.FDA Nod for J&J Psoriasis Treatment: J&J’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Tremfya gained FDA approval for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. This makes the drug the first and only biologic approved that selectively blocks only IL-23, a cytokine that plays a key role in plaque psoriasis. Although the psoriasis market is pretty crowded, Tremfya demonstrated superior results in skin clearance compared with Humira in head-to-head analyses at weeks 16, 24 and 48.Tremfya is currently in a late-stage study for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis and a phase III program evaluating its efficacy compared with Cosentyx in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.Mar 2018 PDUFA Date for Pfizer’s Xeljanz Label Expansion: Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) sNDA for Xeljanz has been accepted for review by the FDA with a response expected in Mar 2018. Timely approval would make Xeljanz the first oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor to be available for people living with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC).Pfizer also got a favorable vote from the FDA’s advisory panel for its acute myeloid leukemia (AML) drug, Mylotarg, for newly-diagnosed patients. A final decision from the FDA should be out by Sep 2017. Mylotarg was initially approved in 2000 but was subsequently withdrawn from the market after a late-stage study failed to show a clinical benefit. Moreover, a higher rate of fatalities resulting from treatment-related toxicity was observed in the Mylotarg arm.Priority Review for Lilly’s Advanced Breast Cancer Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) got priority review from the FDA for its CDK 4 & 6 inhibitor abemaciclib. The company is looking to get abemaciclib approved as monotherapy and combination therapy (with fulvestrant) for patients with advanced breast cancer. Given the priority review status, Lilly should get a response from the FDA in the first quarter of 2018. Currently approved CDK 4/6 inhibitors include Pfizer’s Ibrance and Novartis’ Kisqali (Read more: Lilly's Breast Cancer Drug Gets Priority Review Status by FDA).Lilly also entered into a settlement agreement with generic players to settle patent infringement lawsuits related to the Cialis (tadalafil) unit dose patent. With the settlement agreement, the patent, which was previously set to expire on Apr 26, 2020, will now end on Sep 27, 2018. Cialis is approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) and the frustrating urinary symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Cialis sales were $2.5 billion in 2016.Lilly said that the Adcirca (tadalafil) patent will remain protected until Nov 21, 2017, or May 21, 2018, if pediatric exclusivity is granted. Adcirca is approved for pulmonary arterial hypertension (Read more: Lilly Settles Patent Litigation on Cialis with Generic Firms).Sanofi to Buy Vaccines Company for Up To $750M: Sanofi, which failed in its efforts to acquire Medivation and Actelion, announced that it will be acquiring Protein Sciences, a U.S.-based privately held vaccines biotech company, for up to $750 million. This includes an upfront payment of $650 million and up to $100 million on the achievement of certain milestones.  With this acquisition, Sanofi is looking to expand its flu portfolio with the addition of a non-egg based vaccine. Protein Sciences’ Flublok Quadrivalent Influenza Vaccine (QIV), which was approved by the FDA in Oct 2016, is the only recombinant protein-based flu vaccine approved by the agency. The acquisition is scheduled to close in the third quarter of 2017.  Sanofi is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Mylan’s Herceptin Biosimilar Gets Favorable Panel Vote: Mylan (MYL  -  Free Report) got a boost with its biosimilar version of Herceptin (trastuzumab) getting a favorable recommendation from an FDA advisory panel.

1991,JNJ,"Strengthening its focus on image-guided volumetric intensity modulated radiotherapy to cancer patients, Varian Medical Systems Inc. (VAR  -  Free Report) announced that it has initiated treatment with its latest Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system in Europe. Notably, treatment was provided to an 80-year-old male with head and neck cancer at Belgium-based University Hospitals Leuven (UZ Leuven) just two months after the hospital had ordered the new system.The Halcyon radiotherapy treatment system has been designed to offer cost-effective cancer care worldwide. The platform received both 510(k) clearance and CE Mark from the European directive, allowing Varian to start selling the system in the United States and Europe.

1992,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first large-cap pharma stock to report its earnings results for this season on Oct 17. J&J beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in the third quarter and also raised its 2017 sales and profit outlook. Shares of J&J were up more than 3% on Tuesday.J&J’s sales growth accelerated in the third quarter leading the company to post its first positive sales surprise after almost a year. Higher sales in the pharmaceutical segment as well as positive contribution from the Actelion deal pulled up the top line in the quarter. J&J acquired Swiss biotech Actelion in June this year for $30 billion.Overall, the pharma sector has witnessed a great turnaround this year after the drug pricing issue crippled its performance last year.After declining 5.2% last year, the Large Cap Pharma industry has risen 18.2% this year so far, outpacing 14.2% gain for the S&P 500 in the same time frame.New product sales ramp up with rising demand, successful innovation and product line expansion, strong clinical study results, more frequent FDA approvals (11 new drugs approved in Q3 alone) and continued strong performance of legacy products have played a pivotal role in bringing the sector on track this year.These factors are likely to drive the sector through the rest of this year and probably the next despite challenges like rising competition, pipeline setbacks, slowdown in growth of mature products and generic competition for certain key drugs.J&J’s better-than-expected results, especially the strong performance of its Pharmaceuticals segment, have raised optimism for another strong quarterly performance by the pharma sector, mainly the large-cap companies.Let’s have a closer look at what to expect from six big pharma stocks when they report this month/early next month. Five out of the six companies are expected to deliver earnings beat this quarter.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report)Pfizer is scheduled to announce third-quarter results on Oct 31 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of +1.04%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.New products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are expected to contribute to Pfizer’s top line meaningfully. However, the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq Vfend, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to be soft in the quarter due to biosimilar competition.Pfizer surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pfizer, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pfizer, Inc. QuoteBristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report)Bristol-Myers is scheduled to release results on Oct 26 before the market opens. Similar to Pfizer, our quantitative model indicates an earnings beat for Bristol-Myers. This Zacks Rank #3 stock has an Earnings ESP of +1.05%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bristol-Myers’ high-profile immuno-oncology drug, Opdivo, is likely to drive the company’s top line in the to-be-reported quarter. Opdivo’s U.S. sales are driven by the melanoma, second-line non-small-cell lung cancer and renal cell carcinoma indications.Recent label expansions into the classical Hodgkin lymphoma and head and neck cancer indications will also boost the drug’s sales.Bristol-Myers outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Price and EPS Surprise | Bristol-Myers Squibb Company QuoteMerck & Company, Inc. (MRK  -  Free Report)Merck is scheduled to release results on Oct 27 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.61%, the chances of the stock beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter is high.Merck’s new products like Keytruda (cancer), Zepatier (HCV) and Bridion (sugammadex) Injection will likely drive revenues this quarter as well. Keytruda sales in the United States are gaining, particularly from strong momentum in the new indication of first-line lung cancer. The Keytruda development program significantly advanced in the first half with regulatory approvals for four new indications in the United States and an additional indication in Europe. The new approvals expand the patient population and are expected to drive sales further.However, genericization and increasing competition will likely remain overhangs.Merck outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Merck & Company, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Merck & Company, Inc. QuoteGlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report)Brentford, UK-based GlaxoSmithKline is expected to report results on Oct 25. GlaxoSmithKline is also expected to outperform in the third quarter due to its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Earnings ESP of +1.80%.Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business segments are expected to perform well. Glaxo’s Pharmaceuticals segment is expected to continue being driven by strong sales of new HIV products, Tivicay and Triumeq.However, many of Glaxo’s key drugs like Lovaza and Avodart are facing declining sales due to generic competition. Moreover, sluggish sales growth in the Consumer Healthcare segment due to a slowdown in market conditions and the impact of divestures may negatively impact the top line in the third quarter.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise GlaxoSmithKline PLC Price and EPS Surprise | GlaxoSmithKline PLC QuoteEli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Eli Lillyis slated to announce third-quarter results on Oct 24 before the market opens. With a Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.07%, the chances of an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter is high.Continuing the trend of the past few quarters, new products like Trulicity, Cyramza, Taltz and Jardiance are likely to support the top line in the reported quarter.However, sluggish performance of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue in the third quarter due to the loss of exclusivity.Notably, Eli Lilly surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, as shown in the chart below:Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise Eli Lilly and Company Price and EPS Surprise | Eli Lilly and Company QuoteNovartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report)Swiss company, Novartis is scheduled to report its results on Oct 24, before market opens. Novartis is not expected to beat estimates in the third quarter due its Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -0.40%.The recent approval of Kymriah for acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a major boost for Novartis, given the potential in the CAR T therapy space. Moreover, new products like Cosentyx and Entresto are expected to boost the top line. Cosentyx has been strong and the company has grabbed market share from rivals like AbbVie’s Humira and Amgen’s Enbrel. Cosentyx achieved blockbuster status in 2016.However, a weak Alcon business and generic competition for several of its key drugs is expected to hurt revenues in this quarter.Notably, Novartis outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, as reflected in the chart below:Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise Novartis AG Price and EPS Surprise | Novartis AG QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1993,JNJ,"A fair share of the buoyancy in Wall Street this year can be attributed to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The blue-chip index has been continually hitting record highs, with the latest being the 23,000-mark touched on Oct 17. The index actually set out on an astounding rally since Trump’s win and crossed a “new 1,000-point threshold for the fourth time this year.”It topped 19,000 for the first time in its 120-year history on Nov 22, 2016. And apart from some occasional dips on Trump’s policy-related uncertainty, there was no looking back. This year itself, the index hit more than 20 record highs. As a result, SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) is up 15.3% this year (as of Oct 17, 2017).Instrumental StocksStocks that acted as tailwinds in the last six months were the likes of Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and McDonalds (MCD  -  Free Report).On Oct 17, 2017, International Business Machines Corp (IBM  -  Free Report), another major component of DIA, posted a beat on both lines. JNJ too beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and sales. UnitedHealth comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Its membership growth led to the outperformance. UNH and JNJ were up 5.5% and 3.4% on Oct 17 while IBM added more than 5% after hours.Trump’s Tax Reform Proposal  At the end of September, Trump revealed his much talked-about tax plan, suggesting comprehensive tax cuts for individuals and corporations. Some of the key suggestions are a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% and slashing of the number of individual tax brackets to three from seven.Goldman sees 2018 earnings for the S&P 500 companies to get a boost of 12% while Bank of America Merrill Lynch believes that the new rate would benefit earnings by about 11% in 2018. Quite expectedly, Dow Jones exhibited a nice stretch on hopes of tax reform (read: ETFs to Benefit from Trump Tax Plan).Upswing in the Manufacturing SectorDomestic factory activity jumped to a more than 13-year high in September thanks to higher new orders. An uptick in manufacturing numbers can act as a strong tailwind to Dow Jones Industrial Average’s forward growth, in our opinion. After all, Dow Jones-based ETF DIA invests about 20% weight, the highest allocation, in the industrial sector (read: 3 ETFs to Play Upbeat Global Manufacturing).Good News from Oil Patch Furthermore, it has been noticed lately that Dow Jones shares a deep relationship with oil price movement.Though energy sector rally spreads optimism over the broader market as a whole, in most cases, on a particular day of oil surge, the spurt in the Dow Jones is steeper than that of the S&P 500, or vice versa.In such a scenario, the American Petroleum Institute (API) recorded a steep drawdown of 7.130 million barrels in U.S. crude oil inventories, against the S&P Platts’ analyst survey that expected stockpiles to fall by 3.9 million barrels for the week ending Oct 13.ETFs That Were Benefited Other Than DIAInvestors should note that leveraged Dow ETF plays favored investors for obvious reasons. Two choices are ProShares Ultra Dow30 (DDM  -  Free Report) and ProShares UltraPro Dow30 (UDOW  -  Free Report).

1994,JNJ,"Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report), a well-known name in the multiple sclerosis (MS) market, surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017. The drugmaker also raised its revenue guidance for 2017 as sales of its newest drug Spinraza (spinal muscular atrophy) witnessed faster-than-expected adoption in the U.S.Shares of Biogen rose almost 5% in pre-market trading in response to the strong results. However, we note that Biogen’s shares have inched up 0.8% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with the industry’s increase of 12.7%.                                                                    Biogen reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $5.04, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.36 by 15.6%.

In the U.S., Tecfidera revenues benefited from seasonal recovery in both unit volumes and discounts as well as allowances.Second-quarter Tysabri revenues were flat year over year and the same decreased 9% sequentially to $496 million (U.S. $289.4 million, ex-U.S. $206.6 million).Note that Tysabri revenues in the first quarter of 2017 benefited by approximately $45 million in the ex-U.S. markets due to an agreement with the Price and Reimbursement Committee of the Italian National Medicines Agency (AIFA) related to Tysabri sales. This benefit was missing in the second quarter, leading to the sequential decline.Combined interferon revenues (Avonex and Plegridy) in the second quarter were $691 million (U.S. $501.7 million, ex-U.S. $188.9 million), down 5% from the year-ago period.

Plegridy contributed $133 million to second-quarter 2017 revenues, up 8% year over year and 19% sequentially.U.S. Interferon revenues are experiencing declining trends due to patients transitioning to other oral MS therapies as well as higher discounts and allowance.Zinbryta, launched in collaboration with AbbVie Inc.

It was also approved of in Japan and Canada recently.This quarter, Biogen recorded biosimilar revenues of $91 million compared with $66 million in first-quarter 2017.

Biogen also markets Flixabi, a biosimilar referencing Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade, which recorded revenues of $1.9 million in the reported quarter compared with $0.6 million in the first quarter.Revenues from Anti-CD20 therapeutic programs, which include Biogen’s shares of Rituxan and Gazyva operating profits, climbed 14% from the year-ago period to $397 million in the second quarter.R&D spend soared 68% in the reported quarter to $796 million, while SG&A spend decreased 12% year over year to $430 million. This quarter, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares worth $782 million under its $5.0 billion share repurchase program.2017 OutlookBiogen raised its earnings and revenue outlook for 2017.Biogen now expects earnings in the range of $20.80-$21.40 per share (old guidance: $20.45-$21.25 per share) for 2017.Revenues are now expected in a range of $11.5-$11.8 billion comapred with the earlier guidance of $11.1-$11.4 billion in 2017.

1996,JNJ,"Geron Corporation (GERN  -  Free Report) is expected to report second-quarter 2017 results next week.The company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.Geron’s shares outperformed the industry by rising 39.2% so far this year, while the industry witnessed a gain of 12.7%.Focus on Imetelstat Geron has no approved product in its portfolio and its top line solely comprises license fees and royalties. In such a scenario, investor focus will remain on the company’s sole pipeline candidate, Imetelstat. Geron, in collaboration with Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Janssen Biotech, is developing the candidate for treating patients with hematologic myeloid malignancies like myelofibrosis (MF), myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).In April, Geron provided a positive update on two late-stage studies for imetelstat – IMbark (phase II) for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF), and IMerge (phase II/III) for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Owing to the favourable update, both trials are continuing unmodified.Geron informed that Janssen has completed the second internal review of data from two studies, IMbark and IMerge, on imetelstat, Janssen said that the benefit/risk profile of imetelstat in the treated patients supports continued development in lower risk MDS indication.For IMbark, the latest clinical benefit and a potential overall survival benefit observed supports continuation of the trial without modifications. The trial that assesses the safety and efficacy of imetelstat treatment in relapsed or refractory MDS will also include an assessment of overall survival. Also, the data suggest that 9.4 mg/kg is an appropriate starting dose in the studyJanssen is expected to take a decision regarding the initiation of the phase III stage of the IMerge study later this year and a decision regarding the continued development of imetelstat for relapsed or refractory MF indication next year.We expect the company to provide an update on the path forward for imetelstat development program at the second quarter conference call,Surprise HistoryGeron’s performance over the last four quarters has been mixed, with the company surpassing expectations thrice and meeting the same once. The average positive surprise over the last four quarters is 27.98%.Geron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Geron Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Geron Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Geron is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at a loss of 5 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Although Geron’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, its 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a couple of health care stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARNA  -  Free Report) is expected to release results on Aug 14. The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.47% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1997,JNJ,"Benchmarks turned in mixed performances on Monday. This was largely due to the fact that bond yields increased, leading investors to exit in utilities and telecom stocks. Also, sales for Johnson& Johnson fell after the release of a new drug Renflexis by Merck and Co. This also weighed on the S&P 500 and Dow. On the other hand, Nasdaq ended in the green as the tech-rally continued ahead of major earnings for the sector slated for this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined 0.3% or 66.9 points, closing at 21,513.17. The S&P 500 Index (INX) fell 0.11%, sliding by 2.63 points to close at 2,469.91. This apart, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed 6,410.81, adding 23.05 points or 0.36%. A total of around 5.5 billion shares were traded on Monday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.1 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.27-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored advancers.Bond Yields Go Up, Utilities SufferThe yield on 10 year Treasury note increased to 2.26% and this had negative ramifications for safe havens such as utilities and telecom. A selloff in bonds was responsible for the surge in rates, leading investors to offload utilities and the telecom stocks in favor of their safer fixed income counterparts. As a result, this weighed on the S&P 500 Index.Johnson & Johnson Disappoints As Share Prices TankShares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) fell 1.5% to $133.21 on Monday.  This was largely due to the fact that Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) together with its South Korean partner Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd has started selling Renflexis, a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States.The drug would sell at an astounding 35% discount on the list price of Remicade. This move is touted to bring down the price of this widely sold medicine. The general trend in the prices of generic medicines show that once multiple biosimilars of a drug become accessible, prices drop rapidly due to stiff competition between rivals. Furthermore, this comes as the jolt to the healthcare heavyweight after Pfizer Inc launched Inflectra late last year at a 15 percent discount to J&J's list price and later dropped it to a 19% discount.Tech Stocks Show Stellar PerformancesNasdaq closed on a record high on Monday primarily due to splendid performances and broad-based gains by technology stocks. This comes just before the earnings release of FAANG stocks such as Amazon.com, Inc (AMZN  -  Free Report) and Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) which are due later this week. Over the year, Facebook, Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), Amazon., Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Alphabet Inc (GOOGL  -  Free Report) have gained between 25% to 34%. But the primary reason behind Nasdaq’s recent gains has been splendid performance from Netflix . Shares jumped 13.5% after it added over 5.2 million subscribers on July 17, 2017.Existing Home Sales StumbledThe existing home sales in the US have taken a hit due to an acute shortage of properties at a time when demand is high. Around 1.96 million houses were up for sale in market last month, skidding 7.1% from a year ago. The median house price has also increased 6.5% to $263,800 in a year’s time. Additionally, The National Association of Realtors announced on Monday that existing home sales dropped 1.8% to 5.52 million units last month.Stocks That Made HeadlinesCore Laboratories Q2 Earnings Top Estimates, Sales LagCore Laboratories N.V. (CLB  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted diluted earnings per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

1998,JNJ,"The second-quarter reporting cycle seems to have gotten off to a good start, with an abundance of positive surprises, particularly on the revenue front. Meanwhile, earnings and revenue growth also bettered expectations.As of Jul 21, 2017, 97 S&P 500 members, accounting for 28.1% of the index’s total market capitalization, reported results, according to  Earnings Preview.Total earnings for these 97 index members were up 8.4% from the year-ago quarter on a 5.1% improvement in revenues.

This follows 13.3% earnings growth in the first quarter on 7% increase in revenues, the highest in almost two years.Among the pharma bigwigs, only Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss company Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) have reported so far. J&J reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales.  This was the third consecutive sales miss for J&J due to a a slowdown in pharmaceutical product sales. However, J&J is optimistic that sales growth will accelerate in the second half of 2017. On the other hand, Novartis’ second-quarter results were encouraging as the company beat both earnings and sales estimates. However, Sandoz’s performance was disappointing due to pricing pressure.Here we have three pharma giants that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 25. Let's see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report)Lilly, which is scheduled to release earnings before the market opens, had delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.08% last quarter.

We expect the trend to continue in the second quarter of 2017 as well. However, a decline in the sales of Alimta, Cymbalta and Zyprexa are expected to continue due to the loss of exclusivity. (Read More: Is a Beat in the Cards for Eli Lilly in Q2 Earnings?).Our previous article showed that Lilly was likely to beat on earnings this quarter. However, estimates changed thereafter and we are not certain of a beat this earnings season.Biogen Inc.

1999,JNJ,"Illinois-based global medical device company Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) partnered with Bigfoot Biomedical to solidify its footprint in the rapidly growing diabetes therapeutics market.Leveraged on Abbott’s FreeStyle Libre glucose sensing technology, the collaboration will result in innovation and marketing of insulin delivery systems.The alliance will help the companies develop patient-friendly insulin delivery systems with no calibration glucose sensor. Per management, an important trial on the combined technological systems is projected to initiate in 2018 at clinical research sites across the U.S.Abbott has been moving steadily toward development in its diabetics segment. Recently, the company announced receipt of Health Canada License for FreeStyle Libre Flash Glucose Monitoring System. This will further stimulate growth in the Diabetes Care sales segment, which was up 20.2% in first-quarter 2017 on continued consumer acceptance of FreeStyle Libre internationally.We expect Freestyle Libre to further contribute to Abbott’s top line as along with the Canadian development, the French Health Ministry recently approved national reimbursement for the device.Per a report by Mordor Intelligence, the global market for diabetes care devices is projected to value $30.25 billion by 2021 witnessing a CAGR of 5.93%. Moreover, the insulin delivery devices market is expected to see a CAGR of 5.59% to roughly $14.22 billion in 2019.Thus, considering the market potential and Abbott’s current developments in the diabetes care segment, this collaboration seems to be a lucrative and strategically aligned one.We believe an ageing population, unhealthy lifestyle and rising awareness and expenditure in healthcare will continue to drive growth in the diabetes market. However, this market is dominated by many well established players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) being the most prominent one.  In this space, Johnson & Johnson also has a tie-up with U.S.-based Animas Corporation to successfully develop and innovate insulin delivery systems.Moreover, Abbott has been gaining investor confidence on consistent positive results.

2000,JNJ,"Good news is here, investing friends! Q3 earnings results are not only clear and present, but results are better than expected among most household name stocks ahead of the bell this morning. In a quarter rife with stresses from the nation’s capital, natural disasters both here and abroad, and other stock market headwinds, stronger-than-expected earnings are providing a good tonic for us this morning.Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) tore the cover off the ball, figuratively speaking. The Wall Street investment giant easily surpassed top and bottom-line estimates: $5.02 per share beat the $4.31 expected, and revenues of $8.3 billion topped the $7.6 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. This was also higher than the $8.2 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter. This marks the fourth quarter in the last five that Goldman Sachs has beaten earnings estimates, for a 4-quarter trailing average of 11.6%.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and revenues: the investment bank’s top line brought in $9.2 billion, versus the $9.0 billion expected, on earnings per share of 93 cents — easily outpacing the 81 cents anticipated. Investment banking revenues, in particular, grew 18.4% in the company’s Q3.Household products giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a solid dime to $1.90 per share, as top-line results also came in above expectations: $19.65 billion versus $19.28 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for fiscal 2017 was also raised. Pharma sales in the quarter grew an impressive 15.4%.For its fifth straight earnings beat (at least), United Healthcare (UNH  -  Free Report) also posted a positive surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: $2.66 per share bested the $2.57 expected. Revenues of $50.3 billion in the quarter rose 8.7% year over year on growth in medical enrollment.On the other side of the street, Harley Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) illustrated some of the difficulties in today’s market, just meeting the 40 cents per share expected in the Zacks consensus, down 40% from year-ago results. Sales of $962.1 million did top the $960.8 million expected, but these numbers are both down from the $1.1 billion reported in Q3 2016. Baby boomers buying fewer bikes looks to be the culprit here; in related news, Peter Fonda is 77 years old.New Import/Export NumbersSeptember results for both import and export prices beat expectations this morning, up 0.7% last month from the 0.6% consensus, as well as the unrevised headline from the previous month. Exports performed even better, up 0.8% as opposed to the +0.5% expected. Imports year over year are in-line at +1.9%, while exports are +2.7% since this time last year. More grist for the interest rate hike mill. You know the Fed is paying attention to this.

The Wall Street investment giant easily surpassed top and bottom-line estimates: $5.02 per share beat the $4.31 expected, and revenues of $8.3 billion topped the $7.6 billion in the Zacks consensus estimate. This was also higher than the $8.2 billion recorded in the year-ago quarter. This marks the fourth quarter in the last five that Goldman Sachs has beaten earnings estimates, for a 4-quarter trailing average of 11.6%.Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) also beat expectations for both earnings and revenues: the investment bank’s top line brought in $9.2 billion, versus the $9.0 billion expected, on earnings per share of 93 cents — easily outpacing the 81 cents anticipated. Investment banking revenues, in particular, grew 18.4% in the company’s Q3.Household products giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a solid dime to $1.90 per share, as top-line results also came in above expectations: $19.65 billion versus $19.28 billion in the Zacks consensus. Guidance for fiscal 2017 was also raised. Pharma sales in the quarter grew an impressive 15.4%.For its fifth straight earnings beat (at least), United Healthcare (UNH  -  Free Report) also posted a positive surprise ahead of today’s opening bell: $2.66 per share bested the $2.57 expected. Revenues of $50.3 billion in the quarter rose 8.7% year over year on growth in medical enrollment.On the other side of the street, Harley Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) illustrated some of the difficulties in today’s market, just meeting the 40 cents per share expected in the Zacks consensus, down 40% from year-ago results. Sales of $962.1 million did top the $960.8 million expected, but these numbers are both down from the $1.1 billion reported in Q3 2016. Baby boomers buying fewer bikes looks to be the culprit here; in related news, Peter Fonda is 77 years old.New Import/Export NumbersSeptember results for both import and export prices beat expectations this morning, up 0.7% last month from the 0.6% consensus, as well as the unrevised headline from the previous month. Exports performed even better, up 0.8% as opposed to the +0.5% expected. Imports year over year are in-line at +1.9%, while exports are +2.7% since this time last year.

2002,JNJ,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ACHN  -  Free Report) reported a loss of 16 cents per share in the second quarter of 2017, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In the year-ago quarter, the company had reported a loss of 14 cents per share.The company generated no revenues in the reported quarter as had been the case in the year-ago quarter.Shares of Achillion surged almost 28% in after-hours trading on Aug 8, as the company announced positive interim results on its most advanced factor D inhibitor pipeline candidate, ACH-4471. However, the stock has underperformed the industry year to date. The company’s shares lost 2.9% whereas the industry registered an increase of 8.7%.Research and development expenses increased nearly 29% from the year-ago period to $18.3 million due to increased clinical trial costs related to pipeline candidate, ACH-4471. The increase in expenses also included higher manufacturing costs related to ACH-5528 and cost related to ophthalmic factor D inhibitor compounds in development. However, the increase was partially offset by a decrease in cost related to manufacturing of ACH-4471.General and administrative expenses were up 4% to $5.4 million due to an increase in corporate legal fees and consulting fees, partially offset by a decrease in corporate taxes.Pipeline UpdateIn April, Achillion initiated patient dosing in a phase II study, evaluating its key pipeline candidate, a factor D inhibitor, ACH-4471 for the treatment of patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The company completed three months of dosing during the quarter and entered a long-term extension trial.The interim results from the study, announced together with the earnings release, showed clinically meaningful complement inhibition and a favorable tolerability profile for ACH-4471. The candidate has shown improvement in LDH, hemoglobin, fatigue score and other markers of response.Moreover, the company plans to initiate a phase II study later this year on ACH-4471 in patients with C3G, a rare renal disorder, which includes dense deposit disease (DDD) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN).Meanwhile, Achillion is planning to advance a number of next-generation factor D inhibitors in preclinical or clinical studies by 2017 end.Also, Achillion is evaluating a triple combination of simeprevir, odalasvir and AL-335 in a phase II OMEGA-1 study in patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 infection, with and without cirrhosis.

2003,JNJ,"The second-quarter 2017 earnings season is nearing its last leg and the picture so far appears to be quite encouraging.  After a few turbulent quarters, earnings for the second quarter of 2017 showed solid strength. As of Aug 4, approximately 420 S&P 500 companies or 86.1% of the index’s total market capitalization have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported are up 11.6% year over year on 5.6% higher revenues. Of these, 74.3% have topped earnings estimates while 68.3% have beat on revenue estimates resulting in a blended beat of 55.0%.Growth in the second quarter came on the back of strong contribution from the Finance, Technology and Energy sectors. The growth is expected to persist in the second half of 2017 as well. Even though the pace of growth has been sluggish, total Q2 earnings for the index are currently up 10% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, much better than the 7.9% earnings growth projected at the start of the quarter. Going forward, the estimate for Q3 growth is 4.3%, down from 6.3% projected at the start of July.How Did the Medical Sector Perform?The Medical sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum. So far 83.6% of the companies in the sector have reported results. Earnings are up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues resulting in a blended beat of 65.2%.  Among these, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales estimates.

2004,JNJ,"Total earnings for 83.3% of the total healthcare market capitalization are up 6% on revenue growth of 4.1%. Though earnings growth is weak compared with many other sectors, earnings and revenue beat ratios of 85% and 70%, respectively, are particularly encouraging. In fact, healthcare is the fourth sector that surprised investors the most on earnings, trailing aerospace, technology and materials.Among the most notable players, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first major drug company to report earnings on July 18, followed by Eli Lilly and Company (LLY  -  Free Report) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) on July 25 and July 27, respectively. Two other major U.S. drug companies – Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) – reported on July 28 and August 1, respectively. These industry primes posted solid results with earnings beat while a few lagged on the revenue front.Johnson and Johnson Earnings in FocusThe world's biggest maker of healthcare products continued its long streak of earnings beat but narrowly missed the top–line estimate. Earnings per share came in at $1.83, 4 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 5.2% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 1.9% year over year to $18.84 billion but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion.Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.12–$7.22 from $7.00–$7.15 and revenue guidance to $75.8–$76.1 billion from $75.4–$76.1 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was pegged at $7.10 for earnings per share and $75.71 billion for revenues at time of earnings release. JNJ has gained 0.9% to date since its earnings announcement (read: J&J Brightens Outlook: Healthcare ETFs in Focus).Pfizer Earnings in FocusThe U.S. drug giant beat on earnings but missed on revenues. Earnings per share of 67 cents came in couple of cents above the Zacks Consensus Estimate while revenues of $12.9 billion fell shy of our estimate of $13 billion. On an annual basis, earnings per share rose 5% and revenues declined 2%.For 2017, Pfizer expects revenues in the range of $52-$54 billion and raised the lower end of the earnings per share guidance to $2.54-$2.60 from $2.50–$2.60. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is correctly pegged at $52.79 billion for revenues and $2.56 for earnings per share. Shares of PFE are up 1.8% since the earnings announcement.Merck Earnings in FocusEarnings per share came in at $1.01, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 87 cents and improving 8.6% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues inched up 1% year over year to $9.93 billion and were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.79 billion.Merck raised its revenue guidance from $39.1–$40.3 billion to $39.4-$40.4 billion while reiterated earnings per share projection at $3.76–$3.88 for this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $40.32 billion for revenues and $3.86 for earnings per share. The stock has lost 0.3% following its earnings announcement.Bristol-Myers Earnings in FocusBristol-Myers reported earnings per share of 74 cents, a penny ahead of our estimate and increased 7% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 6% to $5.14 billion and edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.07 billion.The company raised its low end of earnings per share guidance to $2.90-$3.00 from $2.85-$3.00 for this year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of the earnings announcement was pegged at $2.94. Shares of BMY are down 0.9% to date since the earnings announcement (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Eli Lilly Earnings in FocusEarnings of $1.11 at Eli Lilly outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by seven cents and came in 29% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 8% to $5.82 billion and beat our estimate of $5.59 billion.Like other drug makers, Eli Lilly also raised its 2017 revenue and earnings guidance. It now expects revenues in the range of $22.0–$22.5 billion compared with the previous expectation of $21.8–$22.3 billion and earnings per share in the range of $4.10-$4.20 versus $4.05-$4.15 expected previously.

2005,JNJ,"This week, companies like Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Allergan (AGN  -  Free Report) and Teva (TEVA  -  Free Report) reported second quarter results. While Pfizer reported a mixed quarter, Allergan topped expectations. Teva, however, had a tough quarter. Meanwhile, Bristol-Myers (BMY  -  Free Report) announced immune-oncology (IO) focused deals including an acquisition.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at Q2 Earnings Results: Big companies like Pfizer, Allergan and Teva reported second quarter results this week. Pfizer surpassed earnings estimates but missed on revenues raising concerns about the company’s top-line growth prospects. While Prevnar and Enbrel sales declined during the quarter, Pfizer is facing two key loss of exclusivities (LOEs) in the U.S. -- Viagra later this year and Lyrica at the end of 2018 (Read more: Pfizer Surpasses Q2 Earnings Estimates, Misses Sales).Meanwhile, Allergan topped both earnings and sales estimates and raised its outlook as well (Read more: Allergan Q2 Earnings & Sales Top, Restasis Sales Down).Teva’s shares fell 24% on a dismal quarter with the company missing on earnings and sales reflecting the performance of the U.S. generics business and the continued deterioration in Venezuela. The generics business was hit by accelerated price erosion and lower volume mainly due to customer consolidation, higher competition, and delayed new product launches. Teva lowered its outlook for the year and slashed its dividend as well. The company also expects to exit 45 markets across the globe by year end and will be cutting its headcount by about 7,000 since the closing of the Actavis Generics business deal. Teva has lost 34.5% of its value year to date versus the 7.6% decline of its industry.J&J, AbbVie Drug Gets FDA Nod for cGVHD: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and AbbVie’s BTK inhibitor Imbruvica gained FDA approval for its first non-cancer indication -- chronic graft versus host disease (cGVHD) in adults after failure of one or more systemic lines of therapy. This makes Imbruvica the first and only approved treatment for this patient population. This marks the sixth indication for Imbruvica in the U.S. J&J stock has gained 15.8% year to date, outperforming the 10.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Bristol-Myers in Acquisition Deal Worth Up to $2.3B: Bristol-Myers announced that it will be acquiring IFM Therapeutics, a venture-backed biotech company working on treatments that modulate novel targets in the innate immune system to treat cancer, autoimmunity and inflammatory disorders.With this acquisition, Bristol-Myers will gain full rights to IFM’s preclinical STING (stimulator of interferon genes) and NLRP3 agonist programs that are focused on cancer. The STING agonist program includes a lead asset while the NLRP3 agonist program includes a potential first-in-class pipeline candidate.This acquisition, scheduled to close in the third quarter, will strengthen Bristol-Myers’ immune-oncology (IO) pipeline. The deal will see Bristol-Myers shelling out $300 million upfront while additional payments of up to $1.01 billion will be made for each of the first products from the two programs on the achievement of certain milestones.Additional milestone payments could be made for further products resulting from these programs.Bristol-Myers signed another IO focused deal this week -- the company signed a clinical collaboration agreement with Clovis Oncology under which its immunotherapy Opdivo will be evaluated in combination with Clovis’ PARP inhibitor Rubraca in mid- and late-stage studies for different types of tumors.Meanwhile, Opdivo’s label was expanded in the U.S. this week for the treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that has progressed following treatment with a fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan. Accelerated approval was granted on the basis of overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response.However, we note that Merck’s Keytruda gained approval earlier this year for patients with MSI-H or dMMR in a wider patient population -- Merck’s label includes patients with solid tumors that have progressed following prior treatment and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options as well as colorectal cancer patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with certain chemotherapy drugs.J&J RA Drug Fails to Get FDA Advisory Panel Support: J&J’s investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor, failed to get the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee on safety concerns. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. Although the FDA is not required to do so, it usually follows the advice of its advisory panels. Considering the safety concerns raised by the panel, the agency could well ask for additional information before granting approval.Pfizer Drug Gets Advisory Panel Support: Pfizer’s supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz (5 mg twice daily) and Xeljanz XR (11 mg once daily), for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA), got the support of the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee. The advisory panel voted 10 to 1 in favor of approving the proposed dose of Xeljanz for the PsA indication. A decision from the FDA should be out by Dec 2017. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $587 million in the first half of 2017.Priority Review for AstraZeneca BTK Inhibitor: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) investigational BTK inhibitor, acalabrutinib, was granted priority review by the FDA. The company is looking to get the drug approved for use in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least one prior therapy. A response from the agency is expected in the first quarter of 2018. Acalabrutinib was also given Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for this indication.AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi also got BTD this week for the treatment of patients with locally-advanced, unresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has not progressed following platinum-based chemoradiation therapy.Positive Data on Lilly Migraine Drug: Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) presented late-stage data on its investigational migraine drug, lasmiditan, saying that it met the primary endpoint as well as key secondary endpoints. The results were consistent with results presented from an earlier late-stage study. Lilly expects to file for FDA approval in the second half of 2018.Lilly is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

2006,JNJ,"Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (PCRX  -  Free Report) incurred second-quarter 2017 loss of 29 cents per share (including the impact of stock-based compensation), wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate loss of 28 cents and the year-ago loss of 2 cents. Higher costs and soft revenues hurt earnings in the quarter.Revenues rose 1.9% year over year to $70.9 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $74 million. Revenues were below estimates as higher Exparel revenues were offset by lower other product and collaboration revenues. However, the company remains encouraged by the progress of its Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) partnership to co-promote Exparel (entered into in Jan 2017), with their sales and medical education teams actively supporting Exparel in the orthopedic space.Pacira’s share price has increased 18.8% year to date, compared with the Zacks classified industry’s gain of 1.7%.Quarter in DetailPacira’s top line comprises product revenues, collaborative licensing and milestone revenues, and royalty revenues. Exparel, generated revenues of $69.8 million, up 6.1% year over year, but DepoCyt(e) and other product revenues came in at $0.4 million, down 81.1%.Collaborative licensing and milestone revenues were down 90.4% to $0.1 million. Royalty revenues were $0.7 million, up 11.4%.Research and development (R&D) expenses ((including the impact of stock-based compensation)were up 101.4% to $18.9 million, while selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 9.4% to $39.6 million.Recent DevelopmentsThe company remains on track to resubmit its supplemental new drug application, (sNDA), to the FDA later in 2017, seeking expansion of the EXPAREL label to include the indication of  administration via nerve block.The sNDA will be based on two pivotal efficacy studies. The company believes that the data from these two studies will meet the requirements of the FDA as stated in the complete response letter (issued in Mar 2015).Pacira is also evaluation Exparel for the treatment of total knee arthroplasty (TKA).

Also, the company will be entitled to sales-based milestone payments of up to $211 million from Sep 1, 2017 to Nov 30, 2019. However, under the new agreement, AGI will not pay any royalties to AstraZeneca, which was a condition in the older agreement.Notably, the new deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017.So far this year, AstraZeneca’s shares have gained 19.5%, comparing favorably with the industry’s growth of 16%.AstraZeneca has been regularly divesting non-core assets or marketing rights to some treatments so that it can focus its resources on three main therapy areas including oncology and respiratory.In June 2017, the company sold the global rights of migraine treatment drug Zomig outside Japan to Grünenthal, a German pharmaceutical company.In March, it sold the U.S. commercialization rights to its inhaled respiratory medicines — Tudorza and Duaklir — for COPD to Circassia Pharmaceuticals.

2008,JNJ,"AbbVie Inc. (ABBV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 earnings, before the opening bell on Jul 28.AbbVie’s shares have rallied 18.2% so far this year, while the industry has recorded an increase of 13.2%.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive surprise of 1.59%. We note that AbbVie’s earnings history is a mixed bag as the pharmaceuticals company delivered positive surprises in the two of the last four quarters but recorded in-line earnings in the other two. The average earnings beat for the last four quarters is 1.65%.AbbVie Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAbbVie Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AbbVie Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for the company this quarter.Factors to ConsiderAt the first-quarter 2017 conference call, management revealed that it expects second-quarter 2017 earnings in the range of $1.39–$1.41 per share. Revenues are expected to grow between 7% and 8% on a reported basis. Currency headwinds are expected to hurt revenues by 1%.The company’s key drug, Humira, is likely to remain the main growth driver in the second quarter. Increasing awareness, favorable clinical data, additional indications and expansion into new markets are expected to help the product continue making significant contributions to the top line. This quarter, AbbVie also expects Humira sales growth in the U.S. in the mid-to-high teens range while internationally, Humira sales are expected to rise in a mid-single-digit range on an operational basis.Though Humira is doing well, the company is concerned about the product’s long-term prospects owing to the potential biosimilar competition.Another area of focus is the performance of Imbruvica, added to AbbVie’s portfolio following its May 2015 acquisition of Pharmacyclics. The drug recorded strong sales since past few quarters, a trend that we expect to continue. Imbruvica has multi-billion dollar potential and the company is looking to expand the drug’s label for solid tumors and autoimmune diseases.The company expects the Imbruvica sales growth in the U.S. to approach 35% in the second quarter.Although Imbruvica has huge commercial potential, investors should know that revenues from it will be shared with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which has a collaboration agreement with Pharmacyclics.Other drugs like Duopa and Creon are also expected to continue to perform well in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.However, Abbvie’s Hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, Viekira, will continue to be adversely impacted by an intense pricing and competitive pressure in the HCV market.Notably, last month, the company announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) recommended a marketing approval of its investigational, hepatitis C virus (HCV) combo regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P). The candidate will be marketed by the trade name of Maviret.A decision from the European Commission is expected in the third quarter of 2017. An approval will definitely provide the company with a stronger presence against the competitive dynamics in the HCV market.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that AbbVie is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for AbbVie is -0.71% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.39 per share and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stands higher at $1.40. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Though AbbVie’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of the ESP, its -0.71% Earnings ESP makes the surprise prediction difficult.We caution against the Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some better-ranked health care stocks that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release its results on Aug 9. The company has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Pfizer Inc.

2009,JNJ,"Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 67 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents by 3.1%. Earnings also rose 5% year over year.On the other hand, revenues missed expectations. The pharma heavyweight delivered revenues of $12.90 billion, which fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.02 billion. Again, revenues declined 2% from the year-ago period due to currency headwinds and divestiture of Hospira infusion systems business. In Feb 2017, Pfizer divested its Hospira infusion systems (HIS) business to ICU Medical.Sales in DetailCurrency movement impacted Pfizer’s second-quarter revenues by 2% ($202 million). Sales growth was flat on an operational basis. Excluding HIS revenues, sales rose 2% on an operational basis.Lower sales of Enbrel and the Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise and loss of exclusivity for some products  offset strong performance of key products like Ibrance (breast cancer), Xtandi (prostate cancer) and Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis).International revenues declined 3% (flat on an operational basis) to $6.55 billion. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues were flat at $6.34 billion.Segment DiscussionFrom the second quarter of 2016, Pfizer reorganized its reporting segments to Pfizer Innovative Health (IH) and Pfizer Essential Health (EH).Pfizer IH sales grew 8% (up 9% operationally) from the year-ago period to $7.67 billion.Pfizer IH revenues were driven by persistently strong momentum of Ibrance and Eliquis globally and growth of Lyrica and Xeljanz primarily in the U.S.While Ibrance revenues rose 66% to $853 million in the quarter, Xeljanz rose 55% to $336 million. Lyrica sales rose 5% to $1.10 billion. Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales rose 50% to $605 million.Revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, also propelled U.S. revenues. Xtandi recorded alliance revenues of $141 million in the quarter compared with $131 million in the first quarter.This was partially offset by continued decline in revenues from Prevnar 13 in U.S. and lower revenues of Enbrel and Viagra.Enbrel revenues declined 20% to $617 million in key European markets due to biosimilar competition. Pfizer has exclusive rights to Amgen, Inc.’s (AMGN  -  Free Report) blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis(RA) drug, Enbrel, outside the U.S. and Canada. Viagra sales declined 15% to $255 million due to lower sales in the U.S. and international markets due on reduced demand.Global Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 revenues declined 8% to $1.15 billion. Prevnar 13 revenues tanked 16% in the U.S. due to “high initial capture rate” of the eligible adult patient population following its successful 2014 launch. This resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity in the second quarter compared with the year-ago quarter. Unfavorable timing of government purchases for the pediatric indication also hurt U.S. sales.Eucrisa (crisaborole) topical ointment for the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema), which was bought as part of the Jun 2016 Anacor acquisition, was launched in the U.S. in first quarter of 2017. The ointment recorded sales of $9 million in the second quarter.While Consumer Healthcare revenues rose 1% to $846 million, Global Oncology revenues surged 44% to $1.59 billion driven by Ibrance. Global Vaccine revenues declined 7% to $1.27 billion. While Internal Medicine rose 10% to $2.41 billion, the Inflammation & Immunology franchise declined 1% to $992 million. Additionally, the portfolio of Rare Disease declined 8% to $562 million.Pfizer EH segment sales recorded a decline of 14% (down 12% operationally) to $5.23 billion. Excluding HIS revenues, EH sales declined 7%.EH revenues were hurt by the loss of exclusivity and associated generic competition for products like Pristiq (generic versions launched in the U.S. in Mar 2017), Vfend, Zyvox, Celebrex, Lyrica; lower revenues from legacy Hospira products and divesture of HIS. However, in the EH business, biosimilars did well in the quarter.Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Merck & Co., Inc.’s (MRK  -  Free Report) blockbuster RA drug Remicade, in November last year. While Inflectra recorded sales of $23 million in the U.S. and $94 million globally, all other biosimilars brought in sales of $27 million (down 18%) from outside the U.S. markets.Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI&A) expenses were flat (operationally) in the quarter at $3.39 billion. Adjusted R&D expenses rose 2% to $1.77 billion.2017 Guidance UpdatedWhile Pfizer raised the lower end of its adjusted earnings guidance, it retained the revenue expectations for the year. Revenues are expected in the range of $52 billion to $54 billion.Adjusted earnings per share are expected in the range of $2.54 - $2.60 compared with $2.50–$2.60 expected previously. Higher than previously anticipated royalty income from certain products and lower interest cost led to the increase in the lower end of the profit outlook.At the mid-point, revenues are expected to be slightly above 2016 level, while adjusted EPS is expected to increase 7% (previously 6%).Research and development expenses are still expected in the range of $7.5–$8.0 billion, while SI&A spending is projected in the range of $13.7–$14.7 billion.Key Drugs ApprovalsImportantly, key pipeline candidate Bavencio/avelumab received accelerated FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. The candidate is being studied for different types of cancers including several combination therapies with other immuno-oncology agents.Another pipeline candidate, Besponsa (inotuzumab ozogamicin) was approved in the EU in June as a monotherapy for relapsed or refractory CD22-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The candidate is under review in the U.S. with a FDA decision expected later this month.Our TakePfizer’s second-quarter results were mixed as it beat earnings estimates but missed the same on sales. Shares declined slightly in pre-market trading as the company continues to struggle with its sales performance. Pfizer’s shares are up 2.1% so far this year, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 10.7% for the industry.Pfizer continues to face headwinds in the form of genericization of key drugs, lost alliance revenues, pricing pressure and rising competition, which are hurting the top line. Products like Viagra, Lyrica and Chantix will lose exclusivity in a couple of years. Nonetheless, we believe that new products like Ibrance, contribution from acquisitions, cost-cutting efforts and share buybacks should help the company achieve its guidance. Pfizer also boasts a strong pipeline and expects approximately 25 to 30 drug approvals over the next five years, including around 15 products that have blockbuster potential. Bavencio is being considered a key long-term growth driver for Pfizer.Pfizer carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2010,JNJ,"The FDA, which approved 22 treatments last year, has given its approval to 26 drugs so far in 2017 including 3 in July. Key approvals this year include Gilead’s Vosevi (hepatitis C virus), Puma’s Nerlynx (to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning), J&J’s Tremfya (moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis), Regeneron/Sanofi’s Kevzara (rheumatoid arthritis), Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment, Ocrevus, Regeneron and Sanofi’s eczema treatment, Dupixent, Tesaro’s PARP inhibitor, Zejula, and BioMarin’s Brineura (treatment of a specific form of Batten disease) among others. Some of these drugs have blockbuster potential.With the drug development process being lengthy and time-consuming and requiring the utilization of a lot of funds and resources, key pipeline events including data readouts and regulatory updates are of paramount importance and could act as major catalysts. Here is a look at a few important regulatory events scheduled for the month of August.Another New Indication for Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo?Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY  -  Free Report) is looking to get the label of its PD-1 inhibitor expanded for use in patients with mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) after prior fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based chemotherapy. The regulatory application is currently under priority review with a response expected on Aug 2, 2017. Opidivo is currently approved for a wide range of indications and brought in sales of $2.3 billion in the first half of 2017. Bristol-Myers has lost 2.6% of its value year to date (YTD) versus the 10.5% growth of its industry.Will J&J RA Drug Win Support of FDA Panel?The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting tomorrow to discuss the BLA for Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) investigational rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment, Plivensia (sirukumab), an IL-6 inhibitor. The company is looking to get Plivensia approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderately to severely active RA who have had an inadequate response or are intolerant to one or more disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). RA is a common, chronic, life-long, autoimmune disease that affects about 1.3 million people in the U.S. While new treatment options have entered the market over the last couple of decades, RA patients are still not adequately managed with many left with fewer therapeutic options due to loss of response to available agents, and poor compliance due to inconvenient dosing.Earlier this week, the FDA had released briefing documents for the meeting which indicate a lot of emphasis will be placed on the safety profile of the drug especially the imbalance in all cause death between Plivensia and placebo. If approved, Plivensia would enter a pretty crowded market given the presence of drugs like Humira, Actemra and Kevzara among others, though its once-monthly dosing schedule could give it an advantage. Shares of J&J have gained 15.2% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Will FDA Follow in EU’s Path and Give the Green Signal to AbbVie’s Maviret?AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) also has an important regulatory event coming up with the FDA expected to respond on the approval status of the company’s latest hepatitis C virus (HCV) offering this month. Maviret, an investigational, pan-genotypic regimen of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P), is a once-daily ribavirin-free treatment that has the potential to provide a faster path to virologic cure for all major HCV genotypes (GT1-6). Maviret represents blockbuster potential and could help AbbVie gain major market share once approved and launched. We note that Maviret gained EU approval just last week. Shares of AbbVie have gained 11.6% YTD, outperforming the industry’s rally.Third Time Lucky for Dynavax’s Heplisav-B?It’s been a great week for clinical-stage immunology company Dynavax Technologies Corp. (DVAX  -  Free Report) which got a favorable recommendation (12-1) from the FDA’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) for Heplisav-B, a vaccine for immunization against hepatitis B infection in adults. With the positive vote, will it be third time lucky for the company which has previously received two complete response letters for Heplisav-B (one in Nov 2016 and the other in Feb 2013) from the FDA? A decision from the agency is expected on Aug 10. If approved, Dynavax plans to launch the vaccine early next year. Dynavax’s shares shot up 71.4% on the positive panel vote and are up a whopping 301.3% YTD, significantly outperforming the industry’s10.5% rally.Pfizer’s Xeljanz to Be Reviewed by FDA Advisory PanelPfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) has two regulatory events this month -- the first is an FDA advisory panel meeting and the other a PDUFA date. The FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee will be meeting on Aug 3 to discuss supplemental new drug applications (sNDAs) submitted by the company for its JAK inhibitor, Xeljanz and Xeljanz XR, for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis. Efficacy and safety data and benefit-risk considerations will be discussed by the panel. Xeljanz, currently approved for RA, brought in sales of $927 million in 2016.Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to give a response regarding the approval status of Pfizer’s Besponsa which recently gained approval in the EU. If approved in the U.S., Besponsa will provide a new treatment option for adult patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), an aggressive type of blood cancer with poor prognosis in adults. According to information provided by Pfizer, the 5-year overall survival rate for patients with relapsed or refractory adult ALL is less than 10%. Pfizer stock has gained 2.1% YTD, lagging the industry it belongs to. Pfizer is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock -- you can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some other FDA decisions scheduled for this month include a response regarding Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AGIO  -  Free Report) and partner Celgene’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Idhifa (under priority review for relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with an IDH2 mutation) on Aug 30. Meanwhile, the FDA is expected to decide on the approval status of Valeant’s eye drug, Vesneo (latanoprostene bunod) and Adamas’ ADS-5102 (treatment of levodopa-induced dyskinesia in people with Parkinson's disease) on Aug 24.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

2011,JNJ,"The Dow continued to trade within a tight band during a week dominated by earnings. Investors refrained from posting big bets on Monday, leading to the index ending mostly unchanged. Earnings results guided the Dow’s fortunes over the next two trading days of the week. However, it was a deal between two retailing majors which led to losses for a key component, and hence for the index itself on Thursday.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow closed at a record high for the third time in a row last Friday. The 30-stock index registered its 25th record close for this year, increasing by 0.4% as tech stocks gained. JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) and Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) all posted better-than-expected earnings results.But shares of these banking-behemoths fell after reporting decline in trading sales. Investors also digested a couple of poor economic reports on retail sales and inflation, which led market participants to believe that the Federal Reserve may turn dovish.The index gained 1% last week even as all major benchmarks posted solid gains. The indexes overcame a series of bottlenecks from tech overvaluation fears to Russia’s involvement in the U.S. election to climb back into record territory.The Dow This WeekThe index declined a meager 0.04% on Monday as investors refrained from placing big bets ahead of a busy earnings week. Investors geared up for key quarterly earnings results of major players that were slated for release during this week.The index declined 0.3% on Tuesday weighed down by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report). Shares of the banking behemoth slipped after reporting a staggering 40% drop in second-quarter bond trading revenue. Meanwhile, shares of Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) hit a record high following larger than expected subscriber additions in the second quarter. Netflix’s gains helped other benchmarks close in the green.The Dow gained 0.3% on Wednesday. Benchmarks closed at record highs on Wednesday boosted partly by broad-based gains in technology shares. Meanwhile, IBM Corp’s (IBM  -  Free Report) disappointing quarterly results limited the Dow’s advance. Nevertheless, the blue-chip index still managed to finish at a record high.The deal between Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) weighed on home improvement retailers on Thursday. This in turn dragged the Dow 0.1% lower after Home Depot Inc (HD  -  Free Report) lost 4.1%. However, shares of Microsoft Corp. (MSFT  -  Free Report) gained momentum on expectations of better-than-expected quarterly results, banking on strong cloud performance and tax benefits.Components Moving the Index American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.47 beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. However, earnings witnessed a sharp 30% year-over-year decline. The stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-than-expected results were mainly backed by a lower tax rate and the effect of share buyback. However, when comparing year-over-year, the bottom line suffered as the year-ago earnings reflected the $1.1 billion gain recorded from the sale of the Costco Wholesale Corp. COST co-brand portfolio.The company reaffirmed its earlier EPS guidance of $5.60–$5.80 for 2017. Revenues came in at $8.3 billion, slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.2 billion and up 1% year over year.

However, revenues outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.57 billion.Results were primarily driven by higher equities revenues and low expenses. However, lower fixed income revenues were a headwind. Notably, the quarter witnessed challenging market-making environment, reduced levels of volatility and low client activity levels.

2014,JNJ,"Janssen, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), announced that the FDA has approved the label expansion of its plaque psoriasis drug, Stelara for use in adolescents (12 years of age or older). The drug is approved for adults in this indication since 2009.The company believes that the label expansion is a significant achievement as plaque psoriasis develops before the age of 20 years in approximately one-third of the patients. Moreover, the number of treatments available for adolescents is limited.Patients are administered only four doses a year after two starter doses of Stelara, which has become a leading therapeutic option.Shares of the company are up 18.4% so far this year, almost in line with the industry’s performance. The industry has gained 18.3% in the same time frame.The latest approval for Stelara is based on data from a phase III study, which evaluated the subcutaneous administration of the drug in adolescent patients. The data showed that the drug achieved minimal psoriasis or clear skin in at least two-thirds of the patients. The safety data was also consistent with what was achieved in adult patients.There are almost 7.5 million people suffering from psoriasis in the United States per the American Academy of Dermatology. Moreover, the National Center for Biotechnology Information stated that the majority of psoriasis patients suffer from plaque psoriasis. The numbers represent a huge opportunity for the drug following its label expansion..Moreover, with this approval Stelara has gained an edge over competing drugs like AbbVie Inc.’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Humira, Novartis AG’s Cosentyx and Celgene Corporation’s (CELG  -  Free Report) Otezla, which are only approved for adult plaque psoriasis patients. However, Pfizer Inc.’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Enbrel will compete with Stelara in the adolescent segment.Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus  Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus | Johnson & Johnson QuoteJohnson & Johnson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2015,JNJ,"A few months down the line, the Republicans will complete a full year in power. Unfortunately, since the political power change, the healthcare community hasn’t had many opportunities to rejoice.A survey report by Gallup Analytics last month revealed that  U.S. adults cited healthcare as the second major problem faced by the country under the new presidential administration. In fact, the debate over repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare has been raging for a while now. Per the report, it peaked when it reached the Congress in August. Considering the prevailing uncertainty in the implementation of the health policy, any respite from it in the near term seems unlikely.MedTech in the United States: A Blurred PictureNeedless to say, the current crisis  in the U.S. MedTech industry, an integral part of the broader healthcare space, shows no signs of abating. A few months back, companies  in the space were hopeful about the promised cancellation of the 2.3% MedTech tax of Obamacare under the new government. Unquestionably, the latest political developments have landed the MedTech space in an uncertain territory.Investors are mulling over whether they should retain their existing MedTech stocks or forego their holdings  in favor of companies in other industries to boost their financial resources. That said, in spite of what the future may hold, we believe investors should stick to the MedTech space as it has shown signs of prosperity in recent times globally.Yes, you read that right. Even considering the dull performance of the U.S. medical device market (that still holds the leading position with almost one-third of the world market share) on rising regulatory and legislative uncertainty, global growth has been quite encouraging. In 2016, this industry grew 5%, a pace last seen before the financial crisis.Emerging Markets Hold Immense PromiseThe uncertainty in the United States along with the worsening economic condition in Europe automatically shifted the focus to emerging geographies like China, India, Latin America and others.These emerging economies are seeing  a rise in the uptake of medical devices largely due to growing medical awareness and economic prosperity. An aging population, increasing wealth, government focus on healthcare infrastructure and expansion of medical insurance coverage make these markets a happy hunting ground for global medical device players. Add to it, rising healthcare spending and improving healthcare infrastructure, this growth should continue in 2017 and beyond.Going by a recent BCG report, the share of emerging markets, which is currently less than a quarter of global MedTech revenues, is likely to increase to nearly one-third of revenues by 2022. The MedTech market in China, currently the second largest in the world, is projected to grow about 13% annually from 2015 through 2022. India’s Medtech market, the fifth largest in the world, is currently demonstrating 17% annual growth. If this continues, India may give good competition to Japan and Germany by 2022.Among other emerging geographies, Latin America, even in the face of general economic stagnation, holds enormous potential. Per a January 2017 report by MedTech Intelligence, the Central and South American nations significantly increased per capita spending on healthcare in the period between 2008 and 2014. According to World Bank data, Guatemala increased spending by 27%, Brazil 31%, Chile 54%, Colombia 58%, Uruguay 95%, Paraguay 115%, Bolivia 138%, and Ecuador 139%. Lower domestic production in Latin America has made it as an open market for U.S. exporters. Investment in Emerging Market Players Looks SensibleIn such a scenario, we believe it will be wise of investors who are keen on MedTech stocks to keep an eye on companies who have turned the emerging markets into a happy hunting ground with their expertise and network. No wonder, these stocks, cashing in on the enormous growth potential of these emerging geographies have perfectly shielded themselves from the political turmoil within the United States.Let us look at a few MedTech players with significant emerging market presence.Given the huge potential in these regions, long back, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) had set up manufacturing and R&D centers in Brazil, China and India. The company’s medical device segment of emerging markets is growing three to four times faster than the developed markets. It has been doing business in China for nearly 30 years and is expanding further here on the back of the Synthes acquisition. Johnson & Johnson Price and Consensus Johnson & Johnson price-consensus-chart | Johnson & Johnson Quote Abbott (ABT  -  Free Report) continues to lead the emerging market investment trend with about 50% of sales from this region.

2016,JNJ,"Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, will report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 17, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 2.23%.J&J’s shares have gained 18.6% so far this year, underperforming the 18.3% increase witnessed by the Zacks classified industry.The company has consistently surpassed earnings expectations. Its earnings beat expectations in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.18%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderAt the Q2 conference call, J&J’s chief executive officer, Alex Gorsky had said that the company's sales and earnings growth will accelerate in the second half of the year. Organically, excluding acquisition divestitures and purchase price adjustment, sales grew 2.4% in the first half of the year. The company expects organic sales growth of 4% in the second half of the year.The Pharma segment is expected to benefit from easier comps in third and fourth quarters compared with the first half, continued growth of Imbruvica and Darzalex, new product launches like Tremfy (approved in the United States in July 2017 for plaque psoriasis), better performance of Stelara as well as Xarelto and meaningful contribution from Swiss biotech Actelion, which J&J bought in June. These positives will offset the loss of sales of some drugs like Invokana due to higher managed care discounting.However, biosimilar competition is expected to continue to hurt key arthritis drug Remicade’s sales outside the United States.Management is expected to comment on Pfizer, Inc.’s (PFE) lawsuit, which was filed in a U.S. district court recently. In the lawsuit, Pfizer alleged that J&J is resorting to unfair practices to prevent sale of Inflectra — Pfizer’s biosimilar version of Remicade — that was launched in the United States in November last year. We remind investors that at the Q2 conference call J&J had said that the rate of penetration of Inflectra may be modest.In the Medical Devices segment, increased contribution from new products and strong growth in Vision Care are expected to lead to better sales trends. However, weaker macroeconomic dynamics in some consumer categories and geographic markets will continue to put pressure on sales in the Consumer segment.Meanwhile, at the investor call, management may also provide an update on the complete response letter (CRL) received for rheumatoid arthritis candidate sirukumab last month for want of additional safety data.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model does not conclusively show that J&J is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Its Earnings ESP is -0.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J&J’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings beat.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the large-cap pharma sector that have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Eli Lilly & Company (LLY) has an Earnings ESP of +4.46% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Oct 24.Pfizer, Inc. (PFE) is scheduled to release results on Oct 31. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and a Zacks Rank #3.

2017,JNJ,"Markets notched up record highs following release of the Federal Open Market Committee minutes on Wednesday. The minutes clearly indicated a rate hike in December. Moreover, the minutes stated that a majority of the Fed officials voted in favor of the rate hike. Meanwhile, the Dow posted an all-time record close, supported by a rally in shares of Johnson and Johnson and McDonald’s.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,872.89, gaining 0.2%. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 0.2% to close at 2,555.24. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,603.55, increasing 0.3%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,439 to 1,213. On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by 1,414 to 1,228. The CBOE VIX decreased 0.9% to close at 9.99.Benchmarks Finished at Record HighsThe Dow gathered 42.21 points on Wednesday to notch up an all-time record close. Such gains were buoyed by a rally in shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report), which gained 2.8% and 2.6%, respectively. The blue-chip index has advanced 16% so far this year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The S&P 500 amassed almost 5 points to hit a record close. Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, nine ended in gains with real estate and utilities leading the advancers. The Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) and the Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU) advanced 0.6% and 0.4%, respectively.Fed Minutes Confirm Rate Hike in DecemberMinutes of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), released Wednesday confirmed a rate hike in December, the third instance in 2017. Though, the Federal Reserve officials remained largely divided over raising interest rates, majority of the bankers vouched in favor of raising rates. The ones debating against increasing rates reasoned that hiking rates at a time when inflation is lower than the target of 2% — an indication of a healthy economy — might cause major setbacks to the U.S. economy.Such persistent disagreements among the Fed officials make it difficult for the investors to understand how the future of rate hikes would unfold. Meanwhile, a majority of the policymakers opined that the impact which hurricanes Harvey and Irma had on the U.S. economy would likely fade in a short time. Further, they also commented that inflation would soon hit the target rate of 2%.After the meeting ended, the Fed chose to leave the interest rates unchanged in the range of 1% - 1.25% and decided to start unwinding its $4.5 trillion balance sheet. The much anticipated unwinding of the humungous balance sheet of the Fed was announced at the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee last month. The Fed is slated to begin the gradual unwinding process this month and plans to trim assets by $10 billion each month.However, the Fed panel announced one rate hike before 2017 ends and three further hikes in 2018. Experts therefore speculate that this would come in December when Fed meets for the final time before the year ends. Moreover, in a recent speech at Cleveland, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen cautioned against raising interest rates gradually. She reasoned that this might lead to overheating of the economy and also financial instability. Such claims by Yellen were seconded by Kansas City Fed President Esther George who said that waiting for the inflation rates to hit the 2% level could rather turn out to be a ‘mistake.’Stocks That Made HeadlinesAllegiant Raises Q3 Guidance Despite September Traffic FallAllegiant Travel Company (ALGT  -  Free Report) has reported traffic numbers for September.

2018,JNJ,"Second quarter earnings season for the pharma sector kicked off this week with industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Swiss pharma giant, Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report), reporting results. Meanwhile, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report) gained tentative approval from the FDA for its follow-on biologic basal insulin though the company cannot launch immediately due to an ongoing patent infringement case.Recap of the Week’s Most Important StoriesA Look at J&J and Novartis’ 2Q Results: Industry bellwether J&J and Swiss pharma giant, Novartis, both reported second quarter results earlier this week. J&J surpassed earnings expectations though revenues fell short. The company raised its outlook for the year with operational sales growth expected to accelerate in the second half. Some of the factors that should help this include the earlier launch of Tremfya, a more moderate erosion of the U.S. Remicade business compared to previous expectations as well as the continued strong performance of key drugs. Contribution from new products in the Medical Devices segment is also expected to pick up in the back half of the year with strong growth in the Vision Care segment expected to continue. The Consumer segment, however, will continue to be impacted by weaker macroeconomic dynamics (Read more: J&J Beats on Q2 Earnings, Lags Sales, Ups 2017 View).Novartis’ second quarter results were better than expected with the company beating on both earnings and revenues. Entresto and Cosentyx continued to perform well while Sandoz sales declined reflecting pricing pressure in the U.S. Meanwhile, Alcon’s performance improved encouraging the company to raise its Alcon sales outlook to low single digit growth (Read more: Novartis Tops Q2 Earnings, Sandoz Faces Pricing Pressure). Novartis stock has gained 17.3% year to date, outperforming the 12.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.Tentative Approval for Merck’s Follow-On Basal Insulin: Merck got tentative approval from the FDA for its biosimilar version of Sanofi’s (SNY  -  Free Report) blockbuster diabetes drug, Lantus. Lusduna Nexvue (insulin glargine injection), technically a follow-on biologic basal insulin, has been developed by Merck with funding from Samsung Bioepis.However, Merck will have to wait before it can launch the product due to an automatic 30-month stay resulting from a patent infringement lawsuit initiated by Sanofi in Sep 2016. Merck cannot launch its product before the expiry of the stay period or a favorable court ruling, whichever occurs first.We note that a biosimilar version of Lantus is already on the market in the form of Lilly (LLY  -  Free Report) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Basaglar which entered the market in mid-Dec 2016. Lantus sales declined 14.1% in the first quarter of 2017 including a 20.9% decline in the U.S. reflecting lower average net price, patient switches to Toujeo and the impact of formulary exclusions. Pricing pressure will increase once Merck’s product enters the market.Sanofi and Merck are both Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stocks. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Sanofi in Nanobody Deal with Ablynx: Sanofi has entered into a research collaboration and global exclusive licensing agreement with Belgian company, Ablynx, focused on the development and commercialization of Nanobody-based therapeutics for the treatment of various immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. With this deal, Sanofi will gain access to certain Nanobodies in Ablynx’s existing portfolio as well as to Ablynx’s scientists and proprietary Nanobody platform. Sanofi will make an upfront payment of €23 million. Other financial details include up to €2.4 billion in milestone payments as well as tiered royalties. With this collaboration, Sanofi is looking to expand its drug discovery pipeline in immunology.EU Nod for AstraZeneca’s Kyntheum: AstraZeneca’s (AZN  -  Free Report) psoriasis treatment Kyntheum gained approval in the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The company said that its partner LEO Pharma gained approval for the use of the biologic medicine for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Kyntheum was approved in the U.S. under the trade name Siliq in Feb 2017 with a black box warning regarding risk in patients with suicidal thoughts or behavior.PerformanceLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % ReturnThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index gained 1.8% over the last five trading sessions.

2019,JNJ,"The Q2 earnings season has commenced and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) was the first drug company to report earnings on July 18 before the opening bell. The world's biggest maker of health care products continued its long streak of earnings beat and offered an upbeat outlook for the full year. However, it lagged our revenue estimate again on sluggish drug sales.Q2 Results in DetailEarnings per share came in at $1.83, 4 cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 5.2% higher than the year-ago quarter. Revenues grew 1.9% year over year to $18.84 billion but fell shy of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.89 billion. Weak drug sales of arthritis treatment Remicade, diabetes medicine Invokana and cancer drug Zytiga – which are among the company’s 10 top-selling treatments – were responsible for the revenue miss.Johnson & Johnson raised its full-year earnings per share guidance to $7.12–$7.22 from $7.00–$7.15 and revenue guidance to $75.8–$76.1 billion from $75.4–$76.1 billion. It expects sales and profitability to pick up in the second half of this year on strong demand for newer, pricey treatments such as cancer drugs Darzalex and Imbruvica. The Zacks Consensus Estimate are currently pegged at $7.10 for earnings per share and $75.71 billion for revenues (see: all the Healthcare ETFs here).Market ImpactFollowing the results, shares of JNJ rose 1.7% at the close on July 18. Currently, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with a VGM Score of B. Further, Johnson & Johnson belongs to a solid industry with a Zacks Rank in the top 24%.As a result, investors should closely watch the movement of the stock and keep a close eye on ETFs having the largest allocation to this diversified drug maker. Below, we have highlighted those.Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV  -  Free Report)The most popular healthcare ETF, XLV follows the Health Care Select Sector Index. This fund manages nearly $17.7 billion in its asset base and trades in heavy volume of around 7.8 million shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.14% annually. In total, the fund holds 63 securities in its basket with JNJ taking the top spot at 11.7% of the assets. Pharma accounts for 34.5% share from a sector look while biotech, healthcare providers and services, and healthcare equipment and supplies make up for a double-digit exposure each.

2021,JNJ,"Gilead Sciences, Inc. (GILD  -  Free Report) announced that the FDA has approved Vosevi (Sovaldi, velpatasvir 100 mg/voxilaprevir 100 mg) tablets. The drug is a single-tablet regimen (STR) for the re-treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in adults with genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, previously treated with an NS5A inhibitor-containing regimen, or with genotype 1a or 3 previously treated with a Sovaldi-containing regimen without an NS5A inhibitor.The approval came on the back of positive data from the phase III studies – POLARIS-1 and POLARIS-4 studies. The studies evaluated 12 weeks of Vosevi in direct-acting antiviral-experienced chronic HCV-infected patients without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis.However, Vosevi has been warned for its product label regarding the risk of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in HCV/HBV co infected patients.Nevertheless, the approval makes Vosevi the first once-daily STR available as a salvage therapy for patients infected with HCV genotype 1–6 who have failed prior treatment with DAA regimens including NS5A inhibitors. The approval is expected to boost Gilead’s strong HCV portfolio.Gilead has a strong presence in the HCV market due to its blockbuster HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni. While Sovaldi continues to be a very important product for the company, Harvoni’s label has been expanded twice in the U.S. since approval and is now approved for use in a broader range of patient population. The HCV portfolio got a huge a boost when Epclusa gained approval in both the U.S. (Jun 2016) and the EU (Jul 2016) to become the first and only all-oral, pan-genotypic, STR consisting of Sovaldi and velpatasvir (an NS5A inhibitor), for the treatment of adults with genotype 1-6 chronic HCV infection. Initial uptake of Epclusa has been encouraging while formulary reviews are on track. Gilead expects to launch Epclusa in other large EU markets once pricing and reimbursement is in place by the second half of 2017, which should boost sales further.Last month, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion on the company’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for Vosevi following an accelerated assessment procedure.Gilead’s HCV franchise is under pressure due to intense competition and pricing issues. HCV product sales were weaker than expected mainly due to fewer new patient starts for Harvoni and lower revenues per patient. Harvoni, Sovaldi and Epclusa has being facing competition from AbbVie’s (ABBV  -  Free Report) Viekira Pak and Viekira XR, Bristol-Myers’ (BMY  -  Free Report) Daklinza and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Olysio.The company expects that the persistent decline in HCV patient starts will be the primary factor behind the year-over-year decrease in revenues in 2017 along with increased competition which will impact patient share and pricing.Shares of Gilead have underperformed the Zacks classified Medical-Biomedical and Genetics industry in the year so far, with the stock losing 0.1% during this period, against the industry’s gain of 8.8%. Nevertheless, the HIV franchise of Gilead is performing well and is expected to help the company combat the persistent decline in HCV franchise.Zacks Rank Gilead currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing UpsiZacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2024,JNJ,"The second quarter earnings season is off to a strong start. As of July 25, approximately 128 S&P 500 companies or 36.1% of the index’s total membership have reported results.  A deep look into the results show that earnings for the companies reported so far are up 7% year over year on 4.2% higher revenues. Of these, 77.3% have topped earnings estimates while 70.3% have beat on revenue estimates. However, the pace of growth is below the first quarter but in line with the four-quarter average and has improved over the 12-quarter average. Going forward, estimates for the third quarter are going down. The estimate for Q3 growth is 4.8%, down from 6% at the start of the quarter.The Pharma sector has more or less combated the overall decline in the financial markets and maintained momentum.  Last week, industry bellwether Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) reported mixed second-quarter results, beating on earnings but missing on sales. Swiss major Novartis AG (NVS  -  Free Report) reported encouraging second-quarter results. Meanwhile, biotech giant Biogen Inc. (BIIB  -  Free Report) surpassed expectations both for earnings and sales in the second quarter of 2017 and raised its annual guidance.Let’s take a look at three biotech companies that are set to report second-quarter results on Jul 27.Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company beat earnings estimates by 16.7%.Bristol-Myers has a decent track record so far. The company’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 8.39%. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a 0.00% Earnings ESP .

Last quarter, the company beat expectations by 4.08%.Celgene’s key product, Revlimid, is expected to continue to be the main growth driver as in the first quarter, driven by share gains in important markets and longer treatment duration in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM). Other key products – Pomalyst/Imnovid, Abraxane and Otezla continue to perform well. In the second-quarter call, investors are expected to remain focused on the company’s performance and label expansion efforts, along with updates on the pipeline front.

2025,JNJ,"Johnson &Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), a healthcare bellwether, announced that the FDA has approved a label expansion for its oral pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) medicine, Tracleer.Consequently, a 32 mg tablet of Tracleer is now approved for use in pediatric patients aged three years and older with idiopathic or congenital PAH to improve pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), which is expected to result in an improvement in exercise ability. With the approval, Tracleer has become the first medicine in the U.S. to be approved for use in pediatric patients. The 32 mg oral suspension formulation for pediatric use is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year. Presently, Tracleer is marketed in 62.5 and 125 mg dosages for adult patients. These will still be available.We remind investors that Tracleer and other PAH drugs including Opsumit, Ventavis, Veletri and Uptravi were added to J&J’s portfolio with the acquisition of Swiss biotech, Actelion. J&J acquired Actelion in June this year for $30 billion, which diversified the former’s revenues in the PAH category.Actelion’s newer drugs – Opsumit and Uptravi – have been well received and are poised to become blockbuster drugs. However, Tracleer, an older medicine is facing competitive pressure. We believe the label expansion for pediatric use should improve sales of Tracleer, going forward.PAH is a chronic life-threatening disease characterized by increased blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries. The PAH market is highly attractive given the low diagnosis rate, low penetration of existing therapies and significant unmet medical need.Other than Actelion, United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) holds a strong position in the PAH market with as many as four approved products - Remodulin, Adcirca, Tyvaso and Orenitram. Pfizer’s (PFE  -  Free Report) Revatio is used for the same indication as well. Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARNA  -  Free Report) has ralinepag in its pipeline, which is also being developed for PAH.So far this year, J&J’s share price has increased 13.4%, comparing favorably with a gain of 11.8% recorded by the industry it belongs to.J&J carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2026,JNJ,"Pfizer Inc (PFE  -  Free Report) and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMY  -  Free Report) presented findings from a phase IV study on Eliquis, which demonstrated the oral anticoagulation’s potential in achieving and maintaining normal heart rhythm (cardioversion).The study, EMANATE, compared Eliquis with standard-of-care, Heparin, for reducing the occurrence of acute stroke, systemic embolism, major bleeding, clinically relevant non-major bleeding and all-cause death in non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) patients undergoing cardioversion.We remind investors that Eliquis is already approved for the reduction of the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with NVAF, treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) and reduction in the risk of recurrent DVT and PE following initial therapy, and prophylaxis of DVT, which may lead to PE, in patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery. However, the drug is not approved for the reduction of stroke in NVAF patients undergoing cardioversion.Pfizer has underperformed the industry so far this year. The stock has gained 3% during this period, while the industry gained 11.3%.Coming back to the latest news, cardioversion procedure is associated with a concern for clotting of blood in the heart while travelling to brain (stroke) or other body parts (systemic embolism). The EMANATE study showed that there was no stroke in Eliquis group compared to six strokes in the Heparin arm. However, no systemic embolism was observed for both the drug groups. Eliquis also reduced the number of major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events compared to Heparin.The current standard-of-care – Heparin and Coumadin – requires monitoring and potential dose adjustment while administered for reducing the risk of stroke. However, Eliquis can be administered at a fixed dose of 5mg twice daily.We note that Eliquis, being an anticoagulant, increases the risk of bleeding, which can become serious and potentially fatal.The company also announced data from a real-world analysis of Eliquis in NVAF patients in a separate press release. Per the analysis, Eliquis showed lower risk of stroke/SE and lower rates of major bleeding compared to Coumadin in NVAF patients as well as for each of the selected high-risk patient sub-populations.Eliquis faces competition in the anticoagulant segment from Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ  -  Free Report) Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim’s Pradaxa. With the approval of Portola Pharmaceuticals, Inc.’s (PTLA  -  Free Report) Bevyxxa in June 2017competition is expected to intensify.Stroke events are a major concern for NVAF patient. The above findings show that Eliquis may become a preferred treatment for the same which may boost the potential of the drug. If Pfizer and Bristol-Myers try to get the label of Eliquis expanded to include the findings, it will give the drug an edge over other marketed blood thinners.Pfizer, Inc.

Again, the Amazon-Sears deal adversely affected Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), which in turn weighed on the Dow.

Also, shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) fell 1.5%, dragging down the blue-chip index. This was largely due to the fact that Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) together with its South Korean partner Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd has started selling Renflexis, a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday following stellar earning results from McDonald's Corp.

2028,JNJ,"United Therapeutics Corporation (UTHR  -  Free Report) reported adjusted earnings of $4.41 per share (including stock-based compensation benefit but excluding charges) for the second quarter of 2017, which were better than $4.39 per share in the year-ago quarter.United Therapeutics said it has set aside $210 million for a potential settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to resolve an investigation related to its contribution to non-profit organizations that provide financial assistance to patients, thereby violating federal securities laws. In the quarter, the company recorded a $210 million charge as an estimated loss contingency in relation to this matter. It also recorded an impairment charge related to cost method investments in a privately-held company, which experienced an event triggering an impairment analysis.Including these charges and stock-based compensation benefit, the company incurred a loss of $1.25 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.61 by 134.63%.Revenues for the reported quarter rose 8% year over year to $445.0 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $402 million. Stronger sales across the pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) franchise pulled up the top line in the quarter.Despite the better-than-expected sales performance, shares declined almost 5% on Thursday in response to the potential settlement expense. A look at United Therapeutics’ share price movement shows that the stock has underperformed the industry this year so far. United Therapeutics stock has declined 12.8% during this period, while the industry rose 7.1%.The Quarter in DetailUnited Therapeutics markets four products for the treatment of PAH – Remodulin, Tyvaso, Adcirca and Orenitram.Orenitram reported sales of $46.0 million in the quarter, up 21% year over year. Adcirca sales were $120.6 million, up 33% year over year. Tyvaso sales totaled 104.2 million, down 3% year over year. Remodulin sales were $157.7 million, down 1% year over year. However, sales of both Tyvaso and Remodulin improved sequentially in the quarter. Unituxin (for the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma) sales of $16.1 million were down 10% year over year.Lately, the growth of United Therapeutics’ PAH drugs Orenitram, Tyvaso and Remodulin have slowed down due to competition. Last quarter, the company had said that patients were staying longer on front-line oral AMBITION therapy (Adcirca + Gilead Sciences, Inc.’s (GILD  -  Free Report) Letairis) and delaying the transition to inhaled/injectable therapies like Tyvaso/Remodulin, thereby hurting their demand.Meanwhile, the drugs are also facing strong competition from Actelion’s, now a part of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), new drug Uptravi (selexipag).Initial treatment in PAH is typically with orally delivered drugs followed by prostacyclins therapies. At the first quarter earnings call, management had said that the longer use of oral therapies resulted in a large backlog of patients eligible for prostacyclin therapy like its PAH medicines – suggesting that sales trends could improve. With sales of Tyvaso, Remodulin and Orenitram improving in the second quarter from first quarter levels, management believes that it is seeing early signs of this transition from ambition regimen back to its PAH drugs.Research and development (R&D) expenses (including stock-based compensation benefit) increased 70% to $59.8 million due to higher costs to support its pipeline of cardiopulmonary and cancer drugs and to develop organ manufacturing projects.Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses (including stock-based compensation benefit) declined 7% to $67.4 million as lower consulting and marketing costs offset higher legal costs.Pipeline UpdateUnited Therapeutics is working with medical device maker Medtronic, Inc. (MDT  -  Free Report) to get an implantable pump for delivering Remodulin (RemoSynch) approved by the FDA. In order to launch RemoSynch in the U.S., United Therapeutics and Medtronic are pursuing parallel regulatory filings related to the device and the drugWe remind investors that in April, United Therapeutics announced that regulatory issues will delay the planned U.S. launch of RemoSynch. The company now expects to launch RemoSynch sometime in 2018 against the first half of this year, as expected previously.  United Therapeutics is also working with DEKA for the development of a pre-filled, semi-disposable pump system for the subcutaneous delivery of Remodulin (RemUnity- launch expected in 2019). Clinical studies on RemoPro, a pain-free new chemical entity version of treprostinil, are expected to begin this year.Other phase III pipeline programs include an oral combination therapy of Orenitram - OreniPlus (FREEDOM-EV study), Tysuberprost (esuberaprost in combination with Tyvaso), Tyvaso-ILD (Tyvaso being evaluated in patients with PAH associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) and OreniLeft (PAH with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction).United Therapeutics is also developing dinutuximab, the active ingredient in Unituxin, for small cell lung cancer (phase III) and other high-risk forms of cancer with GD2 expressing cell tumors such as ovarian cancer and several sarcomas.United Therapeutics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2029,JNJ,"We expect Pfizer, Inc. (PFE  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 1, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.99%.The pharma giant has a mixed record of earnings surprises. The company’s earnings surpassed expectations in two of the last four quarters while missing in the other two, resulting in an average negative surprise of 0.35%.Pfizer’s shares rose 1.9% this year so far, comparing unfavorably with an increase of 11.8% for the Zacks classified industry.Factors at PlayNew products like Xeljanz (rheumatoid arthritis) and Ibrance (breast cancer) as well as older products like Lyrica (neuropathic pain) and Eliquis (blood thinner) are likely to contribute to the top line meaningfully. Xeljanz (5 mg taken twice daily) was approved in the EU in Mar 2017, which may boost the drug’s sales in the to-be reported quarter.Also, revenues from the blockbuster prostate cancer drug Xtandi, added to Pfizer’s portfolio following the Sep 2016 Medivation acquisition, are likely to propel U.S. revenues.The Hospira acquisition is expected to be an important growth driver as well.Also, Pfizer launched Inflectra, a biosimilar version of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) blockbuster drug Remicade in Nov 2016. Inflectra recorded sales of $17 million in the U.S. and $78 million globally in the first quarter. The biosimilar may generate more sales in the soon-to-be reported quarter.However, Pfizer will continue to face headwinds in the form of loss of exclusivity on key products like Pristiq, Zyvox and Celebrex and the expiration of a few co-promotion agreements, which will continue to hamper top-line growth. Blockbuster drug Enbrel sales will continue to decline in the quarter due to biosimilar competition. The Prevnar/Prevenar 13 vaccines franchise is expected to continue to see lower sales while lower demand should continue to hurt sales of Viagra.Meanwhile, the bottom line should be driven by cost savings and share buybacks. However, new product launch expenses and R&D investments are expected to hurt profits.On the second-quarter call, investor focus is expected to remain on the performance of new products and pipeline progress including biosimilars and immuno-oncology. Importantly, key cancer candidate, Bavencio/avelumab received FDA approval for metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) in Mar 2017 and for advanced bladder cancer in May. The drug may bring in some revenues in the second quarter. Management is expected to shed light on how the launch is progressing at the conference call.Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) candidate, Besponsa, was also approved in the EU in late Jun 2017. We expect management to comment on the commercialization plans at the conference call.What Our Model IndicatesOur proven model shows that Pfizer is likely to beat on earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate (66 cents per share) and the Zacks Consensus Estimate (65 cents per share), is +1.54%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of Pfizer’s Zacks Rank #3 and positive ESP makes us confident of an earnings beat in the upcoming release.Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5), on the other hand, should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Other Stocks to ConsiderA couple of stocks in the pharmaceuticals sector that also have a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank are:Novo Nordisk A/S (NVO  -  Free Report), scheduled to release results on Aug 9, has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Celgene Corporation (CELG  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +0.62% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to release results on Jul 27.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.
