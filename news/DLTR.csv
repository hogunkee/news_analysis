Then Target, Costco (COST) and others followed. Walmart's minimum wage hike to $11 an hour has contributed to the same kind of dynamic early this year. Target subsequently hiked its base pay to $12 an hour and CVS to $11 an hour.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same.

29,DLTR,"Deep discount retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR) fell short of fourth-quarter forecasts across the board and gave weak guidance, sinking shares Wednesday. The dollar store is the latest discount chain to sell off after reporting earnings. Costco (COST), meanwhile, pulled ahead of revenue expectations in the afternoon.X Estimates: Profit to grow 37% to $1.90 per share in Q4 as revenue rises 14% to $6.4 billion. Consensus Metrix expects 2.8% same-store sales growth, including 4% comps from flagship Dollar Tree stores and 1.5% comps from Family Dollar locations.Results: EPS of $1.89 on revenue of $6.36 billion. Same-store sales increased 2.4%, including 3.8% growth at Dollar Tree and a 1% gain at Family Dollar.Outlook: Q1 EPS of $1.18 to $1.25, below consensus for $1.32, on revenue of $5.53 billion-$5.63 billion, below consensus of $5.65 billion, with combined same-store sales up by low single digits. Full-year EPS of $5.25-$5.60, below consensus for $5.95, on revenue of $22.7 billion-$23.12 billion, below consensus for $23.41 billion, with combined same-store sales up by low single digits.Stock: Shares plunged 14.5% to 89.25 on the stock market today, tumbling below their 200-day moving average for the first time since late August. Heading into earnings, the stock had hit resistance at its 50-day moving average after breaching the key level in early February. Dollar General (DG) fell 4.3% Wednesday and Five Below (FIVE) dropped 3.6%.Analysts have pointed to dollar stores' resilience against online stores of Amazon's ilk, thanks to their reach into more rural areas and potential consumer benefits from tax reform.But several discount retailers have had a rough earnings season. Off-price apparel retailer Ross Stores (ROST) plunged 6.4% as a cautious outlook overshadowed solid fourth-quarter EPS and sales. Target (TGT) sold off Tuesday after reporting weak holiday earnings and profit guidance, not long after Walmart (WMT) crashed in late February for the same miss-and-warn report.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Estimates: Earnings to rise 24% to $1.45 per share on 10% sales growth to $32.71 billion. Core same-store sales, minus gas and the impact of foreign exchange, are expected to rise 5.5%, per Consensus Metrix. Including those elements, analysts are expecting comp growth of 7.5% globally.Results: Diluted earnings of of $1.59 a share on $32.995 billion in revenue, including membership fees. But minus a 17-cent per-share benefit from changes in the tax laws, Costco earned $1.42 per share, short of views.Excluding gas and foreign exchange, comps grew 5.4%.  Including gas and foreign exchange, comps rose 8.4%.Stock: Costco initially rallied, but then turned fractionally lower. The stock closed down 2.1% to 187.36 during the regular session. The stock has a flat base with a 199.98 buy point as it bobs around its 50-day line.Results from the membership-based wholesaler come amid a backdrop of battling among the major retailers: namely, Walmart and Amazon.

31,DLTR,"The economy added 164,000 jobs in April as the jobless rate fell to 3.9%, the lowest since 2000. Yet wage growth, the key number for stock market investors on edge about more Fed rate hikes, surprised on the downside, coming in at 2.6%.The jobs and wage data slightly lowered odds of four Fed interest-rate hikes in 2018, which should be positive for the stock market. The data didn't initially provide much of a boost. The Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite opened moderately lower after the jobs data, but the major market indexes staged a midmorning rally, fueled by Apple (AAPL). The Nasdaq led the way into positive territory, soon followed by the Dow Jones and S&P 500.Wall Street expected 191,000 new jobs, 4.0% unemployment and a 2.7% annual rise in average hourly wages. Yet the undershooting on two of three key jobs metrics may make the job market look less robust than it is.First, job gains in the prior two months were revised up by a combined 30,000, leaving the 3-month average at a rock-solid 208,000.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFurther, Jefferies economist Thomas Simons noted that wage growth is sometimes depressed in months that the Labor Department's survey of businesses doesn't include the 15th of the month, which occurred in April. If that's the case, wage growth could take a leap in May. However, March's wage gain was also revised down, from 2.7% to 2.6%.Jim Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors, noted that other gauges of wage growth have pointed to stronger gains. The Employment Cost Index released last week showed that private-sector wages and salaries grew 2.9% from a year ago in March.After the jobs data, the 10-year Treasury yield eased to 2.935% while the 2-year yield, which more closely tracks Fed rate expectations, held around 2.49%. The narrow spread between long-term and short-term interest rates may reflect concerns that the Fed will hike rates too much in the near term as the economy gets a boost from tax-cut and spending stimulus, leading to an economic letdown.The stakes have increased for each jobs report as inflation has picked up close to the Fed's target 2% and interest rates have hit multiyear highs. The combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains would fit perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. For investors, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem confident that inflation pressures won't lag too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.To some extent, it's already happening as the Fed's favored gauge of core inflation hit 1.9% in March. Meanwhile, Wall Street has bumped up odds for a fourth rate hike this year to about 40%. Still, the Fed signaled on Wednesday that it won't be overly concerned if inflation rises a bit above 2% for a few months.There's good reason to expect a further pickup in wage growth in coming months. A host of large companies including CVS Health (CVS), Starbucks (SBUX) and Target (TGT) have announced wage hikes rolling out this spring that may start to show up in Friday's report.This year is beginning to look lot like 2016, when wage gains accelerated into summer after Walmart (WMT) hiked its base wage to $10 an hour.

33,DLTR,"Wage growth will likely accelerate in the March jobs report and beyond, with hawkish implications for the Fed interest-rate outlook. Goldilocks is on her way out.Wall Street economists expect the monthly employment report out at 8:30 a.m. ET to show a gain of 175,000 jobs. The unemployment rate should dip to 4%, the lowest since December 2000. Average hourly wage growth should tick up to 2.7% on an annual basis from a so-so 2.6% in February.Expect the improvement in wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour. Six months after raising its minimum wage to $11, Target (TGT) said last month that it will pay all current associates at least $12 an hour starting this spring.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSecond, wage growth receded in the spring of 2017, rising just 2.2% at an annual rate from March through June. As those months that saw depressed pay gains drop off, replaced by months with firmer growth this year, the annual rate will trend higher.Take a closer look at Walmart's wage changes. Before its pay hike announced in January 2018, Walmart hadn't raised its base wage in nearly three years. That's a big deal. When Walmart hiked its minimum wage for all current associates to $10 an hour in February 2016, that wage hike was contagious.Walmart is big enough to put upward pressure on wages for other employers. Target and Costco (COST) were among those who quickly hiked pay shortly after that 2016 move. Average hourly earnings growth rose to 2.8% that July before momentum flagged.Walmart's 2016 wage hike came when the jobless rate was nearly 5%. Now it's around 4%, so competition for workers has intensified. At least for workers on the lower end of the wage spectrum, pay hikes appear to be broad-based. Starbucks (SBUX), Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all have said they're raising pay. Meanwhile, dozens of banks, including Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) hiked their minimum wage to $15 an hour for tellers.As wage gains accelerate and the jobless rate moves below 4% in coming months, Fed policymakers may lean toward four interest-rate hikes in 2018, not just three. Fed models assume that inflation will follow wage growth higher. There's reason to be skeptical. For example, Kroger said last month that it will use the bulk of its tax cut to offset the cost of higher wages and lower prices.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Check Out These 4 Dow Jones Stocks; One Is Near A Buy PointBoeing, GE, United Tech Fall As China Hits Aviation But 737 Orders Roll InHow To Invest In A Late-Stage Bull Market As FANG Stocks SlumpStocks To Watch: These Stocks Just Got Added To IBD 50, IPO LeadersTop Stock LGI Homes Breaks Out To Buy Zone On Strong Growth

34,DLTR,"Don't be fooled by the weak job growth or higher-than-expected unemployment in March. Better wage growth and less labor-market slack mean the stock market won't get much of a reprieve from Fed rate-hike fears.The good news: The surprisingly weak 103,000 job gain throws a bit of cold water on the notion that the economy is overheating. Yet a hawkish shift by the data-dependent Federal Reserve will continue to remain a risk for investors with every wage and inflation report. The consumer price index coming out on Wednesday is the next one to watch. UniCredit Research expects the core CPI, excluding food and energy, to rise 2% from a year ago vs. 1.8% in February.Following the report, Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite initially moved higher, then relapsed in late morning trade on the stock market today. The Dow Jones, S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite were all down 1% or more.Before the report, stock market futures were deep in the red in reaction to President Trump's threat to strike back at China even harder, with tariffs on an additional $100 billion in imports.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 10-year Treasury yield slipped about 5 basis points to 2.78% as stocks fell and the jobs and unemployment data surprised on the soft side. Odds of four Federal Reserve rate hikes this year, one more than expected, eased to about 26% after the report, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Average hourly wages rose 8 cents to $26.82 an hour, lifting the annual gain to 2.7%, in line with expectations.Wall Street economists expected a 175,000 job gain, 4.0% unemployment and 2.7% average wage growth.Still, job growth has averaged a solid 202,000 the past three months, including revisions. A balmy February likely shifted some seasonal job employment forward, depressing March job creation.Harm Bandholz, chief U.S. economist at UniCredit, pointed out that jobless rate actually did decline in March — if you don't round to the tenths — from 4.14% to 4.07%. Over the past 12 months, the labor force has increased by 125,000 per month, on average, well below the pace of job creation. ""Looking forward, we continue to expect the jobless rate to fall towards 3.5% by the end of the year.""Employers also have been increasing work hours, further evidence of less slack. On a weekly basis, the average wage rose 3.3% from a year ago in March, the best gain in seven years.Investors should expect the improvement in hourly wage growth to be the start of a trend for two reasons.First, dozens of major employers announced wage hikes over the past few months, but few came early enough to show up in February's jobs report. Walmart (WMT) and CVS Health (CVS) hiked their minimum wages to $11 an hour.

36,DLTR,"The favored Fed inflation gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, rose 0.2% on the month and 1.6% from a year ago in February, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.Core inflation came in a tad hotter than the 1.5% annual rate expected. Including food and energy prices, the PCE price index rose 0.2% on the month and 1.8% from a year ago vs. expectations of 0.2% and 1.7% increases.After the report, Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 index futures rose a little more, while the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed around 2.77%.If the inflation data stay tame, and core PCE inflation remains well below the Fed's 2% inflation target, the U.S. central bank probably won't hike its key interest rate four times this year. At last week's Fed meeting, policymakers' projections saw core inflation rising to 1.9% this year as the Fed hikes three times.Policymakers are getting more confident that inflation will start to firm. Their projections point to 2.1% core inflation in 2019, just above their target.The Fed still believes in the Phillips curve, which predicts rising wage growth as unemployment falls. Before too long, wage pressures put upward pressure on consumer prices.So far, official measures haven't detected a pickup in wages. The Labor Department reported weaker-than-expected 2.6% annual average hourly wage inflation in February. But faster wage growth should begin to show up this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX) that didn't happen soon enough for the latest jobs report.As those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same.

Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Still, inflation is likely to remain near the top of investors' concerns this year.

""Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view,"" Fed Governor Lael Brainard said last week.Bottom line: Inflation is going to remain a concern for Wall Street throughout 2018.The soft inflation reading came as medical care services inflation was unchanged in February, after January's 0.6% monthly gain, and prices for medical care commodities including prescription drugs slipped 0.3%.Meanwhile, prices for food away from home rose 0.2%, while the cost of food consumed at home fell 0.2%, more evidence of the competition from Amazon in the grocery arena.Outside of energy, inflation is showing up in transportation services, whose prices rose 1.0% on the month and 4.5% from a year ago.

43,DLTR,"If the February jobs report out Friday morning comes in as strong as Wall Street expects, it will set financial markets up for another Fed interest-rate scare later this spring.X Here's the reason: Economists expect the new jobs data to match January's 2.9% hourly annual wage gain — the best since 2009. That's even though that surprising data point appeared inflated by a dive in the work week that disproportionately reduced hours for low-wage workers. But even bigger pay gains are likely coming this spring, reflecting recently announced wage hikes from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), CVS Health (CVS) and Starbucks (SBUX), which won't show up yet in the February jobs report.And as those companies hike wages, their competitors are being pressured to do the same. This week, Kroger (KR), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Ross Stores (ROST) all said they're raising wages for employees, and their stocks sold off amid worries about profit margins.Wall Street also expects that the jobless rate dipped to 4.0% in February for the first time since 2000, as the economy added a robust 205,000 jobs.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

44,DLTR,"See stocks near a buy point, get chart pattern recognition and run custom screens. Start NowThe combination of low and falling unemployment with accelerating wage gains fits perfectly with the Phillips curve theory that has long guided Federal Reserve policy. As far as investors are concerned, the key point is that most Fed policymakers still seem pretty confident that inflation pressures won't follow too far behind wage pressures, as businesses pass along a portion of their higher wage bills.That's why an interest-rate scare is looking increasingly likely, even if a legitimate inflation scare doesn't materialize.Yet the competitive environment facing Kroger from Walmart and Amazon.com (AMZN) via its Whole Foods division, among others, offers at least some reason to doubt whether wage pressure will feed through to higher prices. Kroger said on Thursday that it will use one-third of its tax cut to boost shareholder returns, but the other two-thirds will go to higher wages and lower prices.Kroger gave weak profit guidance as it forecast smaller profit margins, sending shares crashing 12% on Thursday.Walmart's minimum-wage hike to $11 an hour was its first for new, entry-level workers since 2015, when it raised its minimum wage to $9 an hour. Then, in early 2016, Walmart hiked pay for all current associates to a minimum of $10 an hour, leading Target, Costco (COST) and others to raise their own wages. The point is that wage hikes can come in bunches. It didn't really happen last year, when wage growth hit a bit of a lull. But it does appear to be happening in 2018.If it does, Wall Street will continue to bump up odds for a fourth rate hike in 2018.

So far this young year, going into Thursday, the fund is up 5.08% vs. 4.89% for the S&P 500 and 4.64% for its peer group. That's an improvement over the past three years, when it slightly lagged the S&P 500.X Credit starts with leading stocks held by the fund. Top holdings FleetCor Technologies (FLT) and Red Hat (RHT) rose 36% and 74% in the past 12 months. Top new buy Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Arista Networks (ANET) rose 42% and 198%.Other holdings include Thor Industries (THO) and Align Technologies (ALGN), which are up 48% and 186% in the past 12 months.

58,DLTR,"Fidelity Investments' plan is that shareholders of Growth Discovery Fund (FDSVX) will find their usual satisfaction in the first five or so months of the year. In that span, Asher Anolic will temporarily take the helm from marquee manager Jason Weiner, who will spend that period away from the fund on a leave of absence, traveling with his family and pursuing educational opportunities.X Anolic will be the acting manager not only of the $1.7 billion Growth Discovery but also of its advisor-sold twin, $3.1 billion Advisor Equity Growth (FAEGX).For Anolic, the challenge is weighty. Weiner, who has steered the funds since February 2007 and early November of 2006 respectively, has led them to rarefied success.The funds outperformed the broad market in the form of the S&P 500 in the latest calendar year, 2017, as well as the three and five years ended Dec. 31. If the funds keep up that pace and add outperformance over the past 10 years, they will earn inclusion as IBD Best Mutual Funds Awards winners. Only 4% of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds with at least $100 million in assets pulled off that feat by the end of 2016.Weiner — with Anolic as co-manager since July 1 — achieved that multiperiod outperformance with portfolios featuring leading stocks like Five Below (FIVE), Red Hat (RHT) and Alibaba Group (BABA), as well as household names like Facebook (FB)  and Amazon.com (AMZN), two of the FANG stocks.Shortly before 48-year-old Weiner began his sabbatical, he and 39-year-old Anolic talked with IBD from their Boston offices about their managerial juggling act and how their investment styles overlap and how they differ.IBD: Jason, has your management style changed since Asher joined you as co-manager?Weiner: Absolutely, yes. Any time you take on a partner, you talk about what you think, what your partner thinks. Ash came with experience in health care and staples, and with a much sharper quantitative investment focus. No two people have the same skill set. So one plus one equals more than two.IBD: Asher, have you changed?Anolic: With my background in staples and health care and financials, I never had a chance to encounter some of the big open-ended growth stories that Jason has done an excellent job figuring out. Those companies can have huge addressable markets, which become multiples of what people think they are today.In the past, I would have shied away from those because I was afraid of getting caught in something that I wasn't able to visualize where it could go. Jason's been great helping me out there.IBD: Since before the 2016 elections, the fund has swung toward cyclical stocks, then growth stocks, then back to cyclicals. How has that worked for the fund?Weiner: In 2016 growth didn't perform well and we didn't get paid for owning them. We got it all back in 2017 for the first three-quarters of the year. In the last quarter those leadership names took a breather. But I think it's healthy because we don't want a bubble.We stuck with growth. Now our job is to look forward into 2018 and figure out how to extend the process. No matter what the short-term gyrations are, how do we stick with names that are growing earnings and adding value?IBD: What's been the biggest change in the market during your career, Jason?Weiner: When I started at Fidelity in 1991, I was a junior analyst picking small-cap names. There was an inherent advantage because small companies were where you found little trees that grew into big trees.Today, it's completely the opposite. The only companies growing fast are the biggest companies in the world, companies with market caps of $500 billion. That's really driven by internet economics. This is very different, very unique.IBD: And you still look for the best growth opportunities, with an overlay of valuation sensitivity?Weiner: That hasn't changed. We look for undervalued growth stories and stocks with the potential for price-to-earnings (P/E) expansion, while avoiding names that have unreasonably high valuations or deteriorating business fundamentals.IBD: Asher, what changes will you make while Jason is out?Anolic: Aside from the fact that I don't love the decor (which drew laughter from both Anolic and Weiner), I expect changes in less than a quarter of the holdings. Jason has constructed the portfolio with a two-year horizon. We've tested lots of what-if scenarios. Nothing should surprise us. If something does crop up out of left field, I will adjust. But the fundamental approach will not change.IBD: Does Facebook still meet your valuation check box?Weiner: It's valuation is a lot higher than a year ago. It occurred because they grew fast. Earnings went up. They're touching 1 billion people a day with News Feed, their main product. You can sell a lot of advertising when you touch over 1 billion people a day.I still think they will improve their ad targeting. So fundamentals are intact. Can I find better value elsewhere (in another stock)? That search goes on every day. After the big move in these (internet) names in the last year, that conversation is a little more intense.IBD: With Amazon, you're comfortable that their spending will pay off within a reasonable period?Weiner: If you say retail as we knew it is dead and the retail of tomorrow is being invented as we speak, which companies are at the forefront? It is Alibaba and Amazon.We like to take a company's profit-and-loss statement and break down the business units. For Amazon, it's domestic retail and international retail and Amazon Web Services. How is each performing? What are their opportunities? With the investments they make, what will future earnings be like?IBD: Asher, what would you add?Anolic: AWS is cost intensive, more than the rest of Amazon. But it has taken a ton of market share, and has good margins and good cash flow. It's at the forefront of a major technological shift.IBD: Any more thoughts about Alibaba?Weiner: I look at Amazon and Alibaba as a pair. You want to distill the thoughts of Alibaba's Jack Ma (founder and executive chairman) and Amazon's Jeffrey Bezos (founder, chairman and CEO)? Looking at them together is helpful to understanding what those visionaries are doing. Just one part of that is inventing a new world of retail.IBD'S TAKE: For the latest news and analysis of Chinese stocks, visit IBD's special section about Chinese stocks to buy and watch.IBD: Does Five Below defy the problems of many brick-and-mortar retailers by discounting and by focusing on a teen audience?Weiner: It's too small to worry about, but I will tell you this: It's like Dollar Tree (DLTR) plus a treasure-hunt thing. Mom can bring her kids, who go to the $5 basketballs while mom goes to the $5 makeup aisle. I remember the CEO saying once, ""This is the only store where you can bring your kids and not have any fears.""IBD: Red Hat is the top provider of open-source Linux software for corporate data centers. Is that like being the top buggy-whip maker?Anolic: With the move to the cloud, people are worried about Red Hat's growth prospects. If you have a Linux operating system for several servers, but then you move a lot of that data to AWS or Google Cloud or Microsoft (Azure), you don't need all of those servers or that operating system.But Red Hat's core Linux business is still fantastic. Much in the cloud runs on Linux. And Red Hat is reinventing its business. They have a new product that can write programs on top of the Red Hat system and port them to different clouds. It gives CIOs the flexibility of not getting locked in to one cloud vendor. This gives some visibility to how Red Hat looks in a cloud environment. We're going to keep monitoring it. It's a fascinating solution.IBD: What business hasn't been totally disrupted, but could be eventually?Weiner: Digital payments. Payments in general have entrenched players like Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) and card-issuing banks like Citi (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) and merchant acquirers like First Data (FDC) and Global Payments (GPN). That system has been built over decades.But PayPal has given us a taste of disruption. We've all used PayPal at checkout. Can they take that beachhead and expand into the payment space? They've already got Venmo in people-to-people payments. And they own Braintree, which (provides mobile and web payments acceptance and processing for) merchants. (The payments space) feels ripe for disruption.IBD: Why do you like Copart (CPRT)?Weiner: It's a duopoly (with KAR Auction Services (KAR)), a great business. Hurricane Irma rolls through (the Caribbean and) Florida, Harvey hits Houston, and 100,000 cars get wrecked. They get disposed of through auto auctions. Copart is family run, has super profitability and super acquisitions. When cars get totaled, sometimes the scrap value is higher than a resale value.IBD: Asher, you're continuing to run $784 million Select Pharmaceuticals (FPHAX). What's the biggest change in joining Jason at the helm of Growth Discovery?Anolic: Jason has been helpful in teaching and generous with his time. So I'm totally up to speed on what is needed. And we worked together before I was named co-manager, so I was familiar with how he runs money.The biggest change is moving from one sector to the whole market. Six months of partnering doesn't teach you everything that someone running for 20-plus years has learned. But the skill set I've built allows me to understand day-to-day market moves and how to learn as I go.IBD: Jason, was Asher's apprenticeship long enough?Weiner: Asher is an experienced investor. And the way the fund (Growth Discovery) is built, 70% of its assets are in the top 40 names, so Asher only has to learn about 40 names to understand nearly three-quarters of the portfolio. Also, Asher already knew some names from his work on other mutual funds. And we have a huge amount of research support.IBD: Jason, will you be able to hit the ground running when you return in May or so?Weiner: I think I'll be raring to go. I'll have had a nice break, but it will be nice to get back to business.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:2018 Stock Market Forecast: Smaller Price Gains, With A Foreign TiltHot Fidelity Fund Owns Stocks Like Tencent That Jumped Friday

60,DLTR,"Dollar General (DG) reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and sales early Thursday, a day after another top-rated discounter, Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI), reported strong Q3 numbers but weak guidance.X Earnings rose 17% to 98 cents a share, excluding a 5-cent impact from recent hurricanes.

61,DLTR,"The $8.3 billion American Century Growth Fund (TWCGX) is feeling its oats. The fund was up 30.92% this year going into Thursday, thanks in part to gains by aerospace giant Boeing (BA), up 91% this year; video game provider Activision Blizzard (ATVI), up 80%; and robotic surgical systems maker Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), up 72%.X The fund's gain is better than double its 12.37% three-year average annual gain. And it tops the 28.01% average this year by his large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct as well as the S&P 500's 22.04% gain.Information technology and consumer staples were the fund's first and fifth largest sectors as of Nov. 30, with weightings of 41% and 9% respectively. That reflects the outlook expressed by managers Gregory Woodhams and Justin Brown, who noted in their Sept. 30 commentary that growth prospects appear strong in tech and that valuations in consumer staples are compelling.Those factors matter to the managers because they seek to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and improving but whose share price performance does not fully reflect those traits.Activision is one of the fund's tech holdings. So are Facebook (FB) and Applied Materials (AMAT). The latter two both happen to be members of the IBD 50 list of top-performing growth stocks. Facebook is also a member of Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play moves of top stocks.Trading around 178, Facebook shares are up 55% so far this year. IBD readers see that Facebook is in a buy range from a prior 175.59 flat-base buy point. Big volume during its Nov. 29 slide was a bad sign, but the stock is holding up so far. The number of daily active Facebook users has climbed above 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform is pulling in the bulk of the company's total advertising revenue.The managers like Activision because it's a video game publisher that they think should continue to benefit from an ongoing shift to online subscription models, away from reliance on console-based video games. The shift to a subscription model tends to boost a business's margins.American Century research shows that capital spending by semiconductor companies is rising. Applied Materials is a semiconductor equipment provider that is seeing rapid growth due to increased demand for chips used in artificial intelligence and big data applications, Growth Fund's managers told shareholders.IBD'S TAKE: Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and others are racing to develop artificial intelligence hardware and software. Bookmark IBD's AI page to follow the latest developments.In consumer staples, the fund's managers noted that Dollar Tree (DLTR) is bucking the trend of weakness among brick-and-mortar retailers. Dollar Tree benefits from focusing on lower-income consumers, the managers said. And the company has boosted its results due to its acquisition of the Family Dollar chain.Dollar Tree shares are up 41% so far this year. Earnings per share grew 10%, 37% and 40% the past three quarters.Wal-Mart Stores' (WMT) earnings per share inched up a modest 2%, 1% and 2% the past three quarters. That reflects the competitive challenge faced by brick-and-mortar retailers in general as they compete with online retailers such as Amazon (AMZN) — which is also a holding of this American Century fund.Wal-Mart sales rose 1%, 2% and 4% the past three stanzas. Yet Wal-Mart shares are up 43% so far this year. Why such bullishness by investors? In the third-quarter, reported last month, Wal-Mart's U.S. e-commerce sales jumped 50% and gross merchandise volume leapt 54%. The company appears to be learning how to compete online.As IBD recently reported, Wal-Mart's 2016 acquisition of Jet.com has beefed up its online capabilities. And acquisitions in 2017 such as ModCloth, Bonobos, Moosejaw, are helping the megastore build its indie and fashion cred. Those enabled the firm to beat Q3 forecasts last month and give upbeat holiday-quarter guidance.Wal-Mart also announced last month that it will start to sell Lord & Taylor's department store products on Walmart.com. That will broaden its assortment of products and fashionable apparel, IBD has reported.American Century Growth appears poised to continue its run by aiming for leadership stocks. Seven of its 10 largest holdings as of Sept. 30 had IBD Composite Ratings in the 90s. So did two of its five top new buys. A third top new buy had a Comp Rating of 89. IBD's Composite Rating is scored on a scale of 1 to 99. Stocks poised to move higher often have a Comp Rating of 95 or higher. RELATED:How The New Tax Bill Affects YouYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Growth was also up sharply from Saturday and Sunday, which brought in a total of $5.12 billion online, up 10.1%.So which stores are racking up major sales, and which ones are desperate for shoppers?Toys and gadgets were predictably hot on Black Friday: the Nintendo (NTDOY) Switch, Hatchimals and Colleggtibles, PJ Masks, L.O.L. Surprise Dolls, Ride On Cars, and Google (GOOGL) Chromecast and Roku (ROKU) streaming devices were top sellers, said Adobe.Computers, TVs and toys were the most discounted products on Friday, and shoppers looking to complete their holiday shopping will likely find great deals on toys again today, as toys are expected to get the biggest price cuts on Cyber Monday. Piper Jaffray said Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) was the busiest store its analysts visited in both Minnesota and Texas over the weekend.""Overall, we think (Thanksgiving/Black Friday) was strong even though it continued to be diluted by online sales and earlier sales that began in early November and heightened the weekend before (Black Friday),"" wrote B. Riley FBR analyst Susan Anderson. ""However, given the cold spurt in early November we believe outerwear was a big purchase early on which left room for apparel purchases over BF, particularly given the new fashion cycle.""At the mall, American Eagle (AEO) (and its Aerie brand), Build-A-Bear Workshop, L Brands' (LB) Pink and Gap (GPS) chain Old Navy came out on top on Black Friday, she said, ""managing sales/promos that should lead to good top lines and bottom lines.""Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Abercrombie-owned Hollister also merited callouts from Anderson, although traffic at both stores was lower than that of the top performers.

Brick-and-mortar traffic fell over 7.5% on Black Friday, and same-store retail traffic fell over 3%, according to Cowen, citing national traffic devices.

The DOJ has asked AT&T (T) to sell off Turner Broadcasting or its DirecTV satellite business to gain approval.

81,DLTR,"The stock market ended modestly lower Thursday as retail stocks received the most attention, while the Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 continued to battle for support at the 50-day moving average.XAt the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed losses of 0.1%-0.2%. Small caps outperformed, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%. Preliminary data showed volume on the NYSE and Nasdaq coming in slightly higher than Wednesday's levels.Late Wednesday, the Federal Trade Commission cleared a merger between Amazon.com (AMZN) and Whole Foods Market (WFM), and Amazon promptly announced plans to cut prices at Whole Foods. That fueled sell-offs in food retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST), Target (TGT) and Kroger (KR). Kroger fared the worst, falling 8%, while Wal-Mart, Costco and Target showed losses ranging from 2% to 5%.Cisco Systems (CSCO), Merck (MRK) and Chevron (CVX) held up well in the Dow with gains of around 1%.Big earnings movers in the retail sector included two heavily shorted stocks: Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and Guess (GES). Shares of Abercrombie surged 16% while Guess vaulted 18%.Earnings also lifted shares of retailers Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Michaels Companies (MIK) and Burlington Stores (BURL), but all four closed near session lows after a strong start.Friday could be an interesting session depending on what comes out of the Fed's Annual Economic Symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Fed Chair Janet  Yellen and European Central Bank President Mario Draghi are speaking Friday. The Fed is about to start shrinking its $4.5 trillion balance sheet after years of quantitative easing to stimulate the economy. The ECB, meanwhile, could be ready ease back on its bond purchases amid signs of economic improvement.Among the day's gainers in the stock market today, Sodastream (SODA) gained nearly 2% to 60.39. After falling 7% below a 57.78 buy point, the stock found support at the 50-day moving average and is back near highs. Initially, Sodastream was known for its carbonation system for making soda drinks at home, but as soda has become less popular among consumers, the company's sparking water offerings are enjoying strong demand.Finally, for a good example of what institutional selling in a stock, check out shares of Ulta Beauty (ULTA). The former leader reported earnings after the close, and slumped 9% in early after-hours trading despite beating profit estimates. Growth prospects for the retailer remain solid, but its technical picture has weakened considerably after several above-average volume weekly declines since June.RELATED:Amazon Will Cut Whole Foods Prices Monday, Integrate Prime: Grocery Stocks Slammed2 Hot Mining Stocks Break Out Into Buy Zones As Metals RallyUlta Beauty's Q2 Earnings: Dud Or Double-Digit Comps Growth?

Small caps led the upside with iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) up 0.2% and iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) up 0.1%.Retail was the big winner among sector plays. SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) gapped up and rose nearly 2% as it aims for a third straight advance. Component stocks Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), Guess (GES) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were among retailers scoring big gains following their earnings reports.Telecom, biotech and real estate ETFs also made solid advances. But most oil, utilities and consumer staples lagged. VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) fell 0.4%, while SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) rose 0.4%. United States Oil Fund (USO) and PowerShares DB Oil Fund (DBO) sank about 2% each.Gold plays were mixed.

SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) pulled back 0.3% and 0.2%.West Texas intermediate crude prices slid 2.4% to $47.25 a barrel; gold futures eased 0.2% to $1,291.70 an ounce.Two funds that invest in opposite ends of the Standard & Poor's index spectrum are seeking support at their 50-day moving average lines. Both have Apple (AAPL) ties.Pursuing big-cap companies is iShares S&P 100 (OEF), which tracks the S&P 100 Index, the 100 largest U.S. equities. The fund, which will mark its 17th anniversary in October, has amassed $4.8 billion. It advanced 3% from a prior bounce off the 50-day line in early July.Technology, at 24%, accounted for the biggest chunk of assets as of Aug. 21, followed by 17% in financial services, 15% in health care and 10% each in consumer defensive and consumer cyclical, according to Morningstar Inc. The top five holdings represented 19% of assets: Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The average market cap of stocks in OEF's portfolio is $191.4 billion, well above the $113.2 billion average of Morningstar's large blend category. Turnover is at the low end, at 4%. Its expense ratio is 0.20%.As you'd expect, the fund's performance has been largely in line with the S&P 500. It returned 10.5% year-to-date through Aug. 23; the S&P 500 returned 10.9%. OEF's 15-year return is 7.9% vs. the benchmark index's 8.6% gain.Since it targets the fastest-growing stocks in the S&P 500, Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG) holds many smaller-cap names.

83,DLTR,"U.S. stock indexes stumbled midday Thursday as the economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo., convened. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will speak Friday.XThe Nasdaq lost 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 rose 0.4%. Volume in the stock market today was slightly lower on the NYSE but higher on the Nasdaq.Yellen's speech isn't expected to offer much new. Perhaps more important than her speech is the growing realization that Yellen may be replaced when her term expires in early February. This naturally creates uncertainty in the market.Still, the stock market had some intense pockets of strength midday Thursday.Fiber optics midcap Lumentum Holdings (LITE) popped almost 3% higher in heavy volume as the stock approached its 50-day line. The stock fell under its 50-day line in early August despite topping earnings estimates Aug. 9. The bottom has fallen out for the fiber-optic stock group. Three weeks ago, the group was No. 1 among 197 industry groups. But now it is ranked in the middle of the pack, around No. 100.For Lumentum, the pullback could be a blessing. The stock's recent consolidation was late-stage, but the stock recently undercut the lows of the consolidation. This resets the base count if Lumentum were to form a new consolidation.On the downside, Stamps.com (STMP) sagged 3% in brisk volume. The stock gapped up  35% on Aug. 3 after topping the consensus view on earnings. But Stamps.com has had difficulty adding to that gain.One bright spot in Thursday's market was retail. Among IBD's 197 industry groups, seven of the day's top 15 groups were retail. Leaders included discount retailer Dollar Tree (DLTR), up 9%; apparel chain Guess (GES), up 18%; department store J.C. Penney (JCP), up 4.5%; jewelry retailer Signet (SIG), up 20%; and Michaels (MIK), up 13%.The problem with the retail stocks is that most are beaten down. Big gains don't mean as much to growth investors when they come deep off highs rather than making new highs.Blue chips were mostly up, with advancing issues outnumbering declining issues by an 8-3 ratio in the Dow Jones industrial average. Cisco Systems (CSCO) held the day's biggest gain in the Dow, up 1.1%. Cisco is working on a 12%-deep consolidation but is below its 50-day and 200-day lines. The stock needs to build the right side of the pattern.Cisco has been a rangebound dud since rebounding to a short-term high in 2004. Resistance has repeatedly emerged in the low 30s. But since December, resistance has emerged at 34 and support at 29-30. Bulls would like to see Cisco break above 34 and turn the old resistance area into support.RELATED:Dow's Hottest Stock Has An Entry Point3 Dividend Stocks That Could Offer Entries

The Nasdaq also lost 0.1% after briefly retaking its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 continues to contend with resistance just below that line.Economic news Thursday leads off with the start of the international Economic Symposium at Jackson Hole, Wyo., and with the Labor Department reporting jobless claims rose slightly, but held at the low level of 234,000 in the week ended Aug. 19. That was an uptick from the prior week's 232,000 claims, but below economist projections for an increase to 237,000.July existing home sales fell 1.3% to an annual rate of 5.44 million, the Commerce Department said. That was below views for 5.565 million.Apple (AAPL) turned down to fall 0.2%. A CFRA research report late Wednesday argued that estimates for iPhone average sale prices were too low. The stock remains in a buy range above a 156.52 buy point.FANG stocks also gave up early gains. Netflix (NFLX) was flat. Amazon.com (AMZN) lagged, down 1% after news late Thursday that the Federal Trade Commission would allow Amazon.com's (AMZN) merger with grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM). Whole Foods rose 0.7% in early trade.Retailers exerted a strong early influence on the session, with Home Depot (HD), down 0.4%.After each reported quarterly results, Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) soared 13%, Guess (GES) 15%, Dollar Tree (DLTR) 8%, sports apparel chain Tilly's (TLYS) 5% and kitchenware shop Willliams-Sonoma (WSM) nearly 4%.Signet Jewelers (SIG) bolted 20.5% higher after knocking second-quarter expectations out of the park. The big move drove shares back above their 10-week moving average, but the stock reamains deep in a 21-month decline.Burlington Stores (BURL) vaulted 5% in morning action. Its second-quarter earnings soared 39%, well above analyst estimates. Revenue narrowly topped views and management offered strong guidance. The stock has posted five weeks of very tight weekly closes, as it forms a possible bottom to a three-month consolidation.Foods producers were having a tough morning, as Hormel Foods (HRL) stumbled 7% lower and JM Smucker (SJM) dropped nearly 8%.

85,DLTR,"Stocks rolled into the first real week of the earnings season with mixed feelings, as names like Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) backed away from early highs but remained positive, with Netflix shares soaring in after-hours action on its Q2 results.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 all closed within 0.03% of their starting position. Small caps had a shade more momentum, lifting the Russell 2000 index 0.1%.A weak reading on a New York-region manufacturing gauge and signs of more possible regulatory intervention in China's markets may have rattled investors early in the session. But investors were also looking toward Netflix's Q2 report and the week's increasingly busy earnings schedule, and the market was due for a breather after last week's strong performance.Specialty steel makers were at the top of the sessions best-performing industries, led by Carpenter Technology's (CRS) 6% gain. Retail and mining groups posted many of the day's strongest moves. Macy's (M), Conn's (CONN) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) figured powerfully in those advances.Netflix bolted 8% higher after reporting strong subscriber growth and guidance despite weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings.Apple notched its seventh straight advance, retaking its 50-day moving average, although a retreat from early highs left the stock below the session's midway mark, only pennies above the 50-day line in a weak-volume move.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) each rose 2%, helping boost the Nasdaq 100.On the Dow, Apple couldn't outpull IBM (IBM) and JPMorgan (JPM), which each dropped more than 1%.Trucking fleet operator J.B.

92,DLTR,"X Amazon (AMZN) is acquiring upscale grocer Whole Foods Market (WFM) for $42 per share in an all-cash deal worth $13.7 billion, including the grocer's net debt, the companies announced Friday. The deal makes Amazon a huge player in the brick-and-mortar grocery business, sending shares of grocers and other big food sellers down sharply.Whole Foods Market will continue to operate stores under its brand, and CEO John Mackey will stay on in the top spot, according to the official statement from Amazon. The company's headquarters will remain in Austin, Texas.""This partnership presents an opportunity to maximize value for Whole Foods Market's shareholders, while at the same time extending our mission and bringing the highest quality, experience, convenience and innovation to our customers,"" said Mackey.Amazon shares rose 2.4% to 987.71 on the stock market today. Whole Foods shares rose 29.1% to 42.68, slightly above the offer price. Several big Whole Foods investors said Amazon's bid was too low and looked for another buyer to swoop in.The deal is expected to close in the latter half of the year.Grocery-store operators Kroger (KR) and Albertsons were other names speculated to be mulling a bid.Jana Partners disclosed an 8.3% stake in Whole Foods in April, calling shares ""undervalued and represent an attractive investment opportunity,"" and was said to be nudging the grocer toward the exploration of a sale.Amazon already controls an estimated 1.1% of the $795 billion food and beverage business through various Prime offerings, including Pantry and its fresh-grocery delivery service, Fresh. Wal-Mart (WMT), including Sam's Club, leads with 21%, according to a March 2016 analysis from Cowen analysts John Blackledge and Oliver Chen.IBD's TAKE: As we said a year ago, Amazon's next big growth play would surprise you. Even before the Whole Foods acquisition, Cowen estimated that Amazon's grocery volume would rocket to $23.2 billion five years from now, up from an estimated $8.7 billion in 2016.Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer, is a distant second with a 9% market share. Albertson's/Safeway, Costco (COST) and Publix round out the top five with low- to mid-single-digit shares apiece.Kroger, which crashed 19% Thursday after slashing its full-year profit guidance, tumbled 9.2% on Friday, hitting a three-year low.

93,DLTR,"X Amazon.com's (AMZN) planned $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market (WFM) would put the resources of a $470 billion company with a massive delivery infrastructure behind the growing demand for better, fresher ingredients and seems likely to upend the way Wall Street thinks about companies that have anything to do with food.The planned merger marks a ""seminal moment in the world of eating,"" RBC analyst David Palmer said in a research note, calling the combined company a potential ""category killer"" in home meals.""Virtually all of the companies in coverage — both in the food and the restaurant space — should be huddling up about the long-term implications,"" he wrote.Prior to the deal, some eateries were making moves in e-commerce. Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and Papa John's (PZZA) have already worked digital ordering into deliveries, while fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD) have also made a push into delivery and mobile ordering.The merger seems almost certain to deepen the bruising price war between chains like Kroger (KR), Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT) as an oversupply steers supermarkets toward discounts.Weaker demand in Asia and Europe has in recent years contributed to an oversupply of dairy, while cyclicality has pushed beef prices lower, spurring price cuts to move items off shelves more quickly.Meanwhile, discount European grocers like Aldi and Lidl plan to expand in the U.S., which could bring lower prices for shoppers but also lower profits for the industry.But in Amazon, the industry now faces a retailer that can ""price aggressively, and the smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain,"" Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha said in a statement.Amazon's move also seems likely to hasten consolidation in the industry, Chadha added. Rumors have persisted through the year that Whole Foods or Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) were possible takeover targets by Albertsons.For now, news of Amazon's plans to barrel into the grocery business proved merciless to shares of many of its rivals-to-be.Shares of Kroger tumbled 9.2% to finish at 22.29 on the stock market today, but closed well off intraday lows. On Thursday, the stock sank nearly 19% after Kroger slashed earnings guidance but vowed not to ""lose on price."" Target fell 5%, and Wal-Mart, whose own discounts have escalated the price war in supermarket aisles, dropped 4.7%. Sprouts sank 6.3%. Grocery store operator and distributor SuperValu (SVU) crashed 14%, and distributor United Natural Foods (UNFI) lost 11%.The Amazon-Whole Foods deal would create a top-five grocer in the U.S., but it wouldn't be without challenges. Fresh groceries are lower-margin and require more work to handle.UBS analyst Michael Lasser said in a research note that wholesaler Costco (COST) could be protected from Amazon's move. He added that dollar stores Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) serve rural areas, where consumers have limited resources or are just looking for quick, fill-in trips.""Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared,"" he said. ""We would use this as a chance to parse through the noise.""Cowen analysts in March said the intersection of food sales and digital technology could drive U.S. e-commerce growth over the next five years. Their survey data said that younger consumers, who do more through their smartphones, were ""leading the U.S. shift"" and that U.K. survey data suggested ""3x more online grocery purchasers than the U.S., a positive indicator for U.S. adoption.""As more analysts speculate about retail's connected future — with the store perhaps not vanishing completely but sharing more space with online and mobile shopping — an Amazon-Whole Foods tie-up could help normalize a kind of shopping that bounces data from the price-tags in the store to the device in your pocket.""Amazon now has a high-end retail space where they can truly experiment with IoT, retail analytics, behavioral management, and consumer tracking techniques,"" Stephen DiFranco, an investment advisor to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, said in an emailed statement.As also stated in that email: ""You will never be alone in aisle 6 again.""RELATED:What Amazon's Whole Foods Deal Means For RetailCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Wal-Mart Beefs Up Online Ops With $310 Million Bonobos Deal 
"
94,DLTR,"X Unhinge jaw, devour Whole Foods Market (WFM). Amazon's (AMZN) latest acquisition is its largest ever at $13.7 billion, and one that promises to shake up the retail space — though exactly how is unclear.A combined Amazon and Whole Foods Market would create the fifth largest U.S. grocery retailer behind Wal-Mart (WMT), Kroger (KR), Costco (COST) and Albertsons/Safeway, said Cowen analyst John Blackledge in a Friday note.As Investor's Business Daily has previously reported, Amazon's foray into the grocery aisle isn't new. Through Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry, Amazon already has some level of grocery-delivery built into its fulfillment strategy, though the complexity of handling produce and perishables at its fulfillment centers means that the rollout has been relatively slow.It was not until the latter half of 2016 that Amazon ""meaningfully ramped up its expansion efforts"" to be in approximately 20 major U.S. markets, wrote Blackledge in an earlier report from March.Engulfing Whole Foods now brings 460 additional brick-and-mortar locations in the U.S., Canada and the U.K., and around 87,000 more employees to Amazon's arsenal. Whole Foods raked in $16 billion in sales in fiscal 2016.That expanded presence in the real world could mean all manner of retail ripples. Amazon could use the acquisition to increase its product offering through Prime Now or expand its beta-tested curbside pickup offering, among other things, noted Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson. The e-commerce titan could also incorporate its private-label items, ""compressing costs and removing differentiation currently enjoyed by retailers like (Wal-Mart).""Whole Foods will expand Amazon Fresh's potential footprint to most of the U.S., especially in upscale areas, Olson added. ""We believe Amazon can therefore launch nationwide grocery delivery coverage within 12-18 months.""For Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), ""it will likely complicate its delivery partnership with AMZN through Amazon Prime Now,"" wrote UBS analyst Michael Lasser. Amazon and Sprouts announced a Denver grocery delivery partnership on Thursday.Additionally, ""we consider it to be a negative read for (Target), as it could further complicate its efforts to gain traction creating a stronger, better-for-you food offering in its stores,"" he said.The buyout could also increase the existing allure of Amazon's Prime membership.In the cybersphere, Amazon Prime was already the ""most used"" platform to buy groceries online in 2016, according to a Cowen survey from March. Prime's 47% share outguns Wal-Mart 39% piece of the pie, and Cowen's Blackledge added that the U.S. grocery retail market is ""greatly underpenetrated online,"" projecting earlier this year that online grocery sales could reach $177 billion in 2022, up from an estimated $71 billion this year.And there appears to be plenty of room to grow within Amazon's own ecosystem: Consulting firm Magid said only 13% of Prime subscribers buy groceries on Amazon.Analyst reaction has been swift. BMO Capital Markets upped its price target on Whole Foods to 42, Amazon's offer price. Oppenheimer raised its target on Whole Foods to 45 from 40, and said it can't rule out the possibility of another bid for the upscale grocer as a defense measure against Amazon.Some investors apparently agree with Oppenheimer. Whole Foods shares shot up 29.1% to 42.68 on the stock market today. Amazon rose 2.4% to 987.71.Calling the buyout a ""somewhat surprising step"" from Amazon, RBC analyst Mark Mahaney also noted surprise that Amazon is wading further into brick-and-mortar retail.The question of what Whole Foods can bring to Amazon appears to be answerable in a dozen different ways. A murkier question appears to be what Amazon can do for Whole Foods.""We could see AMZN perhaps improving WFM's procurement processes, but it's very unclear to us how Amazon would improve the rest of WFM's operations,"" said Mahaney, noting that Amazon ""has typically not bought fixer-uppers.""""So we see substantial execution risk here, offset only by the reality that in the AMZN scheme of things, this is actually a relatively modest acquisition,"" he wrote.UBS' Lasser sees potential for ""deeper price investments"" at Whole Foods, which he says is ""necessary"" to re-accelerate same-store sales growth at the grocer.Looking to Amazon's peer in China might offer some clues about what comes next in the plan.""If you look at Alibaba (BABA) and what they've been able to do in China with the grocery stores that they've invested in, that might be a model, but you don't know because Amazon is always going to be on the forefront,"" ACSI Funds CEO Phil Bak told Investor's Business Daily. Amazon and Whole Foods Market are both holdings in the company's fund.Alibaba recently inked a deal with Chinese supermarket heavyweight Shanghai Bailian Group, which has 4,700 locations in the country, and the China e-commerce giant has an approximate one-third stake in Sanjiang Shopping Club.Amazon ""is not following anyone else's model,"" said Bak. ""They're going to pave the way, and they're going to create a new model for how grocery shopping can be.""One thing is clear: This massive acquisition means that the list of Amazon-proof stores is getting smaller.""As other brick and mortar retailers have come to realize the hard way that competing with Amazon is a formidable challenge, supermarkets will now have to contend with not only competition with each other and nontraditional grocers like Wal-Mart and Target, but with a retailer like Amazon which has the financial capacity to price aggressively,"" said Moody's Vice President Mickey Chadha in an emailed statement, adding that ""smaller regional supermarket chains and independents will bear the most pain.""Kroger, which plunged 19% Thursday after warning on full-year earnings, sank 9.2% on Friday to a two-year low.Wal-Mart, Costco and Target shares also were big losers, along with dollar stores and drugstores with significant grocery operations. Sprouts Farmers Market was down 6.3% after losing 9.4% Thursday.Wal-Mart has been seen as a growing Amazon competitor online, reporting revived e-commerce growth in recent quarters and making several initiatives such as curbside delivery and discounts for in-store pickups. It's also made several online acquisitions, announcing Friday that it will buy Bonobos, an upscale online men's apparel site, for $310 million.But UBS' Lasser said the Amazon news may have a more limited impact on Costco and specialty stores.""COST's limited assortment, low cost structure, and deep private label penetration probably means that its fortunes will be preserved, at least for the foreseeable future,"" Lasser wrote. ""Further, the dollar stores like DG and DLTR tend to serve a customer segment that lives in rural areas or has limited resources or looking for a fill in trip. Thus, those models may not see as much change as is feared.""RELATED:Amazon Is Buying Whole Foods For $13.7 Billion, Roiling SectorAmazon-Whole Foods Merger Could Be 'Category Killer' For Food, EateriesCould Trump-Bezos Tension Imperil Amazon-Whole Foods Deal?Amazon's Next Big Growth Play Will Surprise You

100,DLTR,"X Rallying retailers led a strong-volume session that added a sixth day to the market's May rally and left the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 at new closing highs.The Nasdaq paced the session with a 0.7% gain, aided by a 3% advance from Netflix (NFLX). The S&P 500 followed at a respectable distance, up 0.4%. The Dow Jones industrial average scaled up 0.3%, settling below its March 1 closing high of 21,115.Preliminary data showed volume rising in the session from Wednesday's totals, also a bullish sign.A good day overall for the market had its weak spots, particularly among 0il-related groups, which took seven of the 10 worst losses among industries. Disappointment with a nine-month commitment agreed to by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries this morning in their extension of a December production cap, and by Iran's reluctance to agree to the deal, sent West Texas Intermediate sprawling nearly 5% lower, to below $49 a barrel.Retail groups seized four of the top five gains among industries.Best Buy (BBY) spiked 21% and drove the consumer electronics groups' advance. Strong first-quarter results soothed fears over the so-called Death of Retail, and management boosted its second-quarter revenue and earnings guidance above the consensus views. Best Buy shares were extended following a breakout from a cup-with-handle base in April.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) teased out a 4% gain during the regular session, then shot up 4% in after-hours trade, after reporting its first-quarter results. Ulta shares ended the session just above a 289.37 buy point in a flat base.In discount and variety retail, Dollar General (DG) and Big Lots (BIG) each rose about 3%. Dollar Tree (DLTR) added 1% after delivering weak first-quarter results and Q2 guidance below analysts targets. All three stocks have chart repair work to do.Budget air carriers Spirit (SAVE) and Azul (AZUL) rose 4% and 5%, respectively, leading a rally among airline stocks. Brazil-based Azul, a volatile IPO, is up 8% for the week, but still 11% below the prior week's high and up 15% from its April IPO price.UnitedHealth Group (UNH) led the Dow, rising nearly 2% after announcing its Optum unit would partner with Merck (MRK) to develop and evaluate a model linking drug prices to the outcomes of patients treated with those drugs. The gain sent UnitedHealth to a new high, but the stock remained in buy range above a 172.24 buy point in a flat base.Among FANG stocks, Netflix gapped up 3% to bang out a new high. Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson on Thursday reiterated his overweight rating on Netflix stock and raised his price target to 190 from 166. Netflix is extended after a rebound from 10-week support in April.RELATED:The Top Dog Vs. The Big Threat In Retail Consumer Electronics5 Hot Restaurant Stocks Still In Reach: Investing Action Plan

101,DLTR,"X Stock futures early Thursday morning indicated record highs for the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite at the opening bell.S&P 500 futures rose 0.3% above fair value. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average advanced 0.35%. U.S. crude oil futures reversed from overnight highs near $52 to fall almost 1% to below $51 a barrel after Saudi Arabia said an expected output cut extension at Thursday's OPEC meeting would not involve deeper production reductions.On Wednesday, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite rose to within 0.1% of all-time intraday highs as the Federal Reserve signaled a go-slow approach for paring its massive balance sheet. The Dow Jones industrial average is within 1% of all-time highs. The S&P 500 actually set a record closing high. The big-cap Nasdaq 100 hit an all-time intraday best, with FANG stocks Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) hitting all-time highs and Facebook (FB) climbing more than 1%.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei advanced 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.8% while China's Shanghai composite gained 1.4%.In European trading intraday, the U.K.'s FTSE and Germany's Dax climbed 0.1% while France's CAC-40 rose 0.3%.Recent tech unicorn MuleSoft (MULE) broke out of an initial IPO base on Wednesday, while much-hyped Snap (SNAP) traded near lows. First Solar (FSLR) cleared an entry point as well after a long downturn.MuleSoft shares shot up 8.7% to a record closing high of 25.70, clearing a 24.98 buy point above a handle in an IPO base.MuleSoft — which helps companies integrate their applications, data, and devices — came public at 17 a share in mid-March. Shares shot up 46% in its trading debt, hitting its still-intraday peak of 25.92.MuleSoft is a good example of why investors should wait for new IPOs to form and break out of an IPO base or other bullish consolidation before jumping in.Snap is an even better example, because the Snapchat operator has never presented a proper buying opportunity. Snap, which also came public at 17 in March, had a strong debut and second day of trading. But then the stock fell sharply.Heading into earnings, Snap was starting to show some positive signs but was still not close to a buy zone. Then Snap reported a wider loss and slower user growth than expected, as much-larger Facebook successfully clones popular Snapchat features.First Solar leapt 6.7% to 38.90, hitting a six-month high and clearing a bottoming base with a 37.77 buy point. Solar stocks have been bouncing back in recent weeks after a long slide. SunPower (SPWR) climbed 4% Wednesday after moving above its 200-day line Tuesday for the first time since January 2016.Later today, Several retailers will try to fight the tide of weak industry results or guidance, squeezed by Amazon, Wal-Mart (WMT) and other headwinds.

103,DLTR,"If you want to know how prospects for tax reform look, don't watch President Trump's address before a joint session of Congress on Tuesday evening. Watch this brutal new ad from the National Retail Federation.The retail group, leading a fight on behalf of Wal-Mart (WMT), Costco (COST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others, depicted Republicans as heartless tax-hikers, slapping taxes on ""your car, your food, your medicine, your clothes.""As a bonus, viewers are told, Congress is throwing in its ""new job-killing formula for free.""The border-adjusted tax, or BAT tax as it's called in the NRF ad, would apply a 20% tax on the full value of imports in the House GOP proposal to lower the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%.More than $1 trillion raised by the BAT tax over a decade would pay for the cost of the rate cut. Supporters argue that retailers and their working-class customers wouldn't be hurt by the tax on imports because the dollar would appreciate vs. foreign currencies and neutralize the tax. But economists are divided over whether currencies would fully adjust.IBD'S TAKE: Backers of a 20% border tax say that the dollar would rise about 25%, effectively negating the higher tax bill faced by importers. Yet if that were to happen, the stronger dollar would hurt the U.S. tourism industry — including Trump hotels.House backers of the plan have warned that the border tax is integral to their plan and that tax reform could die without it.To understand why, consider that a plan to cut the corporate tax rate to 25% from former House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp was pronounced dead on arrival by GOP leaders. Deficit-neutral reform, which is needed to pass via reconciliation, would mean cutting prized tax benefits for things like domestic production, research and development, and accelerated depreciation.The only proposals for cutting the corporate tax rate below 25% involve big increases in capital gains taxes, which have attracted few GOP supporters.Wal-Mart fell 1.4% and Dollar Tree 3.7% intraday on the stock market today, as Target (TGT) sold off on its grim earnings and guidance.

113,DLTR,"Business productivity rose at a 3.4% annual rate in the third quarter, tied for the second fastest growth in output per hour worked since the start of 2010, the Labor Department reported on Thursday.Business output rose at an annual rate of  3.5% in the quarter, while hours worked were up just 0.1%. That followed three straight quarters of declining productivity.While the productivity rise was boosted by inventory-building in the quarter, there's good reason to expect better productivity growth to continue after stagnating in recent years. That conclusion comes from a close look at how Wal-Mart (WMT), a prime force behind the last productivity boom, is re-engineering its business processes to meet competitive threats from Amazon.com (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others, while facing the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own pay scale.The key is that Wal-Mart's efficiency gains tend to be contagious when it shares those gains with consumers via lower prices, as it's begun to do again recently. Kroger (KR), Target (TGT) and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.The upshot is that productivity could surprise on the upside, even as economists — including Federal Reserve policymakers — are becoming increasingly sure about a future with low-productivity growth, low economic growth and unusually low interest rates. The latest Fed economic projections in September marked the long-term economic growth rate down to just 1.8% from 2.0% in June.IBD'S TAKE: IBD recently examined a host of ways Wal-Mart is working to streamline its business, from using drones to manage inventories to its new ""Scan & Go"" app. For a closer look, read How Wal-Mart May Revive U.S. Productivity — And Its Own Fortunes.Leaner stockpiles were a big reason productivity growth had been negative in recent quarters, but that was actually a positive sign for productivity growth going forward, because it's partly the result of better inventory management. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.RELATED:Forget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar StoresFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperWhole Foods Soars On Kroger Takeover Rumor, Wal-Mart Plans

114,DLTR,"A future with slow-growing productivity — and by extension, slow-growing incomes — seems close to becoming conventional wisdom. But the strides that Wal-Mart (WMT) is making with technology that streamlines everything from tracking inventory to simplifying check-out suggest a brighter outlook.The retail giant was considered a prime force behind the last productivity boom (think bar codes, scanners and retailer-supplier data links) and the subsequent productivity bust (heavier reliance on temps and part-time workers come to mind).But facing competitive threats from Amazon (AMZN), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG), Target (TGT) and Costco (COST), and the simultaneous challenge of substantially raising its own wage scale, Wal-Mart is re-engineering virtually every aspect of its business. New technologies and strategies have been tested, sending drones flying through warehouses, equipping shoppers with their own scanners and putting apps in the hands of efficiency-seeking store managers. Now sales are on the upswing, though profits have yet to follow, as the pace of change at Wal-Mart is accelerating.The payoff for investors won't be immediate. On Oct. 6, Wal-Mart cut its profit outlook again as it invests heavily to improve operations in stores and online. The stock has a lousy 19 Composite Rating out of 99, which means the stock only outperforms 19% of all other stocks based on earnings, share price performance and other key criteria. The Retail-Major Discount Chains group is No. 190 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart, like many retailers and companies in other modest-wage industries, have seen profit margins pressured amid intense competition and rising wage pressures. But some have thrived. On Thursday, Ulta Beauty predicted earnings growth above 20% through 2019. Read this Investor's Corner primer on profit margins.The good news for consumers is that the retail giant is sharing some of its efficiency gains via lower prices, which means you can expect its efficiency measures to spread to other companies. Amazon may be the most disruptive force in retail, but Wal-Mart's sheer scale still gives it an outsized influence on the economy. Kroger (KR), Target and the dollar stores are feeling heat from Wal-Mart price cuts, the companies have hinted at and analysts have signaled in recent weeks. Even fast-casual restaurants and quick-service chains like McDonald's (MCD) appear to be feeling pressure due to Wal-Mart's grocery price cuts along with its upward pressure on wages, with the cost of eating out rising at a record pace vs. eating in. When Wal-Mart makes up its mind to cut prices and do what it must to accomplish that, suppliers and competitors have little choice but to change the way they do business too.Here's a look at some technology programs underway at Wal-Mart and how they could change the productivity paradigm for retailers and the broader economy.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart is the best stock in its sector, but its Retail-Major Discount Chains group is ranked 190 out of 197 by IBD based on stock performance and Wal-Mart shares aren't near a buy point. For a primer on how to find stocks to buy at the right time, visit IBD University.Wal-Mart CEO Doug McMillon said on the Aug. 16 earnings call that the company will roll out its new self-scan-and-pay technology at all Sam's Clubs this fall, letting members of the discount warehouses ""skip the checkout line.""Customers can use the ""Scan & Go"" app to ring up items as they put them in their shopping cart and see a running receipt total on their phones. The app also handles payment, so customers just show their receipts to greeters on the way out.The technology has been a long time in development. In 2014, the company pulled the plug on a year-old Scan & Go pilot program at 200 Wal-Marts using an app that was only compatible with Apple (AAPL) iPhones.But the company isn't reserving its latest innovations for Sam's Club customers. In June, Wal-Mart rolled out mobile payment technology at all of its 4,600 U.S. locations. It is testing out customer handheld scanning devices provided by the store in a number of Wal-Mart locations, but management has noted the logic of offering the same self-scan capability via smartphone that it's doing at Sam's Club.Scanning items as you put them in your cart relieves one of the frustrations of people who prefer the self-checkout lane. But like shoppers who check out with the help of a cashier, they still face another frustration: Finding bar codes slows everything down.Wal-Mart is experimenting with a technology called digital watermarking that, in the words of McMillon via Instagram in June 2015, ""could transform the way our customers check out.""Digimarc (DMRC), which subsequently confirmed that its bar code technology was the subject of McMillon's post, invisibly embeds bar code information repeatedly over retail packaging so there's no need to locate it or reorient the merchandise before scanning.Adoption of this next-generation bar code, if broad adoption is to occur, must proceed in steps. Bar code scanners must be designed to read the digital watermarking, and Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) and Datalogic are now equipping their scanners to do so.Regional grocer Wegmans has begun using digital watermarking on its private-label packaging in a logical first step before broader adoption by consumer packaging companies. Wegmans, which has 89 stores, expects $2 million in annual savings for every extra item scanned per minute vs. the usual 21, noted Cowen & Co. analyst Robert Stone in a recent research report.The next big breakthrough would be for major producers like Procter & Gamble (PG) to update their packaging. A push from Wal-Mart could certainly provide an impetus, but there's another important catalyst: By mid-2018, food labels of large manufacturers must meet new standards, making nutrition information easier to read, Stone notes.Eventually, Digimarc has said, shopping carts equipped with scanners could read its bar codes when customers put items in the cart.Wal-Mart said in June that it will start using drones to take inventory in its warehouses by late 2016 or early 2017, identifying when stocks are misplaced or running low. The drones will make a one-day job out of work that now takes employees a month to complete, while reducing the risk of accidents, Wal-Mart says.The drones are part of a larger push to manage inventories more efficiently. Wal-Mart, like other retailers including Home Depot (HD), Target and Kohl's (KSS), has been making a big push to keep inventories to a minimum and improve efficiency by rationalizing product selection (such as three sizes of salad dressing instead of six) and having more frequent supplier deliveries. Wal-Mart also is keeping more inventory in distribution centers to facilitate e-commerce shipping. One goal is simply limiting the number of times merchandise has to be moved by an employee from the time Wal-Mart receives a supplier shipment to final purchase.The latest U.S. economic data show that inventories at general merchandise stores fell 0.6% from a year earlier in July. In the short term, better inventory management may hold down economywide output and make productivity look awful, even if it's actually a partial result of retailers making efficiency gains. In the second quarter, leaner inventories subtracted 1.16 percentage points from GDP.Over time, though, inventory efficiencies reduce costs and permit lower prices and, possibly, better product selection. Wal-Mart's own inventories declined 2.9% from a year earlier in the second quarter, including a 6.5% drop in comparable-store inventories, management reported on its August earnings call. Meanwhile, in-stock levels continued to rise, meaning fewer frustrated customers.Now every member of Wal-Mart's in-store management team has a My Productivity smartphone app to request restocking of certain items and check sales trends while they roam the aisles and assist customers.""Prior to My Productivity, management associates were spending thousands of hours in the backrooms of our stores annually,"" wrote Mark Ibbotson, Wal-Mart executive vice president, in a June blog post introducing the new technology. ""That simply cannot be in today's world.""Wal-Mart's latest move to improve productivity, like many of its efficiency gains, involved using old technology in a new way. In early September, the company said it was cutting 7,000 cash accounting and invoicing jobs in its U.S. stores. Instead, the company will use cash recycler machines to count money and will handle invoicing at a central office.Wal-Mart also has been dreaming up new ideas for fixing the age-old problem of unused shopping carts left in the parking lot or cluttering the shopping aisles. This year, Wal-Mart filed a patent for a robot that collects unused shopping carts. A related idea would let customers hail a shopping cart via smartphone.While there's no telling how long it may take that burst of creativity to materialize in stores, the key point is that Wal-Mart is leaving no stone unturned or idea unconsidered to drive productivity and improve the customer experience. On Oct. 6, the company hosted a few dozen companies out of 250 original applicants in a ""Technology Innovation Open Call."" The winners got to pitch their technology solutions for retail, logistics, big data, security and social media.Wal-Mart's efficiency moves have swept through the economy before. An influential McKinsey & Co. study on productivity in the second half of the 1990s found that the retail sector accounted for nearly one-fourth of the U.S. rise, adding that ""more than half of the productivity acceleration in the retailing of general merchandise can be explained by only two syllables: Wal-Mart.""Big information technology breakthroughs, such as bar codes, wireless scanning guns and electronic data interchange with suppliers, came long before productivity took off. Wal-Mart's efficiency gains in that era were as much due to managerial efforts, McKinsey found. The key was that its tech and management changes were both geared toward achieving ""everyday low prices."" Wal-Mart reached a scale that compelled its business partners and rivals to follow suit or risk being left behind.U.S. output per work hour at general merchandise stores, excluding department stores, soared by nearly 150% from 1995 to 2007.But over the past eight years through the end of 2015, productivity in this sector has risen just 3%.What went wrong? A sluggish economic recovery, modest wage gains, and an overabundance of stores as Amazon gained market share. Wal-Mart, which opted to close 154 U.S. stores at the start of 2016, went through a six-quarter string of same-store sales declines through mid-2014 as its customer-satisfaction rankings tumbled.Retailers and other modest-wage employers such as fast-food chains took what might be viewed as profit shortcuts. Wal-Mart reportedly boosted its temp workforce and had understaffed stores. Other employers boosted their ranks of part-timers clocking fewer than 30 hours per week to dodge paying for health insurance or facing a fine under the ObamaCare employer mandate.Wal-Mart's penny pinching hurt sales and productivity, ultimately spurring lower profits and a change in strategy.As the economy nears full employment and employers recognize that cutting corners hasn't paid off, wage gains are picking up as companies try to raise their game. Wal-Mart has been at the forefront, raising its own base wage to $10 an hour, pushing other modest-wage employers to follow suit or suffer low morale and high turnover.Yet whatever productivity gains Wal-Mart is seeing from initiatives launched in the past year or two have yet to catch up to its extra spending on wages and on technology to improve customer satisfaction and narrow the gap with Amazon. While sales rose 3.1% from a year ago at Wal-Mart's U.S. stores in the second quarter, expenses rose 8.3% and operating income fell 6.2%.The company warned last week that it won't turn the corner on earnings growth until 2018, forecasting roughly flat per-share profits next year, prompting some analysts to reel in their price target for Wal-Mart shares. Wal-Mart also said it would scale back plans to grow its U.S. store base, adding just 55 stores in the next fiscal year, compared with 135 this year, while building more distribution centers for online orders.Ultimately, consumers will decide with their feet and their wallets how productive Wal-Mart investments turn out to be. On that score, Wal-Mart's 1.2% same-store increase in customer traffic last quarter looked like a good sign, even as fewer people were shopping at rivals Target and Dollar General.Wal-Mart CEO: Sam's Club Shoppers Can Skip Cashier Off The Charts: Fast Food Inflation Vs.

115,DLTR,"As President Trump, barely a month into his presidency, speaks to the nation on Tuesday night to outline his economic plans, his White House lacks his predecessors' clarity at the same stage about how to achieve its economic policy goals.But that hasn't prevented him from praising his pace as being virtually unparalleled for its productivity. While the credit he's claimed for job creation plans announced by Wal-Mart (WMT), Intel (INTC) and General Motors (GM) has been disputed, investor enthusiasm over Trump's policies has clearly played a role in lifting the Dow Jones industrial average and other market gauges to record highs.But on bread-and-butter economic policy, Trump still seems to be grasping for a way forward at a stage when Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush had already detailed their tax-cut plans and President Obama had signed his stimulus program into law.Reagan detailed his tax-cut plan on Feb. 5, 1981, and signed it into law on Aug. 13, slashing the top marginal tax rate to 50% from 70%.Bush detailed his tax-cut plan on Feb. 8, 2001, and signed legislation on June 7 of that year. Tax rebate checks of $300 per individual arrived in the mail that summer.Obama signed his $787 billion stimulus on February 17, 2009, which included, among other things, extended unemployment benefits, a $400-per-worker tax credit, and funding for infrastructure, energy efficiency and elevated state Medicaid costs.After the GOP election sweep last November, the White House and top leaders in Congress may have helped set unrealistic expectations about what they could accomplish, and how fast. Yet, it's also true that Trump and the GOP are undertaking efforts that carry a higher degree of difficulty.Politically, Obama had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, and passing a stimulus only required assembling a big basket of tax and spending goodies.As Trump's tax plan is expected to do, the Bush tax cuts relied on budget reconciliation, limiting the vote threshold to a simple majority. However, Bush sidestepped the toughest part of reconciliation, which requires that legislation be deficit neutral beyond the 10th year. The trick was to let the Bush tax cuts sunset after 10 years and hope — partly in vain, it turned out — that a future Congress would make his tax cuts permanent.The downside of such an approach is that long-term tax changes can have a much bigger impact on behavior, such as deciding where to locate a manufacturing facility.Bush also was able to sell his tax cut because of the budget surplus and the low federal debt level that he inherited.By contrast, current CBO projections show the deficit surpassing $1 trillion by 2023 and reaching 5% of GDP by 2027. Meanwhile, CBO also says the debt held by the public will balloon by $10 trillion over the next 10 years, hitting $25 trillion in 2027, or 89% of GDP vs. 77% in 2017.The avoidance of deficit-neutral policy essentially meant that no tough trade-offs were needed. On the other hand, the centerpiece of the House GOP approach for cutting the corporate tax rate to 20% from 35% involves a 20% border tax on imports that retailers like Target (TGT) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) are waging war against.IBD'S TAKE: Here's why corporate tax reform could collapse if political opposition kills the House border tax proposal. Trump, who has gone back and forth on the merits of the border tax plan, said on Monday that he wouldn't release details of his tax plan until the budget impact of repealing and replacing ObamaCare is clear.That's the other big anchor weighing on Trump's economic agenda. He faces the challenge of repealing and replacing the signature policy achievement of his predecessor. Despite a failure of the GOP to settle upon any approach for replacing the Affordable Care Act since it was passed in 2010, Trump said on Monday, ""Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.""Nevertheless, Trump declared that the White House has come up with a ""really, really good"" plan to dispatch with ObamaCare. The jury is out until at least Tuesday night. But if Trump can figure out how to make good on the GOP's plan to make ObamaCare better and cheaper, then maybe they can figure out all the pesky details needed to make tax reform fly.RELATED:Trump Prioritizes ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostThe Trump Economy: Jobs, Regulations, Taxes And Trade

116,DLTR,"Boeing (BA) is going to bat for the BAT — the border adjustment tax that is a central part of the GOP plan to cut the corporate tax rate.The controversial Republican tax-reform plan, which would slap a 20% tax on imports but make exports tax-free, has gotten off to a rough start in the court of public opinion. The National Retail Federation has warned that it would raise prices and cause consumer spending to decline, while analysts have said that big importers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Best Buy (BBY) could suffer major hits to profitability.House Republicans, with the help of economists, have countered that an anticipated 20% appreciation of the dollar would neutralize those negative effects, while removing what they call a ""Made in America"" tax.Now big exporters including Boeing and General Electric (GE) are reportedly gearing up to help House Speaker Paul Ryan make that case, and it's not hard to understand why.Consider Boeing: The company paid an effective federal tax rate of 27.7% in 2015, when it had a current tax bill of $2.1 billion, but would have had negative tax liability under the House plan.In 2015, 59% of company revenue came from non-U.S. customers. Given that Boeing does almost all of its manufacturing and sourcing within the U.S., it has limited exposure to the 20% import tax. Meanwhile, the House GOP tax plan exempts exports from any tax. Companies would be taxed on their cash flow, basically the total cost of (non-imported) goods, labor and capital outlays minus U.S. revenue.In effect, Boeing's U.S. cash flow, as far as the GOP tax plan is concerned, would have been dramatically negative once its $56.7 billion in non-U.S. revenue was excluded.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in December that some big exporters ""may pay little or no federal taxes — and may even accrue tax benefits in the form of net operating losses.""Yet some tax experts say the only way to make the House plan work as intended would be for the federal government to write a check to exporters with negative liability.The border adjustment tax would effectively become a trade barrier, doing more to keep out imports than to facilitate exports ""unless cash refunds were provided,"" wrote American Enterprise Institute scholar Alan Viard.William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, wrote that while it may create a ""serious optics problem"" for Treasury to write checks to big corporations, the issue is just one of perception. Because of the exchange-rate adjustment, the House plan shouldn't affect the after-tax profitability of either exporters or importers, he wrote.President Trump initially sounded wary of Ryan's tax reform approach, calling it ""too complicated"" and the wrong medicine for a dollar that is already ""too strong."" But he may have put those concerns aside: White House spokesman Sean Spicer said Thursday that Trump would pay to build a wall on the Mexican border with funds generated by a 20% border tax as part of tax reform. But White House chief of staff Reince Priebus later said a 20% tax is just one option.The outcome of this rhetorical and political battle may be critical in deciding whether Trump can deliver on his plan to cut the corporate tax rate to a range of 15% to 20% from a statutory rate of 35%, among the world's highest. Without the $1.1 trillion in revenue that would come from the border-adjusted tax, analysts say a tax rate of 25% may be the best Trump can do.Boeing shares fell fractionally to close at 167.70 Friday on the stock market today. But they're up nearly 6% for the week, hitting new highs after the aerospace giant topped earnings views.RELATED:President Trump Backs 20% Import Tax To Pay For Border Wall, Aide SaysWal-Mart, Best Buy, Apple Rally After Trump Pans GOP Border Adjustment Tax

117,DLTR,"For the first time since Wall Street began to focus on the GOP's border-tax plan, retailers joined the rest of the stock market in a broad rally on Thursday, lifting the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite to record highs.After a strong day for retail on Wednesday, Dow component Wal-Mart (WMT) shares rose another 1.9% to 69.08 on Thursday, the highest close in more than a month. Dollar Tree (DLTR) surged 3.6%, Gap (GPS) added 2.8%, and Costco (COST) rose 2.6% to an all-time closing high. Dollar General (DG) raced ahead 3.5% to its highest close since Nov. 30 as its former CEO, Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., made waves with his forceful opposition to the border-tax plan. (Wal-Mart retreated 1.5% on Friday as retailers were mixed overall).Meanwhile, fell Dow component Nike (NKE) shares sprinted 2.7% Thursday, retaking its 200-day moving average for the first time since August. Nike added 1.7% on the stock market today to a fresh four-month high. As ex-CEO at Nike rival Reebok, Perdue also must be looking at the border-tax debate from the view of the footwear industry that does most of its manufacturing overseas.Yet even as hopes dimmed for the GOP House plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 20%, funded by a 20% tax on imports, the broad market charged higher on the back of President Trump's comments to airline executives that he'll be announcing a ""phenomenal"" tax plan in the next two or three weeks.Goldman Sachs (GS) helped the Dow claim new heights, rising 1.6% Thursday and 0.5% Friday. Tesla (TSLA) cruised ahead 2.7% Thursday, as it breaks out of a long base, holding its gains Friday.Steel stocks were especially strong Thursday, with U.S. Steel (X) up 8.3%, Steel Dynamics (STLD) 5.7% and Nucor (NUE) 4.6%. All three stocks rose fractionally Friday.Yet assuming Perdue stands firm, the GOP can only afford to lose one more senator to keep the border tax alive. And Perdue didn't appear to leave much wiggle room to reverse his opinion: ""The clear effect of the proposed border adjust tax is an increase in consumer prices,"" he wrote in a letter to colleagues. ""This would hammer consumer confidence and lower overall demand, thus putting downward pressure on jobs.""IBD'S TAKE: Supporters of the border tax plan say that the dollar would rise by 20% vs. other currencies, meaning that it wouldn't harm either corporate profits or consumers. But it does pose a risk to U.S. investors holding shares of companies like Alibaba or international ETFs.The retail stock revival and record high for the major averages raise this question: If the border tax isn't going anywhere, what does Trump have up his sleeve? If the border tax dies, Wall Street analysts have largely concluded that corporate tax cuts would have to be scaled back in a big way to make it through reconciliation, a legislative maneuver that means the GOP can pass tax cuts with only a majority vote if the package is revenue neutral in year 11 and beyond.Without a border tax, some think the effort to cut corporate taxes could collapse. At best, the corporate tax rate might be cut to 25%, but even that might be out of reach.Yet a closer look suggests that investors didn't really get carried away with Trump's mystery tax plan. Even though advancing stocks led declines by roughly 2-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange, Raymond James strategist Jeffrey Saut noted that the percentage of volume going into advance stocks ""was among the lowest in history"" on days when the S&P 500 has hit a 52-week high and closed positive on the day.RELATED:If Border Tax Dies, Trump Corporate Tax Cut May CollapseWhy Tax Reform Could End In Tears For Trump And GOP

119,DLTR,"After a solid month of bad news, Wal-Mart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and other retail stocks were among the biggest winners on Tuesday as doubts emerged over President-elect Donald Trump's plan to slash corporate taxes.Apple (AAPL) also may be seeing a benefit from a disagreement between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan over how to make a big corporate tax cut fiscally viable.Even as doubts about tax reform helped drag down broad stock market indexes on Tuesday, retailers bucked the trend. Wal-Mart rose 1.9% to 68.42 on the stock market today. Best Buy climbed 2.4% to 44.88 and Dollar Tree jumped 3.1% to 79.51. Gap (GPS) rose 2.1% to 24.15.Meanwhile, Apple edged up 0.8% to 120, extending its breakout past a 118.12 buy point to a 14-month high.A plan backed by Ryan and other House GOP leaders would raise more than $1 trillion by imposing a 20% tax on imports, while making exports tax-free and lowering the federal corporate tax rate to 20%.Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Monday, took issue with Ryan's approach. Trump criticized the border-adjusted tax as ""too complicated"" and said it could result in ""a bad deal.""While prospects for corporate tax reform have been one of the key drivers of the Trump stock market rally, financial markets and Wall Street analysts see Ryan's border-adjusted tax as bad news for big importers, with retailers especially hard hit. RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Ciccarelli found that a 20% import tax could wipe out profits at Best Buy and raise Wal-Mart's tax bill by close to $10 billion.While Apple stands to be the biggest beneficiary of a reduced tax rate on profits held overseas, UBS analyst Steve Milunovich has estimated that the company could actually see an earnings drop under the full House GOP approach. Not only would the company face a tax on the value of iPhones it imports to sell in the U.S., but the value of foreign earnings could shrink in dollar terms.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Trump's chief problem with Ryan's plan appears to be the consensus that a 20% tax on all imports would lead to a significant appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies. In weekend comments, he specifically called out China and its weakening currency.""Our companies can't compete with them now because our currency is too strong. And it's killing us,"" Trump said.Trump's comments sent the U.S. dollar index skidding 1.2%, while gold rose 1.6%. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to 2.33%, the lowest since late November, and closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since late September.Trump has vowed to level the playing field for U.S.-based producers by imposing tariffs, threatening a 35% border tax on automakers producing in Mexico for the U.S. market.But he's skeptical of Ryan's approach because economists expect the 20% tax on imports to lead the U.S. dollar to appreciate vs. foreign currencies, neutralizing any competitive advantage from imposing an import tax.Trump's disagreement with Ryan raises a number of questions. If he doesn't back the border-adjusted tax plan, how will the GOP offset the cost of tax reform? Offsets are needed because legislation passed on a partisan basis in the Senate via reconciliation must be budget neutral after the 10th year.Further, does Trump's dismissal of Ryan's plan mean that he's more likely to make good on his threat to hit imports from Mexico and China with 35% to 45% tariffs? Such a fallback could pose even greater risks to retailers and Apple than the border adjustment tax.RELATED:Trump Trade, Tax Talk Hits Dollar As Mexico Warns On TariffsBank Stock Losses Intensify After Trump Rips GOP Tax Plan

120,DLTR,"Wal-Mart (WMT), Macy's (M), Gap (GPS) and other retailers rose Monday as investors sold ""Trump rally"" stocks and perhaps lowered the odds of tax reform that could sock merchants.Wal-Mart rose 1.2% on the stock market today. But that's after Wal-Mart hit eight-month low on Friday. Target (TGT) edged up 0.7%, Macy's 1.4%, Dollar Tree (DLTR) 1.6% and Gap 1.3%.Retailers tumbled at the end of last week after the White House hinted that it might back the House GOP tax reform plan that includes a 20% border-adjustment tax. House Republicans have said they see the border-adjusted tax, which applies to imports but not exports, as a critical part of tax reform because it would raise more than $1 trillion to help pay for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20%. Retailers, which are huge importers, fear the plan will slam their profits.President Trump's immigration order could end up hurting the odds of tax reform and other key parts of Trump's fiscal agenda. That's because with a thin GOP majority in the Senate, he can't afford to alienate potential allies.IBD'S TAKE: Apple and Boeing are among six Dow stocks in buy range to start the week. But three of these blue-chip stocks dipped below entry areas amid Monday's market retreat.Separate from Trump and his tax and trade policies, brick-and-mortar retailers face an near-existential crisis as shoppers continue to shift online.

121,DLTR,"Threats of a trade war intensified over the weekend, as President-elect Donald Trump said the dollar ""is too strong"" and warned BMW that it would face a 35% tariff on imports to the U.S. from a plant it's building in Mexico.Trump's words help sink the U.S. dollar index by 1% vs. other major currencies on Tuesday. Meanwhile, gold prices rose 1.6% to $1,215 an ounce and the 10-year Treasury yield slipped as low as 2.33%, the lowest level since November 29.Following similar threats of a ""big border tax"" aimed at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Toyota (TM), Mexico's economy minister Ildefonso Guajardo indicated the country was preparing to strike back.""It is clear we need to be prepared to immediately neutralize the impact of such a measure,"" he said in a Friday interview on Mexican TV.Guajardo added that Trump's plan to counter the competitive advantage of low-cost countries with tariffs would lead to a global recession.Trump's dollar comments had added significance because they brought out in the open divisions among GOP leaders about how to achieve corporate tax reform.Those divisions might be positive news for retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) that could be hit by House Speaker Paul Ryan's favored approach to corporate tax reform. Yet they raise big questions about how Republicans will be able to offset the cost of tax cuts, which is critically important since budget measures passed through reconciliation must be revenue neutral after 10 years.IBD'S TAKE: The House GOP tax reform that Trump is considering would likely help foreigners holding U.S. stocks and hit U.S. investors in foreign investments, such as Alibaba's ADRs or overseas ETFs.Trump, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Monday, voiced doubts about the House plan for a border-adjusted tax, saying it was ""too complicated"" and could result in ""a bad deal.""Trump's chief problem appears to be the consensus that the a 20% tax on all imports would lead to a significant appreciation of the dollar vs. other currencies.

And it's killing us,"" Trump said.The House plan has come under criticism, and not just from retailers, for potentially violating World Trade Organization rules. Still, some proponents have pitched it as a way to improve U.S. competitiveness without the brunt instrument of tariffs that Trump seems to prefer.One big selling point of the House plan to impose a 20% tax on the value of imports is that it would raise in excess of $1 trillion to offset the cost of lowering corporate tax rates. If Trump rejects that idea, it's unclear how the GOP will be able to make its numbers add up.RELATED:Trump Trade: What He Can Do Legally Vs.

122,DLTR,"President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of cutting the federal corporate income-tax rate and boosting infrastructure spending is giving U.S. investors plenty of positive reasons to stay at home when it comes to stock picking. Now they may get a not-so-positive reason to lighten up on their foreign stock holdings.While the details of corporate tax reform are still far from certain, the House GOP's border-adjusted tax proposal that Trump's team is weighing could create some surprising winners and losers. Among the biggest losers could be U.S. investors holding American depositary receipts of Alibaba (BABA) and other foreign companies. Among the biggest winners may be foreign investors holding U.S. equities.Retailers like Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and others are panicking over the House plan that would impose a 20% tax on the value of imported goods, but not on exports. The fear is that this could be a disaster for retail earnings, as well as for their consumers, who could see big price hikes.Yet economic theory suggests that exchange rates would adjust to balance out the impact of the tax shift. Deutsche Bank expects that the dollar would rise 15% vs. foreign currencies, largely offsetting the higher taxes on retailers. But economics is, of course, a highly uncertain science and other analysts says it's possible that the currency adjustment could be as little as 10% or well above 20%.In other words, Wal-Mart, Target and their peers may have reason to be concerned and, without question, so do American investors holding foreign stocks.Although American depository receipts (ADRs) and the underlying American depositary shares are priced in dollars, they don't provide any protection against currency risk. If the currency of the foreign company's home country suddenly sinks 20%, the American depositary shares immediately fall to reflect that decline.Alibaba's U.S. shares reflect this. While already correcting from late September highs, Alibaba fell sharply after Election Day, as the dollar rallied. Shares continued to slide until late December, about the time that the U.S. dollar peaked. Alibaba and other U.S.-listed Chinese stocks such as NetEase (NTES) have rebounded in 2017, helped by China's central bank intervening to support the yuan.The same currency risk applies to exchange traded funds like KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) that many investors use to invest in a sector. An exception, to at least some degree, are hedged equity ETFs, which aim to neutralize currency risk.IBD'S TAKE: The Trump rally may have arrived at the show-me stage, when markets are looking for confirmation that the positive parts of his agenda will come to fruition. For now the market remains in a confirmed uptrend, which means the risk-reward in buying leading stocks breaking out of consolidations is favorable. Read IBD's The Big Picture each day to see if the uptrend remains intact.Federal Reserve data show that U.S. residents held $7.2 trillion worth of foreign equities, including ADRs, at the end of September. Meanwhile, foreigners held $5.7 trillion worth of U.S. corporate equities, so the stakes in a potentially abrupt currency adjustment aren't small.Wall Street strategists are divided on the odds of the House border-adjusted tax becoming a reality, with Citigroup calling it likely and Goldman Sachs seeing about a 1 in 3 chance. Those odds seem high, considering all the criticism the proposal is coming under, including from some Republicans.Still, there are a number of reasons why Republicans including House Speaker Paul Ryan like this idea. One of the biggest is that a border-adjusted tax could raise more than $1 trillion that would help offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. Without that offset, the GOP could have a hard time delivering a big corporate tax rate cut via reconciliation, which requires just 50 votes but precludes deficits beyond 10 years.RELATED:Trump's Trade Hand: 6 In-Your-Face Cards, No AcesTax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

124,DLTR,"Whole Foods Market (WFM) shares have been in a downturn for nearly three years amid growing competition. But the pioneer in natural and organics groceries shot up 5% on the stock market today.First, Wal-Mart (WMT), which is the largest U.S. groceries seller, said Thursday morning that it would curb new-store growth as it invests in e-commerce. That's good news for a slew of retailers, from specialty discounters such as Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG), as well as grocery chains such as Whole Foods and Kroger (KR).Grocery sellers have been struggling with falling food prices, in part due to renewed Wal-Mart price cuts. That's especially painful for Whole Foods, which has struggled to shake its ""whole paycheck"" reputation. Whole Foods recently opened up a lower-priced chain of stores called 365.Then speculation grew that Kroger, the largest pure-play grocer, was making or mulling a bid for Whole Foods Market.Chatter $40 cash/stock bid for $wfm from $kr.— Mike Bergen (@BergenCapital) October 6, 2016Kroger has stepped up its offerings of organic foods, grabbing market share in recent years. So it's unclear if Kroger would want to make such an acquisition.Kroger and Whole Foods didn't comment on the rumors.In any case, several grocery sellers — including dollar stores, fared well Thursday.Whole Foods Market rose 4.9% to 29.33, its best gain in four months, but found resistance at the 50-day line and still near the lowest levels since early 2011.Kroger stock rose 1.8%, but rebounded from its lowest close in nearly two years.Dollar Tree rose 4% while Dollar General climbed 3.1% -- also rebounding from recent lows. Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), another natural foods grocer, rose 3.5%.As for Wal-Mart, its shares fell 3.2% to 69.36 as the retail giant gave earnings guidance that's below most analyst forecasts. The stock is at its lowest level in more than four months but did close above the 200-day support line.RELATED:Wal-Mart Earnings Forecast Trails Views On Investment SpendingGrocery Chains Reeling From Low Food Prices, Stiff CompetitionKroger Is Latest To Warn On Food Deflation, Doesn't Fear Wal-Mart

125,DLTR,"Retail hardly feels like a safe bet these days. IBD's Retail-Department Stores group finally, briefly, came up for air above their 200-day moving average earlier in August, while off-price darling TJX (TJX) slipped below its 50-day and out of buy range on disappointing guidance.Even discounters aren't a safe space: Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) each took a beating on weaker-than-expected results, as Wal-Mart (WMT) embarks on a price-cutting campaign.In any case, value retailers Five Below (FIVE) and Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) each report quarterly results late Wednesday. Here's what investors should expect.Wall Street analysts are looking for 31% profit growth to 17 cents a share on a 20% increase in revenue to $219.2 million.In Q1, Five Below earnings rose 50%, for its best gain in nearly three years. Revenue rose 25%, with growth accelerating gradually for a third straight quarter.Products at teen-focused Five Below cost between $1 to $5, and include backpacks, headphones, nail polish and the like. There are close to 500 locations of the value chain.Shares of Five Below have mostly been trading below their 50-day line since mid-August, but they remain above their 200-day moving average after decisively finding support at the key line in mid-February.Shares fell 2.5% to 45.26 in the stock market today, a 2-month closing low.Ollie's, which describes itself as ""one of America's largest retailers of closeouts, excess inventory and salvage merchandise,"" has 218 stores around the country and sells everything from designer bed linens to patio furniture to Nascar tickets.IBD'S TAKE: Ollie's has an IBD Composite Rating of 93, which means that it is outperforming 93% of publicly traded companies. Investors looking for a potential entry should take an in-depth look at Ollie's chart action: ""Will Ollie's Stock Get Marked Up -- Or Down -- Ahead Of Earnings?""Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters anticipate 20% EPS growth to 18 cents on 14% revenue growth to $207.6 million.The relatively new issue started trading publicly in July 2015. On Friday, Ollie's stock fell slightly below a 26.65 buy point from a double-bottom base cleared in early August.Shares fell 1.3% to 26.08 on Monday, approaching its 50-day line.RELATED:Forget The Amazon Effect; The Wal-Mart Effect Hits Dollar StoresBig Lots Earnings Jump, But Stock Cuts Key SupportAs TJX Sold Off, This Retailer Broke Out -- But Earnings LoomWhy TJX Stock Could Still Be A Good Buy Despite Off-Price Outlook

126,DLTR,"Big Lots (BIG) easily beat second-quarter profit estimates Friday morning, but shares quickly reversed lower amid ongoing concerns about retailers and discounters in particular.The report followed a steep sell-off in Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The dollar stores missed Wall Street earnings targets, and Dollar General cut its full-year sales forecast amid intense competition, as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) was preparing to slash prices, and as Amazon.com (AMZN) continued to expand its online retail footprint.Big Lots, which operates more than 1,400 closeout stores in 47 states, said Q2 earnings per share minus one-time items climbed 30% to 52 cents, easily topping estimates of 40 cents. It was the third quarter in a row of better-than-expected earnings.Revenue dipped slightly to $1.2 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier, just missing projections for $1.216 billion. Comparable store sales edged up 0.3%.For Q3, Big Lots sees diluted EPS between a 4 cent loss and a 1 cent gain. Consensus is for a 1-cent loss. The company expects sales at stores open more than a year to be flat to up 2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier. For Q4, Big Lots sees adjusted EPS of $2.18-$2.23, with same-store sales flat to up 2%. Analysts had expected Q4 EPS of $2.21.Big Lots has seen weak revenue for more than two years, reporting growth in a range of minus 1% to plus 1% every quarter in that period. Its earnings growth, however, has mostly in double digits due to cost control measures.Big Lots opened higher on the stock market today, but it soon reversed and traded down 4.5% to 50.57 in very heavy volume, below the 50-day moving average. The stock fell 4.3% on Thursday, dropping below its 50-day line intraday but closing above that support area. Thursday's move did push Big Lots slightly below a 53.45 entry point cleared in late July.The high-volume selling below the 10-week line is a clear sell signal.IBD'S TAKE: Retail earnings and stocks have been uneven in recent weeks, with discounters no exception. But one specialty discounter has performed well since its July 2015 IPO and is setting up in a bullish consolidation. Check out this IBD Stock Analysis of Ollie's Bargain Outlet, which reports earnings next week.Dollar General fell 0.15% after closing down 17.6% Thursday.

127,DLTR,"United Natural Foods (UNFI), a longtime grocery distributor to Whole Foods Market (WFM), easily topped fiscal fourth-quarter profit forecasts and gave bullish full-year sales guidance after the close Monday.Estimates: Earnings per share of 63 cents, down 12.5%, on revenue of $2.218 billion, up 7.6%.Results: EPS of 69 cents or 70 cents ex items on sales of $2.21 billion.Prior Quarter: Fiscal Q3 EPS fell 8%, the third straight quarterly decline. Sales rose 1%, the sixth straight quarter of decelerating growth.Outlook: Fiscal 2017 GAAP EPS of $2.53-$2.63 on sales of $9.43 billion-$9.6 billion. Analysts see EPS of $2.69 on sales of $9.39 billion.Stock: Shares were up 0.2% in late trading, down from an earlier 9% surge, after closing up 0.5% at 41.82 in the stock market today. The stock broke out of a cup-with-handle base in June following the organic grocery distributor's last quarterly report, but shares have trended downward since the middle of last month, below their 50-day line.Why It Matters:  United Natural Foods' results will come as the grocery sector deals with an oversupply in some types of food -- particularly meat, poultry and dairy -- that have dragged prices lower and forced grocery stores into more aggressive promotions that some have compared to the industrywide price wars that took place in 2009.SuperValu (SVU), a grocery-store operator and distributor, last week warned about lower food prices and said Wal-Mart (WMT), which is undertaking a big price-cutting campaign, has ""always been a tough competitor."" Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), a natural-foods rival to Whole Foods, also slashed its full-year guidance.Cowen on Monday upgraded Wal-Mart's stock to outperform from market perform and raised its price target to 83 from 76.Some analysts also believe Wal-Mart's discounting has hurt dollar stores. In reporting their quarterly results last month, Dollar General (DG) last month cited retail ""food deflation"" as a problem, while Dollar Tree (DLTR) management spoke of a ""challenging retail sales environment.""And grocery-store operator Kroger (KR) last week attempted to downplay Wal-Mart's effect on sales, but it cut its full-year earnings-per-share forecast due to ""continued deflation."" Telsey Advisory Group on Monday cut its price target on Kroger to 40 to 46. Kroger shares fell more than 2% to 30.82, a fresh 52-week low.IBD'S TAKE: Cheaper groceries have also hurt the restaurant business, with more people opting to save money and eat in. However, Papa John's in recent days has flirted with a buy point. See why stocks like Papa John's and Domino's Pizza are rising above rival restaurants.Sprouts Farmers Market fell 1.2% and Whole Foods shed 0.7%, while Wal-Mart rose 2.3%. Dollar Tree rose 0.9% and Dollar General gained 2.%.

128,DLTR,"Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) on Thursday said increased competition, lower grocery prices and other difficulties weighed on their second-quarter results, which for both companies missed Wall Street's expectations.The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT) starts to cut its own prices, potentially luring away customers who might otherwise head to smaller dollar stores strategically placed within the orbit of big-box Wal-Mart locations. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) has been ravaging clothing retailers and is making more inroads in groceries.""Retail food deflation ... coupled with unseasonably mild spring weather, proved to be stronger than expected headwinds to our business,"" Dollar General CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement. ""The competitive environment also intensified in select regions of the country.""Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser, meanwhile, cited a continued ""challenging retail sales environment"" in the company's second-quarter earnings release. Variations on that phrase -- ""challenging environment"" -- have become a common refrain this earnings season amid heightened concerns about economic security and personal safety.Shares of Dollar General dived 17.6% to 75.61 in the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day average and falling out of buy range. Dollar Tree sank 9.9% to 85.50. Technically, that's back in buy range from a prior breakout, but the high-volume gap down through the 50-day line is a clear sell signal. Wal-Mart dipped 1.4% to its lowest close since June 20 -- just two days after hitting a 14-month intraday high. Amazon ticked up 0.3%.Dollar Tree cut its full-year net sales forecast to $20.69 billion-$20.87 billion from an earlier outlook of $20.79 billion-$21.08 billion. Analysts expected $21.02 billion. However, Dollar Tree raised its full-year earnings-per-share guidance to $3.67-$3.82 from $3.58-$3.80. Analysts forecast $3.79.IBD's TAKE: Cheaper groceries also pose a competitive threat to the restaurant business, potentially forcing restaurants to cut costs. See this story on Middleby, which makes equipment for restaurant kitchens, for more on how restaurants try to contain expenses. Dollar General stuck to its full-year EPS forecast, but said it expected capital expenditures during the year to rise after purchasing 42 Walmart Express stores — Wal-Mart's small-store model that the dollar stores effectively killed.The dollar stores benefit from a smaller-store model, which can be easier to navigate for shoppers seeking to buy only a few items and helps keep labor costs down. But Wal-Mart has stepped up its e-commerce efforts, and its price cuts could force the dollar stores into a downward spiral of discounts to compete more aggressively with each other.""As we spoke to store managers about price competition in March of this year, almost none cited any issues or changes in activity from competitors,"" Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder said in a research note earlier this month.""However, as we went through spring and summer, the responses around increased pricing activity spiked up enough to get our attention. Walmart was often mentioned as the culprit, but we also heard store managers call out direct competition in the dollar store channel.""RELATED:Wal-Mart Re-Thinks Small Format Strategy As Dollar Stores SwarmWal-Mart Pays $3.3 Billion For Jet.com And E-commerce 'Lore'

Volume in the stock market today was running about even with Wednesday's pace. Neither the Nasdaq nor the S&P 500 has had a day of above-average volume in roughly three weeks. The low-volume trend made for an easy comparison for Wednesday's distribution day. Distribution involves a sizable price loss in a major index in rising volume.Buenaventura (BVN) popped 4% higher as the Peruvian gold and silver miner found support at its 50-day line. This was the midcap stock's first break of the 50-day line since it emerged from a cup-with-handle base in early June. Buenaventura lost money in 2014-15 but is expected to turn a profit of 68 cents a share in 2016 and then follow with a 40% earnings pop in 2017.Other gold and silver stocks finding support at the 50-day lines included Vancouver-based threesome Silver Wheaton (SLW), MAG Silver (MAG) and Pan American Silver (PAAS); South Africa's Sibanye Gold (SBGL), and Chicago-based Coeur Mining (CDE).The price of gold has faded some since early July, while the gold miners have been slipping since mid-August.The gold and silver mining group is No. 1 among 197 industry groups. The group was up about 1.8 in afternoon trading Thursday. The worst performer Thursday was the discount and variety retailers, hurt by weak earnings from Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Also on the negative side, chip designer Silicon Motion Technology (SIMO) stabbed under its 50-day line in heavy volume. The stock remains far extended from a March breakout.In economic news, durable goods orders for July were stronger than expected. First-time jobless claims were not as bad as expected.

"
133,DLTR,"Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) report second-quarter earnings this week. Here's what to expect.Dollar General reports on Thursday. Analysts expect the company's earnings per share to rise 15% to $1.09, with revenue increasing 8% to $5.497 billion.Both Dollar General and Dollar Tree use smaller stores to compete with Wal-Mart (WMT).The smaller-store model allows the companies to set up shop without requiring a huge plot of land or a large workforce. The model also allows the dollar stores to set up locations along the way to a local Wal-Mart that can pick off customers who would rather not wander around a massive store to buy only a few grocery items.Dollar General in July even announced that it bought 41 former Walmart Express locations -- part of Wal-Mart's failed attempt to compete with the dollar stores in a small-store format. However, Wal-Mart's sales still dwarf those of the dollar stores, and Jefferies this month downgraded Dollar General, citing recent pricing competition from the company's big-box rival.While the downgrade was not tied to any concerns surrounding Dollar General's second-quarter sales, Wal-Mart's moves could be a threat down the road and weigh on Dollar General's guidance.Jefferies analyst Daniel Binder wrote that ""we did start to see evidence of increased pricing activity from Walmart."" He added: ""Walmart is at the beginning of its price investment campaign, so that risk considered, shares of DG after a big run look less attractive.""Wal-Mart also said this month that it would buy discount e-commerce upstart Jet.com. The acquisition could help Wal-Mart compete with Amazon (AMZN) and strengthen a sales channel that the dollar stores don't really have.Analysts have said that dollar stores have some insulation from e-commerce because it often doesn't make sense for customers to buy only a handful of grocery items online and pay for the shipping costs.Dollar General's stock jumped 4.6% on May 26, the day it reported first-quarter earnings, breaking out of a consolidation with an 87.52 buy point. The stock rose as high as 96.88 on July 27, but then started to retreat. Shares have fallen back below their 50-day line and are now within the 5% buying zone from the 87.52 entry.Shares fell 0.1% to 90.79 in the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Wal-Mart reported rising U.S. same-store sales and faster e-commerce growth last week. But operating profit fell amid rising costs. Wal-Mart warehouse unit Sam's Club has a new scan-and-go app that will shoppers skip the cashier.  Analysts expect Dollar Tree, which also holds its earnings call on Thursday, to report EPS of 73 cents, nearly tripling from a year earlier. Sales are seen jumping 69% to $5.084 billion. The company acquired Family Dollar last year.However, Dollar Tree still has ""considerable work"" ahead in its efforts to improve Family Dollar locations, BB&T Capital Markets said last month. Many dollar stores across the space have gotten makeovers -- an effort that has helped to draw or retain customers and drive sales.BB&T analyst Anthony Chukumba said that some of the Family Dollar stores he visited in the New York area were in ""terrible condition, with rampant out-of-stocks, messy displays and dirty floors.""But he said the revamped Family Dollar locations ""are likely generating much higher sales per square foot and store contribution than their untouched counterparts, which highlights the opportunity for Dollar Tree of upgrading the fleet and implementing consistent store standards chain-wide.""Dollar Tree rose 0.2% to 95.76 Monday. The stock broke out after its latest earnings report in late May and continued climbing. Shares have been finding support above their 50-day line in recent days.Wal-Mart fell 11 cents to 72.70, closing below its 50-day line for a second straight session.

136,DLTR,"The stock market took off thanks to President-elect Donald Trump's agenda of corporate tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation, but the latest headlines signal a likelihood of turbulence ahead as investors examine what JPMorgan analysts call ""radical changes.""CNN on late Wednesday reported that top players in the incoming administration have been kicking around the idea of imposing an across-the-board 5% tariff on imports. Alternatively, team Trump has been weighing support for a House Republican corporate tax change that would indirectly apply a 20% tax on imports, even though it might not pass muster with the World Trade Organization.Trump aides Thursday responded to the CNN report, stressing that no decisions have been made.""The CNN story got a little bit too far out over its skis,"" Trump transition spokesman Jason Miller told reporters. ""The incoming administration is obviously discussing numerous trade deals and tax reform packages with members of our own team as well as members of Congress. But it's too early to go into specific speculation on issues of tariffs or border adjustability.""The report followed the announcement that economist Peter Navarro, who has defended Trump's campaign threat to slap a 45% punitive tariff on Chinese imports, will head a soon-to-be-established White House National Trade Council.On Thursday, shares of major retailers were taking it on the chin. Wal-Mart (WMT) was off 2.3% on the stock market today. Macy's (M) slid 3.6%, Target (TGT) 4.4%, Gap (GPS) 5.4% and Dollar Tree (DLTR) 5.65%. E-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) fell 0.55%. (Retailers also fell on reports of weak holiday sales and traffic).One of the big questions since the election is how Trump will merge his populist campaign themes with a traditional Republican agenda of tax cuts and deregulation. A boost to infrastructure spending and use of the bully pulpit to keep companies like Ford (F) and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), from shutting down U.S. production are two clear ways that Trump aims to stay faithful to his working-class supporters who put him over the top in the Rust Belt. Demanding that Mexico and Canada open up North American Free Trade Agreement for renegotiation is another likely tack. Yet the latest reports offer the clearest indication that Trump may go further than investors have been expecting.It's easy to see why investors are excited about the prospect of a big corporate tax cut. Trump's campaign plan to cut the corporate rate to 15% from the 35% statutory rate could boost S&P 500 earnings by $180 billion, or 16%, figures Jonathan Glionna, head of U.S. equity strategy research at Barclays.IBD'S TAKE: Stocks that stand to benefit from both corporate tax cuts and an infrastructure boost have been among the big winners of the Trump rally. Two of those stocks, Freeport McMoRan and Martin Marietta Materials, are near a buy point. Check out Leaderboard, where IBD's market writers help you find buying opportunities in these and other stocks as they emerge, as well as sell signals to lock in profits.But some companies and sectors could stand to benefit much more than others. Domestic-focused industries like retail and homebuilders, many of which derive 100% of income from the U.S., could see an earnings boost of 30% or more, Glionna wrote, and could get a further boost from a consumer tax cut. Dollar General (DG), for example, could see its 37% effective tax rate (including state taxes) fall to 17% under the Trump plan.Among industry groups, only telecom would get a bigger lift than retail, with AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ) seeing a 29% boost in earnings.Yet, retailers could, all of a sudden, become big losers if Trump adopts the House Republican plan. While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Dollar General, Wal-Mart, Amazon, Costco (COST) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, one concern is that retailers that sell a lot of imported goods might have to pass much of those taxes on to customers to maintain their profitability.""Clearly a 20% tax on the wide range of consumer goods that are imported into the United States would put increased economic pressure on families who can least afford it,"" the National Retail Federation said after the House unveiled its ""Better Way"" tax plan in June.Actually, the economic impact of the House plan is far from clear. While imports could be 20% more expensive and exports 12% cheaper, the dollar could appreciate by 15% or more, largely offsetting the tax changes, Deutsche Bank wrote in an analysis this week.Trump and the GOP could be in for a big battle if they build corporate tax reform around this border-adjustment plan. Yet, reform may not be much easier if they choose another path. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% in the House plan. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.On top of that, there are real worries that other countries will punish American companies if the Trump administration applies tariffs or Congress adopts what looks like a border tax.It's probably safe to say that the stock market rally has downplayed some of these nagging problems in implementing the Trump agenda and that the ride may get bumpy because the range of possible outcomes is wide.As JPMorgan analysts wrote this week, ""While a lot of the early corporate tax reform enthusiasm was predicated on a cursory examination of the headline rate cuts, markets are now examining the radical changes being proposed to the intricacies of the code. (Last) Thursday and Friday saw notable weakness in apparel/retail-linked stocks and a big factor behind the selling was concern around the border adjustment concept that sits at the heart of the GOP corporate tax reform plan.""RELATED:Here's How Much Trump Tax Cuts Could Boost The Stock Market Tax Reform May Pit GOP Vs.

139,DLTR,"After riding a wave of working-class support to the White House, Donald Trump is hanging ten in Indiana today, celebrating the neat trick he pulled off in getting Carrier, a unit of United Technologies (UTX), to keep nearly 1,000 jobs that were headed for Mexico.But the big question is what Trump and the GOP will do for an encore. In particular, how will they pull off corporate tax reform that's in tune with their populist moment?The path for tax reform put forward by House Speaker Paul Ryan and fellow House Republicans would appear — at least at first blush — to offer a clear answer: taxing imports but not exports, in a reversal of current policy that imposes corporate income taxes on exporters but not overseas producers with goods bound for the U.S.Proponents go so far as to suggest that this is a neat way for Trump to shift the tide of trade without provoking a trade war by slapping punitive tariffs on goods from China and Mexico.While the economic impact of the proposal is much more complicated, the immediate fate of the House GOP tax reform may rest on what Trump's working-class supporters find more alarming: anti-competitive U.S. tax policy or higher prices at Wal-Mart (WMT).The National Retail Federation has begun sounding the alarm about the House GOP plan released in June, when a clean sweep in the election for Republicans seemed like a distant long shot.Here's why retailers are girding for a fight: While cutting the statutory corporate tax rate to 20% from 35%, the House plan would no longer allow businesses to deduct the cost of imports from taxes. That means retailers such as Wal-Mart, Amazon (AMZN), Costco (COST), Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Starbucks (SBUX) would have to pay a tax equal to 20% of the cost of the clothing, televisions, toys and coffee they import.Because retail profit margins are generally in the low single digits, retailers that sell a lot of imported goods would have to pass those taxes onto customers to maintain their profitability.IBD'S TAKE: Donald Trump made a lot of promises during the campaign. Here's what President Trump could accomplish in his first 100 days.It's not clear whether Trump is on board with the House plan. His own plan called for cutting the corporate tax rate to 15%, low enough that corporations wouldn't go out of their way to avoid U.S. taxes.Yet, it's important to understand the House proposal to grasp the direction and limits of the tax reform effort on which the GOP is about to embark.Here are six key points:The U.S. corporate tax system is a mess and definitely needs fixing. The clearest evidence is that U.S. companies such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are holding more than $2 trillion in profits overseas to avoid taxation in the U.S.The House wants to tax profits where goods and intellectual property are sold, rather than where profits are earned, which is a much fuzzier concept that's vulnerable to gaming. For example, companies have an incentive to overstate costs incurred by domestic operations to reduce their U.S. tax bills, shifting more profits to overseas subsidiaries, where they'll be taxed at a lower rate.For years, Republicans have talked about shifting the U.S. to such a territorial system, where the U.S. no longer taxes foreign earnings, but Democrats have warned that such a move could increase the incentive for offshoring. Ryan & fellow Republicans would avoid such an outcome by changing the tax code to keep companies from deducting the value of imports from their new, lower 20% income tax rate.There's another big reason, beside protecting U.S. producers, that the House GOP relied on this indirect tax on imports: the budget. The conservative Tax Foundation estimates that this border adjustment of corporate taxes would raise $1.1 trillion over 10 years, a huge sum that helps offset the cost of lowering the corporate tax rate. Unless the GOP can get eight Senate Democrats on board, which is doubtful, a tax package passed via reconciliation will have to be deficit-neutral beyond 10 years, so offsets are needed to make the U.S. tax code more competitive.Although it seems logical that hiking taxes on imports and reducing taxes on exports could shift the balance of trade, economists say that won't happen, at least not on a sustained basis. If the U.S. starts running a lower trade deficit due to tax policy, the value of the dollar would rise relative to other currencies, negating any advantage gained. Further, assuming currencies adjust as the change is phased in, the impact on retailers and their customers would be far less than feared.Still, economists generally favor a reform that taxes consumption where goods are sold and expect a payoff from less tax evasion. But there's a big question about whether the House GOP tax reform would comply with World Trade Organization rules. University of Maryland professor Peter Morici, who served as chief economist at the U.S. International Trade Commission, tells IBD that the House plan seems to violate WTO rules requiring nondiscrimination in the tax treatment of imports relative to domestic goods. While the outcome can't be known until a trade case is litigated, other analysts have also raised questions. Morici thinks Republicans would be wise to adopt a value-added tax instead, while junking the corporate income tax, but no one in the GOP is willing to go there.RELATED:Trump's Latest Twitter Win: Carrier To Keep Nearly 1,000 Jobs At Indiana PlantAs Trumpnomics Cheers Wall Street, Economists Fret

141,DLTR,"A federal judge's order on Tuesday blocking the Obama administration's overtime time rule from taking effect next week was the second big surprise most companies hadn't been counting on — the first being the election of Donald Trump.Some companies, including Wal-Mart (WMT), have already given managers a raise to comply with the law. Others, like Carrols Restaurant Group (TAST), the biggest franchisee of the Restaurant Brands International (QSR) Burger King chain, had said they were shifting managers into hourly workers to avoid any increase in pay.Even on Tuesday, about an hour before the injunction was announced, Dollar Tree (DLTR) told analysts it would see extra labor costs of 3-4 cents per share in the fourth quarter due to the overtime rule taking effect on Dec. 1.The Obama administration rule was set to lift the minimum salary exempting employers from paying time and a half for overtime to $47,476 from $23,660.""We have been preparing for and testing changes to our compensation structure in regard to the new (Fair Labor Standards Act) regulations,"" Bob Sasser, CEO of Dollar Tree, told analysts, according to a SeekingAlpha transcript. ""We have communicated these changes to our teams to ensure our company's compliance when the new rule will become effective on December 1.""The good news for employees is that pay hikes that already have been granted and accounted for are more likely than not going to stick to avoid a hit to morale. Managers who were effectively demoted to clock puncher, though, may remain on salary.Because Trump's election put the eventual fate of the overtime rule in doubt, companies that were struggling with the change likely delayed taking actions that were either negative for the bottom line or employee retention. Some companies may have planned to give managers a raise but not yet told them.While it's unclear whether the injunction could survive an appeal, the cloud over the controversial overtime rule will make it that much easier for the incoming Trump administration to walk away from the rule, or to dilute it.IBD'S TAKE: The likely weakening or retraction of the Obama administration's overtime rule is just one of the reasons why Donald Trump's victory was absolutely huge for McDonald's.Wal-Mart boosted minimum salaries for assistant store managers to $48,500 from $45,000, effective in September, to avoid being liable for overtime pay.President Obama initially touted the rule change as a way to keep employers from mistreating salaried workers by giving them what amounts to a paltry wage, sometimes equivalent to the minimum or less when all the extra hours worked were factored in. Yet the likeliest beneficiaries of the change are those who were already making above $40,000, so boosting their pay wouldn't hit bottom lines too hard.Here's what some other companies have said:Panera Bread (PNRA), on its Oct. 26 earnings call, said it was holding off giving earnings per share guidance for 2017, in part because of the ""final timing of FLSA"" changes, implying that election outcomes or an effort to delay the change in Congress could alter the Dec. 1 date.Planet Fitness (PLNT): ""With some of the law changes on the FLSA that kick in ... our manager salaries will go up a bit starting in Q4.""Dollar General (DG): ""We anticipate the incremental expense will be about $0.03 to $0.04 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of this year.""

Salesforce (CRM) gave weak guidance, while United Airlines (UAL) hired a key American Airlines (AAL) executive.The major market averages rose modestly for the week, continuing the long string of sideways action near record highs. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.6% while the S&P 500 and Dow industrials climbed 0.5%. Investors see a Fed rate hike in September as even less likely now. Fiber-optic stocks remained hot, generic drugs rebounded. Apparel stores were among the notable losers.The European Union's executive arm ordered Apple to repay 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) in back taxes plus interest to Ireland, part of a broader crackdown into EU member nations' special tax treatments for big multinationals. Apple CEO Tim Cook vowed to appeal the decision and criticized the commission's 'unprecedented"" action as ""total political crap."" Apple set plans for a Sept. 7 event, with widespread expectations that it will unveil the iPhone 7.Apple shares rose 0.7% to 107.73 for the week, approaching a 110.33 by point.The U.S. added 151,000 jobs in August, below views and down from gains of 275,000 in July and 271,000 in June. Meanwhile, ISM's manufacturing index for August signaled its first contraction in six months. The odds of a September rate hike, already low, fell further. But markets still expect a year-end hike.Ford Motor (F), General Motors (GM) and most other big automakers reported lower U.S. sales in August vs. a year earlier. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (FCAU) sales rose 3%. But it was the only one of the seven top U.S. sellers to report higher demand.U.S. sales totaled 16.98 million vehicles at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate vs. a 17.88 million pace in July. GM joined Ford in forecasting lower domestic sales for the industry in 2016 after hitting record levels last year.GM and Ford shares fell modestly Thursday on the auto sales news, but rose slightly for the week. Tesla Motors (TSLA) tumbled 10% to a 2-month low amid cash-crunch concerns about the electric car maker and its takeover target, SolarCity (SCTY).U.S. crude oil prices fell 6.7% to $44.44 a barrel, its worst weekly loss since early July. Crude inventories rose for a second straight week, while mixed economic data also weighed. U.S. oil rig counts edged higher to a seven-month high.Drugmaker Mylan (MYL) launched a generic EpiPen on Monday, responding to a frenzy of criticism over price hikes on its allergy treatment. But it faced new lawmaker calls for EpiPen-related documents, while others asked the FDA for an explanation of what was holding up approval for other generic versions. On Friday, some lawmakers accused Mylan of overcharging Medicaid for EpiPen, while Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said she would crack down on drug-price hikes. Mylan fell 7.1% this week after tumbling 11.6% in the prior week.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) earned 50 cents a share excluding items, meeting fiscal Q4 views for a 79% gain. Revenue growth topped. But EPS guidance for current Q1 was weak and indicated yet another quarter of decelerating Palo Alto growth from very high levels. Despite solid full-year EPS guidance and a $500 million buyback plan, shares fell 7.2% on Wednesday, but rallied for a 3.2% weekly gain, just below its 200-day line.Chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Ambarella (AMBA) late Thursday posted top- and bottom-line beats for quarters ended July 31, and both gave guidance that topped Wall Street … and both stocks fell Friday and for the week. One problem is that investors and analysts have some doubts about crucial products about to be announced by key customers.Ciena (CIEN), a major fiber-optic company, earned 42 cents a share excluding items in its fiscal Q3, up 13.5% and beating by four cents. Sales grew 11% to $670.6 million, slightly below views for $672.2 million. Ciena stock broke out of a consolidation, rising 5.8% for the week. Ciena and Cisco (CSCO) are lead vendors on a major 100-gigabit metro rollout for Verizon (VZ). Telecoms, cloud computing giants and China are seeing huge demand for fiber-optic gear, lifting hot IPO Acacia Communications (ACIA) and others.Salesforce.com reported Q2 earnings and revenue that beat estimates. But billings were below expectations, with Q3 guidance that implied billings growth might tick down again. Salesforce, which said it sees some ""softness"" in U.S. demand, projects fiscal Q3 revenue of $2.11 billion to $2.12 billion, vs. Wall Street consensus of $2.12 billion. It expects EPS minus items of 20 cents to 21 cents, below the consensus of 24 cents.Salesforce stock fell 6.2% for the week, trading below its 200-day line for the first time since the end of March.Closeout retailer Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) topped earnings and sales forecasts, and guided full-year estimates higher. Teen-centric retailer Five Below (FIVE) gave weak third-quarter guidance. That followed murky forecasts from Target (TGT), Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). The results come as Wal-Mart (WMT)begins its own price-cutting campaign, potentially drawing customers away from rival discounters.Ollie's stock rose 4% for the week, retaking a 26.65 buy point after falling below its 50-day line. Five Below fell 6.5% as it extended its losing streak to eight straight sessions.Lululemon Athletica (LULU) met earnings estimates of 38 cents a share, marking 12% growth, but missed on revenue, as sales grew 14% to $514.5 million vs. forecasts for $515.5 million. Currency-neutral same-store sales rose 5% for the yogawear maker and retailer. Some analysts were anticipating an earnings turnaround, but Lululemon issued cautious Q3 guidance. Shares sank 10%, erasing virtually all of Lululemon's gains from its breakout after its prior earnings report.Shares of United Airlines (UAL) jumped this week after Scott Kirby joined the carrier from American Airlines (AAL), where he had served as president. Kirby, now United's president, is seen by some as one of the industry's best revenue strategists. The move rounds out United's recent efforts to shake up its executive team to compete with American and Delta Air Lines (DAL). United rose 9% for the week, retaking its 200-day line. American climbed 0.8%. Delta, which reported that August unit revenue fell 9.5% vs. a year earlier as it suffered outages that forced cancellations, rose 3%. Hawaiian Holdings (HA), parent of Hawaiian Airlines, rose 4.8%, breaking past a buy point, but in light volume.Smith & Wesson (SWHC) late Thursday reported first-quarter results that easily beat Wall Street forecasts. It raised full-year guidance, helped by new acquisitions. But shares of the gunmaker slid 6.4% on Friday to a two-month low and back below its 50-day line. That's in part due to FBI data on August background checks — a loose indicator of firearm demand — that didn't exhibit the surge seen in previous months. Shares of rival Sturm Ruger (RGR) fell 2.5% on Friday.Stun-gun maker Taser (TASR) broke out of short consolidation on Tuesday, then crashed to fall 6.8% for the week, diving through its 50-day line.Veeva Systems (VEEV) was expected to report a soft Q2 due to the lumpiness of its bookings, but Veeva earnings beat estimates, while 34% sales growth also surprised. Analysts credited strong uptake of the Vault content-management system.

Dollar stores suffered heavy losses as competition from Wal-Mart (WMT) was heating up.Fed Chair Janet Yellen said at Friday's long-awaited speech that the case for an interest rate hike has ""strengthened in recent months."" That followed other modestly hawkish statements from fellow Fed policymakers. However, Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer said Yellen's comments were consistent with a September rate increase. He saw the possibility of two rate hikes this year. Markets had already priced a Fed move, perhaps in December, but they don't expect any quick follow-upNew-home sales soared to a 654,000 annual rate in July, by far the highest since October 2007, the Commerce Department reported.

That fueled selling in drug and biotech stocks. Mylan CEO Heather Bresch, daughter of Sen. Joe Machin, D-W.V., said only a fraction of the $608 list price makes it back to Mylan, due to all the middlemen, leading shares of Express Scripts (ESRX), CVS Health (CVS) and AmerisourceBergen (ABC) to fall as well.Big pharma Pfizer agreed to buy Medivation for $14 billion in cash, snatching the cancer-drug specialist from Sanofi (SNY), which had been trying for months to acquire Medivation.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) also raised full-year EPS guidance. But its Q3 profit range was a little cautious. Ulta shares have been on a strong run-up, so it may have been priced for perfection. Ulta shares tumbled 6% on Friday, undercutting its 50-day moving average.Workday (WDAY) reported a wider-than-expected Q2 adjusted loss. But it topped on some key metrics, including revenue, which rose 34% to $377.7 million.

Video game and electronics retailer GameStop (GME) disappointed investors with in-line EPS and below-forecast sales.Discount retailers Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) suffered double-digit share price losses, as both reported second-quarter results that came up short of Wall Street expectations, with falling grocery prices and tougher competition hurting sales. Those results came as Wal-Mart is waging its own campaign to cut prices, a move that could draw more customers who have become more cautious with their spending.Meanwhile, the jeweler Tiffany (TIF) held to its full-year outlook, while its Q2 EPS beat views, helping to boost shares. However, Signet Jewelers (SIG), the parent of mall jewelers Kay, Jared and Zales, slashed its fiscal-year outlook, partly due to difficulties ""in the energy-dependent regions."" Those regions' economies have been hurt by cheap oil and other commodities.HP Inc. (HPQ) reported that its fiscal Q3 earnings per share minus one-time items jumped 37% in fiscal Q3 to 48 cents on a 4% decline in sales to $11.89 billion, both better than views.

158,DLTR,"Wal-Mart (WMT) is in talks to purchase e-commerce discounter and Amazon (AMZN) rival Jet.com, Dow Jones reported, a move that could strengthen the big-box retailer's online and delivery offerings as it contends with higher labor costs and more nimble rivals like Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG).It was unclear how far along the discussions were or what the purchase price of Jet.com might be. A source told Dow Jones that Jet might be valued at up to $3 billion. Bloomberg reported Jet was valued at $1 billion in its last round of fundraising and had a sales run rate of $1 billion last month, adding that the talks could also result in a strategic investment, not an acquisition.Jet.com launched about a year ago with the intention of providing a cheaper alternative to Amazon, Wal-Mart and Costco (COST). The company in May even began offering fresh grocery delivery in some markets in the Northeast and Washington, D.C. Amazon has also expanded its grocery delivery services.

175,DLTR,"Stock indexes chalked up losses Tuesday afternoon as the Nasdaq joined the S&P 500 on the loss side.Heading into the final hour of trade, the Nasdaq was down 0.2% after being up 0.4%, while the S&P dropped 0.5%. The Dow Jones industrial average trudged lower, losing 0.8%.Volume in the stock market today was running higher on both major exchanges. Friday's preholiday pace made for an easy comparison.Panera Bread (PNRA) cleared a 219.48 buy point in a shallow, cup-with-handle pattern and then fell back under the entry. Volume was weak. The pattern could be seen as a base atop a base. Panera broke out March 1 in soft volume and then rose 6% from a 208.10 buy point before beginning the current consolidation. The stock never fell more than 3% under the buy point, so individual investors who held their position could be up about 5% now.The fast-casual restaurant-cafe-bakery chain has some things going for it and some things going against it.On the negative side, pretax margin was 9.5% last year, the lowest in seven years. Revenue growth was 6% the past two years, down from double digits in 2010-13. Another drawback is the restaurant stock group. Restaurants rated No. 69 in six-month price performance among 197 industry groups.On the plus side, earnings are expected to rise 8% this year and then step up to 17% growth. Cash flow is strong, and return on equity was 26% last year. The Composite Rating, which combines all five IBD ratings into a single number, is 88. A rating of 88 means the stock is in the top 12 percentile among all the stocks in IBD's database.How does Panera Bread rate in the restaurant group?

177,DLTR,"The major indexes are capping a fine week with moderate gains in late-afternoon trading Friday. The surprising bump up in the number of fresh breakouts serve as corroborating evidence that institutional investors are warming again to stocks.Stocks gave up some gains after Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said an interest rate hike would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months, but soon firmed again. The Nasdaq composite led the upside, up 0.4%, while the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrials 0.1%. Smaller companies outperformed, with the S&P 600 up 0.6% and the mid-cap S&P 400 up 0.4%. Volume was tracking lower on both exchanges ahead of the Memorial Day holiday weekend.Veeva Systems (VEEV) rushed 10% higher, further moving past a 28.05 handle within a four-month cup base. That base is nestled within a much longer and deeper base. The software firm focuses on the health care industry and is rising on a 25% jump in fiscal first-quarter profit to 15 cents a share, smashing Wall Street's 11-cent view. Revenue rose 33% to $120 million, accelerating from gains of 28% and 31% in the prior two quarters.The 25% profit jump is especially impressive when considering that in the year ago April-ended quarter, earnings blasted 140% higher to 12 cents a share.Veeva, an October 2013 IPO, earns an excellent Composite Rating of 95 on a scale of 1 to 99. It's part of IBD's Computer Software-Medical industry subgroup.What other companies beside Veeva hold outstanding IBD Ratings? Check for free at IBD Stock Checkup.Weibo (WB) is rising past a 24.89 buy point in a tight consolidation that could serve as an entry point for aggressive investors. The China-based Twitter-like service had broken out of an excellent cup with handle at 19.20 in early April. On the retailing side, Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) have moved sharply past proper buy points at 83.82 and 87.52, respectively. Such action among leading individual stocks reflects growing confidence that the Federal Reserve plans to further normalize the cost of money with the possibility of raising interest rates either in June or July. The Fed in December last year hiked the fed funds rate for the first time since 2006. But rates remain drastically low; the 10-year Treasury yield remains below 2%. On Friday, Fed chief Janet Yellen made comments during a Q&A session at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass., indicating that she too is ready to remove some ""policy accommodation.""Low interest rates actually help stocks in the sense that the so-called ""earnings yield"" for S&P 500 firms is higher than long-term bond yields. With the consensus estimate for full-year 2016 earnings at roughly $119 and the S&P 500 trading near 2093, the index's earnings yield stands at 5.7%.S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that earnings in 2016 will rise a little more than 2%.On Tuesday, IBD's Market Pulse showed a change in the current outlook to ""Uptrend resumes"" from ""Uptrend under pressure"" as the major indexes continued to rally and distribution days expired. But the overall distribution count remains elevated.

178,DLTR,"Deep-discount variety store chains Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General (DG) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates amid strong expansion, driving shares up early Thursday.Dollar Tree said Q1 EPS jumped 25% to 89 cents, compared to views for 71 cents. Revenue of $5.09 billion was more than double the same quarter in 2015 on a 2.3% increase in same-store sales and its $8.5 billion purchase of Family Dollar in July, which boosted sales.Dollar Tree shares shot up 12.8% to 88.37, rising above an 83.82 buy point of a flat base to a new all-time high.Revenue was below analysts' consensus of $5.1 billion. Still, Chief Executive Bob Sasser said in a written statement he was generally pleased with the company's performance in ""what continues to be a challenging economic environment.""The company projects second-quarter earnings of 66-72 cents a share and sees $5.03 billion-$5.12 billion revenue. Consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for 75 cents earnings per share and $5.1 billion revenue.Meanwhile, rival Dollar General's first-quarter adjusted earnings climbed 23% to $1.03 a share, and revenue grew 7% to $5.27 billion. Wall Street expected 95 cents earnings per share and $5.28 billion revenue.It was the second quarter in row of better-than-expected earnings after the company missed in the prior three quarters last year amid strong competition from Amazon.com (AMZN) and big-box discount chains such as Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT).For the quarter ended April 29, Dollar General's same-store sales at outlets open more than a year grew 2.2% vs. the same quarter a year earlier, and operating profit rose 16 basis points to 30.6%.

"
180,DLTR,"Bears and bulls alike showed patience late Thursday afternoon as the stock indexes stayed close to the break-even level. The market is likely waiting for the second take on first quarter GDP, which will be released Friday before the opening bell.The Nasdaq inched up 0.3% Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average was fractionally lower. The Dow Jones utility average led the upside with a 0.9% pop. Volume was running lower on both major exchanges.GDP has been revised upward in each of the previous three quarters' second takes. In the first Q1 estimate, GDP came in at a weak 0.5%. The Street's consensus view expects the percentage to be adjusted upward to a still-sluggish 0.9%. The range of estimates ran from 0.5% to 1.1%.On Thursday, blue chips were mostly down. Of the 30 stocks in the Dow, only one attracted higher volume. Apple (AAPL) cranked up volume more than 40% above the usual pace, gaining 1.1% to 100.69. The stock is headed toward its fifth daily gain in a row and was testing its 100 price level. Apple has wiped out most of the losses tied to its April earnings report. The stock chart, though, still looks ugly.A report from Morgan Stanley says Apple is spending heavily on auto technologies' research and development. Apple’s R&D spending rose 30% in Q1 to $2.51 billion. This kind of investment could bring Apple back into the growth camp. Some market analysts say that Apple is now more of a conservative stock than a growth stock.How many failing red marks does Apple get in IBD Stock Checkup?Economic news was generally bullish Thursday. Durable goods orders in April bulldozed past the Street's estimate. April's increase was 3.4% vs. views for 0.3%. The March percentage was revised upward from 0.8% to 1.9%. Meanwhile, first-time jobless claims came in lower than expected.Pending home sales for April boomed 5.1% vs. views for 0.8%. The home sales number reached the highest level in 10 years. The reaction, however, among housing stocks was subdued. For example, D.R. Horton (DHI) was flat as the market headed into its final hour of trade.The one negative note came from the Kansas City Fed's manufacturing gauge. The needle pointed to minus 5 in May vs. minus 4 in April. Manufacturing, which accounts for 12% of GDP, has been a sore point in the U.S. economy.Breakouts Thursday included Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR). Dollar General rose 5% intraday while Dollar Tree shot up 13.5%, both on earnings reports.

181,DLTR,"Stocks remained nearly flat in early afternoon trading Thursday, as investors weighed positive economic data and earnings reports from Costco Wholesale (COST) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).The Nasdaq was essentially flat as of 12:51 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dipped 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average down 0.2%.

The stock retook its 50-day and 200-day moving average lines intraday, but has dropped back below both key levels.On the IBD 50, Dycom Industries (DY) followed through on its prior session's big gap-up with a 4% advance in rapid turnover. Shares of the telecom infrastructure services provider cleared a 73.28 cup-with-handle buy point Wednesday.WebMD (WBMD) gapped down and fell nearly 6% in heavy trade to near its 50-day line. After the close Wednesday, the online health care information site announced plans to offer $300 million of convertible debt in a private offering.In economic news, April durable goods orders rose a better-than-expected 3.4%, while jobless claims fell 10,000 to 268,000 in the week ended May 21, vs. forecasts for 275,000. And April pending home sales jumped 5.1% to a 10-year high.The data indicate the U.S. economy is strengthening, boosting the odds for the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates soon. The probability of a quarter-point rate hike in June is at 30%, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The odds of at least a quarter-point hike in July is now 58%.

202,DLTR,"Sellers battered retailers on Wednesday on a range of company and earnings news, but discount chains have held up better.In late trading, retail and apparel industry groups had 16 of the day’s 20 worst losses among the 197 groups tracked by IBD.That’s a tough day.The stock market has been hard in general on the retail sector, with retail groups holding four of the 10 worst industry rankings. One exception has been discount and variety stores, essentially the dollar-store chains. Those were in the top five rankings on Wednesday and have held top-20 rankings for nearly eight straight weeks.Dollar stores for the past several years have offered a combination of defensive and offensive plays. Like Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT), the stores tend to attract more customers when economic times turn tough, as consumers hold down spending. At the same time, they have provided a growth story as the once highly fragmented industry consolidates into a smaller numbers of larger players.But the group wasn’t immune to Wednesday’s selling pressure.Get a closer look at Macy's fine points using IBD's Stock Checkup feature.Five Below (FIVE), Big Lots (BIG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Ollie’s Bargain Outlets (OLLI) and Dollar General (DG)  slid.But none of that really caused any chart damage within the group, with one exception. Five Below pared its losses after diving almost 8% in opening trade. It had already tripped a sell signal last week, after falling more than 8% below a 42.36 buy point. Wednesday's action showed the stock losing its grip on its 50-day moving average. It also sent shares more than 8% below a prior buy point of 41.57, triggering a sell rule for investors who bought at that level.Ollie’s has been the group’s barn-burner, ripping ahead 27% from a March 18 breakout to a peak on April 28. Anywhere above a 20% increase from the buy point would have been a good place for investors to book profits. Those who held on rode a pullback over the past three weeks. Shares are now testing support at the 10-week moving average and about 10% above the stock's buy point.If the stock rises off its 10-week line in strong trade, it would present an add-on buying opportunity. If it cuts that line in heavy trade, it could mark a sell signal, depending on how severely the stock breaks support.Ollie’s sells name-brand goods -- from clothing to sporting goods to flooring and food -- at steep discounts. The bargain chain operates some 200 stores across the East.Dollar General took a light bounce off support at its 10-week moving average. It is working on the sixth week of a flat base with an 87.52 buy point. It is in a base-on-base pattern, with its low sitting around the high of a prior base. Dollar General broke out of that pattern after reporting its Q4 results on March 10. The company plans to report Q1 results on May 19.All the companies in the group operate on a January year-end calendar.Dollar Tree had outflanked Dollar General last year, spending $8.5 billion to win over Family Dollar and bump Dollar General out of a bid for market dominance. The deal left the dollar-store market with two peers of essentially equal size: Dollar Tree-Family Dollar with nearly 14,000 stores and Dollar General with just under 13,000.Dollar General's revenue for fiscal 2015 was $20.4 billion. Dollar Tree-Family Dollar booked revenue of $15.5 billion. In terms of earnings, analysts' consensus is for a 15% rise in Dollar General’s EPS this year in what would make a tenth straight advance.Dollar Tree’s outlook: a 55% jump in EPS and a 35% surge in revenue as the company fully digests Family Dollar. Next year estimates slow to a 23% earnings gain and a 6% sales rise.Despite the sharp upturn in financials, the jury is still out among investors with regard to the Dollar Tree-Family Dollar combo. Shares have traded sideways since January after recovering from an October low, but they remain about 6% below their March 2015 high.Big Lots is the group’s struggling turnaround story. Quarterly earnings and revenue have wobbled up and down. The stock continues to trade at about 14% below a November 2014 high.The stock is basing, but fundamentals continue to look weak. Earnings are forecast to grow 11% this year on a 1% revenue gain, rising to a 14% gain next year with revenue growth holding steady.

203,DLTR,"Investors this week learned to stop worrying and love the rate hike. Even as Fed officials and fresh economic data bolstered the case for a summer interest rate increase, stocks rallied. Apple (AAPL) and banks continued to climb, while energy stocks took heart from $50 oil. Top-rated Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and deep-discount stores shrugged off retail earnings woes. Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) kept spinning. Alibaba (BABA) disclosed an SEC accounting probe, while Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC) won key court battles.Odds for a Federal Reserve rate increase at the June or July meetings continued to climb, but stocks rallied. The Nasdaq rose 3.4%, the S&P 500 2.3% and the Dow industrials 2.1%, with all three regaining their 50-day lines as the market direction returned to a confirmed uptrend. Apple advanced 5.4% after climbing 5.2% last week. Financial and energy stocks also rallied, with the latter rising along with oil prices. U.S. crude oil futures briefly topped $50 a barrel Thursday, a seven-month high, as U.S. inventories and production fell. Crude rose 3.3% for the week to $49.33.Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who has been among the more dovish policymakers publicly in recent months, said Friday that raising rates cautiously would be ""appropriate"" in the coming months as the economy continues to improve. Earlier in the week, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said he sees two or three rate hikes this year, with three or four more next year. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard reiterated that the U.S. job market is tight and may start to push inflation higher -- cause for another rate hike. Fed Gov. Jerome Powell said the benchmark rate could go up soon, but weak productivity growth could curb further increases.While odds of a rate hike at the June policy meeting are about 33%, the chances for at least one quarter-point hike by the July meeting are above 60%.Economic data largely backed calls for a rate hike. New-home sales spiked 16.6% to an eight-year high, while pending-home sales shot up to their best level in 10 years. Durable goods orders rose 3.4% on soaring aircraft demand, but the report also showed core capital goods bookings slid to a five-year low.In the coming week, May data on manufacturing (ISM index), U.S. auto sales and employment may lock in expectations for or against a Fed rate hike.Automaker-tech pairings continued. Toyota (TM) said it will invest an undisclosed amount in Uber after last year disclosing plans to invest $1 billion in R&D on self-driving cars. Toyota will offer auto leases to Uber drivers. BMW i Ventures said it will invest in Scoop Technologies, creator of the Scoop carpooling mobile app. Volkswagen (VLKAY) will invest $300 million in Gett, an Uber rival in Europe and New York City. The trio join Apple, which in early May said it would invest $1 billion in top China ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing as it reportedly works in secret on an Apple Car project. (Didi itself is backed by Alibaba and Tencent (TCEHY), while Uber partners in China with Baidu (BIDU)). Also, General Motors (GM) in January said it would invest $500 million in Lyft, an Uber rival.The specialty beauty retailer continues to be an outperformer among a field of retail disappointments. Ulta Beauty notched a 39% EPS gain -- the biggest in three years -- on 24% revenue growth to $1.07 billion, way above views. Ulta also amped up its full-year outlook. Q2 guidance was mixed. More retailers are scheduled to report this week. Shares rose 11.8% for the week, mostly on Friday's post-earnings jump.IBD's Take: How beautiful is Ulta's stock based on IBD criteria, and does it stand out vs. rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupDollar-or-less variety store chains Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) crushed first-quarter earnings estimates Thursday amid strong expansion. Dollar General reported a 23% EPS gain and plans to open 900 new stores this year. Dollar Tree reported a 25% EPS advance. One troubling sign was that both fell short of Wall Street revenue targets. Still, Dollar Tree CEO Bob Sasser said he was generally pleased with the company’s performance in “what continues to be a challenging economic environment.”Dollar General stock leapt 10.1% this week, and Dollar Tree gained 15.7%, both breaking out to new highs.Alibaba disclosed an ongoing SEC investigation into potential violations regarding the e-commerce giant’s transaction and consolidation practices, as well as its operating data from Singles Day, the Chinese company’s most lucrative shopping day of the year.Shares plunged 6.8% Wednesday, Alibaba’s worst one-day percentage decline in more than a year. But Alibaba ended 2.8% higher this week.Evercore, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts all said they remained positive on the stock.Hewlett Packard Enterprise said it would spin off its Enterprise Services business and merge it with Computer Services Corp. (CSC), a move the company said would create a $26 billion global IT behemoth. HPE, itself a spin-off of Hewlett-Packard, also kept its full-year EPS guidance above views.HPE stock rose 15.1% for the week. Computer Sciences spiked nearly 41% to a six-month high.Bank of America, Citigroup (C), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other big banks are back on the hook for a potentially crippling sum of cash after a U.S. appeals court overturned a 2013 lower-court ruling against antitrust lawsuits that alleged the banks rigged Libor and hurt investors. The lower court found the plaintiffs didn’t show sufficient harm, but the appeals court felt the opposite. Now the lower court will deliberate further on the matter and decide whether the plaintiffs are justified to sue at all.That same appeals court overturned a $1.27 billion suit against Bank of America that alleged the bank’s Countrywide Financial misled mortgage giants Fannie Mae (FNMA) and Freddie Mac (FMCC) on loan sales in the run-up to the financial crisis. The court said Countrywide’s actions were likelier to fall under ""breach of contract"" rather than outright fraud. The court also dismissed a civil suit against Rebecca Mairone, who was once an executive at Countrywide.A jury ruled that Alphabet's Google didn't need approval from Oracle (ORCL) to use the latter's programming tools -- APIs -- to build Android, the world's leading mobile operating system. Oracle had sought $9 billion in damages and possible additional royalties, saying Google violated its copyrights. But the jury said the Alphabet unit exercised fair use. Oracle said it will appeal.Alphabet stock rose 3.6% for the week, closing back above its 50-day moving average.Monsanto (MON) agreed that a deal with Bayer (BAYRY) made financial sense, but the agriculture giant rejected the $122 per share, or $62 billion offer, saying it was worth more money. But it also said it was open to more talks. Bayer said it looks to further talks with Monsanto and said it could address potential financing and regulatory issues. Monsanto stock rose 7.85% to 109.49. Bayer fell 5% to a 3-year low.Gannett (GCI)  threatened to withdraw its $15 per share offer for Tribune Publishing (TPUB) after the the owner of the L.A. Times and Chicago Tribune issued 4.7 million new shares and sold them to Nant Capital. The investment firm Towle, which controls 3.85% of Tribune shares, blasted the move and said it supports an acquisition by Gannett.Tribune Publishing stock dived 20.9% after spiking 24% in the prior week. Gannett stock fell 3.2%.Palo Alto Networks (PANW) guided to $386 million to $390 million in fiscal Q3 sales and 48-50 cents earnings per share ex items, missing the midpoints of the consensus model of $389.3 million and 50 cents. The No. 2 cybersecurity firm's fiscal Q2 sales grew 48% year over year to $345.8 million, topping Wall Street for $339.5 million. Q2 EPS shot up 83%, though that merely met analyst forecasts.Palo Alto shares dived 8.4% this week after crumbling 12.4% on Friday.Tiffany (TIF) reported Q1 EPS fell 14.8% to 69 cents but beat views by a penny. Sales fell 7.4% to $891.3 million, under views for $915.1 million. European and Asia-Pacific same-store sales were down 15%, while Americas unit comps were down 10% on lower tourist spending.

209,DLTR,"Remember back before DVRs allowed you to fast-forward past commercials or pause your programming? If you were watching an exciting show, the commercial break was your opportunity to think about the clues to solve the mystery, catch your breath from the action, or even just go get a snack.Consider the flat base as the commercial break for successful growth-stock investors.The flat base is one of the more common patterns encountered among the biggest winners of each market cycle. In a computer-generated pattern recognition study going back to 1963, one-third of the bases among a large set of big market winners fell into the flat base category.Dollar Tree (DLTR) showed excellent flat-base characteristics in its three-month base that started in November 2009. Flat bases tend to be shallow, correcting no more than 15% from the base's high to low. In Dollar Tree's case, the drop was 11%. The shallow correction testifies that institutions are unwilling to give up shares. In fact, institutions may even be using the correction to pick up shares as the stock comes down, absorbing any selling with quiet accumulation.On the chart, the stock seemed to get support each time it fell near 47 (1). Even if the institutions aren't doing much buying during the correction, they aren't selling either. That is why you often see volume dwindle (2) as the flat base forms. Institutional activity is mostly quiet.The required minimum length of the flat base is five weeks -- shorter than the seven weeks of the cup with handle or double bottom. Start counting weeks in the base with the first down week from a high. The week of the actual breakout is not included (the stock has broken out of the base at that point). Dollar Tree had 12 weeks in its flat base.The flat base doesn't usually start the move for a stock, rather they follow from the move of a previous base. You can look at flat bases as opportunities to participate in winners that you might have otherwise missed. This is another valuable lesson why it isn't necessary to chase stocks, just wait for the next opportunity to buy it right.The stock broke out on Feb. 24, 2010, at 52.30, 10 cents above the high of the base. An earlier point of resistance at 51.73, reached on Feb. 3, could have served as an aggressive entry point. The stock broke out strongly, gapping up for a 12% gain in volume 448% above average.While technical action is a critical component of the timing for a stock purchase, do not neglect your fundamental analysis.Dollar Tree saw increased sales as people started tightening their belts after the financial crisis of 2008. They had also expanded their refrigerated and freezer section, driving increased traffic. The company announced earnings-per-share growth of 41% for their fiscal 2009 on record sales over $5 billion, and that acted as the catalyst for the breakout. It launched a move of over 200% in the next two years.Image provided by Shutterstock.

210,DLTR,"After shoring up its position in the hotly competitive discount arena by acquiring a larger rival last year, Dollar Tree faces the task of turning its newly acquired muscle into bigger sales and profits.If it is to be successful, Dollar Tree (DLTR), now the biggest U.S. discount chain, needs to get a better performance from its Family Dollar Store outlets, which were struggling prior to the merger.Wall Street is tentative on Dollar Tree's prospects.""There are some natural synergies that came out of the deal with regard to buying and some expenses,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Peter Keith told Investor's Business Daily. ""But the jury is still out on whether Dollar Tree can drive material improvement at the Family Dollar business. At this point, I believe what investors will want to see is better sales productivity from Family Dollar stores, which should in turn drive improved operating margins and overall profitability.""Dollar Tree closed on the purchase of Family Dollar Stores July 6 after a heated takeover battle with rival deep discounter Dollar General (DG). It paid $6.8 billion in cash and 28.5 million shares of the company’s stock valued at $2.3 billion.Prior to the merger, Dollar Tree enjoyed a long-running streak of double-digit quarterly profit. The merger has the potential for synergies and productivity gains, and could enable Dollar Tree to serve a broader range of customers, tap new markets and enhance market share in existing ones while enhancing the company’s financial performance and improving its growth prospects, the company said at the time of the buy.“The draw (for investors) is the opportunity the company has to dramatically improve the earnings power of the Family Dollar segment,” Northcoast Research analyst Nicholas Mitchell told IBD.But the integration and turnaround processes present challenges, say followers. While analysts praise Dollar Tree management’s capabilities, opinions are mixed on the extent to which Dollar Tree will achieve its objectives.“I think Dollar Tree is a very successful retailer and they're very good operators,” Stifel analyst Taylor LaBarr told IBD. “But it was a big step acquiring a company that was bigger than they are, with even more employees, more distribution centers and more stores. It is a big acquisition and integration task for any situation, but they’re also trying to fix and turn around a struggling retailer. So we really like the core Dollar Tree business, but it’s going to be a tough integration.”Dollar Tree’s stock price rose 9.7% last year, though it’s been up and down so far this year. Its stock price has also soared 44% since the retailer announced its intent to buy Family Dollar on July 28, 2014.Dollar Tree operated 13,851 stores across 48 states and five Canadian provinces as of Jan. 30. Stores operate under the brands of Dollar Tree, Family Dollar, Dollar Tree Canada and Deals. It expects to have 217 of the 222 Deals stores converted to the Dollar Tree brand and five to Family Dollar brands by July. Dollar Tree converted 52 Deals stores to Dollar Tree stores in January.Dollar Tree operates fixed-price point stores, selling everything for $1 or less, while Family Dollar operates multiprice point stores, selling the majority of its products at $10 or less.Post merger, Dollar Tree faces new rivals.When it acquired Family Dollar, Dollar Tree gained more direct competition with Dollar General, convenience stores, the front end of drug stores, and to some degree giant discounters Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) and Target (TGT), says analyst Mitchell.“The acquisition made the business more complicated and levered up the balance sheet,” Mitchell said. “It used to be a very uncomplicated investment story that investors felt comfortable buying with the intention of holding the shares as a core position. These guys were so good at merchandising and real estate site selection that the cash flow could efficiently be reinvested in the business with expectations of earning a high return on the incremental capital.”Mitchell went on to say: “After it acquired Family Dollar, the story went from being a very clean investment story with very good unit economics and a strong competitive advantage to a story that's half the same and the other half a turnaround story. I would imagine that it has probably been a little more challenging than (management) thought it would be at the start, but they are making good progress cleaning up many of the underlying problems they inherited.”On the plus side, Dollar Tree has turned out two straight quarters of positive same-store sales for Family Dollar, which is a nice improvement, Mitchell says. It’s also cleaned up the Family Dollar stores, strengthened the end-of-the-aisle displays and improved the “in-stock” position in these stores, he says.“It’s going to take time to get the consumer back,” he added. “There’s a lot of work ahead that needs to be done. The final verdict on whether this was a smart move will be a function of execution in the next 12 to 18 months.”In the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, which ended Jan. 30, Dollar Tree’s adjusted earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share. Revenue surged 117% to $5.37 billion, boosted by $2.68 billion in sales from the Family Dollar segment. Family Dollar stores saw a low single-digit rise in same-store sales, driven by growth in both traffic and the average ticket.In a note to clients on Dollar Tree’s fourth-quarter results, UBS analyst Michael Lasser was upbeat about the company's prospects.“After parsing back the one-time items, (Dollar Tree) put together another solid (quarter) that puts it on pace to substantially grow its earnings over time,” he wrote.He notes that the company has now seen growth in same-store sales in each of the last seven months.“Its traffic is accelerating, and improvements are being made,” he added. “This provides a more stable base from which its (same-store sales) can accelerate.”

211,DLTR,"Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) late Wednesday reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of 31 cents a share excluding one-time items, beating analysts' consensus by three cents a share and pushing shares up late Wednesday.The retail closeout chain said that its revenue rose 21% to $243.4 million, topping views for $239.1 million and accelerating from 16% in its fiscal Q3.For the current fiscal year, which ends Jan. 28, 2017, Ollie's guided sales of $865 million to $875 million, the midpoint of which is below analysts' consensus for $872.3 million. It expects 83-85 cents EPS, vs. views for 76 cents. ""We feel very good about the current outlook and trends across our business,"" CEO Mark Butler said in a written statement. But it sees same-store sales growth of just 1.5%-2.5% after a 5% jump in Q4.Ollie's stock rose 5.7% to 22.99 in late trading. Shares closed up 0.9% to 22.70 on the stock market today, retaking a 22.63 buy point. But the after-hours action suggests that the stock may be out of the buy range limit of 23.76.The stock initially broke out on March 18 but undercut its buy area on Tuesday.The company opened three new stores during the quarter, ending with a total of 203 outlets in 17 states. It expects to add 28-32 stores this year and doesn't plan to close any outlets.Ollie's joined Dollar General (DG), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Big Lots (BIG) and Five Below (FIVE) as a publicly traded company last summer after pricing at 16 and launching trading on July 16 in its initial public offering.The discounter is in the Retail & Discount Variety group, ranked an excellent 4 on IBD's list of 197 industries. Dollar General closed down 0.1% Wednesday, Dollar Tree rose 0.7%, and direct rival Big Lots rose 0.6%. Five Below, which is on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, advanced 0.5%.

212,DLTR,"Dollar Tree (DLTR) stock sold off Tuesday on weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings and current-year guidance, but shares rebounded off their 50-day moving average to turn higher.Dollar Tree earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share, falling short of views for $1.07 a share. Revenue shot up 117% to $5.37 billion, thanks to the company's Family Dollar takeover, but still missed estimates for $5.41 billion.Same-store sales at Dollar Tree stores grew 1.7% on a constant currency basis vs. 5.6% comp growth in Q4 of last year. Sales at Dollar Tree stores open for at least a year rose 1.3% once adjusted for the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, the company said.Dollar Tree expects diluted per-share earnings of 75-83 cents in Q1, in line with consensus for 79 cents. The midpoint of its revenue guidance for $5.05 billion-$5.12 billion falls slightly below analyst estimates for $5.1 billion.For the year, the company guided for $3.35-$3.65 a share in earnings, below forecasts for $3.76 a share. The midpoint of targeted revenue of $20.76 billion-$21.11 billion is a hair above current estimates for $20.93 billion.Soon after the open, Dollar Tree stock tumbled to 77.77, just below its 50-day moving average, but it then rallied strongly and closed up 2.2%. The stock had briefly undercut an 80.14 buy point.Dollar General broke out of a cup-with-handle base in early January at that 80.14 buy point, but the attempt quickly failed, and shares have been up and down since then. Shares hit an eight-month closing high on Friday. Another buy point at 82.86  is available on a longer-term consolidation going back to the all-time high set in March 2015.Rival Dollar General (DG) shares rose 1.75%.Image provided by Shutterstock.RELATED:What Correction?

213,DLTR,"Dollar General (DG) shares bumped up past their buy point Thursday as the dollar-store chain's candy and snacks, perishables, tobacco and food departments experienced the ""most significant"" sales increases in the fourth quarter.Earnings grew 11% to $1.30 per share on 7% revenue growth to $5.29 billion, ahead of consensus views for $1.26 earnings per share and $5.28 billion in revenue.Shares shot up past their buy point of 76.85 on the report after developing a cup-with-handle base for the last eight months, and closed up 10.7% to 83.23.""At first glance we were impressed by Dollar General's better-than-expected Q4 '15 results, which were consistent with our view that the company remains the 'least risky' way of gaining exposure to the deep-discount retailing space,"" wrote BB&T Capital Markets analyst Anthony Chukumba in a brief note Thursday morning, prior to the earnings call.Dollar General's Q4 same-store sales growth of 2.2% was in line with Chukumba's estimate. Reuters cited Consensus Metrix analysts as expecting a 1.9% rise.In keeping with the company's newly established long-term growth model, it is broadly targeting 7%-10% annual net sales growth and a 10%-15% rise in diluted earnings per share every year. Wall Street is anticipating 9% sales growth and a 13% EPS rise for the year.Dollar General said it approved on Tuesday a 14% boost to its regular quarterly cash dividend to 25 cents a share. It plans to open 900 new stores in fiscal 2016.Competitor Dollar Tree (DLTR), which recently acquired Family Dollar, fell short of Q4 estimates when it reported at the beginning of the month. Full-year profit guidance also missed views.Dollar Tree's stock rebounded that day to close higher, nearly reaching an 82.86 buy point. But shares drifted lower over the next several sessions until Thursday morning, when they vaulted 4% to 79.82, moving above their 50-day line.RELATED:Discount Retailer Dollar General Offers StabilityDollar Tree Earnings Miss, But Stock Stages Bullish Upside Reversal.

214,DLTR,"Retail tends to depend on a flourishing economy for its significant moves, but discount and variety retailers don't necessarily have that requirement. People love bargains, no matter what. Of IBD's 197 industry groups, the discount and variety retailers have been moving up sharply.

The Nasdaq grabbed a 0.5% gain.Volume rose sharply as the stock market today received early boosts from the European Central Bank's broad upshift in economic stimulus and a better-than-expected U.S. weekly jobless claims report.Even so, Europe's markets pulled well off their early gains to trade narrowly mixed in afternoon action.More than two-thirds of the Dow's stocks traded higher at the starting bell. Intel (INTC) jumped highest, with a 1% gain.

217,DLTR,"After watching its main rival fatten up on a big acquisition last year, deep discount retailer Dollar General (DG) has something smaller in mind for 2016 -- namely, the size of some of its stores.The company has announced plans to expand its test of its smaller-format stores this year even as other retailers, Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) in particular, have abandoned the concept.Dollar General currently is trying out around 30 of the smaller-format stores, which are less than 6,000 square feet vs. 7,400 square feet at the typical location. Earlier this month the company said it will open about 80 smaller-format stores this year as part of an overall plan to open 900 new stores.The smaller stores help Dollar General ""capture growth opportunities"" in more densely populated metropolitan areas, Chief Executive Todd Vasos said on a March 10 conference call with analysts.""Sales productivity and returns based on the early results are very encouraging,"" Vasos said. ""By eliminating less productive product segments and adding or expanding product departments to meet the needs of our urban customers, we believe this smaller-format store will allow us to have higher capture rate per-site selection.""He also reckons that the concept will work well in sparsely populated rural areas.""With this smaller format, we have even greater confidence in our real estate strategy for metro sites and smaller, lower household rural sites,"" Vasos said.Dollar General no doubt hopes to have a better go of it with the smaller format than Wal-Mart. The retail giant’s Express concept also aimed to capture more business in densely populated urban areas, but ultimately fell flat with consumers.There are some obvious differences between Wal-Mart and Dollar General, however -- the biggest being the gap in size between small and large formats.Dollar General’s smaller stores only have about 1,400 fewer square feet than typical stores. In contrast, Wal-Mart’s Express stores, at about 15,000 square feet, were around 170,000 square feet smaller than the typical Supercenter. That’s akin to retail culture shock for consumers who associate Wal-Mart with size and breadth of product offerings. In January, Wal-Mart said it would close all 102 of its Express stores as part of a total of 269 store closures.Although Dollar General looks to capture more business in urban and rural markets with the smaller-format stores, the concept might take a while to have much impact on the overall financial performance.""While a smaller format should allow the company to be more flexible with future site selection, given that plans call for just 80 units on a nearly 12,500 store base, we do not expect the decision will have a material impact on performance in the near- to medium-term,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli noted in a recent report.The bigger impact will come from Dollar General’s aggressive plan to open a total of 900 new stores overall, which would bring the total store count to more than 13,000. That would help it close in on main rival Dollar Tree (DLTR), which currently has about 13,600 stores.Dollar Tree more than doubled its size following last year's $10 billion buyout of Family Dollar Stores, which closed in July. That deal brought Dollar Tree 8,100 stores and $2.6 billion in annual sales, and came after a failed bid by Dollar General to acquire Family Dollar.Dollar General still ranks No. 1 in sales, however. It logged $20.4 billion in revenue during fiscal 2015, which ended in January. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect sales this fiscal year to reach $22.4 billion. Dollar Tree took in $15.5 billion in revenue last fiscal year and is expected to record about $21 billion this year.Meanwhile, Dollar General also has produced better bottom-line growth. While Dollar Tree has reported lower year-over-year earnings each of the last three quarters, Dollar General has strung together six straight quarters of double-digit EPS gains.Dollar General’s steady growth is the product of both internal initiatives and macro trends, Ciccarelli said: ""We believe the company has broadened its customer base through a combination of low prices and conveniently located stores, helped by economic necessity on the part of U.S. consumers and a reduction in the pre-recession social stigma that surrounded shopping at dollar stores.""The company earned $1.30 a share during the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter, up 11% from the prior year and above consensus estimates for $1.26. Revenue gained 7% to $5.29 billion, slightly above views for $5.28 billion. Same-store sales climbed 2.2%, in line with consensus.The company’s sales per square foot reached $226 during 2015, up from $223 the prior year. As recently as 2008, Dollar General had sales per square foot of less than $160, JPMorgan analyst Matthew Boss noted in a report.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Dollar General to grow earnings 15% this fiscal year and another 12% next year.Boss says growth in the metric has been driven by internal initiatives such as expanding the size of Dollar General’s coolers, tweaking its apparel and home goods lineups, and selling beer and wine in some stores.""In addition, the combination of an aging baby boomer population and higher income demographic has placed the company in a sweet spot for traffic,"" Boss wrote.

218,DLTR,"Stocks showed strong gains near midday Tuesday, one day after the Nasdaq and S&P 500 marked an ugly close and notched a distribution day.The stock market strengthened after the February ISM manufacturing index came in better than expected at 49.5 but still showed contraction for the fifth straight month. Meanwhile, U.S. consumers’ six-month economic outlook for the nation fell to its lowest level in more than two years, according to a fresh reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.The Nasdaq jumped 1.8%, the S&P 500 rallied 1.5%, and the Dow Jones industrial average gained 1.3%.Money flowed out of bonds and into stocks as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 7 basis points to 1.8%.In the stock market today, Dollar Tree (DLTR) paid a visit down to its 50-day moving average Tuesday but then reversed higher after a soft start. Shares jumped 2.5%. It's still in a buy range from a prior 80.14 buy point in a six-month cup with handle. A longer cup with handle has also formed, yielding a fresh buy point at 82.86. Before the open, the retailer reported its third straight quarter of declining earnings growth, but sales jumped 117% to $5.37 billion, helped by its merger last year with Family Dollar. Annual earnings growth at Dollar Tree is expected to rise more than 20% in its current fiscal year and next.Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) was an early gainer, rising nearly 2%. Before the open, the company reported another quarter of solid growth, helped by upbeat industry trends and higher margin.Ross Stores (ROST) added 2% to 56.04 ahead of its fiscal Q4 earnings report after the close.

220,DLTR,"Teens and tweens love shopping, and a weekly allowance stretches far at Five Below (FIVE).With its ever-rotating trendy offerings, the rapidly expanding store chain is a haven for the adolescent set. There are shelves of cell-phone accessories, toys, fashions, sports gear, candy and seasonal items -- all for just $5 and below.To the average adult, it may sound like a pubescent-laced nightmare. But there's serious money behind catering to one of the more free-spending demographics out there.Dan Binder, an analyst with Jefferies, says he’s had a buy rating on the stock since its initial public offering in July 2012.“I like the story; I like the store concept,” Binder told IBD. “Most importantly my teenage girls like it too. I will regularly offer them the opportunity to go to movies or to go to Five Below. They usually pick Five Below.”And for those who would gladly leave the shopping at Five Below to their kids, consider this: It currently has 437 outlets in 27 states and has opened 70 of those in 2015 alone.""We’ve had a great year,” Chief Executive Joel Anderson said on a January 2016 conference call. The company says it will grow even faster in 2016, adding roughly 85 stores.Anderson says the company is growing using four strategies: opening new stores and new markets; smart merchandising; increased digital marketing and brand awareness; and building infrastructure and systems that scale. He says the company is now spending “2.5% to 3% of sales” on marketing.""We want to grow to 2,000 or so stores in the U.S.,” he said. “This concept is pretty simple. We think about it as '1/10/100,' less than a one-year payback (on investment in a store), 10 years of consistent comparable store growth, and 100% of our stores are profitable.”Net income for the company’s third quarter, ended Oct. 31, rose a hefty 30% to $4.3 million from $3.3 million. Diluted earnings per share rose 33% to 8 cents from 6 cents in the year-earlier quarter.In the third quarter of 2015, Five Below reported a rise in net sales of $31.7 million or 23% to $169.7 million from $138 million in Q3 2014. Comparable or same-store sales for the period increased 4.8%, the company said.On Jan. 7, 2016, Five Below reported net sales for the nine-week period ended Jan. 2, including the holiday season, rose 24% to $286.1 million from $230.7 million in the comparable nine-week period of 2014. It also said that same-store sales for the nine-week period were up 4.1% year over year.And Five Below also said its outlook for the full fourth quarter, with final results out by the end of this month, calls for net sales of $323 million to $326 million and earnings per share of 75 to 76 cents for the quarter. Zacks puts earnings per share for the company’s fourth quarter at 76 cents.Analysts are smitten with the company’s rapid growth, market positioning and its ability to make its new stores pay.“The payback on new stores is the shortest I’ve ever seen in retail -- they have been paying back their investment in under a year,” Matt Nemer, analyst with Wells Fargo Securities in San Francisco, told IBD.Nemer has an outperform rating on the company’s stock. He notes that growing and opening stores at this rapid a pace could be cause for concern.“What mitigates that is a pretty simple store concept, and then they cluster the openings,” Nemer said. By doing that, the company is able to “focus on that market, and leverage its advertising and marketing.”Analyst Binder from Jefferies also notes that the company has been smart about how it’s building out its network of stores: “They’re keeping it pretty tight; they’re not trying to build in California when they’re still trying to fill out in the East.”Five Below’s share price has had an up and down ride over the past 12 months. It hit a 52-week intraday high on June 23 of 41.47 per share. But it tumbled all the way down to close at 27.50 on Nov. 17, due to worries about retailer Christmas sales. Since then, the price has been climbing -- even in a tough market -- and it’s now trading around 39 a share.Like other retailers, Five Below has also been clever about finding what it calls “wow” items. At Christmas, it sold a remote control helicopter for just $5, which drove a lot of traffic to its stores, analysts said. These items keep tweens and teens coming back to hunt for treasures that usually sell out quickly.In January 2015, CEO Anderson brought in Michael Romanko as executive vice president of merchandising. Nemer says that Romanko has improved the merchandise Five Below sells by bringing in more fitness and electronics products and other products he considers compelling.Binder says the company doesn’t really have a direct competitor, but rather has several rivals, from Walmart (WMT) to Target (TGT) for some goods, and Dick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) for sports gear.But he said Five Below is “deep value.” And unlike dollar stores such as Dollar General (DG) or Dollar Tree (DLTR), Five Below doesn't offer food or household items.“Without a doubt, merchandising to teens is their sweet spot,” he said.A year ago, Anderson said the company was focused on “outlining its digital marketing campaign with TV, email, social media and mobile” all being pieces of it.Anderson understands that his core customers, “teens and tweens,” are “living online.”But Five Below is using its online marketing to drive retail store sales. Analysts say that at its product price point of $5 and less, the company doesn’t have to worry about competition from online retailers.“Five Below’s product prices are so low it would be very difficult to make money shipping them to someone’s home,” said Nemer.Five Below’s puny prices also give the stores the ability to “do well in a strong or a weak economy” when customers have less money to spend, noted Nemer.

221,DLTR,"Today's IBD 50 list, which pinpoints top-performing growth stocks, includes five that made the elite list, fell off and then climbed back aboard.They are Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), Michael Kors (KORS), Five Below (FIVE), Sturm Ruger (RGR) and Smith & Wesson (SWHC).Here's a look at what's happened at these top performers that's put them back on the IBD 50.Natural and organic foods grocer Sprouts Farmers Market continues to rise on strong earnings growth while rivals Whole Foods Market (WFM) and The Fresh Market (TFM) saw lackluster growth last year amid rising competition from supermarket giant Kroger (KR), Amazon (AMZN) and others.On Feb. 25, Sprouts reported a 50% surge in Q4 earnings  and a 27% pop in revenue to $930.3 million. Both figures crushed analyst estimates.Meanwhile, reports that Kroger is looking to buy The Fresh Market have added to expectations of industry consolidation.Sprouts, which boasts a 98 IBD Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99, fell 1.6% Friday.The trendy Hong Kong-based maker of fashion clothes, footwear and accessories took the U.S. and Europe by storm a few years ago. Its stock price soared 405% from 20 at its initial public offering in December 2011 to an all-time high of 101.04 on Feb. 28, 2014, before it consolidated amid execution problems.In February, Kors had its biggest up week in four years on an earnings report that surprised Wall Street analysts.On Feb. 2, its stock shot up 24% and continued rising. Shares ended essentially flat Friday.Deep discount retailers such as Five Below, which sells preteen and teen products for $5 or less, along with Dollar Tree (DLTR), Dollar General (DG) and bulk discounter Big Lots (BIG), saw sales surge during and after the Great Recession, when people were pinching pennies.The trend among consumers to buy at discounts has lingered even as the recession has receded. On Wednesday, Five Below opened its first store in Miami, expanding its store count in the state to 17, with plans to open over 100 more in Florida.Five Below rose 2.8% to 38.77.The nation's largest firearms maker, Smith & Wesson, sees dramatic swings. The Aurora, Colo., movie theater shooting in July 2012 and the Sandy Hook school shooting in December 2012 sent sales, profit and the stock soaring as fears of tougher laws sparked a rush to buy ahead of any legislative action.But demand waned as attempts in Congress to pass new gun limits failed, sending Smith & Wesson's stock tumbling.The mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif., on Dec. 2 revived the gun debate and helped fiscal Q3 results top views late Thursday.Its stock cleared a cup-with-handle base on Friday, touching an all-time high at 27.99 before closing at 27.06, up 6.5% for the day.No. 2 U.S. firearms maker Sturm Ruger reported Q4 results last month that handily beat Wall Street forecasts.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Michael Fifer predicted a ramp-up in demand if Democrats take the White House and Senate, as the next president could get several opportunities to appoint new Supreme Court justices.Sturm Ruger shares closed up 5%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Still, the market may be hanging back ahead of the Fed's March Beige Book report, due at 2 p.m. ET. It is the last before the Federal Open Market Committee's March 14-15 meeting, and it could have some impact on afternoon trade.Oil prices stuck to their early losses, with West Texas Intermediate down almost 2% and Brent crude trading 1% lower. The Energy Information Administration reports its weekly inventory data at 10:30 a.m. ET. The weekly inventories estimate from the American Petroleum Institute indicated Tuesday that inventories rose 9.9 million barrels last week, vs. consensus views for a 2.5 million barrel increase.Dow stocks opened generally lower. Apple (AAPL), Pfizer (PFE) and Merck (MRK) crept higher, all with gains of less than 0.3%. DuPont (DD) and Nike (NKE) led the downside, with losses of 0.9% and 2%, respectively.On the S&P 500, Monsanto (MON) tumbled 5% after management guided its Q2 and full-year earnings below consensus expectations. Dollar Tree (DLTR) shed 3% after its fourth-quarter earnings fell more than expected and a 117% revenue gain stopped short of analyst forecasts.Small caps were performing comparatively well as the S&P 600 generated some big moves. CheckPoint Systems (CKP) skipped up 27% on a takeover offer. Darling Ingredients (DAR) spiked 26% after reporting Q4 results Tuesday. American Vanguard (AVD) rocketed 16% higher after its Q4 report late Tuesday.On the Nasdaq 100, Seagate Technology (STX) climbed almost 3%.

Ross Stores (ROST) posted the strongest gain, up nearly 3% following its Q4 results late Tuesday.  The gain put shares more than 3% above 55.74 buy point.Image provided by Shutterstock.
"
223,DLTR,"Ross Stores (ROST) will raise its minimum hourly wage for eligible employees to $10 from $9 in the second quarter to attract stronger talent, the off-price retailer said Tuesday, matching Wal-Mart’s (WMT) plans for a hike to $10 this year.The planned increase, discussed on Ross’ Q4 earnings call, echoed similar moves from retailers last year, when Wal-Mart raised wages to a minimum of $9 per hour. After Wal-Mart's pay hike, retailers like Ross, off-price rival TJX (TJX) and Target (TGT) followed.The planned pay hike also weighed on Ross’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $2.59-$2.71, which missed forecasts for $2.75. Comparable-store sales are seen rising 1% to 2%. For Q1, the company sees EPS of 69-72 cents, lower than views for 76 cents.The dimmer forecast comes amid broader fears of a recession, more aggressive off-price offerings from Macy’s and Nordstrom, and pressures for better accommodations for labor across the industry.“As we enter 2016, we continue to face our own challenging multiyear comparisons in an increasingly uncertain and volatile macroeconomic and retail environment,” Ross CEO Barbara Rentler said in a statement.“As a result, while we hope to do better, we believe it is prudent to maintain a somewhat cautious outlook when forecasting sales and earnings for the coming year.”Q4 earnings per share rose 10% to 66 cents, topping by 2 cents. Sales increased 7% to $3.25 billion, edging past views for $3.21 billion. Comps rose 4%.Those results came despite tough holiday promotions from rivals. The Midwest continued to be Ross’s strongest performer, while its largest region, California, outpaced the company’s average.Shares were up 0.75% after hours in the stock market today. The stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96, having cleared a consolidation in January but fizzling in the days after. Still, shares have generally found support at their 50-day line.Earlier Tuesday, Dollar Tree (DLTR) said Q4 earnings fell 13% to $1.01 per share, falling short of views for $1.07 a share. Revenue shot up 117% to $5.37 billion, thanks to the company’s Family Dollar takeover, but still missed estimates for $5.41 billion.For the year, the company guided for $3.35-$3.65 a share in earnings, below forecasts for $3.76 a share. The midpoint of targeted revenue of $20.76 billion-$21.11 billion is a hair above current estimates for $20.93 billion.Dollar Tree shares closed up 2.2%.

224,DLTR,"Super Tuesday was equally super for the stock market, as stocks ended with big gains in higher volume.Stocks strengthened after the February ISM manufacturing index came in better than expected, at 49.5, even though the index still showed contraction for the fifth straight month. Meanwhile, U.S. consumers’ six-month economic outlook for the nation fell to its lowest level in more than two years, according to a fresh reading from the IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index.The Nasdaq surged 2.9%, the S&P 500 gained 2.4%, and the Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.1% in the stock market today.Winners topped losers on the NYSE by a 5-to-1 margin. The ratio was nearly 3-to-1 on the Nasdaq.Money flowed out of bonds and into stocks, as the 10-year Treasury yield jumped 9 basis points to 1.82%.Ross Stores (ROST) rose more than 2% during the regular session but slipped 2% in after-hours trading despite reporting better-than-expected earnings and sales. Adjusted earnings of 66 cents a share topped views by 2 cents and rose 10% from a year earlier. Sales rose 7% to $3.25 billion vs. the consensus estimate of $3.21 billion.During the regular session, banks did most of the heavy lifting. Among super-regional banks, SVB Financial (SIVB) jumped nearly 7%, while Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) rose 6%. In the money-center group, Citigroup (C) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were big winners, rising about 6% each.In the retail sector, Dollar Tree (DLTR) paid a visit to its 50-day moving average Tuesday but reversed higher after a soft start. Shares rose more than 2%. The stock is still in a buy range from a prior 8o.14 buy point. Before the open, the retailer reported its third straight quarter of declining earnings growth, but sales jumped 117% to $5.36 billion, helped by its merger last year with Family Dollar. Annual earnings growth at Dollar Tree is expected to rise more than 20% in both its current fiscal year and the next fiscal year.Elsewhere, AutoZone (AZO) gained 2%. Before the open, the company reported another quarter of solid growth, helped by upbeat industry trends and higher margins.Inside the IBD 50, Citrix Systems (CTXS) outperformed, rising 6%.

The stock is below an 83.35 buy point in a four month cup base.Online retailer JD.com (JD) reported a narrower-than-forecast loss and a much better than consensus 57% surge in Q4 revenue.

230,DLTR,"The market is back in an uptrend, but the S&P 500 is still trading below its high from May. It is easy to see eight months of a struggling market reflected in IBD’s blue chip Big Cap 20 list. Fully 14 stocks on the current list qualify as defensive names.Utilities including Southern Energy (SO), Consolidated Edison (ED) and WEC Energy Group (WEC) are defensive because their prices to consumers are generally locked, and customers have little choice but to use the product. Also, the stocks typically offer healthy dividends.Another factor: Utilities are a segment into which mutual funds working to maintain minimum levels of investment rotate into during choppy markets. This demand can hold share prices steady or even drive them higher while the general market corrects.On the other hand, four stocks on the list qualify as solid growth stocks: Cognizant Technologies (CTSH),  Equinix (EQIX) and Intuitive Surgical (ISRG).McDonald’s (MCD) carries some combined traits of defensive and growth stocks, giving it an interesting leg up in the current market. The fast-food chain’s turnaround under new Chief Executive Steve Easterbrook has made the stock a growth contender with regard to a number of fundamental and technical attributes: earnings growth, same-store-sales, relative strength and accumulation/distribution.McDonald’s still falls short on the standard punch list of CAN SLIM elements. But the turnaround has made the stock much more attractive for investors looking for healthy dividend names and/or double-threat defensive plays.McDonald’s, which fell off the list Monday, was extended after last week’s bounce off its 10-week moving average, and from a breakout in October.Dollar General (DG) was a double-threat growth/defensive stock from its re-entry to public markets in November 2009 through July 2012. It and its now-merged competitors Family Dollar and Dollar Tree (DLTR) were grabbing market share from Wal-Mart (WMT) and buying up smaller, regional chains across the U.S. Dollar General’s EPS growth is forecast at a healthy 13% for the year ended in January, and 15% in 2017. Revenue growth has slowed to high single digits.O’Reilly Automotive (ORLY) torqued up nearly 1290% from October 2008 to October 2015. During that period, when the market was choppy or in a correction, auto parts chains were seen as dual growth/defensive plays because they were consolidating and gaining market share while benefiting from consumers holding on to their cars longer than they had in the past.O’Reilly, which announces its Q4 results on Feb. 10, is forecast to remain in the camp through 2015 with full EPS growth forecasts of 24%. Revenue growth is seen slowing to 8%. For 2016, analyst consensus puts EPS growth at 14% and sales growth at 7%.Big Cap 20 stocks tend to be stable, healthy performers, but they are not a list of pick-and-play buy opportunities. Investors need to look carefully at the fundamentals and make sure they understand both the company and its value proposition. Sudden changes in market direction can generate significant changes in the companies on the list.

236,DLTR,"The stock market today continued to trim early losses in afternoon trade, aided by a bounce in oil prices. The S&P 500 recovered to a 0.1% gain after dipping 0.7%. The Nasdaq whittled a 1% decline to 0.1%. The Dow swung out of its earlier losses and rose 0.2%, with Exxon-Mobil (XOM), Pfizer (PFE) and Chevron (CVX) doing much of the heavy lifting.Oil-related groups posted six of the 10 best gains among industries, as oil price rebounded on rising tension in the Middle East.Among S&P 500 stocks, Dollar Tree (DLTR) sprang ahead 7%, despite reporting mixed results in its first full quarter since acquiring peer Family Dollar.

"
237,DLTR,"Strong quarterly results from Wal-Mart and TJX helped ease concerns Tuesday that U.S. consumers are in full retreat, though they continue to shy away from clothes shopping and hunt for the best deals.
"
238,DLTR,"TJX (TJX) topped estimates and raised its guidance going into the all-important holiday quarter, and the off-price retailer doesn't appear to be burdened by the same inventory and pricing issues that plague full-price peers.In contrast to Macy's (M) and Nordstrom's (JWN) weak results and forecasts last week, TJX lifted its full-year same-store sales growth estimate to 4%-5% from a prior outlook for 3%-4% growth. Q3 earnings edged up over 1% to 86 cents per share, topping by 2 cents, and revenue grew over 5% to $7.75 billion, vs. views for $7.73 billion.""It's a broader reflection of core middle- and lower-income consumers, which makes up 70% of the population,"" Retail Metrics' Ken Perkins told IBD. ""They are looking for value.""TJX shares climbed 3.85%, and Wal-Mart gained 3.5%.Fourth-quarter and full-year guidance fell short of expectations, however, as the company accounted for a variety of factors — including its late October acquisition of Australian off-pricer Trade Secret — that should weigh on EPS growth by 9%.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT) saw a 14% drop in Q3 EPS to 99 cents, topping by a penny. Revenue dipped 1.3% to $117.4 billion, missing views, but U.S. comps grew for the fifth straight quarter amid turnaround efforts.Shift In Spending HabitsA ""healthy U.S. consumer backdrop,"" cleaner stores and upgraded staffing, among other factors, will likely drive holiday demand at Wal-Mart, noted Cowen & Co.'s Oliver Chen, who has a market perform rating on the stock.But Wal-Mart still faces competition from Amazon (AMZN), said Perkins, and the big-box retailer is also feeling the heat from dollar stores like Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).Weighing on traditional retailers and department stores is a shift in spending habits. Perkins pointed to off-pricers' post-recession success as a reason why Macy's, Nordstrom and other companies are pursuing the discount space themselves, with offshoots like Macy's Backstage, Nordstrom Rack and Saks Off Fifth, among others.And in an increasingly cutthroat shopping environment that pits brick-and-mortar shops against Amazon and other online shopping destinations, the battle is being fought on several fronts.But shoppers also aren't as interested in apparel, say both Perkins and Morningstar analyst Bridget Weishaar. Those dollars are going into a variety of different areas, including home goods and bigger-ticket items such as automotive needs.Outside of cheaper products, another advantage that off-pricers like TJX and Ross Stores (ROST) have is faster and higher inventory turnover, giving it a flexibility that makes it more akin to fast-fashion favorites Forever 21 and Zara than Macy's or Nordstrom.""The ones that are outperforming right now are the ones that are most responsive to what consumers want,"" Weishaar said.Traditional retailers have a six- to nine-month lead time for orders, she explained, while off-pricers can buy merchandise much closer to the start of each season. This helps to ""weatherproof"" against factors such as, say, a warmer fall that keeps shoppers enjoying the changing foliage instead of shopping for snow boots.When asked about the impact of warm weather — which several other retailers have blamed in recent earnings reports — TJX CEO Carol Meyrowitz said that she'd ""rather not talk about weather,"" focusing instead on her team's performance.""That's all about execution and delivering the right product to the right stores at the right time,"" she said on the post-earnings call. ""Every year, we learn and we get better at weatherproofing our business. It just comes back to the model — we keep ourselves very flexible.""For department stores, improving lead time is easier said than done, said Perkins. ""It's like trying to turn around a battleship.""The good news for shoppers, at least, is that Santa's likely to deliver plenty of discounts for the holidays.Perkins said he expects the promotional environment to be ""comparable, if not even steeper"" and potentially more aggressive than last year's holiday quarter, as retailers try to get rid of leftover inventory from the fall.Weishaar was even less optimistic: ""It's going to be horrible. It's going to be one of the worst we've seen in a long time.""

While a September increase was seen as a sure bet a few months ago, recent global turmoil and mediocre U.S. data have prompted some analysts to expect a hike later.The Cupertino, Calif.-based tech giant, was placed on the good list because of its strong balance sheet, Bloomberg reported. Some of the other companies making the grade ranged from tech to food to finance.They are: Google (GOOGL), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Wells Fargo (WFC), Priceline Group (PCLN), PepsiCo (PEP), BlackRock (BLK), Oracle (ORCL), Kinder Morgan (KMI) and Dollar Tree (DLTR).On the other hand, companies with a lot of floating-rate debt should be avoided when the Fed hikes rates, because their financing costs will rise, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report last week.Despite its enormous sums of cash and overall balance sheet strength, Apple also has a lot of floating-rate debt, according to Goldman.The companies that made it onto the not-so-great stocks list include: McDonald's (MCD), eBay (EBAY), MetLife (MET), Monsanto (MON), Coca-Cola (KO), General Motors (GM), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Allergan (AGN), Chevron (CVX), Time Warner (TWX), Ford Motor (F) and General Mills (GIS).The somewhat schizophrenic listing of Apple in the Goldman Sachs report didn't faze investors. Apple shares rose 1%, finishing at 115.31 on the stock market today, helped by early indications that its latest iPhone models are seeing high demand.Follow Ciaran McEvoy on Twitter @IBD_CMcEvoy and on Facebook.

389,DLTR,"So was the Thursday selloff just a flash in the pan? Was it another short-term bottom? Traders seem to think so; they went bargain hunting to start the month of May on a high note as they took the Dow back up 183 pts ... But were there any real bargains? Not so much, just slightly reduced prices, but enough to cause the trader types to jump back in.
"
390,DLTR,"Despite Friday's strength, the major averages all ended lower for the week. Nasdaq tumbling by 1.7%, while the Dow and the S&P 500 fell by 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. The macro data last week continued to confirm confusion ... The ISM reported that manufacturing activity continues to hold steady ... as they reported a read of 51.5 — unchanged from March — but a bit below what analysts had expected. Remember, anything above 50 is a sign of expansion; so if you believe the numbeR, then we are seeing continued growth in the manufacturing sector. The confusion comes from the fact that the committee noted that 15 of the 18 maufacturing industries reported growth in April vs. the 10 in March, so supposedly a broader distribution, yet the overall number was unchanged ... someone is not being completely honest here ... Math is a funny thing; you can manipulate the numbers anyway you want .. .
"
391,DLTR,"In a separate report the Commerce Dept. showed an unexpected drop in construction spending in March. The report said construction spending fell by 0.6% vs. the expected rise of 0.5%. And the Univ of Mich said what? Sentiment remains robust at 95.9 — and so the mkt, with all the conflicting data — continues to trade near record highs.
"
392,DLTR,"Earnings this quarter disappointed almost on a daily basis — but investors did not seem to care. Earnings are history — it's over — it is the forward guidance that is important. European macro data also did not set any records — yet those markets are teasing with multiyear highs as well. Asia's macro data are mixed and those market are all trading up ... so what is the common theme? Come on, you know the answer ... The central banks. And so as long as the central banks are playing such a key role, the markets will never really trade on their own which is why global mkts are teasing with new or all time highs ...
"
393,DLTR,"Central banks are not going away. The Fed is not in any rush to raise rates. June is off the table and my bet is that September is as well. The ECB is not going anywhere and anytime Chinese or Japanese macro data shows any weaknes, the conversation turns to more stimulus and ""off we go.""
"
394,DLTR,"Now do I think that the economic data will improve? Sure. Will 2015 turn out like 2014, where we got off to a weak start only to ""kill it"" at year end? Yes ... and analysts are already talking about the ""blowout"" 2nd quarter ... they note the ""encouraging"" signs about the labor mkt as initial jobless claims fell to 262k last week, the lowest reading in 15 years as wages supposedly rose by 2.6%. Friday brings us the Non-Farm Payroll report and all expectations are for a ""significant"" rebound — making the April figure the ""outlier,"" allowing the statisticians to dismiss it, causing investors to celebrate. Talk of better days ahead for the second half of the year is all the rage.
"
395,DLTR,"Funny how this works. Last week we learned that a large number of retailers are getting ready to start to shut down so many stores . .. and that means putting people out of work ... So I ask: How much longer can the mkt remain so disconnected from the economic reality? Below is just a short list of the coming closings and it is not encouraging at all:
"
396,DLTR,"180 Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), 150 American Eagle (AEO), 223 Barnes and Noble (BKS), 265 Body Central (BODY), 120 Chico's (CHS), 200 Children's Place (PLCE), 340 Dollar Tree (DLTR), 31 Fredrick's of Hollywood (FOHL), 40 JCPenney's (JCP), 14 Macy's (M), 400 Office Depots (ODP), 200 Walgreens (WBA). .. and the list goes on.
"
397,DLTR,"Yet investors celebrate this news — because these companies are becoming leaner and meaner- agreed, agreed. But what about the job losses?
"
398,DLTR,"Valuations are now running at 17.4 x the past 12 months earnings . .. that is 19% higher than the 10-yr average of 14.6 and with 360 companies having reported Q1 earnings — profits are set to show a decline of only 0.4%, a far cry from the -4.6% expectation .. . and this is happening in a weak recovery. Could it just have been that analysts overestimated the impact of the dollar or the state of the global recovery? Or are we still seeing companies manage their bottom lines via cost cuts vs. real top line growth? Yes, Yes and Yes.
"
399,DLTR,"The wild card remains what the Fed will do — and until the data becomes more consistent the lack of clarity will continue. Now don't get me wrong ... the Fed has been clear about what will cause them to raise rates — we just have not gotten there yet. But when we do I think the mkt will celebrate a move ... investors and the mkt both realize that rates need to go up. They know that we can't do this for much longer ...

Was it another short-term bottom? Traders seem to think so; they went bargain hunting to start the month of May on a high note as they took the Dow back up 183 pts ... But were there any real bargains? Not so much, just slightly reduced prices, but enough to cause the trader types to jump back in.Despite Friday's strength, the major averages all ended lower for the week. Nasdaq tumbling by 1.7%, while the Dow and the S&P 500 fell by 0.3% and 0.4% respectively. The macro data last week continued to confirm confusion ... The ISM reported that manufacturing activity continues to hold steady ... as they reported a read of 51.5 — unchanged from March — but a bit below what analysts had expected. Remember, anything above 50 is a sign of expansion; so if you believe the numbeR, then we are seeing continued growth in the manufacturing sector. The confusion comes from the fact that the committee noted that 15 of the 18 maufacturing industries reported growth in April vs. the 10 in March, so supposedly a broader distribution, yet the overall number was unchanged ... someone is not being completely honest here ... Math is a funny thing; you can manipulate the numbers anyway you want .. .In a separate report the Commerce Dept. showed an unexpected drop in construction spending in March. The report said construction spending fell by 0.6% vs. the expected rise of 0.5%. And the Univ of Mich said what? Sentiment remains robust at 95.9 — and so the mkt, with all the conflicting data — continues to trade near record highs.Earnings this quarter disappointed almost on a daily basis — but investors did not seem to care. Earnings are history — it's over — it is the forward guidance that is important. European macro data also did not set any records — yet those markets are teasing with multiyear highs as well. Asia's macro data are mixed and those market are all trading up ... so what is the common theme? Come on, you know the answer ... The central banks. And so as long as the central banks are playing such a key role, the markets will never really trade on their own which is why global mkts are teasing with new or all time highs ...Central banks are not going away. The Fed is not in any rush to raise rates. June is off the table and my bet is that September is as well. The ECB is not going anywhere and anytime Chinese or Japanese macro data shows any weaknes, the conversation turns to more stimulus and ""off we go.""Now do I think that the economic data will improve? Sure. Will 2015 turn out like 2014, where we got off to a weak start only to ""kill it"" at year end? Yes ... and analysts are already talking about the ""blowout"" 2nd quarter ... they note the ""encouraging"" signs about the labor mkt as initial jobless claims fell to 262k last week, the lowest reading in 15 years as wages supposedly rose by 2.6%. Friday brings us the Non-Farm Payroll report and all expectations are for a ""significant"" rebound — making the April figure the ""outlier,"" allowing the statisticians to dismiss it, causing investors to celebrate. Talk of better days ahead for the second half of the year is all the rage.Funny how this works. Last week we learned that a large number of retailers are getting ready to start to shut down so many stores . .. and that means putting people out of work ... So I ask: How much longer can the mkt remain so disconnected from the economic reality? Below is just a short list of the coming closings and it is not encouraging at all:180 Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF), 150 American Eagle (AEO), 223 Barnes and Noble (BKS), 265 Body Central (BODY), 120 Chico's (CHS), 200 Children's Place (PLCE), 340 Dollar Tree (DLTR), 31 Fredrick's of Hollywood (FOHL), 40 JCPenney's (JCP), 14 Macy's (M), 400 Office Depots (ODP), 200 Walgreens (WBA). .. and the list goes on.Yet investors celebrate this news — because these companies are becoming leaner and meaner- agreed, agreed. But what about the job losses?Valuations are now running at 17.4 x the past 12 months earnings . .. that is 19% higher than the 10-yr average of 14.6 and with 360 companies having reported Q1 earnings — profits are set to show a decline of only 0.4%, a far cry from the -4.6% expectation .. . and this is happening in a weak recovery. Could it just have been that analysts overestimated the impact of the dollar or the state of the global recovery? Or are we still seeing companies manage their bottom lines via cost cuts vs. real top line growth? Yes, Yes and Yes.The wild card remains what the Fed will do — and until the data becomes more consistent the lack of clarity will continue. Now don't get me wrong ... the Fed has been clear about what will cause them to raise rates — we just have not gotten there yet. But when we do I think the mkt will celebrate a move ... investors and the mkt both realize that rates need to go up. They know that we can't do this for much longer ... A rise in rates will show strength and a return to normalcy — In fact when it does happen, I think the mkt will celebrate - singing, ""Here comes the Sun.""This morning U.S. futures are up 5 pts... thanks to some decent overnight data out of Europe.

609,DLTR,"Family Dollar (FDO) turned down Dollar General's (DG) takeover bid Thursday but reportedly would still consider the offer if there were certainty that the deal would get regulatory approval.A Family Dollar analysis indicates that Dollar General would have to sell several hundred more stores for the deal to pass, sources told Bloomberg. Family Dollar's decision Thursday suggested that the current proposal to close 700 stores wouldn't be enough to risk spurning its lower-priced agreement with Dollar Tree (DLTR).But Wolfe Research analyst Scott Mushkin says that Family Dollar is exaggerating its antitrust concerns.""While we acknowledge that regulators have sometimes taken narrow views when two retailers merge together, the bottom line is that even in the smallest markets that we have researched, the consumer has a multitude of options when buying ubiquitous consumables,"" said Mushkin in a research note published Friday.Mushkin added that Wal-Mart (WMT) has such a dominant market share that a ""more formidable"" Dollar General would actually help the competitive dynamics in many markets.Family Dollar shares ticked up 0.3% to 79.61 on the stock market today, remaining above Dollar Tree's offer of $74.50 a share and suggesting that investors expect a higher price tag. Shares of Dollar Tree and Dollar General were flat.Dollar General CEO Rick Dreiling has said he's confident that any antitrust issues could be quickly and efficiently resolved.Dollar Tree would still have the opportunity to match Dollar General's $78.50-a-share offer if Dollar General would agree to appease Family Dollar with additional divestments, Bloomberg said.RELATED:Video: Family Dollar Backs Dollar Tree Buyout Bid.

684,DLTR,"The Williams-Sonoma store on Manhattan's Upper East Side drew a nice crowd during its summer clearance sale on the last Wednesday in July.
"
685,DLTR,"But customers weren't only drawn to the bargains. They were also snapping up pricier items like carving boards that cost $79.95 to $99.95 and bottles of organic olive oil for $24.95, while at least one browser eyed a Nespresso Maestria Espresso machine for $699.95.
"
686,DLTR,"Judging from its financial results,Williams-Sonoma (WSM) doesn't need a sale to lure customers or deliver solid profit growth.
"
687,DLTR,"The luxury home goods retail operator has grown earnings by at least double digits in all but two of the past 16 quarters. During this year's first quarter it logged a 17% year-over-year increase in EPS and 10% gains in both overall sales and comparable brand sales.
"
688,DLTR,"Tiffany, Kors Shine
"
689,DLTR,"Williams-Sonoma isn't the only luxury retailer on a roll. In the first quarter, upscale jewelers Tiffany & Co. (TIF) andSignet Jewelers (SIG) and high-end fashion house Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) all posted double-digit earnings growth, while luxury home furnishings retailer Restoration Hardware (RH) saw a triple-digit gain.
"
690,DLTR,"In contrast, retailers that target the middle- and lower-income consumer — including deep discounters Family Dollar Stores (FDO) and Dollar General (DG) as well as giant discounter Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) — reported little or no growth during the latest quarter.
"
691,DLTR,"As a group, luxury retailers have outpaced the broader market since the first quarter of 2010 and discounters since the fourth quarter of 2009.
"
692,DLTR,"The luxury group's Q1 profit rose 9% from the prior year. That compares with a 7% drop for the discount group and a 4.5% decline for the retail industry, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics.
"
693,DLTR,"Luxury retailers typically cater to consumers with an annual household income above $100,000. For obvious reasons, these consumers can spend more freely than those who make less money.
"
694,DLTR,"Affluent consumers have benefited from the rise both in real estate and equity markets during the economic recovery, Perkins says. Most moderate-to-low-income consumers did not benefit from these assets.
"
695,DLTR,"In addition, Perkins added, ""the economy has been unable to generate enough well-paying jobs to generate a higher level of consumer spending. That's had an impact on many middle- and lower-income consumers. Their wages are stagnant or in decline.""
"
696,DLTR,"Analyst Bradley Thomas, who covers retail hardlines for KeyBanc Capital Markets, offers a similar take.
"
697,DLTR,"""There's definitely a bifurcation, he said. ""Clearly, the wealth effect is the tailwind for high-end retailers and manufacturers.""
"
698,DLTR,"Williams-Sonoma and Restoration Hardware have had ""standout results,"" Thomas says. But chains that are more exposed to low-income consumers — such as rent-to-own operators Rent-A-Center (RCII) and Aaron's (AAN) — have had a ""fair amount of weakness this year.""
"
699,DLTR,"The low-end consumer also has been faced with a ""litany of small cost increases that really add up,"" Thomas says. These include a reduction in food stamp benefits and unemployment benefits.
"
700,DLTR,"Luxury retailers, meantime, have done their fair share to lure consumers.
"
701,DLTR,"Take Williams-Sonoma, whose lineup of retail operations includes Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm. It has seen double-digit profit growth in all but one of the past nine quarters.
"
702,DLTR,"Thomas says one reason for the company's strong results ""comes down to their omnichannel model, which it does better than just about anyone.""
"
703,DLTR,"""Omnichannel"" refers to the fact that each of the company's brands sells through its own stores, online and through their catalogs.
"
704,DLTR,"""Williams-Sonoma has omnichannel in their DNA dating back to their heritage as a catalog business, which has translated very well into being an online business as well as a brick-and-mortar retailer,"" Thomas said.
"
705,DLTR,"In a July report initiating coverage on Williams-Sonoma with a ""buy"" rating, Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace said the company's ""numerous store formats, strong retail brands and established e-commerce presence (44% of the business) should result in continued market-share growth both in the U.S. and internationally.""
"
706,DLTR,"This in turn should help Williams-Sonoma exceed its planned mid- to high single-digit revenue growth and low- double-digit to mid-teens EPS growth, Mace added.
"
707,DLTR,"Real Estate Restoration
"
708,DLTR,"Restoration Hardware has also been a standout, with a long run of double-digit or better earnings and sales growth. The company is undergoing a real estate transformation that involves scrapping some smaller stores in favor of bigger ones, including Full Line Design Galleries of 25,000 to 60,000 square feet.
"
709,DLTR,"As part of the transformation, Restoration Hardware is also revamping its supply chain and system platform. These initiatives have helped the company deliver industry-leading same-store sales gains.
"
710,DLTR,"But times have been tough on the discount front — so tough that even the world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart, has seen several quarters of declining U.S. same-store sales.
"
711,DLTR,"Company officials hope a management shakeup will help turn things around. On July 24, Wal-Mart announced that its U.S. CEO, Bill Simon, is stepping down and being succeeded by Greg Foran, president and CEO of Wal-Mart Asia.
"
712,DLTR,"Wal-Mart's core customer ""has been under pressure since the recovery,"" Perkins said. ""It's being forced to broaden its online effort to bring in more customers, and to expand its (small-format) Neighborhood Market stores to capture some of the business they've been losing to Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Dollar General.""
"
713,DLTR,"Perkins points out that Simon noted just last month that the middle-to-low-end consumer has not seen much recovery.
"
714,DLTR,"Deep Discount Powerhouse
"
715,DLTR,"Meanwhile, Wal-Mart might be facing more competition. Deep discounter Dollar Tree, which sells everything for $1 or less, announced on July 28 that it had agreed to buy struggling Family Dollar in an $8.5 billion deal that would create a new No. 1 player in the deep discount space and create a 13,000-store retail powerhouse.
"
716,DLTR,"The merger should result in improvements at Family Dollar, says Wedbush analyst Joan Storms. ""It clearly would improve its merchandise assortment. That will lead to increased store productivity and operating margin expansion, which would make it a stronger competitor to the likes of Wal-Mart (smaller format) Express stores.""
"
717,DLTR,"One thing many agree on is that the bifurcation between the low-end and high-end retail consumer will continue.
"
718,DLTR,"""It's not because the 'have nots' are getting worse, but because the 'haves' are getting better faster,"" said Joel Bines, managing director at consultancy AlixPartners.
"
719,DLTR,"This has allowed luxury retailers to increase prices and create an even bigger separation between the two segments, he says. ""This also puts enormous pressure on retailers who cater to the lower-end consumer since they can't grow by raising prices.""The Williams-Sonoma store on Manhattan's Upper East Side drew a nice crowd during its summer clearance sale on the last Wednesday in July.But customers weren't only drawn to the bargains.

"
729,DLTR,"The report notes that industry consolidation could help increase productivity and reduce excess capacity. The recent bidding war between Dollar General (DG) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) for Family Dollar (FDO) ""highlights the potential to rationalize dollar-store capacity,"" the analysts said.

730,DLTR,"For example, they said that dollar stores are saturated in the eastern half of the U.S. and that if Dollar General were to win Family Dollar, then Family Dollar would provide Dollar General with an opportunity to expand into the less saturated western half and create a ""rational duopoly"" with Dollar Tree.

731,DLTR,"The team didn't look at retailers trading above 10 times enterprise value/EBITDA — it would make a high teens return on invested capital tough.

Stubbornly high unemployment, weak wage growth and cutbacks in some government assistance programs such as food stamps are keeping a lid on spending.As a result, the Retail-Discount/Variety group is ranked a dismal 182 on IBD's list of 197 industries.Dollar Tree is trying to reinvent itself as a broader-line retailer, adding new goods and marketing to a wider market segment.On its last conference call, CEO Bob Sasser said the company had earlier beefed up its checkout and impulse department, frozen and refrigerated products, stationery, candy and party supplies.Mother Nature will play a role in the company's earnings. Severe weather impacted results in the final quarter of 2013. Sasser noted on the company's quarterly conference call in February that ""out of the full 91 days in the quarter 33 days were negatively affected by winter storms that forced a large number of store closures.""Dollar Tree was down 1% in Monday morning trading on the stock market.Rival Dollar General (DG), the largest deep discount chain, will report Q1 earnings on June 3. The company, which operates more than 11,000 stores, has annual revenue of about $17.5 billion and has beaten or matched analysts' EPS estimates for the last four quarters.Consensus is for the company to record a 2.8% rise in EPS to 73 cents, on a 7.8% increase in revenue to $4.56 billion. Dollar General was up fractionally.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar

Some may need a different footprint or to trim locations as they keep adapting to a changing landscape in which online sales are surging and the old one-size-fits-all store model no longer works with today's cross-channel shoppers.

818,DLTR,"Let volume be your guide. That's been a constant refrain in IBD's articles for years and years.Here's the idea behind it: Big volume indicates anxious buying or selling by institutions or other big investors. It's these heavyweights who have the power to really move a stock to new heights or send it tumbling.But what exactly does it mean to have big volume? It refers to many more shares changing hands than normal.Look at the average daily volume for the stock that you're studying, then see if the current session's turnover is much higher than average. To get the average level, IBD and its sister company MarketSmith generally use a 50-day moving average.On the breakout, you prefer to see trade that's at least 40% above the average over the past 50 days. On a weekly basis, you would like to see higher turnover for the breakout week than during the prior week.William O'Neil, IBD's founder and chairman, has noted that many individual investors are leery of buying a stock that's breaking out.""In almost all cases, it's professional institutional buying that causes the big, above-average volume increases in the better-priced, better-quality growth-oriented stocks at pivot breakouts,"" he wrote in his best-seller ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""He also wrote: ""A full 95% of the general public is usually afraid to buy at such points because it's scary and it seems risky and rather absurd to buy stocks at their highest prices. Your objective isn't to buy at the cheapest price or near the low, but to begin buying at exactly the right time, when your chances for success are greatest.""Dollar Tree's (DLTR) action in February 2010 provided a good example of massive turnover during a breakout. The discount retailer cleared a long flat base in the week ended Feb. 26. 1 On a daily chart, volume was 448% more than its 50-day average of 1.2 million shares. It drew its biggest weekly volume in about 10 months as it surged. 2You also prefer to see strong trade when a stock hits a new 52-week peak. That shows that some big investors haven't lost their appetite for the stock even as it reaches new high ground. At the same time, don't expect to see big turnover with every new high. That just doesn't happen.

820,DLTR,"Desperate times often call for patience.Leading stocks fighting to break out against a pitch-and-buckle market might take a little bit longer to set themselves up for glory.One chart intricacy that often results is the base-on-base pattern. It often forms when a breakout succumbs to market pressure before posting a 20% gain. The stock falls into another consolidation, giving up some, if not all, of its gains.To many investors, the move looks like an unqualified failure. But those clued in to base-on-base patterns keep a careful eye on the second consolidation, watching for a fresh buy point to appear. When it does, this second buy opportunity often signals an even more potent breakout and the launch of a winning run.To qualify as a base on base, the second pattern's peak will be no more than 20% above the buy point of the first. Also, the floor of the second structure should drop to or a bit below the top of the first.In a base on base, what matters is the condition of the second base. A tight, symmetrical formation may well be a go signal. A sloppy or flaw-riddled base may suggest the formation is not yet ripe.The actual patterns in base-on-base formations can include virtually any base types.Let's take the case of Dollar Tree (DLTR). The fast-growing purveyor of goods for a buck or less didn't get far after breaking out of a cup with handle at 31.62 in August 2009 1. But a solid flat base formed over the next five months.The decline from a 34.48 high to a 29.80 low on the base's left side was confined to 14%. Its new breakout in February 2010 2 ignited a rally of more than 130%.A base on base is counted as one structure because the bases are less than 20% apart. Also, a base on base isn't always a green flag. That is particularly true when the market is in decline or choppy.A stock that barely clears its buy point, or clears then falls back immediately below the buy mark, may be set for additional consolidation. But if the subsequent pattern doesn't form atop the first, it is not a base on base.If the second base corrects so deeply that it undercuts the low of the first base, it is also not a base on base. This action resets the stock's overall base count.Stocks in late-stage bases often fail, and even if it's a great stock it may be on the verge of topping.

824,DLTR,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is DLTR due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsDollar Tree Inc. posted first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both earnings and sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate but improved year over year. Further, management updated guidance for second-quarter and fiscal 2018.Quarter in DetailDollar Tree’s quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.19 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23. However, the metric rose 21.4% from the prior-year quarter. Also, earnings came within the company’s guided range of $1.18-$1.25 per share.On a GAAP basis, earnings per share came in at 67 cents, down from 85 cents in the year-ago quarter.Consolidated net sales were up 5% to $5,553.7 million in the quarter but came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,571 million.Further, enterprise same-store sales (comps) grew 1.4%. Comps at Dollar Tree rose 4% on a constant currency basis, driven by improved average ticket and traffic. Including the Canadian currency fluctuations impact, comps at Dollar Tree grew 4.1%. However, comps at Family Dollar dipped 1.1%.The company’s quarterly gross profit advanced 4.5% year over year to $1,699.6 million, while gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) to 30.6%. The margin contraction was mainly due to increased shrink, distribution and occupancy expenses, somewhat compensated by lower markdowns and merchandise costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 20 bps to 22.7% of sales, owing to increased store payroll expenses, partly mitigated by lower depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of sales.Further, operating income dipped 0.5% to $437.6 million in the reported quarter. Also, operating margin came in at 7.9%, down 40 bps from the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetDollar Tree ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $475.2 million, net merchandise inventories of $3,248.2 million, net long-term debt excluding current maturities of $5,040.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $7,355.7 million. Capital expenditures incurred during the quarter were $180.9 million. Management expects consolidated capital expenditures to range $875-$890 million for fiscal 2018.Store UpdateDollar Tree opened 130 outlets, expanded or relocated 26 outlets and shuttered 5 outlets in the reported quarter. The company completed another 215 Family Dollar store renovations thereby bringing the total to 592. During the quarter, the company added the Snack Zone to 214 Dollar Tree stores and plans to launch this into 750 Dollar Tree stores in fiscal 2018.GuidanceManagement updated guidance for second-quarter and fiscal 2018. It forecasts consolidated net sales for the second quarter in the band of $5.47-$5.57 billion, with low-single-digits comps growth. Earnings are envisioned in the range of $1.07-$1.16 per share.For fiscal 2018, the company projects consolidated net sales in the range of $22.73-$23.05 billion versus $22.70-$23.12 billion guided earlier. The company expects low-single-digit comps increase and a 3.7% rise in square footage. Further, earnings per share for the full fiscal are envisioned in the $4.80-$5.10 range versus $5.25-$5.60 guided earlier.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter compared to six lower.Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and Consensus Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and Consensus | Dollar Tree, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, DLTR has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F.

825,DLTR,"Shares of Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) have lost 9.4% since the company reported lower-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 31. Also, management’s trimmed earnings forecast for fiscal 2018 and higher SG&A expenses are hurting investors’ sentiment.A glance at the company’s share price performance shows that it has declined 17.6% year to date against the industry’s rally of 11.6%. The stock’s dismal run is also evident from its Momentum Score of F, which indicates that the chances of recovery are bleak. What’s Hurting the Stock?Dollar Tree’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results marked its second straight sales and earnings miss. Furthermore, deleverage in SG&A rate owing to higher labor expenses, store payroll costs and utilities expenses are weighing on margins. Evidently, gross margin in the quarter contracted mainly due to increased shrink, distribution and occupancy expenses. Lower gross margin coupled with increased expenses weighed on the operating margin that declined year over year.Additionally, analysts are becoming bearish on the stock as apparent from the downward revisions in its earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.58 for fiscal 2018 and $6.26 for fiscal 2019 moved south 7 cents and 13 cents, respectively, in the last 30 days. Also, the estimate of $1.15 for the fiscal second quarter revised downward by 3 cents in the last 30 days. Management now envisions earnings per share in the range of $4.80-$5.10 for fiscal 2018, down from $5.25-$5.60 guided earlier. Earnings for the impending quarter are envisioned in the range of $1.07-$1.16 per share.This apart, Dollar Tree is facing higher freight and fuel cost related challenges, which is expected to continue. Also, the company operates in the highly competitive discount retail merchandise sector. Consequently, it faces stiff competition from well-known industry players. This, in turn, might hurt the company’s top line and profitability.Is There Any Upside Potential?Though the aforesaid factors reveal Dollar Tree’s darker side, its ongoing integration of Family Dollar, which represented nearly 50% of the company’s consolidated sales in first-quarter fiscal 2018, is noteworthy. In addition, the company is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. While the increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company’s results for some time, it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.In fact, Dollar Tree has become a mega U.S. discount with this transaction. The combined chain is positioned to reach out to more value-seeking consumers through a network spanning across vast geographies. Further, the company offers broader and multiple assortments at more compelling prices and is better positioned to negotiate with suppliers.Moreover, Dollar Tree remains committed toward expanding its store base while incorporating technological advancements. The company also leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets, which is expected to generate increased sales and market share. Notably, the company added the Snack Zone to 214 Dollar Tree stores in the fiscal first quarter and plans to launch this into 750 Dollar Tree stores in fiscal 2018. In fact, management remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States in the long term.Also, the company’s focus on consumables and discretionary categories, and the everyday low-price model are expected to boost traffic. We believe that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strategic initiatives will take time to overcome the challenges.Want Top-Ranked Retail Stocks? Check TheseUrban Outfitters, Inc.

826,DLTR,"The grocery war is heating up with tech giants fast trying to invade the space. Reportedly, Microsoft, Inc. (MSFT  -  Free Report) is working on a technology that will eliminate the role of a cashier in a store. And if reports are to be believed, the tech giant is already in talks with retailers, including Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Understandably, the technology is being developed in a move to compete with Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store.That said, an increasing number of retailers and grocers are focusing on customer convenience. From speeding up delivery to introducing digital shopping scanners and coming up with cashier-less stores, retailers are aggressively pumping in more money to develop new technologies and adding muscle to their delivery arm to stay ahead in the race.Microsoft Challenges AmazonMicrosoft is reportedly developing a technology wherein a cashier would no longer be required in a brick-and-mortar store. The tech giant is working on a system, which will be able to track what a customer puts in his or her cart in a brick-and mortar store. In fact, Microsoft reportedly has already demonstrated the sample to select retailers.Interestingly, the new technology could revamp the company’s previous failed attempt of check-out free shopping. Moreover, Microsoft plans not to introduce this technology in its stores first. Instead, it is reportedly in talks with Walmart. Understandably, the new technology is in a move to challenge Amazon Go, the e-commerce giant’s cashier-less store. Amazon, over the last few years, has changed the entire retail ballgame that has made brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) shift focus to online.However, Microsoft’s aim is to develop a cost-effective retail tech system that will not only eliminate the role of a cashier but also will help in cutting down the cost of thousands of cameras installed on the ceilings of brick-and-mortar store.Others Join the RaceIn January 2018, Amazon opened the first Amazon Go store in Seattle. The 1,800-square-foot automated store has replaced cashiers with a smartphone app and hundreds of small cameras that tracks customers’ purchases. This certainly was a revolutionary move by Amazon and a direct challenge to brick-and-mortar giants.However, brick-and-mortar giants too have been increasingly focusing on online sales and using technology to stay abreast in the race. Walmart, Amazon’s biggest rival, already has its Scan and Go technology that allows customers to shop at its stores without interacting with a cashier.In fact, earlier this year, Walmart announced that it will be expanding its Scan and Go technology to an additional 100 stores. Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, immediately after the launch of Amazon Go, Kroger announced that it will expand its Scan, Bag, Go technology to new divisions. The technology helps customers to visit a store self-checkout area for payment. Apart from expanding its Scan, Bag, Go technology to 400 stores by the end of this year, Kroger is also working on a new technology wherein customers can skip checkout and directly pay through an app.Understandably, everyone is trying to build a loyal clientele by playing on the customer- convenience quotient. Amazon too is planning to open more Amazon Go stores by the end of this year, thus heating up the retail race.Bottom LineTechnology undoubtedly has changed the entire retail game in the last few years, with the gap between online and offline fast disappearing. Microsoft’s new technology certainly will make things easier for retailers and intensify competition.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

830,DLTR,"Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) are two of the largest discount stores in the country, and for many investors, hard to distinguish in terms of business structure and expectations. With both companies releasing their earning reports tomorrow, here is what investors need to know in order to stay ahead of the curve.Comparative MetricsDollar General and Dollar Tree are sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), respectively. Dollar General stock is currently priced at $95.54 per share, while Dollar Tree is priced at $94.76 per share. Both stocks have seen slight losses of no more than 1% on the month.While broader share price movement has been nearly symbiotic, trading on the day seems to speak otherwise. Dollar Tree’s price is currently level with its close yesterday, while Dollar General is down nearly 1% in early trading today, perhaps speaking to investor sentiment.ForecastWhile the two companies seem homogenous, looking at our Zacks Consensus Estimates, it is easy to see some key differential statistics.Current quarter consensus revenue and earnings estimates for Dollar General stand at $6.2 billion (+10.3% year-over-year growth) and $1.40 per share (+35.9%).

In the same time frame, Dollar Tree’s EPS estimates have dropped from $1.24 to $1.23 per share.Bottom LineWhile Dollar Tree has not seen negative share price movement on the day thus far, its lower Zacks Rank and diminished revenue and earnings estimates combine to provide potentially better prospects for Dollar General heading into the release of their earnings reports.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Dollar Tree, Inc.

In fact, all these aforementioned tailwinds make us optimistic about the company’s upcoming quarterly results.However, Dollar Tree has underperformed the industry in the past year.

The company has a robust earnings history, having delivered positive earnings surprises for more than three years. However, it broke the trend in the last reported quarter with a negative earnings surprise of 0.7%.Nevertheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.48 for the first quarter increased by a penny in the last seven days and reflects a year-over-year improvement of 29.8%. Management envisions earnings per share within $2.43-$2.48 for the quarter.Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise |  QuoteSo let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the earnings announcement.Factors Influencing 1Q18Ulta Beauty’s effective marketing initiatives, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations and strength in prestige cosmetics bode well. Notably, Ulta Beauty recorded 60.4% growth in e-commerce sales in last reported quarter, which helped it to stand out amid intense online competition. Additionally, favorable traffic is driving its comparable store sales (comps) growth. Further, the company has been gaining from enhanced market share gains and benefits from loyalty program, which have been significantly contributing to its results. These are likely to prove conducive to the company’s upcoming quarterly results.These initiatives have also aided the stock to outperform the industry in the last three months. The stock has returned 27.2%, while the industry gained 2.8%.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, management anticipates net sales in the $1,506-$1,519 million band. Comps, including e-commerce sales, are predicted to grow 6-7%.Notably, analysts surveyed by Zacks expect revenues for the first quarter to come in at $1,525 million, up nearly 16% from the year-ago period. Further, the consensus estimate for salon business’ revenues is pegged at $80 million, up 8.5% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.However, Ulta Beauty has been grappling with soft margins for a while now. The company witnessed contraction of both gross and operating margins in the fiscal fourth quarter. Gross profit margin contracted 50 basis points due to deleveraged merchandise margins and one-time bonus payment with respect to tax reforms. Higher SG&A expenses along with lower gross margin led to the decline in operating margin.Further, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives might deter buyers’ loyalty for the brand, consequently impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner.Zacks ModelOur proven model shows that Ulta Beauty is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

833,DLTR,"The fight for e-commerce retail supremacy is heating up with The Kroger Co (KR  -  Free Report) acquiring meal-kit company Home Chef. The latest development comes within a week of the company striking a deal with British online grocer Ocado to use its robotic technology to fill up orders at its warehouses. The retail landscape is fast changing with almost all major brick-and-mortar stores increasingly focusing on their e-commerce segment.It goes without saying that Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) has changed the entire retail ballgame in the last few years, which is compelling its peers re-strategize their business model. Moreover, the grocery industry, which till some time ago remained insulated from the e-commerce war, isn’t safe anymore, with retailers acquiring grocery companies and taking the fight to the delivery race. Given this scenario, the Ocado deal coupled with the acquisition of Home Chef definitely is a move by Kroger to stay abreast in the retail race.Kroger Heats Up the E-Commerce WarOn Wednesday, Kroger announced that it will be buying Chicago-based meal-kit company, Home Chef, in a deal that could amount to $700 million. The initial price is $200 million and could go up to $700 million over the next five years in earnout payments to Home Chef if it meets certain sales and performance targets.Kroger, the largest U.S. supermarket chain by stores and sales, has been testing the market of its own meal kits at its own stores for quite some time now. Understandably, the Home Chef buyout is in a move to stay in the e-commerce race that follows Amazon’s takeover of the Whole Foods Market.Much like a number of other brick-and-mortar stores, Kroger too has been making efforts to survive the e-commerce onslaught. The Home Chef acquisition is definitely give Kroger a shot in the arm, as Home Chef saw its sales jump 150% to $250 million in 2017.Moreover, the tie-up with Ocado last week will help Kroger will help the company run automated warehouses and deliver food with the help of Ocado’s robots. Kroger certainly is taking the challenge to face both Amazon and Walmart, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) with its increased push in grocery and delivery race.Brick-and-Mortar Stores Take Up the ChallengeThe e-commerce retail war heated up after Amazon’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods in 2017. Moreover, the e-commerce giant announced two-hour same-day grocery delivery service in February, which set the alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar stores like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) that so long rested assured of business safety. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Walmart, undoubtedly, is Amazon’s biggest rival and has been making inroads into the e-commerce space. The brick-and-mortar giant’s recent $16 billion acquisition of India’s e-commerce company Flipkart is been viewed as a bold step toward the online shift.Target too has been increasingly focusing on the e-commerce and delivery front. The company has made e-commerce an important part of its $7 billion turnaround plan. Keeping this mind, Target will be introducing voice-activated shopping with the help of Alphabet, Inc’s (GOOGL) Google assistant. Also, earlier this month the company slashed the next-day delivery feel to almost half to attract more customers.Meanwhile, Dollar Tree has been taking up the challenge by opening more stores. The company will be introducing 650 more stores in 2018 in order to lure more customers. Given that all products at Dollar Tree stores are priced at $1 or below (pricing is its biggest strength) the company is being able to keep itself afloat amid the e-commerce onslaught. Similarly, Dollar General too plans to open 900 stores in 2018.Summing UpThe retail landscape has certainly changed with e-commerce running the show. This definitely has made brick-and-mortar stores sit up and think. However, the race for supremacy seems to be heating up with more players adding muscle to their e-commerce and delivery arm with more acquisitions and technological assistance.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

834,DLTR,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) finally announced on Wednesday that it will be acquiring a substantial stake in India’s e-commerce giant Flipkart. This is likely the smartest move that Walmart has made in recent times. Flipkart will give Walmart the much-required strength Walmart needs to explore the highly coveted India market.Understandably, Walmart’s decision is powered by the intent to compete with e-commerce giant Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has established itself already in the targeted emerging market. That said, despite this big-ticket acquisition, Walmart’s shares took a hit on Wednesday, declining as much as 3.1%. However, it is too early to rule out Walmart given that the Flipkart acquisition will only add to its strengths.Walmart’s Boldest MoveWalmart has agreed to pay $16 billion for a 77% stake in Flipkart, making it the company’s biggest deal ever. This gives Walmart a chance to capture the growing e-commerce market in India. After all, Flipkart is the one of the most successful e-commerce startups over there.Acquiring Flipkart will give Walmart a second chance in India. The retail behemoth has struggled to penetrate the India’s retail market worth $670 billion, despite making its debut 11 years ago. Walmart has a meager 21 wholesale stores in India, and no e-commerce presence. Also, Walmart’s joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business turned sour a few years ago.Understandably, the e-commerce route to tap the India market seems to be the best bet for Walmart. For more than a decade now, different governments in India have denied permission to the likes of Walmart to set up stores in that country. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Finally, when permission was granted in 2012, it came with conditions that foreign investors could do business in India only in partnership with that country’s retailers.   At the same time, Walmart too could not have opened its own e-commerce wing as foreign investment as online retailing isn’t allowed in India. Hence, acquiring an existing business was the best option.How Filpkart Can Turn Walmart’s FortunesFlipkart is India’s own Amazon being that country’s biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second largest. Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been its cash on delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Understandably, Walmart will try to cash in on this quotient.At the same time, this will give Walmart a level playing ground with its biggest competitor Amazon. Jeff Bezos’ company has in the last few years changed the entire retail landscape and is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race.Wait and Watch GameWalmart’s shares slipped 3.1% following news of the Flipkart acquisition. However, the fall isn’t because investors don’t have faith in the stock. Rather, it occurred because Walmart said that the deal could cut into its projected earnings per share of $0.25-$0.30 in the current fiscal year and around $0.60 in the next fiscal. The company also indicated that it anticipates Flipkart’s operating loss in 2017 to almost double this year.This might have dented investor’s confidence to some extent as they have long known that such a decision was in the coming. Moreover, Flipkart holds 30% of India’s e-commerce market. In fact, investors reacted in similar fashion when Walmart in 2016 acquired Jet.com for $3.3 billion. However, the acquisition turned out to be Walmart’s biggest weapon to compete with Amazon, thus proving to be one of its most successful deals.Summing UpWalmart’s decision to acquire a majority stake in Flipkart undoubtedly is a bold move and perhaps the best possible way to say in the race. The deal definitely gives the company a second chance to tap the Indian market. Moreover, given the strict operating rules for retailers in India, the Flipkart acquisition looks the best and timeliest for Walmart to stay ahead in the highly competitive retail space.Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

836,DLTR,"Since we are in the thick of the earnings season, investors should look for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Upbeat earnings results are more often than not followed by an uptick in the share price. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!But earnings acceleration works even better in boosting the stock price. Studies have shown that majority of successful stocks see acceleration in earnings before a positive stock price movement.Future OutperformersSo, what is earnings acceleration? It is the incremental growth in a company’s earnings per share (EPS). In other words, if the rate of a company’s quarter-over-quarter earnings growth increases within a stipulated frame of time, it can be called earnings acceleration.In case of earnings growth, you pay for something that is already reflected in the stock price. But, earnings acceleration helps spot stocks that haven’t caught the attention of investors yet, which once secured will invariably lead to a rally in the share price. This is because earnings acceleration considers both direction and magnitude of growth rates.Increasing percentage of earnings growth means that the company is fundamentally sound and has been on the right track for a considerable period of time. On the other hand, a sideways percentage of earnings growth indicates a period of consolidation or slowdown, while a decelerating percentage of earnings growth may at times drag prices down.Hence, earnings acceleration should be viewed as a key metric for share price outperformance.The Winning StrategyLet’s look at stocks for which the last two quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates exceed the growth rates of the previous periods. The projected quarter-over-quarter percentage EPS growth rates are also expected to be higher than the previous periods’ growth rates.EPS % Projected Growth (Q1)/(Q0) greater than EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1): The projected growth rate for the current quarter (Q1) over the completed quarter (Q0) has to be greater than the growth rate from the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1).EPS % Growth (Q0)/(Q-1) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2): The growth rate for the completed quarter (Q0) over one quarter ago (Q-1) has to be greater than the growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2).EPS % Growth (Q-1)/(Q-2) greater than EPS % Growth (Q-2)/(Q-3): The growth rate from one quarter ago (Q-1) over two quarters ago (Q-2) has to be greater than the growth rate from two quarters ago (Q-2) over three quarters ago (Q-3).In addition to this, we have added the following parameters:Current Price greater than or equal to $5: This screens out the low-priced stocks.Average 20-day volume greater than or equal to 50,000: High trading volume implies that the stocks have adequate liquidity.The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,735 stocks to only 27. Here are the top four stocks:Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) operates variety retail stores in the United States and Canada. It operates through two segments, Dollar Tree and Family Dollar.

It has also been making investments in its Aaron's Business to enhance direct-to-consumer platform as well as boost overall growth.Further, management remains encouraged about the SEI acquisition, Aaron's largest franchisee, which is likely to benefit the company in the first quarter. The transaction is expected to widen Aaron's footprint in the markets with high-growth opportunities besides boosting its revenues and supply-chain synergies between the Aaron's Business and Progressive Leasing.Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $941.3 million, up 11.5% from the year-ago quarter.However, Aaron's has been witnessing declining comparable store sales (comps) at the company-operated stores for quite some time, which is a key concern. Evidently, comps dropped 5.4%, 5.6%, 8.1% and 9.3% in the fourth, third, second and first quarters of 2017, respectively. Also, the company’s Aaron’s Business segment is persistently sluggish and is reporting soft revenues for a while now.Given the mixed factors, let’s wait and see what lies ahead of Aaron's when it reports first-quarter 2018 results.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively show that Aaron’s is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as highlighted below. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, Aaron’s Earnings ESP of -0.30% leaves surprise prediction inconclusive as the company needs to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to beat estimates this time around:Ruth's Hospitality Group, Inc. (RUTH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.70% and a Zacks Rank of 1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.01% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.66% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

838,DLTR,"Bargain hunters are back on the streets buying furniture and appliances, and dining out, as U.S. retail sales rebounded sharply in the month of March, thus ending the streak of three straight declines. With strengthening labor market, tax reform and rising incomes Americans look much more confident now. Moreover, annual tax refunds are also likely to increase their propensity to consume. Clearly, consumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — is likely to remain strong in the months ahead.Retail Sales Bounce BackThe Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in March advanced 0.6% to $494.6 billion — following a decline of 0.1% and 0.2% registered in February and January, respectively. Analysts cited that slump in retail sales in the first two months of the year was a temporary hitch after a sturdy holiday season. Although unfavorable weather played spoilsport, Easter holiday lifted consumers’ shopping spirit.Notably, retail sales improved 4.5% from March 2017. The report suggests that sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers increased 2%, while sales at electronics & appliance stores rose 0.5%. Meanwhile, sales at food & beverage stores and receipts at restaurants witnessed growth of 0.2% and 0.4%, respectively. Sales at non-store retailers climbed 0.8% and increased 9.7% from the prior-year period.However, receipts at gasoline stations and sales at building material dealers fell 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively. Sales at sporting goods, hobby, book & music stores dipped 1.8%, while at clothing shops the same fell 0.8%.This Means a Lot to RetailersPick up in retail sales is welcome news for retailers, whose fortunes depend upon consumers’ willingness to spend. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to boost consumer confidence. We expect this positive sentiment to translate into higher consumer spending. Certainly, favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. With digital transformation in shopping, retailers are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra to provide a seamless shopping experience, whether online or in-stores. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 5%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Preview. This fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%. The top line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% growth registered in the preceding quarter.Wrapping UpWith earnings season all set to gather momentum it will be prudent to hold on to some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates. These are stocks with a favorable combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP.

839,DLTR,"The fight over who will acquire a majority stake in India’s e-commerce retail giant Flipkart is intensifying. According to reports, Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is already in advanced talks to acquire a 51% stake in Flipkart. On the other hand, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) too is leaving no stone unturned to capture a significant stake in the company. So much so that Amazon reportedly has offered a breakup fee of nearly $1-$2 billion as part of its bid to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart. That said, it is too early to predict who will have the last laugh, as none of the three companies have yet commented on this.However, the big question is how much does Flipkart matter to Amazon and Walmart. It surely does, given that Flipkart is the biggest e-commerce company in India and has an enviable customer base in that country, it will only strengthen the presence of both Amazon and Walmart in this vast market. Understandably, India is a lucrative market for both Amazon and Walmart, which are fighting hard to take a lead in the retail race much like every in other country.Flipkart to Help Build Stronger PresenceFlipkart is the world’s third-most funded private company and one of the most successful Indian e-commerce startups. The company has raised more than $7 billion from a number of global investors such as Softbank, Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report) and DST Global and has completed quite a significant number of acquisitions in the past few years, thus making it a name synonymous with retail e-commerce in India. For Amazon and Walmart, a stake in Flipkart definitely means a lot, as they will get to operate in a lucrative market.In fact, Flipkart to Indians is much like Amazon and is the biggest e-commerce company. Amazon, on the other hand is the second biggest. Flipkart has overtaken the likes of Snapdeal and other e-commerce companies in India within 10 years of its inception and is clearly ahead of others including Amazon. Understandably, Amazon stands to benefit if it succeeds in acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart and it will also end the rivalry between the two companies in India. Walmart, on the other hand, too will benefit as it is striving hard to compete with its biggest rival Amazon in the e-commerce space.Moreover, one of the biggest reasons behind Flipkart’s success has been the cash-on-delivery model of business, a feature that has struck a chord with shoppers. Today, most e-commerce companies in India have adopted this model, which has helped them earn the trust of consumers, thereby increasing their revenues.Amazon and Walmart’s India Presence to Get a BoostGlobally, Amazon is clearly ahead of other retail giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) in the e-commerce race. However, Walmart continues to be its closest rivals given that the brick-and-mortar giant is making fast moves to make its online presence felt. Undoubtedly, adding Flipkart will only strengthen Amazon online dominance and at the same time take the competition to the global arena.Moreover, Amazon is the second largest e-commerce company in India and a major reason behind this is that Flipkart enjoys the trust of customers, a lot of which comes from its cash on delivery model of business. If Amazon happens to acquire a considerable stake in Flipkart, it will most likely put an end to this competition. Moreover, Flipkart already has a strong delivery arm much like Amazon has in the United States. This will help Amazon use Flipkart’s logistics wing and aid both the companies to focus more on increasing their revenues instead of competing. This will not only help Flipkart in strengthening its profits but also add muscle to its supply chain and aid in boosting its efficiency in procurement and product assortmentOn the other hand, Walmart has a negligible presence in the estimated $670 billion retail market in India with a meager 21 wholesale stores, while it has no presence in the e-commerce space. The company has been trying hard to make its presence felt in the online retail market since 2014 and adding Flipkart will definitely help it expand its footprint in India. Moreover, Walmart’s failed joint venture with Bharti Enterprises of a 50:50 partnership to run the wholesale cash-and-carry business has left the company with no choice but to acquire an existing business. If the deal fall into place, it is likely to strengthen Walmart’s position against Amazon, by helping it leverage the large market Flipkart caters to. While Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Walmart carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Summing upAlthough nothing has been finalized yet, Flipkart definitely looks to be a lucrative proposition for both the companies given the huge retail market in India. Moreover, Flipkart too stands to benefit as the company has been incurring losses despite its mass appeal. While, for Walmart, acquiring a considerable stake in Flipkart will help the company get an edge of Amazon in the e-commerce space in India, for Amazon it will become easier to spread out and the same time focus more on its profits that competing with Flipkart in India.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

840,DLTR,"The Wall Street is juggling with various macro and micro issues at the moment, including U.S.-China trade dispute, Facebook data breach, apprehensions about three or more rate hikes by the Fed this year and latest being the airstrike on Syria. All these events have kept the market on tenterhooks with investors scurrying for safe havens. A clear reflection of these factors were visible in the recent outcome of the Consumer Sentiment data that declined from its 14-year high.Per the preliminary report released by the University of Michigan, Consumer Sentiment index dropped to 97.8 in April from March’s reading of 101.4, and also came below analysts’ expectations of 100.5. Economists blamed negative news that popped up time and again for the nervousness in the market.Do Retailers Need to Worry?Apparently, consumers’ expectations about the economy have somewhat retreated. A fall in consumer sentiment may impact consumers’ spending pattern, which accounts for over two-thirds of the U.S. economic activity. Undoubtedly, reluctance on the part of consumers to spend more is the last thing retailers want.Nevertheless, experts are of the opinion that consumer sentiment still remains at a decent level. Notably, the index inched up 0.8% this month from a year earlier. Published on The Wall Street Journal, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, Ian Shepherdson, said “the current conditions index spiked in March, presumably as people saw the tax cuts coming through, so a correction in April was always a decent bet.”Definitely, the retailers have nothing to fear as of now. A robust job market, massive tax cuts and sound economic fundamentals are likely to trigger consumer spending. Notably, a strengthening labor market may lead to gradual wage acceleration, and in turn boost consumer confidence. All these sound constructive for retailers.Notably, the Retail-Wholesale sector has advanced roughly 10% in the past six months and has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of 4%. Markedly, the sector is anticipated to witness year-over-year bottom-line growth of 12%, per the Earnings Preview. This fares much better than the previous quarter, where earnings climbed 3%. Top-line is also projected to increase 7.6% compared with 9.7% growth registered in the preceding quarter.Wrapping UpWith earnings season all set to gather momentum it will be prudent to hold on to some retail stocks that are likely to beat estimates.

841,DLTR,"A glimpse at Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST  -  Free Report) share price movement reveals that it has surged 16.7% in a year compared with the industry’s growth of 13.9%. This clearly indicates that the stock with long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9.1% looks quite disciplined in its approach to adapt to the changing retail landscape.In fact, major chains are grappling with sluggish store and mall traffic as consumers choose to shop online. But Costco’s growth strategies and sturdy comparable-store sales (comps) performance have a different story to tell.Dominant Warehouse RetailerWe believe that Costco continues to be one of the dominant retail wholesalers based on the breadth and quality of merchandise offered. In fact, the company’s strategy to sell products at heavily discounted prices has helped it to remain on growth track as cash-strapped customers continue to reckon Costco as a viable option for low-cost necessities.Additionally, a differentiated product range enables Costco to provide an upscale shopping experience for its members, thereby resulting in market share gains and higher sales per square foot. It is also gradually expanding e-commerce capabilities in the United States, Canada, UK, Mexico, Korea and Taiwan. Consequently, comparable e-commerce sales for December surged 33.3%.Positive Comps Performance ContinuesCostco continued with positive comparable-store sales (comps) performance driven by improved store traffic and average transaction size. Comps for December increased 11.5%, following an increase of 10.8% in November, 7.5% in October, 8.9% in September, 7.3% in August, 6.2% in July, 6% in June, 4.1% in May, 3% in April, 6% in March, 4% in February and 7% in January. Notably, net sales increased 14.3%, 13.2%, 10.1%, 12.1%, 10%, 8.8%, 7%, 7%, 5%, 9%, 8% and 9% in December, November, October, September, August, July, June, May, April, March, February and January, respectively.Enhancing Global FootprintWe are encouraged by the company’s expansion strategy. Evidently, Costco has one of the highest square footage growth in the industry and remains committed toward opening new clubs in domestic and international markets. In sync with this, it opened 23, 29 and 26 net new outlets in fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively, and plans to open nearly 20 to 25 warehouses in fiscal 2018. In our view, the company’s diversification strategy is a natural hedge against risks that may arise in specific markets.Deterrents to OvercomeStiff competition and cautious consumer spending remain major threats. Investors also remain concerned about contraction in gross margin. Gross margin contracted 33 basis points during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, after shrinking 15 basis points in the final quarter of fiscal 2017. Management expects incremental costs related to new centralized return facilities may hurt margins in the next two quarters.Costco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksG-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

842,DLTR,"The mall is dead.O.K., maybe not completely dead – there are obviously still plenty of retail malls of all shapes and sizes in operation – but the mall is certainly sick.  On life support, even.Due mostly to changing consumer preferences and the rise of online retailing giants like Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), mall traffic has been declining for years.  Mall real estate vacancies nationwide now top 10%, and this week, Moody’s Investor Service reported that the first Quarter of 2018 saw the highest level ever of default on retailer’s debt with nine firms failing to make scheduled interest payments – most notably, the long-struggling department store operator Sears Holdings  and privately held Claire’s Stores, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy earlier this year.Retail Jewelry Takes a BeatingSignet Jewelers Limited (SIG  -  Free Report) has been hit hard buy the shift from brick-and-mortar retailing in the jewelry sector to more efficient (and in most cases, less expensive) online options.  Operating well-known national brands like Kay, Zales and Jared as well as a number of smaller regional brands, Signet now finds itself on uncomfortable middle ground in the industry. Lacking the cachet of Super-Luxury brands like Tiffany (TIF  -  Free Report) or Cartier, or the online traffic of popular internet jeweler Blue Nile, Signet is in the midst of a three-year restructuring plan that aims to close 200 costly retail stores and attempts to replace the lost revenue with increased online sales.  Unfortunately, it may be a case of too-little-too-late.Despite the push to increase internet sales, Signet sold only $253M worth of goods online in fiscal 2018 (its most recent full year.) Although this is indeed a big increase from the previous year, it still significantly trails industry leader Blue Nile, which had revenues of $480M in 2015 (the last year it reported publicly before being acquired by private equity firm Bain Capital) and which presumably have grown even more since then.Disappointing GuidanceOwing partly to a quirk in the reporting cycle (a 15-week 4th quarter), Signet actually posted a $0.02 cent earnings beat in the fourth quarter - $4.28/share vs. a Zacks consensus estimate of $4.26 – but the company’s guidance for the coming year was abysmal.  Prior to the announcement, the consensus estimate for next year was for earnings of $6.45/share.  Signet shocked the markets by guiding lower by 40% to a range of $3.75 to $4.25/share.Analysts were quick to follow with an avalanche of downgrades, resulting in a new consensus estimate in the middle of that new range - $3.99/share.  This earns Signet our worst rating, a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell.)Despite the fact that the stock price has been punished lately, trading around $38 – down from a 52-week high of $77.94, it’s still really not a value opportunity because of the significantly uncertain prospects for a successful restructuring.  There are plenty of stocks out there that are leading growing sectors.  There’s no reason to get involved in one that’s shrinking.Investors who want to have retail exposure in their portfolio would be wiser to consider Walgreen Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report).  Both currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)- due mostly to relatively flat recent earnings estimates, but in the retail sector, both of these stores are sell the categories of merchandise that consumers are willing to travel to an actual store to get. Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies  It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

845,DLTR,"A slew of traditional retailers and department store chains filed for bankruptcy this year, as they were affected by changing customer habits, price wars and consumers’ inclination towards online shopping.However, record end-of-year holiday season sales have given them a shot in the arm as Americans continue to feel optimistic about their financial wealth as a result of strengthening economy and a stable labor market. Such buoyancy will further drive retailers in the upcoming year. This calls for investors to double down on the hottest retailers right away.2017 – A Tough Year for RetailersThe traditional retail industry witnessed one of its most difficult years, with store closing announcements touching a record 7,000, per retail think tank Fung Global Retail and Technology. So far in 2017, about 662 retailers have filed for bankruptcy, up 30% from the same period last year, according to BankruptcyData.com. While most bankrupt retailers were small mom-and-pop stores, major retailers on the list included Toys R Us, Payless Shoes, Gymboree and Rue21. In fact, The Limited closed down and RadioShack shut almost all of its remaining stores. Understandably, this is because shoppers have made it clear that they want to do shopping on their smartphones instead of hitting traditional brick-and-mortar stores.However, experts did say not to count on it, as they believe that the demise of traditional retailing is overblown. After all, store openings also increased this year compared with last year, as per Fung. Lest we forget that two bargain brands Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report), recently, announced their store opening plans. Tom McGee, CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group of mall owners, said that occupancy rate at the nation’s malls have escalated about 93% this year.Retailers Saw Best Holiday Season Sales Since 2011Retailers are also witnessing plenty of green this holiday season. Total retail sales jumped 4.9% compared with the same period last year. This turned out to be the largest year-over-year uptick since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse report released on Dec 26.  Some of the largest jumps were seen in electronics and appliances. The segment climbed 7.5% and registered the strongest growth in the last 10 years. Home furniture and furnishings grew 5.1% and so did home improvement. Department stores and specialty apparel saw moderate gains, which is quite encouraging given the recent store closings. The jewelry segment also gained 5.9%, primarily driven by last-minute sales.The strong economy was a contributing factor but a pretty low unemployment rate encouraged investors even more to spend this holiday season. Moreover, consumers continue to feel confident and optimistic about spending this year and beyond.Jobless Rate at Record Low, Consumer Confidence Steady The unemployment rate was at 4.1% in November and continues to remain at a 17-year low. The U6 unemployment rate was 8% last month, up from 7.9% in the prior month. But, the broadest measure of unemployment and underemployment remained near the lowest since 2006.U.S. employers also added 228,000 jobs in November, steering past expectations of 200,000. In fact, job additions in the U.S. economy topped the 200,000 mark for the second straight month, reflecting a bounce back after hurricanes in Texas and Florida affected hiring in September (read more: 4 Best Staffing Stocks to Buy on Blockbuster Jobs Report).A key measure of U.S. consumer sentiment slipped for the second straight month in December but continued to show an uptick in household confidence during the holiday shopping period. The University of Michigan’s survey of consumer attitudes came in at 95.9 in early December, down from 98.5 in November. However, Richard Curtin, Michigan survey’s chief economist, said that on an average, consumer sentiment this year was the highest since 2000.2018 Could be Retail’s Big Comeback Year: 5 Must BuysGiven the aforesaid positives, investing in sound retail stocks seems judicious.

846,DLTR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 9% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Dollar Tree Q3 Earnings Beat, View Up Dollar Tree posted third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year. Further, management raised outlook for fiscal 2017 and provided a solid view for the fiscal fourth quarter.Quarter in DetailThe company’s quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share jumped 40.3% year over year, and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 90 cents. Moreover, earnings exceeded the higher end of company’s guidance range of 83-90 cents per share.Consolidated net sales advanced 6.3% to $5,316.6 million in the quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,282 million.Comps for the quarter increased 3.2% in constant-currency, driven by improved customer count and average ticket. Including the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, comps improved 3.3%. While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 5% (in constant-currency), comps at the Family Dollar banner climbed 1.5%.The company’s quarterly gross profit advanced 9.6% year over year to $1,666 million, with the gross margin expanding 90 basis points (bps) to 31.3%. The margin enhancement came on the back of reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses, as a percentage of sales.Selling, general and administrative expenses dropped 30 bps to 23.3% of sales, thanks to reduced depreciation, healthcare costs and store operating costs due to lower utility costs, as a percentage of sales. This was somewhat offset by increased hourly payroll and incentive compensation expenses as well as higher operating and corporate expenses.Balance SheetDollar Tree ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $400.1 million, net merchandise inventories of $3,397.8 million, net long-term debt of $5,557 million and shareholders’ equity of $6,116.5 million.Store UpdateDollar Tree opened 169 outlets, expanded or relocated 23 outlets, and shuttered six outlets during the quarter.Looking AheadRobust fiscal third-quarter results and progress on Family Dollar integration encouraged management to raise the guidance for fiscal 2017. Further, the company provided a solid outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter.Management now forecasts net sales for fiscal 2017 (which will contain an additional week) in the band of $22.20-$22.31 billion, compared with the old projection of $22.07-$22.28 billion. The guidance stems from square footage growth estimate of 3.7% and comps improvement expected in low-single digits.Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are now expected to be in the range of $4.64-$4.73, which includes a receivable impairment charge of 14 cents spent in the first half of fiscal 2017. Earlier, management projected earnings in a band of $4.44-$4.60 per share for fiscal 2017. The company anticipates the additional 53rd week to increase sales by $400-$430 million and earnings by 19-22 cents per share.For the fiscal fourth quarter, consolidated sales are projected in the range of $6.32-$6.43 billion, driven by comps growth in a low-single digit rise range for the combined entity. Earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.80-$1.89 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates.

847,DLTR,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will be adding 500 Pickup Towers to its U.S. stores by the end of 2018. Understandably, this is in a move to stay in the retail race and compete with Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has changed the retail landscape over the last few years.Pickup Towers help customers collect their online orders from tall kiosks inside Walmart stores. Given that Walmart is primarily a brick-and-mortar giant, the company is playing to its strength, much like Amazon is making use of its strong delivery arm to win customer loyalty.Although Amazon has a similar service, Amazon Lockers, Walmart certainly has an edge over the e-commerce behemoth given that it has more physical stores. And more Pickup Towers will only help the company in luring a greater number of customers. Amazon, in the last few years, has redefined the retail space, tapering the gap between online and offline. Walmart’s decision to add more towers in its stores is another instance of other retail giants following in Amazon’s footsteps.Walmart Pickup Towers to Boost Online SalesWalmart is trying to compete with Amazon by offering discounts on its online products only if customers pick up the goods from stores instead of having them shipped to their homes. Naturally, the decision to add 500 Pickup Towers is aimed at increasing online sales. The company introduced Pickup Towers in 2017. Pickup Towers allow customers to order online and then pick up their orders from these 16-feet-tall orange vending machines inside Walmart Stores.Already, Walmart has 200 Pickup Towers and the idea of adding 500 more comes after the company witnessed more than 500,000 orders being sent to the towers. Walmart believes that the expansion will give 40% of the country’s population access to Pickup Towers by the end of 2018. Understandably, Walmart is getting mileage out of its key strength, its well-distributed brick-and-mortar stores across the country.Walmart will also be debuting Pickup Lockers inside its towers, which will store expensive and fragile purchases like televisions, for safety reasons. Moreover, Walmart has another concept similar to Pickup Towers in mind. For this, it has entered into a partnership with Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), wherein customers will be able to place orders using Google’s voice-activated digital assistant.  Amazon on the other hand only has Whole Foods stores, which it acquired for a whopping $13.7 billion in 2017, to bank on for this line of expansion. So Walmart certainly will have an advantage over Amazon in this regard.That said, the expansion is a strategic move, wherein Walmart will be able to stay in the retail race by embracing technology and e-commerce and at the same time cut down on costs. For Walmart, shipping products to its stores will cost a lot less than using its fleet of more than 6,700 delivery trucks to drop packages at individual homes.Amazon Intensifies CompetitionAmazon’s strong delivery arm has been its strength and it is giving stiff competition to brick-and-mortar giant Walmart. In February, the company started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report).And despite not having too many physical stores like Walmart, Amazon is making strategic moves through innovations. Much like Walmart, Amazon has a similar facility, Amazon Lockers, a parcel delivery service, wherein customers can select locker locations as their delivery address and pick up orders.Moreover, Amazon recently launched its Hub delivery lockers. These lockers can be installed in apartment complexes and customers can pick up their orders from nearby lockers.While Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

However, results improved year over year. Also, management issued guidance for first-quarter and fiscal 2018.Quarter in DetailDollar Tree’s quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the metric rose substantially by $1.39 in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, it came at the higher end of the company’s guided range. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to higher sales, the rise in comparable store sales (comps) and higher margins.On a GAAP basis, earnings per share came in at $4.37 compared with $1.36 in the year-ago quarter.Consolidated net sales were up 12.9% to $6,360.6 million in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,401 million.Comps in the quarter increased 2.4% in constant currency, driven by improved customer count and average ticket.

The margin expansion was backed by reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses as a percentage of sales. The increase was somewhat compensated with higher freight charges.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses dropped 40 bps to 21.3% of sales, thanks to reduced depreciation, lower repair and maintenance costs as a percentage of sales. This was somewhat offset by increased hourly payroll and incentive compensation expenses as well as higher advertising expenses.Further, operating income rose 30.5% to $765.6 million in the reported quarter. Adjusted operating margin came in at 11.7%.Balance SheetDollar Tree ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $1,097.8 million, net merchandise inventories of $3,169.3 million, net long-term debt excluding current maturities of $4,762.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $7,182.3 million.

849,DLTR,"Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) is the latest among the FANG stocks to take a beating. The company’s shares plummeted 4.4% on Wednesday and erased $30 billion of its market capitalization after the news website Axios reported that President Donald Trump wants to take on the company’s growing powers and its tax treatment.Trump has long been arguing that the e-commerce giant has been getting an unfair tax treatment compared with brick-and-mortar retailers, which have been suffering the Amazon onslaught for quite some time now. Moreover, Trump has always been critical of Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos, expressing time and again how much he dislikes the company. However, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied that the administration is planning anything against Amazon. ""We have no announcement and no specific policies we are pushing for,"" Sanders said, related to Amazon.That said, it’s still unclear what Trump will ultimately plan or do with Amazon. If he really decides to implement an Internet tax, Amazon’s revenues will be affected and its customers will have to shell out more. This is because Amazon will likely pass on its extra cost burden to its customers.Trump Versus BezosTrump’s dislike for Amazon and Bezos isn’t unknown and dates back a long time. On Wednesday, the company’s shares nosedived once again on reports of Trump planning to take on the Internet retail behemoth and its tax treatment. This saw its shares tumbling as much as 7% at one point of the day and almost $53 billion of its market capitalization being wiped out, before it closed the day at down 4.4%. The selloff was fueled by fears of a prospective Internet tax, which would cut heavily into the profits of the company. Now, this was not something out of the blue. Back in August 2017, Trump had tweeted: “Amazon is doing great damage to tax paying retailers. Towns, cities and states throughout the U.S. are being hurt - many jobs being lost!""In fact, he had also said that the United States Post Office is losing billions of dollars every year by charging the likes of Amazon and others a pittance to deliver their packages. This, Trump suggested is only making Amazon richer. Interestingly, Trump’s dislike is perhaps more for Bezos, who also owns Washington Post. Trump has often criticized Washington Post and on one occasion, misleadingly referred to it as “Amazon Washington Post.”A tweet by Trump, last year, read: ""The #AmazonWashingtonPost, sometimes referred to as the guardian of Amazon not paying Internet taxes (which they should) is FAKE NEWS!"" Understandably, Trump doesn’t like Amazon’s business style and the latest report is further proof of that.Amazon Changing the Retail LandscapeAmazon undoubtedly has changed the retail landscape in the last few years. The company has grown from strength to strength with innovations in the delivery space and by bridging the gap between online and offline retail business. Amazon’s shares have increased 63.7% in the last year and 2.4% year to date. Amazon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This definitely is giving other brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) a run for their money. This is especially so because the traditional incumbents are constantly striving to stay in the race.The biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. Moreover, Amazon recently started free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Of course Amazon has established its dominance in the online retail space and it’s not only the retail giants but also the smaller players that are suffering the most with many shutting shop. Michael Kors (KORS  -  Free Report) will be closing 100-125 stores over the next two years. Sears & Kmart closed 358 stores in 2017 and 63 in January 2018. Toys R Us is nearing closure too. Naturally, Trump’s concern is for brick-and-mortar stores, which are finding it difficult to survive the Amazon onslaught.But What About Amazon’s Profits?Although it really isn’t known what Trump plans to do, an Internet tax will dent Amazon’s booming online business without an inkling of doubt. In 2017, Amazon accounted for 44% of all e-commerce sales and about 4% of total U.S. retail sales, according to CNBC’s One Click Retail study. The company’s e-commerce sales for 2017 are expected to grow almost $197 billion, reflecting a 32% increase from 2016. This says a lot about the company’s dominance in e-commerce retail. And a lot of this is because Amazon is spared from any Internet tax.Moreover, according to the study, Amazon’s grocery sales in 2017 totaled $1.5 billion, up 33% from 2016, thus making it an undisputed leader in the e-commerce space. Naturally, if an Internet tax ultimately comes to effect, Amazon’s profits are sure to take a hit. More taxes mean less profits or steeper prices in case the tax burden is passed on to consumers. This in its turn might cause a slump in sales.In ConclusionTrump’s dislike for Amazon has often come to the fore and the recent news has sparked fears in the minds of investors. An Internet tax certainly isn’t a good sign for the e-commerce giant. However, with nothing concrete on the table now, and the White House denying any imminent action against Amazon, investors can be a little more patient with the stock.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs Pending A medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

850,DLTR,"The Gap Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) has picked up momentum in the past one month from robust top and bottom-line performance in third-quarter fiscal 2017 and a solid comparable store sales (comps) trend. Additionally, constant focus on product quality enhancement, new growth strategy and responsiveness toward changing consumer behavior has rewarded the company well.Notably, Gap’s shares have gained 15% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s growth 12.9%. Moreover, the stock has witnessed a substantial 57.8% increase year to date.Let us analyze the factors influencing the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance.Robust Surprise TrendThe success of the company’s endeavors is clearly visible from its surprise history and upbeat outlook for fiscal 2017. Gap witnessed the third successive earnings beat in the last reported quarter and the fourth consecutive positive sales surprise. Also, improved traffic led to the fourth straight quarter of comps growth for the Old Navy brand. The company’s namesake brand also reflected comps strength. Clearly, Gap’s growth initiatives are paying off, which along with a solid performance in the nine months of fiscal 2017 encouraged management to raise the outlook for the full fiscal.Gap, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Gap, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Gap, Inc. (The) QuoteNew Growth Strategy – Focus on Growth BrandsOver the past two years, Gap has significantly improved its customer satisfaction by delivering quality products faster and more consistently. Now, it has shifted its focus on growth brands, Old Navy and Athleta, as part of its new expansion strategy. The company expects net sales to exceed $10 billion for Old Navy and more than $1 billion for Athleta in the next few years.Investments in Online and Digital Platforms Bode WellGap has been gaining from consistent focus on enhancing product quality and responsiveness to changing consumer trends. Constant efforts to bolster digital and mobile offerings, alongside improving product acceptance, are worth mentioning in this regard. Gap is strengthening its e-commerce and omni-channel capabilities to streamline the North American business. Recently, it announced a buy online, pick-up in store service and many more investments in omni-channel services, which have helped enriched customer experience. Notably, the company has increased its online presence across all of its brands, and its online division is one of its most profitable, posting double-digit sales growth.Hurdles to CrossWhile all is well with Gap’s fundamentals, currency headwinds may dampen its operating performance due to significant international presence. Though earnings and sales topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2017, currency headwinds caused earnings per share to decline year over year. Evidently, adverse currency movements dented third-quarter bottom-line growth by nearly 3 percentage points.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

852,DLTR,"Fossil Group Inc (FOSL  -  Free Report) has been in the red zone for a while now, due to dismal traditional watch sales. Shares of the company plunged 26.9% in the past six months against the industry’s rally of 12.8%. These headwinds, along with margin pressure, have compelled management to lower 2017 forecasts.Considering these aspects, let’s take a look into some of the factors that having been denting the performance of the company and efforts undertaken to aid recovery.What’s Weighing on the Stock?Fossil Group has been witnessing soft sales in traditional watches due to increased competition and rising demand for tech-enabled watches. Evidently, sales at the watch segment declined 2.7% in third-quarter 2017 results.To add to the companies’ woes, the leathers and jewelry businesses have been persistently weak on account of soft consumer demand.  Sales in these segments fell 20.8% and 18.9% during the third quarter, wherein overall sales tumbled 6.7% year over year. Fossil has been witnessing lower gross margin for a year, primarily due to soft retail margins stemming from increased promotions to drive sales (in stores and e-commerce) and higher mix of connected products. In the third quarter, gross margin contracted 580 basis points to 46.4% due to lower margins from connected products and increased product valuation reserves. Lower retail margins from greater promotional activity, unfavorable currency impacts and increased off-price sales also dragged the gross margin.Unfortunately, management expects obstacles related to increased promotions and unfavorable mix to dent gross margin in the fourth quarter. Further, Fossil Group continues to expect a challenging retail environment for its traditional watch category. This along with margin pressure compelled management to lower its 2017 forecasts. The company now expects net sales to decline 8.5-10.5% and envisions the bottom line at a loss of 45 cents to earnings of 10 cents.Efforts to Revive PerformanceRapid technological changes urge retailers to constantly upgrade offerings and keep up with changing consumer preferences. To this end, Fossil Group has been trying to attract tech-savvy consumers by introducing several connected wearables. Notably, Wearables represented more than 10% of the company’s sales in the third quarter, which nearly doubled from the year-ago quarter and also marked a sequential improvement.Driven by positive consumer response in this segment, management has plans to enrich wearables by adding new brands to its smartwatch line-up in 2018. Powered by Android Wear, these brands will strengthen Fossil Group’s current portfolio with premium brands like Diesel, Emporio Armani, Michael Kors and Misfit.Additionally, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been trying to induce greater efficiency into its business through the New World Fossil restructuring initiative. The company’s licensing agreements with Michael Kors, Emporio Armani and other renowned brands are also expected to boost business.We are encouraged with Fossil Group’s efforts to strengthen its performance, especially its watch segment. We expect such initiatives to aid the company offset ongoing challenges and uplift performance in the upcoming periods.Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

855,DLTR,"Shares of Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) have surged nearly 22.7% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 15.4%. Reasons behind the stock’s bullish run can be attributed to positive earnings surprise streak in the eight consecutive quarters along with strategic endeavors undertaken to combat stiff competition and alleviate margin pressure.Hidden catalystBig Lots’ furniture financing programs has been consistently gaining traction. Furniture, which has been the leading performer in the last few quarters, increased in low-single digits in the third quarter.

Comps are anticipated to increase by 1%, down from the previous estimate of 1-5%. Moreover, sluggishness in electronics, toys and accessories remains a concern.Gross margin, a key financial metric determining a company’s basic financial health, has declined in both the third and second quarter of 2017.

856,DLTR,"Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) is in investors’ good books, driven by robust comparable store sales (comps) and improved margins. Also, it is benefiting from the integration of Family Dollar. While its top and bottom lines lagged estimates in the most recent quarter, it has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise in the preceding two quarters. However, volatile consumer environment, intense competition and significant global exposure remain impediments.Notably, shares of Dollar Tree have gained 24.3% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s growth of 12.6%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Solid Q4 & OutlookDespite posting lower-than-expected results, Dollar Tree’s earnings and sales improved year over year in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017. Earnings gained from higher sales, rise in comparable store sales (comps) and higher margins. Meanwhile, sales benefited from a solid performance at both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores. Additionally, it witnessed the expansion of both gross and operating margins. While gross margin growth was backed by reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses; operating margin benefited from SG&A leverage.Going forward, the company provided a robust outlook for first-quarter and fiscal 2018. It forecasts consolidated net sales for the first quarter to be $5.53-$5.63 billion while earnings are envisioned to be $1.18-$1.25 per share. For fiscal 2018, it expects net sales of $22.70-$23.12 billion and earnings of $5.25-$5.60 per share.Remarkable Comps GrowthDollar Tree displayed remarkable comps growth for the last several quarters, mainly due to competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. Dollar Tree continues the positive trend with consolidated constant-currency comps growth of 2.4% in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked the 40th straight quarter of comps growth. The fourth-quarter comps growth can be attributed to improved customer count and average ticket.While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 3.8% (in constant-currency), comps at the Family Dollar banner climbed 1%. This also marked the third straight quarter of positive comps at Family Dollar, driven by a continued rebuilding of the business. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in a low-single-digit range for both the first-quarter and fiscal 2018.Store-Fleet Growth to Drive Top LineCurrently, Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. This, in turn, enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. During fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, it opened 137 new stores and expanded or relocated eight. Moreover, the company opened total 603 stores in fiscal 2017.For fiscal 2018, the company expects to open nearly 650 new stores, including 350 Dollar Tree and 300 Family Dollar. Further, it plans to undertake renovations of at least 450 Family Dollar stores, relocate or expand nearly 100 stores and re-banner 50 from Family Dollar stores to Dollar Tree. Notably, it remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States in the long term.Family Dollar Integration on TrackDollar Tree is befitting from the ongoing integration of Family Dollar that was acquired in July 2015. The company is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. Through the integration, it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.ConclusionWhile all seems well, Dollar Tree has been facing problems regarding highly competitive market and volatile consumer behavior. Also, significant global exposure poses a serious threat to its performance. However, we believe, its strategies will be able to offset these headwinds.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

857,DLTR,"The retail war is intensifying with the focus gradually shifting toward minimum delivery time of your groceries. In February, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) started offering two-hour Whole Foods delivery to its Prime members. And now Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report), Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) and The Kroger Co. (KR  -  Free Report) are following suit with same-day delivery services.Almost all retail giants are pumping in more money and either acquiring or partnering with delivery service companies for same-day delivery to stay ahead in the race. With changing shopping habits, retailers are bent on minimizing the time between the actual placement of an order and its delivery. Needless to say, the gap between online and offline retail is fast disappearing and it’s only a matter of time when others jump the bandwagon.Amazon Shows the Way for Same-Day Delivery Amazon set the ball rolling by playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing — when it started offering free-two-hour delivery service from Whole Food stores to its Prime members in February. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods that stocks a wide range of fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).It goes without saying that Amazon has been a pioneer in minimizing the gap between online and offline retail space. The company is pulling items from Whole Foods stores, packing them and getting the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two hours. This move is in a bid to explore and add novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction.Naturally, the idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient and the two-hour delivery service has certainly given Amazon enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target, Kroger, Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Understandably, same-day delivery is the need of the hour and Amazon’s recent initiative has not only made its rivals sit up and think, but also gear up for an ensuing battle.Walmart Fights BackBrick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Kroger and Target, which so long, in order to compete with Amazon, were stressing on increased investments in e-commerce, have perhaps realized that bridging the online and offline gap is the ideal way to compete. So, most of these companies are busy reallocating their investments to add muscle to their delivery service wing. Walmart recently announced that it will be expanding its delivery service to 100 metropolitan areas by the end of 2018, with orders fulfilled at more than 800 stores across the country and delivered to shoppers contracted through Deliv, Uber and other delivery contractors. Moreover, customers who order a minimum of $30 and pay a delivery fee of $9.95 will get their purchases delivered in four hours provided they order by 1 p.m. This definitely is a challenge to Amazon.Interestingly, Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This is being viewed as a setback for investors. However, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, as it has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Walmart has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Kroger, Target Expand Same-Day DeliveryTarget too isn’t lagging. In December 2017, the company announced plans of acquiring grocery delivery service Shipt for $550 billion and using its technology platform to expand same-day delivery at Target Stores. And come Mar 29, Target and Shipt will start same-day delivery of more than 55,000 groceries and home goods, toys, electronics and other products in Baltimore and Washington. The company also expects to make same-day delivery available from most Target stores before 2018 end and for products in all of its major categories by the end of 2019.Much like Walmart and Target, Kroger too will be expanding its partnership with same-day grocery delivery service Instacart to offer home delivery from 55 central Ohio Kroger locations. The company currently offers home delivery in 45 markets, with Instacart partnering in 27 of those markets. Also, Kroger has plans of offering delivery in 100 markets by the end of 2018.In ConclusionNo doubt, Amazon has taken the retail landscape to a different level altogether with minimum delivery time and others following suit. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. This certainly emerged as an area of prime importance for most retailers and major players are going all out to tap this same-day delivery service space.Moreover, according to Nielsen and the Food Marketing Institute, although only 23% of consumers in the United States buy groceries online, the next five-seven years is expected to see a whopping 70% preferring the same. So it may well be assumed that the same-day delivery space will heat up pretty soon.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.

858,DLTR,"Stocks opened higher on Friday after the February jobs report came in ahead of expectations and cooled concerns about rising inflation. But as the latest employment numbers seemingly confirm the overall health of the U.S. economy, recent earnings results in the retail sector have started to raise questions about the state of consumer spending.For the most part, fourth-quarter earnings season was relatively strong. However, results in the retail space were somewhat mixed. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates—and over the past few days, we have seen disappointing reports from Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Costco (COST  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), and more (also read: Kroger Extends Disappointing Week for Retail Sector Earnings Reports).The traditional earnings season is effectively over, but a few marquee reports—especially in the retail sector—remain to be released. Investors should remember that they can always use the Zacks Earnings Calendar to plan out their schedules for earnings, dividend announcements, and other important financial releases. This handy tool is your perfect one-stop-shop to properly prepare for the market events that will have an impact on your own portfolio.Today, we’ve made that task even easier for you.

(DKS  -  Free Report)Sporting goods retailer Dick’s is scheduled to release its latest quarterly financial results before the market opens on March 13. Dick’s recently grabbed headlines for its decision to change its own gun sales rules in the wake of several mass shootings, but now investors will want to see how the company has actually been performing lately.DKS is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Based on our latest Zacks Consensus Estimate, we expect the company to report adjusted earnings of $1.20 per share, down about 9% year over year. However, total quarterly revenues are expect to improve nearly 10% to touch $2.73 billion. 2. Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Discount retail giant Dollar General is slated to post its most recent quarterly earnings report before the opening bell on March 15. The pressure will be on the company after fellow “dollar store” retailer Dollar Tree failed to impress this week. DG is currently holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $1.48 per share and revenues of $6.22 billion. This earnings results would be basically flat year over year, while the revenue projection would mark a 3.5% improvement. The key for Dollar General will be whether or not its core customer base—lower income families—have started to feel a noticeable tax break and have been spending the extra money for shopping purposes. 3. Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report)Beauty retailer Ulta is expected to report its latest quarterly financial results after the market closes on March 15. Ulta was a Wall Street darling for most of 2016 thanks to strong comps and EPS growth, but the stock struggled last year as growth rates began to slow a bit. However, the company still has plenty of attractive growth opportunities.Ulta is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). According to our latest Zacks Consensus Estimates, the company is expected to report adjusted earnings of $2.77 per share and revenues of $1.94 billion. These results would both represent year-over-year growth of about 23%. Want more market analysis from this author?

Comparable store sales (comps) rose 5.9% in the quarter compared with 4.6% growth in the year-ago quarter.In fact, this was the 20th straight quarter of comps growth and the reflection of the same is quite visible in Burlington Stores’ price performance.

860,DLTR,"Shares of Kroger (KR  -  Free Report) were down nearly 10% in early morning trading Thursday after the grocery giant’s fourth-quarter earnings disappointed investors. As a result, Kroger added its name to the list of sluggish reports from the retail space this week, creating fresh volatility and caution in the evolving sector.Kroger’s Latest ResultsFor the fourth quarter, Kroger reported adjusted earnings of $0.63 per share, matching the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing nearly 19% on a year-over-year basis. Total quarterly revenues reached $31.03 billion, surpassing our consensus estimate of $30.83 billion and expanding more than 12% from the year-ago period.Kroger also said that same-supermarket sales, excluding fuel, increased 1.5%. The company now expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share in the range of $1.95 to $2.15 per share. Headed into the report, our Zacks Consensus Estimate was calling for 2018 earnings of $2.11 per share (also read: Kroger Reports In Line Q4 Earnings, Sales Beat Estimates).Guidance on the low end of previous expectations and slightly-sluggish comps growth was enough to send investors into a panic on Thursday morning. Any concerns about the upcoming year will be exacerbated as competition from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) and other online sellers continues to heat up. Kroger is also facing margin pressure from rising commodity prices, increased freight costs, and higher wages.Recent Retail ReportsThis week’s reports mark the end of the traditional fourth-quarter report season, and overall, we have seen mixed results from the retail sector. Total earnings growth from the sector’s S&P 500 members broke 9% on the back of 9.6% higher revenues, which is an impressive trend.But of the 195 companies in our “Retail and Wholesale” that have reported so far, only 56% have managed to surpass earnings estimates. Meanwhile, the sector has witnessed 43 total negative estimate revisions recently, outpacing its 36 positive revisions.Interestingly, some of retail’s most-disappointing reports have come within the past few days. This week’s sluggishness started with big-box behemoth Target (TGT  -  Free Report), which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on Tuesday. Target did manage to generate respectable comps growth of 3.6%, but investors ditched the stock. Shares of TGT are down almost 5% on the week.Wall Street also saw a concerning double miss from Costco (COST  -  Free Report) on Wednesday afternoon. The membership-based wholesale retailer reported adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by three cents. Quarterly revenues came in at $32.28 billion, lagging our consensus estimate of $32.72 billion.One of the week’s most-concerning earnings announcements came from Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report). Shares of the discount retail company crashed more than 15% shortly after the release of its Q4 report. Dollar Tree reported adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Meanwhile, same-store sales growth of 2.4% missed Street estimates.Dollar Tree was showing signs of strength over the previous six months, emerging as one of retail’s top picks over that time. Analysts pegged the company as an outperformer based on the presumed health of its core customer base: lower income families in suburban and rural areas. Investors will hope that Dollar Tree can shake of its weak quarter and rebound as its shoppers start to realize their new tax breaks.Bottom LineThe latest earnings reports from the retail sector underscore the multitude of challenges facing even its biggest names. Sure, tax reform will be a relief—but across the board, retailers are facing rising overhead costs and new competition.Want more market analysis from this author?

861,DLTR,"Regardless of whether it is a young company or a renowned corporation, unswerving earnings growth is the highest priority for the top brass of any organization. And why not? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t last over the long haul. Consider a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you have earnings.This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. But, expectations of earnings also play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinion on factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.Screening Parameters:In order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed.

Here are the top four stocks:Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (OLLI  -  Free Report) operates as a retailer of brand name merchandise. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

862,DLTR,"Shares of Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high after the company beat top and bottom line third-quarter estimates on Thursday, helping lift the rest of the discount retail industry—including Burlington Stores (BURL  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report).The retail sector has been shaky in recent years, as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) online shopping revolution really heated up. Nevertheless, Dollar General has managed to grow in a more traditional brick-and-mortar fashion.The company reported Q3 revenues of $5.90 billion, which marked an 11% year-over-year jump. This was driven in large part by a 4.3% gain in same-store sales. Dollar General attributed its same-store sales growth to an increase in both average transaction amount and overall traffic.On top of that, the company’s Q3 EPS rose by 10.1% to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The third-quarter also marked Dollar General’s fourth consecutive bottom line beat.Still, what might be most impressive is that the company counties to grow by maintaining traditional, in-store retail roots. In fact, Dollar General plans to open a large number of stores in 2018.""We remain excited about the future for Dollar General. For fiscal 2018, we have plans to execute approximately 2,000 real estate projects comprised of 900 new stores, 1,000 store remodels and 100 store relocations,” CEO Todd Vasos said in a statement.“We continue to believe that investing in the business through our high-return new store growth is the best use of our capital to help drive long-term shareholder value.”In a year when more than 8,600 retail locations are expected to close their doors, according to Credit Suisse analysts—a figure that tops the number of brick-and-mortar locations that shuttered during the 2008 recession—investors are excited about Dollar General’s in-store growth and physical retail expansion.Shares of Dollar General rose 2% premarket and have since climbed over 3.20% to hit a new 52-week intraday trading high of $96.35 per share.With that said, the discount retail industry as a whole has also fared relatively well during these tumultuous retail times, and today’s Dollar General performance helped shares of other discount retailers surge on Thursday.Shares of Burlington Stores gained over 2.50%, while Big Lots (BIG  -  Free Report) saw its stock price pop 1.50%, as they both inched close to their 52-week highs.Dollar Tree stock jumped over 2% to hit a new 52-week high water mark.

863,DLTR,"The retail industry has gone through an immense amount of change over the last few years, as many publicly traded brick-and-mortar stores now fight to stay in business through the online shopping revolution Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) helped start.In 2017, more than 8,600 stores are expected to close their doors, according to Credit Suisse analysts. This number tops the number of brick-and-mortar locations that closed during the 2008 recession.In these turbulent times for the retail industry, many investors have stayed away. But the potential for a GOP tax code overall, which would cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20%, could help the industry immensely.A recent National Retail Federation post titled “Why Passing Tax Reform Is Good For Retail,” highlighted why a Republican tax bill could greatly benefit the retail industry. The post noted that both the Senate and House bills benefit retailers for three major reasons: “They address retail’s high, unequal tax burden; They enable reinvestment; They provide tax relief to consumers.”Still, if the GOP bill isn’t passed, one retail sector—the discount segment—is already experiencing a boom in a more traditional brick-and-mortar manner. Discount retailers have capitalized on their core customers and started to expand their footprints.With all of this said, let’s take a look at three discount retail stocks that investors might consider right now.1.       Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report)Shares of the discount retailer with the tagline “Dress for Less” jumped 31.62% in the last 12-weeks and rest near their 52-week high. Ross Stores is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM grade.In November, Ross reported Q3 net earnings of  $274 million, up from $245 million in the year-ago period. On top of that, the off-priced clothing retailer’s third-quarter sales climbed 8%.For the current quarter, based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Ross’ revenues are projected to surge 12.56% to hit $3.95 billion. The company’s earnings are expected to climb 19.48%.What’s more, within the last 60 days, Ross has received 11 positive full-year earnings estimate revisions against zero downgrades. The discount retail power has also beat or matched earnings estimates for 14 straight quarters.2.       Dollar Tree, Inc (DLTR  -  Free Report) This retail chain is one of the only true “dollar stores,” where everything is sold for a dollar or less. Dollar Tree is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With the integration of Family Dollar, Dollar Tree has opened more stores and focused on strategic initiatives, which led to the company raising its full-year expectations after posting solid Q3 earnings.Shares of Dollar Tree have climbed nearly 38% in 2017, which almost quadruples the “Retail - Discount Stores” industry average and has helped push the company’s stock price to a new all-time high.Dollar Tree is currently trading at 22.12x earnings, matching its industry’s average. The stock also sports a solid 1.17 P/S ratio. What’s more, our Zacks Consensus Estimates currently call for Dollar Tree’s Q4 earnings to climb 33.29% and its sales to pop 13.47%.3.       Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report)Dollar General is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “A” VGM grade. This discount retailer is continuously expanding, and 2016 marked the 27th consecutive year of sales growth at established stores.Shares of Dollar General have gained 22.55% this year, which tops the S&P 500 average by more than 5%. The discount giant is currently trading at 20.16x earnings, which marks a discount compared to its industry’s average.Based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates, Dollar General’s Q3 EPS are expected to hit $0.94, which would mark a 5.24% year-over-year jump. Along with this bottom line growth, Dollar General sales are projected to hit $5.80 billion, which would mark a 9.07% year-over-year improvement.Dollar General is expected to post its third-quart results on Thursday, Dec. 7.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

864,DLTR,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) is progressing well with the integration of Family Dollar, which is contributing significantly to the company’s results. Also, it has been benefiting from its strategic initiatives and store expansion program. Evidently, the company posted robust third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, following which management raised its outlook for the year.Shares of Dollar Tree have gained 6.9% since it reported third-quarter results on Nov 21. So far this year, the stock has rallied 37.8%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 11.4%. Also, it has a VGM Score of B with a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.1%. In fact, the solid quarterly results and raised outlook have increased optimism among analysts. This is quite apparent from the uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Positive Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has moved up 5 cents to $1.85 and 15 cents to $4.81, respectively, in the past 30 days. Also, for fiscal 2018, the estimate has moved north by 17 cents to $5.21. This resulted from Dollar Tree’s spectacular performance in the fiscal third quarter, which also marked the company’s second straight earnings and sales beat. The company posted quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share that improved 40.3% year over year and surpassed the consensus mark of 90 cents. Additionally, comparable store sales (comps) for the third quarter increased 3.2% in constant-currency driven by improved customer count and average ticket. Including the impact of Canadian currency fluctuations, comps improved 3.3%. Notably, this marks the 39th straight time of comps growth. (Read: Dollar Tree Stock Jumps on Q3 Earnings Beat, View Up)For 2017, management now envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $4.64-$4.73 per share compared with $4.44-$4.60, projected earlier. Also, Dollar Tree provided a solid outlook and anticipates earnings in the band of $1.80-$1.89 per share for the fourth quarter.Growth CatalystsDollar Tree’s long-term growth strategy remains intact. We believe that the company is progressing well with its growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve its patrons better. Further, we remain confident that the company will continue to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion to boost top-line performance.Meanwhile, Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. The company also leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets, which enables it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. Apparently, in the third quarter, the company opened 169 outlets.Bottom LineOptimistic analysts’ view along with the company's robust growth strategies makes this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock a favorable pick for investors.Three More Stocks That Witnessed Favorable Estimate Revisions LatelyThe fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 consensus mark for Hibbett Sports, Inc.

865,DLTR,"Shares of Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) crashed more than 15% in early morning trading Wednesday, shortly after the discount retailer posted its latest quarterly financial report. Prior to the earnings announcement, Dollar Tree shares were up 40% within the past year, and the company was looking like one of the strongest in the retail sector. So what went wrong? Let’s take a closer look.Earnings & Revenue MissFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, Dollar Tree reported adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. That result did represent a 36% improvement from the year-ago period, but the miss broke Dollar Tree’s streak of two-consecutive positive surprises (also read: Dollar Tree Falls on Q4 Earnings Miss, Guides for '18).Meanwhile, consolidated net sales of $6.36 billion also missed our consensus estimate of $6.40 billion. Quarterly revenues were up nearly 13% on a year-over-year basis, but investors were clearly disappointed by the company’s top-line performance.Disappointing CompsSame-store sales in the quarter improved 2.4% in constant currency, with comps growth at Dollar Tree stores increasing 3.8% and Family Dollar comps moving just 1% higher. According to analysts surveyed by Reuters, comps growth was expected to come in at 1.5% at Family Dollar and 4% at Dollar Tree. Analysts also expected total same-store sales to gain 2.7%.Weak Guidance Dollar Tree said that it expects consolidated net sales to fall in the range of $5.53 billion to $5.63 billion for the first quarter. Before today’s report, our consensus estimate was calling for revenues of $5.6 billion in the quarter. Management also expects adjusted Q1 earnings of $1.18 to $1.25 per share, which is well below the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.32 per share.The company’s full-year guidance was also disappointing. Dollar Tree now expects net sales in the range of $22.70 billion to $23.12 billion for fiscal 2018, with adjusted earnings expected to come in at $5.25 to $5.60 per share. Our consensus estimates were calling for full-year revenues of $23.10 billion and earnings of $5.85 per share.Bottom LineDollar Tree was showing signs of strength, especially over the last six months. Analysts were expecting that its core customer base—lower income families in suburban and rural areas—would continue driving its growth in the holiday quarter. Today’s disappointing results have taken the wind out of the company’s sails.Looking ahead, Dollar Tree’s sluggish guidance does not spell good news for fiscal 2018. However, the company said that it will use its new tax benefit to raise wages and increase employee benefits, which is typically a positive sign. Moreover, its core customers should have more money to spend this year.Want more market analysis from this author?

However, results improved year over year. Also, management issued guidance for first-quarter and fiscal 2018.Following the quarterly results, shares of the company declined 13.4% in pre-market trading. However, the stock has gained 26% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 23.2%. Quarter in DetailDollar Tree’s quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.89 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. However, the metric rose substantially by $1.39 in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, it came at the higher end of the company’s guided range. The year-over-year improvement can be attributed to higher sales, rise in comparable store sales (comps) and higher margins. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share came in at $4.37 compared with $1.36 in the year-ago quarter.Consolidated net sales were up 12.9% to $6,360.6 million in the quarter, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,401 million.Comps in the quarter increased 2.4% in constant currency, driven by improved customer count and average ticket.

The margin expansion was backed by reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses, as a percentage of sales. The increase was somewhat compensated with higher freight charges.Adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses dropped 40 bps to 21.3% of sales, thanks to reduced depreciation, lower repair and maintenance costs, as a percentage of sales. This was somewhat offset by increased hourly payroll and incentive compensation expenses as well as higher advertising expenses.Further, operating income rose 30.5% to $765.6 million in the reported quarter. Adjusted operating margin came in at 11.7%.Balance SheetDollar Tree ended the fiscal year with cash and cash equivalents of $1,097.8 million, net merchandise inventories of $3,169.3 million, net long-term debt excluding current maturities of $4,762.1 million and shareholders’ equity of $7,182.3 million.

867,DLTR,"On Tuesday, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, missing on earnings after surprises on the positive side in three straight quarters. The company’s shares too fell 5% in late trading despite a 10% jump in revenues. The dismal showing was largely attributable to an increase in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses, for which higher compensation costs were hugely responsible.However, it might be too early to write off the Target stock just on the basis of an earnings fiasco and investor concerns. This is because Target has extensive expansion plans, ranging from increasing minimum wages to expanding its shipping services and even drive up delivery to 1,000 stores by the end of 2018. Plus, another good news is that Target’s sales are improving, thanks to stronger traffic both online and in stores.Target Misses Q4 Earnings Estimates, Sales Beat Target reported fiscal fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of $1.37 per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents and declining 5.8% from the prior-year quarter. However, the company generated total sales of $22,766 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22,463 million for the fourth quarter in a row, and increasing 10% from the prior-year quarter (read: Target's Q4 Earnings Miss, Sales Beat Estimates).It was a rise in cost of sales and higher SG&A expenses that weighted on the company’s bottom line. Target’s SG&A expenses rate was 18.5% in the fourth quarter compared with 17.5% in 2016. SG&A expenses were primarily pushed up by higher compensation costs, which included both an increase in incentives of team members and an impact of investments in store member hours and wage rates. However, even higher sales could not act as a savior and Target’s shares plunged 5% in late trading on Mar 6.Surviving the Amazon OnslaughtOne of the key areas where Target is spending a lot is online order delivery. This is definitely in a bid to push into e-commerce and compete with Amazon. Moreover, Target also intends to invest further in 2018 in order to stay in the race. Amazon, on the other hand, has been constantly making smart moves both in the online and offline retail space.Over the last few years, Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) has redefined the retail space and the online and offline gap is fast disappearing. In doing so, it is giving stiff competition to all retail behemoths that include the likes of Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report), Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report) and Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). And much like other retail giants, Target’s bid to compete with Amazon is affecting its profits.The company recently announced that it would be offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities. The move came within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. While Target and other retail behemoths like Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General are trying to push into e-commerce, Amazon is fast capturing the offline space too (read: Will Amazon's 2-Hour Whole Foods Delivery Skew Retail Pitch?).Target’s Extensive Expansion PlansTarget’s earnings may have raised concern among investors but the retail gaint seems confident about making a turnaround. Target announced Tuesday at its annual investor conference in Minneapolis that it will raise hourly minimum wage from $11 to $12 this spring and expects it to reach $15 by 2020. The American job market has heated up in recent times and Target’s move is a response to a tighter labor market. The company has also announced plans of expanding Drive Up to almost a thousand stores in the United States by end 2018. Drive Up allows customers to place online orders using the Target app brought out to their cars by a store team member, minutes after arriving.Moreover, Target, in order to compete with Amazon, will also be starting a free, two-day shipping service for hundreds of thousands of items on Target.com, with a $35 minimum threshold unless a shopper has a Target credit card. The company’s decision last year to add muscle to its delivery wing by acquiring Shipt will help it to manage costs as it launches its free-shipping initiatives.The company will also expand Restock, its next-day essentials delivery service, to around 40 markets. Naturally, the company is leaving no stone unturned to stay in the race.Shares of Target have gained 18.2% in the last three months. Target has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.All’s Not Lost for TargetIt goes without saying that Target has been performing well amid stiff competition. Investors might feel a shade jittery after the company missed on earnings but the stock has enough potential given that both its online and in-store sales have risen. Moreover, Target looks sure of making a turnaround and has massive expansion plans that include increasing minimum wages as well as investment in shipping and drive up delivery services across the country.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than Visa The total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

869,DLTR,"Ross Stores, Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report) reported solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines beat estimates and improved year over year. However, the company retained a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018 as it continues to anticipate challenges from strong multi-year comparisons and a competitive retail landscape.On that note, shares of Ross Stores declined 6.1% in the after-hours session yesterday. However, the stock has gained 33.3% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s 23.1% upside.Ross Store posted adjusted earnings of 98 cents a share that surpassed its guidance of 88-92 cents and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. Earnings also improved 27.3% from 77 cents reported in the prior-year period.Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Ross Stores, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. QuoteTotal sales for the quarter rose 16% to $4,067.8 million and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,953.4 million, driven by a 5% increase in comparable-store sales (comps). Notably, sales and comps growth were also ahead of the company’s expected rise of 11-14% and 2-3%, respectively. Top-line growth was also driven by broad-based strength across major merchandise categories with children’s on the top. Further, sales were the strongest in Florida. Comps growth can primarily be attributed to the rise in traffic and increased average basket size.Cost of sales increased 15.1% to $2,922.6 million and 50 basis points (bps) as a percentage of sales. The increase was driven by a 40-bp rise in merchandise margin as well as a 45-bp decline in occupancy costs. However, these were partly offset by higher freight expenses and volume costs. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses contracted 45 bps due to the leverage on comps gain and impact of the 53rd week.Operating margin expanded 95 bps to 14.6%, which was better than the company’s expectation of 14% and 14.2%. This outperformance stemmed from improved merchandise margins, lower expenses on better-than-expected comps growth and gains from the 53rd week.Store UpdateAs of Feb 3, 2018, Ross Stores operated 1,627 outlets, including 1,409 Ross Dress for Less stores and 213 dd's DISCOUNTS stores.In first-quarter fiscal 2018, Ross Stores plans to open 29 new stores, including 23 Ross and 6 dd’s DISCOUNT outlets. For fiscal 2018, total store openings are estimated to be 100, with 75 Ross and 25 dd's DISCOUNTS locations. This guidance does not include the company’s plans to close or relocate nearly 10 older stores.FinancialsRoss Stores ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $1,290.3 million, long-term debt of $312 million and total shareholders’ equity of $3,049.3 million.During the reported quarter, the company bought back 3 million shares for $226 million. In fiscal 2017, the company completed its share repurchase target by buying back a total of 13.5 million shares for $875 million.Moreover, the company increased its share repurchase authorization for 2018 to $1.075 billion, from $875 million targeted earlier. Additionally, the company also approved a 41% increase in quarterly cash dividend to 22.5 cents per share. The increased dividend is payable Mar 30, to shareholders with record as of Mar 19.GuidanceThough Ross Stores remains encouraged by strong earnings and sales in the recent quarter, it believes challenging multi-year comparisons and the competitive retail landscape are concerns. Thus, the company retains a cautious approach in forecasting views for fiscal 2018. Notably, the company’s guidance for fiscal 2018 includes impacts from plans related to competitive wage and benefit-related investments, which will increase its minimum wage to $11.00 per hour.The company projects earnings per share for fiscal 2018 in the range of $3.86-$4.03 compared with $3.55 per share reported for fiscal 2017. For the 52 weeks ending Feb 2, 2019, the company anticipates comps to increase 1-2% compared with a 4% growth registered in each of last three years.In addition, the company expects sales growth of 3-4% in fiscal 2018, which will be impacted by benefits from the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2017. Operating margin for the quarter is projected between 13.3% and 13.5% compared with 14.5% recorded in fiscal 2017. The decline is likely to stem from flat merchandise margin and the impact from the aforementioned wage and benefit-related investments.Net interest expenses are estimated at $600,000. Further, the tax rate is projected at 24-25% due to the tax reform legislation. The company estimates capital expenditure of nearly $475 million in fiscal 2018.For first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company expects comps to increase 1-2%. Further, the company projects earnings per share in the range of $1.03-$1.07, versus 82 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.Other assumptions include sales growth of 6-7% in the fiscal first quarter. Operating margin is projected in the range of 14.6-14.8% compared with 15.2% in the year-ago quarter. Net interest expenses are estimated at about $600,000, while the tax rate is expected to decline to nearly 23-24%.Notably, the company’s earnings guidance for both first-quarter and fiscal 2018 includes a benefit of about 16 cents and 69 cents, respectively, from the recent tax legislation.Zacks Rank and Key PicksRoss Stores currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Hold).

870,DLTR,"Standing on the first day of the last month of 2017, we can say that this year has been a blissful one for investors with markets attaining new highs. Evidently, the market has been on a roll, buoyed by an improving U.S. economy, favorable earnings reports and a supportive monetary policy.Encouragingly, the latest GDP data suggests that the U.S. economy improved at a better-than-expected rate in the third quarter, also marking its fastest pace over the past three years. Per the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the second estimate for the third-quarter GDP jumped at an annual rate of 3.3%, courtesy of higher business investments and favorable government spending. An improved labor market and increased consumer spending has also been driving the economy, which saw growth of at least 3% for the second straight quarter.Moreover, Fed Chair’s comment, ""the economy will continue to expand” ushers in positive sentiment among investors, who now have plenty of investment opportunities this month before they bid adieu to 2017. To top it, Trump’s proposed tax cut is expected to provide further impetus to the already buoyant market.Retail Seems to be the Season’s DemandYellen’s comment: “the economic expansion is increasingly broad-based across sectors,"" deems fit at the current juncture. That said, let’s move our focus to the Zacks Retail – Wholesale sector which looks quite well-placed for December, thanks to the bolstered consumer confidence and solid prospects from the holiday season. Incidentally, the sector has rallied 28.8% this year, surpassing the S&P 500’s upside of 20.1%.  Bullish markets, gradual wage improvement, rising economic activities after hurricanes and falling unemployment rate has boosted consumer sentiment. This is clearly visible from the recent Consumer Confidence data, which reached its highest level in almost 17 years. Per the Conference Board data, the Consumer Confidence Index surged to 129.5 in November from October’s revised reading of 126.2.This clearly signals consumers’ willingness to spend more this holiday season, which is the most crucial period for retailers, as it accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits. Fortunately, it commenced on a good note this year, as reflected by National Retail Federation’s (NRF) data for the five-day period stretching over Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday. Also, NRF’s sales projection (including e-commerce) for November and December bodes well for the retail space.From Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to Target (TGT  -  Free Report), retailers are gearing up for the busiest part of the year, and with digital transformation in shopping, they are fast adopting the omni-channel mantra. Having said that, we believe the sector offers lucrative opportunities for investors to make their Christmas holidays special.Your Holiday Shopping Stock Buys for DecemberWe have identified four rock-solid stocks from the Retail – Wholesale space, with a favorable Zacks Rank. Boasting impressive fundamentals and a splendid earnings surprise history, these stocks have surged more than 20% so far this year.Starting with Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

We note that this supermarket giant has delivered nine straight quarters of positive earnings surprises, driven by its aggressive expansion in the e-commerce space. These factors, along with management’s recently raised guidance for fiscal 2018 make this big-box retailer a solid bet.

These factors have helped this Zacks Rank #2 stock soar 25.5%, faring better than the industry that advanced 10.3%. Additionally, this retailer of branded apparel products has a long-term growth rate of 17.5%. Five Below, Inc. (FIVE  -  Free Report) is another solid pick with long-term growth rate of 28.5%. This Zacks Rank #2 company’s impressive merchandise assortment, focus on pre-teen customers and favorable pricing strategy help it stand strong amid a tough retail landscape. This is evident from the Five Below’s stellar past record. Notably, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises for nine quarters in a row now, helping its stock soar 54.7% year to date, as against the industry’s ’s decline of 13.4%.Finally, investors can invest in Dollar Tree, Inc.

871,DLTR,"With Thanksgiving around the corner, the retail industry’s prospects are squarely in focus. Retail is possibly the most visible face of consumer spending, which has powered the recent spurt in U.S. economic growth. But over the last few years, the industry’s landscape has undergone several radical changes. The most important of these is possibly the tussle between brick and mortar formats and exclusive online stores.Around this time last year, it seemed that e-commerce was easily winning the battle. This is likely the case even now, with several retail majors expanding their online presence significantly. However, some brick and mortar chains are resisting the temptation to go online and have found new ways to fight the retail battle.Battling a Retail CollapseNearly 16 million individuals are employed by the U.S. retail sector, making it a significant cog in the country’s economic engine. However, several of them have been forced to shutter several stores after failing to fend off online competition. And troubles don’t end there for this category. Several big names have even had to file for bankruptcy this year.To provide a small illustration, in 2017 alone, Sears Holdings Corporation  has shuttered more than 350 Sears and K-mart stores. Meanwhile, The Gap, Inc. (GPS  -  Free Report) and J. C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCP  -  Free Report) have shut down 200 and 140 stores, respectively.But it isn’t that sales have completely fallen away for these traditional retail mainstays. Instead, several retailers with an online presence are witnessing a migration from brick and mortar outlets to their company websites.Online, Offline or a Mix of Both?This migration toward online portals has forced retailers to come up with methods to balance their online and offline presence. For instance, Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) is following a two-pronged strategy of increasing its online presence and slashing prices. Meanwhile, nearly half of its online purchases are either being shipped from stores or being picked up from brick and mortar outlets by customers.Also, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has decided to adjust its pricing strategy in order to find the right online-offline balance. The iconic retailer has recently decided to raise online prices for certain products for which shipping costs are significantly high. This move makes store prices for certain items cheaper, which means that it’s a strategy that could backfire for online focused customers.How Dollar Tree is Winning the FightHowever, some discount chains have not had to depend heavily on the online route to remain afloat in this fiercely competitive environment. One of them is Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), which posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21. Comparable store sales (comps) for the quarter increased 3.2% in constant-currency, driven by improved customer count and average ticket. (Read: Dollar Tree Stock Jumps on Q3 Earnings Beat, View Up)At the heart of its recent success have been store remodeling efforts and a decision to expand its food offerings. According to Dollar Tree’s CEO Gary Philbin, strong consumables sales have fueled overall sales during the last quarter. Further, the company provided 125 additional Dollar Tree stores with refrigeration facilities. Dollar Tree has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Taking a Leaf out of Aldi’s Book?Dollar Tree has also been gaining from the integration of Family Dollar, which is contributing significantly to the company’s results. Philbin said better food merchandizing led to a rise in sales at Family Dollar outlets during the third quarter. Such strategies are similar to Germany’s retail giant Aldi which announced ambitious U.S. expansion plans this year.One of the biggest reasons behind Aldi’s discount business model is that 90% of the products are Aldi-exclusive brands, letting the grocer provide high-quality product without the hidden costs of advertising and marketing usually associated with national name brands. (Read: Why Aldi is the Grocery Store of the Future)The Way AheadMost traditional retailers are choosing to take a middle path, striking a delicate balance between their online and offline efforts. But the success of discount stores like Dollar Tree and Aldi indicates that the American consumer is willing to opt for brick and mortar outlets ahead of their online counterparts if they provide strong product offerings at reasonable prices. Clearly, the days of brick and mortar stores are far from over.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

873,DLTR,"It has been a week since Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) released its financial numbers for third-quarter fiscal 2018, and we are already seeing an increased optimism among analysts. This is quite apparent from the uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Constructive view of analysts along with the stock’s solid run on the bourses post earnings, makes this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company a favorable pick for investors.Notably, shares of this supermarket giant have jumped 7.3% since the company’s strong results and outlook. In fact, the stock has been a favorite in the investor community for quite some time now. The company’s shares have surged 42.3% so far this year, faring even better than the industry’s gain of 31.6%.Favorable Estimate RevisionsThe consensus estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 have edged up by a notch to $1.36 and $4.42, respectively, over the past seven days. This follows Walmart’s spectacular performance in the third quarter, which also marked the company’s ninth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise. Moreover, the solid results prompted management to provide an upbeat outlook.Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and Consensus  Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Price and Consensus | Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. QuoteWalmart’s quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents and grew 2% from the year-ago period. Total revenues came in at $123.2 billion (including membership and other income) that advanced 4.2% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $121.1 billion. Additionally, Walmart recorded positive comps growth for the 13th successive time, as U.S. comps (excluding fuel) rose 2.7%, largely driven by improvement in comp traffic and strong e-commerce sales. (Read More: Walmart Stock Gains on Solid Q3 Earnings & Raised View)Management now envisions adjusted earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $4.38-$4.46 per share, as compared with the prior expectation of $4.30-$4.40. For fourth-quarter fiscal 2018, Walmart expects both U.S. comps (excluding fuel) and Sam’s Club comps (excluding fuel) to increase in a range of 1.5-2.0%.Near-Term CatalystsWhile this big-box retailer has been gaining from various strategic initiatives, strength in its e-commerce business remains one of its major driving factors. We note that Walmart is trying every means to evolve with the changing consumer environment to compete with brick-and-mortar rivals and e-commerce king Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report). In this regard, the company has been taking initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of Bonobos, ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com, along with its Walmart Pay mobile payment system and Mobile Express Returns program underscore its quest to accelerate online business.Apart from this, Walmart is undertaking aggressive initiatives to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to e-commerce sales in the third quarter. Walmart’s efforts to enhance delivery services also resonates well with its strategy of growing online grocery sales. Backed by all aforementioned endeavors, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50%, primarily owing to Walmart.com’s performance, including significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service.Given these impressive efforts, management’s impressive outlook and positive analyst sentiment, we believe that Walmart is most likely to sustain the solid momentum.2 More Stocks That Witnessed Positive Estimate Revisions LatelyThe fiscal 2017 consensus mark for Ross Stores Inc.

874,DLTR,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) is one of those retailers that is performing well even amid a tough retail landscape. This can be mainly attributable to the company’s robust initiatives to boost sales and its off-price business model. Both these factors have helped TJX companies attract solid consumer traffic, which has been aiding its performance for a while now.However, the company has been incurring high wage costs for quite some time now and also expects it hurt bottom-line growth in fiscal 2018. It looks like these headwinds have dented the company’s stock performance. Evidently, shares of this leading off-price retailer have lost 4.6% so far this year, as against the industry’s growth of 6%.  So, let’s analyze both sides of the story and see if the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth drivers can combat these hurdles and continue to fuel results.Strategic Initiatives to Boost SalesTJX Companies’ aggressive marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums (TV, radio and social media) have been boosting traffic at stores. Its gift-giving initiatives, unique among off-price retailers and loyalty card program (which offers consumers a non-credit card choice and soft benefits such as early shopping hours) also help the company to improve customer engagement. Further, the company remains focused on innovation and has been introducing new products to drive sales. Incidentally, the company’s newly launched U.S. home concept, HomeSense, will offer consumers a different mix of home fashions from HomeGoods at good value.Focus on E-Commerce & Stores ExpansionWith consumers’ changing shopping patterns, TJX Companies has undertaken several initiatives to boost online sales by recruiting an experienced internet management team. The company’s official website tjmaxx.com, accessible from tablets and smartphones, appeals to the young generation — the company’s main target consumers. TJX plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically in it to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores. However, TJX Companies also remains committed to its solid store opening strategy. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking its total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Notably, TJX plans to take the store count to 5,600 over the long term, with plans to open approximately 260 stores in fiscal 2018.While many retailers are struggling with soft traffic, TJX Companies’ off-price model and aforementioned sales driving efforts help it draw considerable traffic. Another retailer which is benefiting from an off-price model is Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report), which boasts a solid top-line growth trend.Q3 Retails Solid TrendComing back to TJX Companies, the company has been witnessing year-over-year growth in both top and bottom lines for over a year now. Notably, this trend was retained in third-quarter fiscal 2018 despite the adverse impact from hurricanes. The top-line growth can be largely attributable to solid customer traffic, which is backed by the company’s impressive merchandise mix, along with the other sales-driving efforts. Further, strong merchandise margins reflect the company’s disciplined inventory management and strength of its off-price business model. Further, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with its solid inventory position and other sales-driving efforts keeping it well placed for the holiday season.TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  TJX Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | TJX Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat’s Weighing on TJX Companies?TJX Companies has been reeling under high wage costs for a while now. In third-quarter fiscal 2018 higher wages dented the company’s bottom line growth by 1%, with its pre-tax margin going down by 10 basis points. Also, selling, general and administrative costs, as a percentage of sales, inched up 0.5 pp to 18.1% due to increase in wages and costs associated with hurricanes. Unfortunately, wage increases are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018.The company also posted flat comparable store sales in the quarter, with results being affected by hurricanes, with demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division also being hurt by warm temperatures in the United States. Nonetheless, trends at the division improved eventually as weather normalized, keeping it well placed for the fourth quarter.Thus, we believe that TJX Companies strategic initiatives are most likely to offset the barriers and continue the growth story of this company with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%.Looking for More?

This can primarily be attributed to rise in traffic and increased average basket size.Cost of sales increased 7.4% to $2,369.1 million and 30 basis points (bps), as a percentage of sales. The improvement was driven by a 25-bps rise in merchandise margin, as well as a 20-bps decline in both occupancy and buying costs.

882,DLTR,"Shares of RH (RH  -  Free Report), formerly Restoration Hardware, rallied 15.7% in after-hours trading on Nov 15. The gain was prompted by the home furnishings retailer’s raised guidance for the fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2017. Per management, this “demonstrates the earnings power of our new membership model, and a dramatically more efficient operating platform.""It is worth mentioning here that RH’s shares have performed well so far this year and have rallied more than 171%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of just 1.8%.Estimates for the fiscal third quarter and the fiscal year moved up by 17.1% and 6.6%, respectively, over the last 60 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The new business model coupled with several growth initiatives should drive the stock’s performance.Revised OutlookDespite a 1% or 5 cents per share of negative impact from hurricanes Harvey and Irma, RH’s adjusted earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.04 per share for the fiscal third quarter compared with the previous guidance of 68 cents to 80 cents. This reflects a substantial increase from the year ago level of 20 cents.Net revenues for the quarter for this leading luxury retailer in the home furnishing space are likely to be about $592.5 million compared with the previous guidance range of $575-$590 million. The updated guidance reflects an increase of 8% year over year, despite an approximate 1% negative impact from the recent natural calamities.RH has also increased its fourth-quarter adjusted net income guidance to the range of $37-$41 million from its earlier prediction of $33- $37 million. The increased outlook reflects the improved business performance RH is experiencing along with $2 million of tax benefit despite an approximate $1.5 million negative impact as a result of its decision to delay the opening of its New York Design Gallery to Spring-Summer 2018.However, net revenues for the fourth quarter are now expected to be in the range of $655-$680 million compared with the previous expectation of $664-$689 million. This is due to a $9 million negative impact from its decision to delay the opening of its New York Design Gallery.Nonetheless, for fiscal 2017, the company hiked its net income guidance to the range of $82-$87 million from the previous forecast of $70-$77 million. It now expects full-year capital expenditures between $120 million and $130 million, down from the range of $120-$140 million.The company said that it expects fiscal 2018 net revenues between $2.58 billion and $2.62 billion, adjusted net income in the range of $125-$145 million, and free cash flow of more than $240 million.Other DevelopmentsRH wrapped up its distribution facility in Los Angeles and has plans of shutting down its distribution center in Dallas by fiscal year 2017 end. Overall, with the elimination of an estimated 1.75 million square feet of distribution space, RH generated savings of approximately $15 million annually.Meanwhile, RH has completed around 90% of the redesign of its reverse logistics and Outlet business. The move is expected to generate cost savings and enhance margin of $15 million to $20 million annually.The company anticipates margins to rise and costs to fall as it plans to reduce inventory and benefit from its new operating model. RH remains optimistic about reaching its long-term goal of $4-$5 billion in North American revenues with industry leading operating margins and returns on invested capital.Zacks Rank & Key PicksRH currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector are TravelCenters of America LLC (TA  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Dollar Tree, Inc.

885,DLTR,"Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its robust surprise trend accompanied by strong comparable store sales (comps) and improved margins. Also, the company is benefiting from the integration of Family Dollar. However, volatile consumer environment, intense competition and significant global exposure remain impediments.Shares of the company gained 24.9% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 21.4%. Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.Robust Surprise Trend and Solid Q3 Result: Outlook RaisedDollar Tree has been posting robust earnings and sales surprise trends in the recent quarters. The company’s top and bottom-line results for third-quarter fiscal 2017 marked its second straight earnings and sales beat. Results were fueled by significant comps growth and improved margins. Comps improved for the 39th straight quarter while reduced merchandise costs, lower markdowns and occupancy expenses aided margins. Also, positive impact from Canadian currency fluctuations aided results.Driven by the robust third quarter and progress on Family Dollar integration, the company raised guidance for fiscal 2017. Also, it provided a bullish view for the fourth quarter. Management is anticipating earnings per share to be in range of $4.64-$4.73. Also, consolidated sales are projected to lie within the band of $6.32-$6.43 billion, driven by comps growth in a low-single digit rise range for the combined entity.Remarkable Comps GrowthDollar Tree’s comps have been benefiting from strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations and competitive pricing. The company continues with the positive trend as is evident from consolidated comps growth of 3.2% in the third-quarter fiscal 2017 and 3.3% in constant-currency.Comps growth in the quarter can be attributed to improved customer count and average ticket. While Dollar Tree banner posted comps growth of 5% (in constant-currency), the same at the Family Dollar banner increased 1.5%.Store Expansion Bodes WellCurrently, Dollar Tree is concentrating on expanding its store base and incorporating technological advancements. During third-quarter fiscal 2017, the company opened 169 new stores and expanded or relocated 23 stores. Consequently, it ended the quarter with 14,744 stores-including 6,604 Dollar Tree and 8,140 Family Dollar outlets. Further, the company remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the United States.Integration With Family DollarDollar Tree is also gaining from the integration of Family Dollar, which was acquired in July 2015. Notably, sales from the Family Dollar banner represented nearly 50% of the company’s consolidated sales in the third quarter.Additionally, Dollar Tree is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. Consequently, the company has renovated 191 Family Dollar stores in the third quarter and intends to complete 350 renovations in fiscal 2017.While increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company results for some time, it expects to generate annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition. The combined chain, on the completion of the integration, will be positioned to reach out to more value-seeking consumers through a network spanning across vast geographies.Bottom LineWhile all seems well, Dollar Tree has been facing problems regarding highly competitive market and volatile consumer behavior. Also, significant global exposure poses serious threats toward the company performance. However, we believe the company’s strategies will be able to offset these headwinds.Do Retail-Wholesale Stocks Grab Your Attention?

889,DLTR,"Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) has long been a treat for investors, as evident from its splendid bull-run over the past year. Notably, this big box retailer which will soon drop the “hyphen” and “stores” from its name to officially emerge as an omni-channel retailer, has surged 49.5% over a year. With this, the company also crushed the industry’s gain of 40.1%. Well, Wal-Mart has been riding on its stellar earnings surprise and comparable store sales (comps) record, which in turn has been backed by the company’s expansion strategies and constant efforts to counter Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) growing dominance. However, significant investments to boost e-commerce activities have been weighing upon Wal-Mart’s gross margin.So, let’s analyze the factors and see if this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock can sustain its robust momentum in 2018.E-Commerce Strategies to Drive Top LineWalmart is trying every means to evolve with the changing consumer environment. In this regard, the company has been taking several e-commerce initiatives, including buyouts, alliances, and improved delivery and payment systems. Evidently, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Bonobos, Moosejaw, ModCloth and Jet.com underscore its quest to build an impressive digital brand portfolio. The company’s Walmart Pay mobile payment system, and Mobile Express Returns program further highlight its focus on accelerating online business and making shopping easier and faster.Apart from this, Walmart is making aggressive efforts to expand in the booming online grocery space, which was a major contributor to its e-commerce sales in the third quarter. In fact, Walmart’s efforts to enhance its delivery services (like buyout of Parcel and deal with Deliv) resonates quite well with its strategy of growing its online grocery sales. Backed by all aforementioned endeavors, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 50% in the third quarter, primarily owing to Walmart.com’s performance. Notably, this includes significant contributions from Walmart’s online grocery service, which has now expanded to over 1,100 locations and is expected to have 1,000 additions next year.International Strength: Another Major DriverApart from having a dominant store and online presence in the United States, Wal-Mart is also gaining from its solid international operations. With operations spread in China, Mexico, Canada and UK, international forms Wal-Mart’s second-largest segment, in terms of revenues. In the third quarter, Walmart’s international sales grew 2.5% to $29.1 billion, driven by broad-based growth — with 10 out of 11 markets recording positive comps. Notably, Mexico and China performed exceptionally well, while results in UK also improved in the quarter. Walmart’s international sales were mainly fueled by strength in food and staples categories.Also, the company’s constant e-commerce initiatives (like partnership with JD.com) and efforts to enhance logistics efficiencies drove results. Wal-Mart remains committed toward achieving growth across all its markets, on the back of its fresh products; expansion of online grocery and private brands. Backed by these endeavors, the world’s largest retailer marked its ninth and 13th consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise and U.S. comps growth, respectively in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Margins Look StrainedWhile Wal-Mart’s online strategies have been driving its business, costs associated with investments in e-commerce expansion and technological advancements; the mix impact from growing e-commerce operations and Walmart’s compelling pricing strategy have been weighing on its margins. Evidently, these factors caused the company’s gross margin to contract 11 bps and 29 bps in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2018, respectively. Apart from this, the company has also been spending more on store labor to enhance customer service, which can hinder profit margins.While these factors and intense competition raise concerns, management’s increased earnings guidance for fiscal 2018 and favorable comps view for the fourth quarter reflect its confidence in the company’s future prospects. This in turn rekindles optimism about Wal-Mart’s strong chances of keeping its spectacular momentum alive.Looking for More Promising Bets? Check These Trending Retail StocksDollar Tree, Inc.

890,DLTR,"Looking back at 2018, it would not be incorrect to characterize this year as the one in which brick and mortar retail faced its gravest challenges. Always a formidable online presence, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) fired its first offline salvo when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion. This was possibly a larger symbol of the changes sweeping through the entire brick and mortar retail space.Even as stores shuttered and a swathe of mall closures ensued, industry occupants responded to new challenges through a variety of initiatives. What finally emerged was a new online-offline model, best illustrated by the efforts of Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) and Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report).Wal-Mart's Resounding SuccessWal-Mart owes its huge success in 2017 to its recent and continuing efforts to strategically transform itself to face new challenges. The stock is up 43.6% year to date and shows no signs of slowing its ascent. The iconic retailer also reported stunning third-quarter fiscal 2018 results and raised its bottom-line view for fiscal 2018. Wal-Mart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So what exactly did the iconic discount retailer get right? After years of sluggish sales, Wal-Mart got its act together primarily through a two-pronged approach. Firstly, it has invested billions of dollars in technology in order to fortify its e-commerce presence.It has also ramped up its delivery capabilities significantly and invested $2.7 billion in higher wages and training, initiatives which are paying rich dividends. (Read: What Can Target Learn From Wal-Mart's Retail Game?)Target Gets its Act TogetherTarget also reported strong third-quarter results, but shares of the Minneapolis-based company declined 4% in pre-market trading on Nov 15.  This was because the year-over-year decline in the bottom line and management’s comments about a highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter was not well received by investors. But Target made several moves recently that have improved its prospects in a big way. Evidence of these efforts is the 25.1% price gain it has experienced over the last six months, significantly higher than the broader sector’s 15.1% increase over the same period.Firstly, it has decided to introduce flexible format stores in order to increase its presence in densely populated urban locations. Also, it has significantly developed its online platform, aggressively reduced costs and started to showcase more premium products.Recently, it strengthened its grocery delivery capabilities by acquiring grocery delivery company Shipt for $550 million. With Target already offering same-delivery in New York City, the Shipt purchase will only add to Target’s delivery muscle. (Read: Grocery Gunfight: Can Incumbents Fend Off Amazon?)Could Target Have Better Upside Potential?Wal-Mart’s superlative success is well known and it is likely that the stock will enjoy a similar run of gains going forward. But could Target offer investors better upside in the days ahead? A cursory glance at some valuation metrics seems to indicate that this might just be the case.The price to sales ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates the market value of each of the company’s sales dollars.Coming to the two stocks under consideration, both are undervalued compared with the wider industry, which has a P/S ratio of 1.08. However, Wal-Mart is the pricier of the two, since it has a P/S ratio of 0.6, higher than Target’s reading of 0.51.   A more-or-less similar picture emerges when comparing EV/EBITDA ratios. This it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not affected by the differing capital structures of the two companies.Coming to the two retailers, both Wal-Mart and Target are undervalued relative to their broader sector. However, Target holds the edge here with an EV/EBITDA value of 6.57, lower than 9.71 for Wal-Mart.In ConclusionWal-Mart’s multiple initiatives have stood the retailer in good stead through 2017 and are likely to help it move even higher next year. Target is yet to catch up, but could offer higher upside in the days ahead, a conclusion borne out by the comparison of more than one valuation metric.  Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

891,DLTR,"The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX  -  Free Report) has been underperforming the industry for a while. The company’s shares have gained 10.3% in the past six months compared with its industry’s rally of 24.3%. TJX Companies’ performance has been sidelined due to dismal comps and persistent struggle against higher wages.We note that higher wages dented the company’s bottom-line growth by 1% during third-quarter fiscal 2018, with its pre-tax margin declining 10 basis points. Wage hikes are expected to negatively impact earnings growth by 2% in fiscal 2018. Further, during the third quarter, the company reported flat comps against 5% growth recorded in the year-ago quarter. In fact, this also broke the company’s long trend of delivering positive comps growth. Management stated that adverse weather conditions combined with soft demand for apparel at the Marmaxx division, were largely responsible for weak store sales.Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been undertaking several initiatives to boost sales and offset ongoing hurdles.Strategies to Boost Brick-and-Mortar and Online SalesWith an effort to revive comps, TJX Companies has been resorting to aggressive store openings. During the third quarter, the company opened 139 stores, taking the total count to 4,052 stores as of Oct 28, 2017. Also, management is encouraged by the initial response to the recently opened 3 HomeSense outlets in the United States and its first TK Maxx outlet in Australia. Notably, the company plans to take the store count to 5,600 in the long term along with approximately 260 stores scheduled for opening in fiscal 2018. In North America, TJX Companies plans to add more than 1,400 stores in the long term, with plans to double Marmaxx’s U.S. count. The company is focused on expanding HomeGoods chain to at least 1,000 stores.Alongside inducing growth in the brick-and-mortar front, TJX Companies has also been undertaking measures to improve performance in the e-commerce arena. The company plans to add more categories to the online shopping site and invest categorically to differentiate it from brick-and-mortar stores. The company has also been recruiting experienced internet management team to encourage greater efficiency and boost online sales.  Other Noteworthy Initiatives  TJX Companies’ dedicated marketing and advertising campaigns through multiple mediums are also encouraging and are expected to boost sales. Further, its gift-giving initiatives, which is unique among off-price retailers, and loyalty card program are expected to improve customer engagement. The company’s sales enhancing initiatives also include introducing products through innovation.TJX Companies’ inventory management initiatives are quite noteworthy. In fact, the company’s off-price business model derives much retail strength from disciplined inventory management. Driven by these efforts, consolidated inventories per store were down 4% on a currency-neutral basis, at the end of the third quarter. Further, management stated that it began the fourth quarter on a strong note, with solid inventory position and other sales-driving.All said, we expect that investors will show greater optimism in the stock in the upcoming periods, which will aid a revival in stock price in 2018.Do Retail Stocks Interest You?

The company’s store banner dot-com businesses both in the United States and Europe increased in mid-single-digit, while digital sales in Canada rose at a double-digit rate.Gross margin contracted 290 basis points to 31% of sales primarily due to fall in merchandise margin on account of higher markdowns to pull traffic and clear slow-moving inventory.

895,DLTR,"Kirkland's, Inc. (KIRK  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Nov 21, before the market opens.We expect the company to gain from its expanding e-commerce business. However, rising operating expenses stemming from business expansion efforts is likely to dent the company’s margins in the upcoming quarterly release. Notably, the company’s bottom line has lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 12.1%.Let’s look into some factors that are likely to impact the third-quarter performance of this specialty retailer of home decor products.What to Expect? The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pegged at a loss of 7 cents per share, which is wider than the year-ago loss of 5 cents. Further, the consensus estimate has widened by a penny in the past 30 days.Nevertheless, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $144.2 million, improving 4.3% from the prior-year period.Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Kirkland's, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kirkland's, Inc. QuoteFactors Impacting the Quarter Kirkland’s has been struggling with increased store occupancy costs, due to aggressive store expansion strategies. This has led to higher operating expenses in the last few quarters. Such headwinds are well reflected in the company’s price performance. The stock has declined 12.9% in the past year, as against the industry’s rally of 4.4%.  Higher costs can also be attributed to increased shipping, store payroll, advertising and packaging costs. Such expenditures are likely to hurt the company’s bottom-line performance. Further, costs associated with Kirkland’s supply-chain and omni-channel expansions may mar the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Kirkland’s has been closing smaller and underperforming stores in malls to reduce costs and enhance efficiency. Additionally, the company plans to open bigger off-mall stores at popular locations, which are likely to boost sales. Incidentally, Kirkland’s intends to inaugurate 25-30 stores and close 20 in fiscal 2017. Furthermore, the company is on track with its initiatives to improve merchandise margins.Kirkland’s has also been gaining from sturdy growth in e-commerce platform. Management expects e-commerce business to grow at a greater pace than its brick-and-mortar stores and contribute significantly to top-line growth. In order to support the momentum of its online business, Kirkland’s has rolled out several new information systems to improve online purchasing and planning.Although Kirkland’s has been taking several initiatives to revive performance, we believe it will take time for the company to offset rising costs.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not show that Kirkland's is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) as well as a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Although Kirkland carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.

896,DLTR,"U.S. Senate Republicans revealed a tax plan that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year. Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump’s ability to pass laws, aggravated by the Wall Street ending an eight-week winning streak. After all, lowering of taxes was one of the major campaign promises made by Trump that helped push the major indices to a series of record highs since the 2016 presidential election. Add to this the high valuations and corporate debt plaguing the broader markets and the decade-long Bull Run is without a question nearing an end.In the wake of such uncertainty, picking stocks isn’t easy. But there are ways to reduce the chances of making a bad investment. In such a scenario, stocks that are undisturbed by market gyration provide steady earnings growth and have higher market capitalization, making solid bets.Tax Overhaul AmbiguityThe Senate seeks to delay the tax reduction plan until 2019. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as lowering of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% can strengthen the labor market and revitalize the economy. It will also encourage the world’s ingenious entrepreneurs to establish their business in the United States.On top of it, the Senate added that the plan will impose a minimum of 10% on income from intangible assets like intellectual property. Multinational companies that generate a significant portion of non-U.S. profits from intellectual properties were in the line of fire. Notable among them are companies from the tech sector. Tech & Banks Affected the MostTech companies, in the meanwhile, benefit immensely from the lowering of the tax rate. Their after-tax earnings improve leading to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and developments, and mergers and acquisitions. Hence, a possible delay in the much-anticipated corporate tax cuts resulted in a bout of selling of tech stocks.Banks weren’t spared either. This is because lowering of corporate taxes will bolster investments and will be a boon for lenders. Adding to the trouble for banks was a flattest yield curve for a decade, which will affect an already weak interest income at the nation’s largest lenders.Eight-Week Winning Streak Comes to an EndIn fact, the broader equity market registered its first weekly loss in two months as investors remained wary after the congressional Republicans failed to make inroads with passing tax cuts. The 30-stock Dow Jones fell 39.73 points to close at 23,422.21 on Nov 10 and the S&P 500 index declined 1%, finishing at 2,582.3. Both the indices recorded an eight-week winning streak, their longest since 2013. Meanwhile, the index of small-cap stocks, the Russell 2000, fell 1.3% and posted its steepest weekly decline since August.Volatility has crept back into the markets. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge which uses options-trading data to measure implied volatility of S&P 500 stocks, jumped 9.6% to close at 11.51. VIX also ended the week slightly above its 2017 average after touching a record low the week earlier.Other Potential Red FlagsNot only the delay in tax reforms, markets are flashing several warning signs. The biggest roadblock is lofty valuations. The bull market already stretches back to March 2009 as a result the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of the S&P 500 is well above 31, the second-highest valuation in a century as per Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, in Atlantic City, NJ. It now lags valuations seen in the late 1990s dot-com bubble.We should also remember that there is too much risk in the Bull Run as the gains are concentrated on certain stocks. According to David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers and portfolio manager of Wintergreen Fund such stocks include Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), eBay, Facebook, Microsoft Corp., Netflix, Priceline (PCLN), Salesforce (CRM) and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), all have gained an average of 29% so far this year. They have also contributed almost a third of the S&P 500’s return since the end of 2014.Last but not the least, corporate debt ceiling is on the rise. As per JP Morgan’s recent ‘Guide to Markets’, corporate debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) touched 45% the highest in recent history.Time to Buy Ultra-Safe Stocks: 5 Solid ChoicesWith the markets apprehending a healthy pullback after a strong run, investing in stocks that are immune to market gyrations seems judicious.

897,DLTR,"Hibbett Sports, Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Nov 17. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this sporting goods retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.The company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 25% in the last reported quarter. Further, it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 3.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 21 cents, reflecting a decline of 68.6% from the prior-year period. Estimates have remained unchanged in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $217.6 million, down about 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. Quote However, shares of Hibbett have improved 0.4% in the last three months, against the industry’s drop of 8.4%. Factors at PlayWhile Hibbett’s bottom-line trend remains impressive, it has a dismal sales surprise history, which exhibits top-line miss in nine of the past 10 quarters. Furthermore, comparable-store sales (comps) continue to be marred by sluggish traffic, softness across all categories, increased promotional activities and difficult launch compares. Moreover, Hibbett is not immune to the challenges in the sporting goods industry.The sporting goods industry seems to be in doldrums, as customers are jumping on the dot-com bandwagon, leaving lesser options for the brick-and-mortar retailers. Consequently, the sporting goods space has grown extremely competitive and promotional, consequently creating pressure on margins and the bottom line.Additionally, the company substantially trimmed its guidance for fiscal 2018 due to the dismal fiscal second-quarter results and expectations of the persistence of a tough retail environment. While the company projects soft sales through the rest of the year, it now anticipates comps decline in the mid- to high-single digit range compared with the prior guidance of negative 1% to positive 1%. In addition, it envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.25-$1.35 per share, down significantly from the previous forecast of $2.35-$2.55.In addition to the soft sales trend, Hibbett is witnessing strained margins for quite a while now. This is clear from the fact that the company has witnessed reduction in gross and operating margins in the past few quarters.Looking ahead, Hibbett anticipates gross margin to contract 250-285 bps in fiscal 2018 compared with its previous guidance of 55-75 bps reduction. Gross margin in fiscal 2018 is estimated to be hurt by increased markdowns to lower aged inventory, continuation of the highly promotional retail environment, along with persistent logistics and store occupancy deleverage stemming from lower comps. These factors make us quite apprehensive about the company’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hibbett is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Hibbett has an Earnings ESP of -18.70% as the Most Accurate estimate of 17 cents is pegged lower than and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. Further, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar Tree Inc.

In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 7.9%.

Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.3 billion, up approximately 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Ross Stores, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Ross Stores, Inc. Quote Notably, Ross Stores has outperformed the industry in the last three months. The stock has jumped 20% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.8%. Factors at PlayOf late, Ross Stores has been displaying a solid earnings trend, recording earnings beat in 12 of the past 13 quarters. This strong earnings trend stemmed from the favorable response of value-focused customers to Ross Stores’ extensive collection of brand bargains and solid cost controls. Moreover, its sound financial status, ongoing merchandise initiatives and consistent focus on store expansion bode well.Following a robust first-half fiscal 2017, the company provided guidance for the second half and accordingly raised earnings view for fiscal 2017. The company anticipates same-store revenues to be up 1-2% in both fiscal third and fourth quarters. Earnings per share are projected in the band of 64-67 cents for the fiscal third quarter, an increase from 62 cents reported last year. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company anticipates earnings per share in the range of 88-92 cents compared with 77 cents in the prior-year quarter.Consequently, the company raised its earnings per share view for fiscal 2017 to the range of $3.16-$3.23 compared with $3.07-$3.17 guided earlier. The updated guidance reflects year-over-year growth of 12-14%. These factors collectively underscore the company’s solid future potential.However, being part of a consumer-driven industry, the company remains prone to threats arising from consumers’ transition toward the dot.com bandwagon. Further, concerns regarding a tough retail environment, stiff competition and cannibalization remain.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ross Stores is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

899,DLTR,"The earnings results are usually the corner stone of gauging a company’s performance. The third-quarter 2017 earnings reporting cycle is drawing closer to an end where we already have a reasonably good picture of the winners and losers in this quarter. This gives investors a hands-on data to re-evaluate their portfolios and take on board stocks that promise handsome returns.Among all the sectors, our focus here will be upon the Retail-Wholesale sector. A close look at the sector reveals that retailers continue to struggle in an Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) dominated market. With market share growing for Amazon Prime, Marketplace and Prime Air, as well as the launch of drone delivery, Amazon is poised for exceptional growth, which undoubtedly presents fierce competition for traditional retailers.The rise of e-tailers has left the retail sector struggling with lower footfall at stores as all the brands are looking to directly sell to consumers through the expansion of digital stores. Further, these retailers are heavily investing in e-commerce and omni-channel functionalities, which are likely to weigh on margins at least in the near term.As the holiday season, which accounts for a sizeable chunk of yearly revenues and profits for retailers, is just around the corner, analysts remain optimistic about the sector’s performance on grounds of gradual wage growth, lower inflation, low unemployment rate, an uptick in the U.S. consumer sentiment and a lift in economic activity post hurricanes. Characterized by the aforementioned improvement in the consumer backdrop, alongside early-hour store openings, huge discounts, promotional strategies, price matching and free shipping on online purchases, the holiday season this November and December is likely to be a huge success.The nation's largest retail trade group, National Retail Federation (“NRF”) rightly projects retail sales for November and December (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) to improve 3.6-4% to $678.75-$682 billion, up from $655.8 billion (or 3.6% growth) last year and better than the five-year average sales growth of 3.5%. Additionally, the NRF projects online holiday sales to rise 7-10% to nearly $117 billion in November and December compared with a 9% improvement to $105 billion in 2015.The NRF predicts sales for the period to benefit from a longer holiday season as Christmas is falling on Monday this year and 32 days after Thanksgiving. This will give retailers one extra day of sales from usual, as well as benefit last-minute shoppers in the weekend before Christmas.While the holiday season is likely to impact the fourth-quarter of 2017, we bring our focus back to the third quarter, which is in its climax.Q3 Earnings ScorecardLooking at the earnings scorecard of the overall S&P 500 Index so far, about 436 S&P 500 members that together represent 87.2% of the Index’s total market capitalization have released third-quarter earnings results. Total earnings for these companies were up 6.8%, on 6.2% revenue growth. Further, about 73.4% delivered positive earnings surprises and about 67% beat revenue estimates.Key takeaways from the results so far point to clear revenue momentum as top-line growth has been accelerating compared with other recent periods. Further, the quarter has witness an above-average proportion of positive surprises, reflecting the carry forward of momentum from the preceding quarter. Additionally, the estimates revision trend for the fourth quarter has been favorable, with earnings estimates holding up a lot better relative to other comparable periods.Among the 16 Zacks sectors, results for the Finance sector have been below average this quarter. However, this earnings season has been favorable for the Energy, Industrial Products, Technology, Construction, Business Services, and Medical sectors.Coming to expectations, total earnings for the quarter are expected to increase 6.2% year over year, with a 5.7% jump in revenues. Here, the strength in the Technology and Energy sectors are likely to balance the soft Finance sector results.For the retail sector, in particular, earnings in the third quarter are expected to inch up 0.6%, with 6.2% revenue growth. Notably, the retail sector still has a sizable chunk of earnings to be reported. Only 47.4% of the S&P 500 members have reported results so far. Of these, 83.3% beat earnings estimates, while 66.7% topped revenue estimates. The sector has seen earnings for the quarter rise 2.9% thus far, with revenue growth of 10.9%.The real picture of the trend so far is visible from our latest Earnings Trends report published on Nov 8.That said, we bring to you seven retail stocks that may show promise based on their favorable Zacks Rank – Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) – and a positive Earnings ESP.

900,DLTR,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) seems to be on a roll. With a splendid comparable store sales (comps) performance backed by solid strategic initiatives, the company has been constantly adding new leaves to its growth story. The reflection of the same is quite evident from the stock’s impressive performance. Notably, the company has gained 32.2% in the past three months, thanks to its upbeat second-quarter fiscal 2017 results and an encouraging view. Moreover, this department store retailer surged 14.5% year to date, against the industry’s 1.2% drop. While a challenging retail landscape and reduction in SNAP benefits could act as deterrents, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s growth efforts are likely to keep it going. Nevertheless, let’s delve deeper into Dollar Tree’s growth drivers.Superb Comps RecordDollar Tree has been witnessing remarkable comps growth, backed by its competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. Incidentally, the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2017 marked 38th straight quarter of comps growth. The second-quarter comps growth was backed by improved transaction count, as well as average ticket. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in a low single-digit range for the third quarter and fiscal 2017, thus reflecting further growth potential. Focus on Store Expansion Bodes WellDollar Tree is progressing well with its growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve patrons better. Also, we remain confident that the company will continue to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion to boost top-line performance.Family Dollar’s Integration Boosts ResultsThe mega-merger of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar has been benefiting the former ever since the deal was concluded in July 2015. Notably, sales from the Family Dollar banner represented more than 50% of the company’s consolidated sales in the second quarter. Further, Dollar Tree is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. While increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company’s results for some time, it expects to generate annual run-rate synergies worth $300 million by the end of the third year of this buyout.Outlook Fuels EstimatesAll these factors, along with contributions from the company’s online business Dollar Tree Direct, helped it post robust financial numbers in the second quarter. Evidently, both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, management raised its outlook for fiscal 2017, reflecting confidence in the second-half performance.Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and Consensus  Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and Consensus | Dollar Tree, Inc. Quote The company now forecasts net sales for fiscal 2017 (which will contain an additional week) in the band of $22.07-$22.28 billion, compared with the old projection of $21.95-$22.25 billion. Earnings per share is expected in the range of $4.44-$4.60, compared with the previous forecast of $4.17-$4.43. Well, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 has gone up by 4 cents and 21 cents to 89 cents and $4.66 respectively, in two months.Possible DeterrentsPresident Trump is suggesting on reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is approximately 25% of the budget for the program. Cut in SNAP benefit may hamper Dollar Tree performance as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict spending to low margin products. Thus, reduction in SNAP benefit could pose hurdles to the company.Also, management stated that it expects store payroll expenses to remain pressurized on account of the elevating minimum wages. We believe that this could raise the SG&A costs and hurt the operating margin. Additionally, stiff competition from other industry players and the growing online dominance of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) pose a threat to Dollar Tree.However, we expect Dollar Tree’s growth endeavors to tide over the obstacles and help the company keep up its solid show on the bourses.Looking for More Promising Bets?

Further, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of nearly 5% in the trailing four quarters. So let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 90 cents compared with 81 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus estimate has witnessed an uptrend in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $5.28 billion, up 5.6% from the year-ago quarter.Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Dollar Tree, Inc. QuoteMoreover, Dollar Tree’s shares have surged 25.2% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 8.6% growth.Factors at PlayDollar Tree has been gaining from the integration of Family Dollar, which is contributing significantly to the company’s results. In second-quarter fiscal 2017, the company achieved comps growth for the 38th straight time. Also, both top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. Apart from solid performance at stores, growth of the company’s online business, Dollar Tree Direct, also fueled results. Reduced merchandise and freight costs, alongside lower markdowns, also boosted margins.Based on the recent quarter results and expected benefits from the Family Dollar integration, management remains confident of the second half. Consequently, it provided a favorable outlook for the fiscal third quarter and raised its fiscal 2017 view.The company anticipates comps growth in a low single-digit range for the third quarter and fiscal 2017, thus reflecting further growth potential. Further, the company projects fiscal third quarter sales of $5.20-$5.29 billion and earnings per share in the range of 83-90 cents per share.For fiscal 2017, management now forecasts net sales (which will contain an additional week) in the band of $22.07-$22.28 billion compared with the prior projection of $21.95-$22.25 billion. Earnings per share for fiscal 2017 are now expected to be in the range of $4.44-$4.60, which includes a receivable impairment charge of 14 cents spent in the first half of fiscal 2017. Earlier, management projected earnings in the band of $4.17-$4.43 per share for fiscal 2017.Much of the optimism on the stock is attributed to the remarkable comps growth in recent quarters, backed by the company’s competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. While a challenging retail landscape and reduction in SNAP benefits could act as deterrents, we believe the company’s growth efforts are likely to keep it going.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dollar Tree is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dollar Tree currently carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. The combination of Dollar Tree’s Zacks Rank #2 and ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:American Eagle Outfitters Inc. (AEO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.72% and a Zacks Rank #2.

903,DLTR,"Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) continued with its upbeat performance in fiscal 2017 as reflected from its better-than-expected third-quarter results. The company’s strategic endeavors, turnaround plan as well as improved traffic trends remain the driving factors. These helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to gain 10.1% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 3.1%.Despite reporting positive earnings surprise during the quarter, shares of this Minneapolis-based company are down roughly 4% in the pre-market trading hours. This is because the year-over-year decline in the bottom line and management’s commentary about highly competitive environment in the fourth quarter was not well perceived by investors. Further, the company’s not so encouraging outlook for the final quarter also hurt investors' sentiments.  Let’s Unveil the PictureThe company posted third-quarter adjusted earnings of 91 cents a share that outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents but declined 13.1% from the prior-year period. We observed that rise in cost of sales, increased SG&A expenses and higher interest expense hurt the bottom line.The company generated total sales of $16,667 million that also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,613 million and rose 1.4% from the year-ago quarter.Target’s initiatives such as the development of omni-channel capacities, diversification and localization of assortments along with emphasis on flexible format stores and cost reduction are encouraging. In a bid to stimulate its digital sales this holiday season, Target is also strengthening its relationship with Google by allowing customers nationwide to shop through Google Express including voice-activated shopping.The company also rolled out Target Restock program that allows customers to restock their shipping box with essential items online and get them delivered at door steps by the next business day for a nominal charge. These endeavors are important due to changing retail landscape that encompasses increasing online penetration and aggressive pricing that may hurt sales and margins.Notably, comparable sales for the quarter increased 0.9% compared to a 0.2% decline witnessed in the year-ago period. While the number of transactions rose 1.4%, the average transaction amount declined 0.5%. Comparable digital channel sales surged 24% and added 0.8 percentage points to comparable sales.Gross profit grew 1% to $4,955 million while gross margin contracted 10 basis points to 29.7%. Operating income plummeted 17.8% to $869 million, while operating margin shriveled 120 basis points to 5.2%.Target’s debit and credit card penetration remained flat at 12.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Total REDcard penetration climbed to 24.2% from 24.3% in the year-ago quarter.Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Target Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Target Corporation QuoteOther Financial DetailsDuring the quarter, Target repurchased shares worth $171 million and paid dividends of $339 million. The company still had about $4 billion remaining under its $5 billion share buyback program.The company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,725 million, long-term debt and other borrowings of $11,277 million and shareholders’ investment of $11,137 million.A Glance at the Outlook Management now anticipates fourth-quarter comparable sales to be flat to up 2%. The company expects fiscal 2017 comparable sales to be flat to up 1%.Target now envisions fourth-quarter earnings in the band of $1.05-$1.25 and fiscal 2017 earnings between $4.40 and $4.60 up from $4.34 and $4.54 per share, projected earlier. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 stands at $1.27 and $4.53, respectively.Interested in the Retail Space? Check Out TheseBig Lots, Inc.

905,DLTR,"After a blissful holiday season, retailers got another reason to smile. Per Bureau of Economic Analysis, consumer spending increased $54.2 billion or 0.4% in the final month of 2017, following the revised upward reading of 0.8% growth registered in November. Meanwhile, personal income surged $58.7 billion or 0.4% in December, following an increase of 0.3% in the month of November.Certainly, a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, a 17-year low unemployment rate and modest inflation were enough to propel consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. Quite evident, retailers were the end gainers, as people continued their shopping spree.Consumer Spending Playing a Vital RoleConsumer spending — one of the pivotal factors driving the economy — remains strong during the holiday season and aided economic growth of 2.6% in the final quarter of 2017. Notably, consumer spending increased at a rate of 3.8% in the fourth quarter, per the Commerce Department’s latest data.Favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current administration bode well for the Retail-Wholesale sector. Moreover, the latest tax reform, which has resulted in the lowering of the corporate tax rate to as much as 21%, has given the much needed boost to the sector that is lately bearing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns.But things have now changed in favor of retailers. Stocks once bogged down by a tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.How the Reporting Cycle Unfolding for Retailers?The sector, which currently occupies the top 19% (3 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced 42.5% in a year and comfortably outperforming the S&P 500’s  growth of 26.6%. Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 8.6% and 5.3%, respectively, in this reporting cycle.As of Jan 24, 2018, about 15.4% of the S&P 500 companies in the Retail sector have reported their results, wherein 66.7% companies delivered an earnings beat, while 100% surpassed revenue estimates. Earnings of these companies rose 9.3%, revenues surged 10.5%.We are in the thick of the earnings season and the trend so far appears impressive. It’s that time of the year again when the investor community is busy comparing estimates with actual outcomes. Prior to the releases, investors are keen on rebalancing their portfolio to include stocks that are likely to trump estimates. This is because an earnings beat serves as a catalyst, raises investors’ confidence in a stock and results in further price appreciation. This leads to the obvious question of how to find the potential winners?Prospective Winners for the SeasonAll said, we used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this earnings season. Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is as high as 70%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Here are some few companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Dollar Tree, Inc.

910,DLTR,"The Retail-Wholesale sector is hogging all the attention, and this time for good reasons. For the time being, the expression ""retail apocalypse” appears to be a thing of past. The sector has certainly been bearing the brunt of heightened online competition, lower footfall and changing consumer spending patterns but of late the tables are turning in favor of the retailers. Stocks once bogged down by tough environment are now suddenly climbing the charts.The sector, which currently occupies the top 19% (3 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks categorized sectors, has advanced 42.5% in a year and comfortably outperforming the S&P 500’s  growth of 26.6%. Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 8.6% and 5.3%, respectively, in this reporting cycle.As of Jan 24, 2018, about 15.4% of the S&P 500 companies in the Retail sector have reported their results, wherein 66.7% companies delivered an earnings beat, while 100% surpassed revenue estimates. Earnings of these companies rose 9.3%, revenues surged 10.5%.Sector Holds the BatonFavorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector. Analysts pointed that a buoyant stock market, gradual wage acceleration, improved employment picture, rising consumer confidence and modest inflation are enough to trigger consumer spending.  Notably, consumer spending increased at a rate of 3.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017, per the Commerce Department’s latest data.Higher spending clearly indicates that the holiday season turned out to be a blissful one for retailers as consumers continued to fill their shopping carts. The festive season showcased a stellar performance since the recession of 2008. Per National Retail Federation, sales (excluding autos, gas and restaurant sales) during the November/December period increased 5.5% to $691.9 billion, surpassing its own projection of a 3.6-4% rise. Online shopping, which is included in the results, surged 11.5%.Another reason why the sector grabbed investors’ attention is the latest tax reform that has resulted in lowering the corporate tax rate to as much as 21%, and retailers will be the beneficiary of the same. Analysts believe that a lower tax burden is likely to allow the retailers to channelize the surplus money to best possible options. They may go for a dividend hike, or reduce debt load, or create a corpus to fund acquisitions, or invest in enhancing omni-channel capabilities, new product launches and any other innovations.Picking the Prospective Winners for the SeasonAll said, we used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat earnings estimates this earnings season.

912,DLTR,"Investors in Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 24, 2017 $72 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Dollar Tree shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Dollar Tree is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Retail - Discount Stores industry that ranks in the Top 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates.

Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

914,DLTR,"Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) is keeping eyes fixed on augmenting e-commerce business, evident from the latest venture to combine Sam's Club with Instacart for providing same day delivery services. The news came in a few days after sources revealed that the company will launch an online shopping vertical offering furniture and home decor products. With such efforts listed in its e-commerce expansion plans, Walmart seems well placed to lock horns with Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) and accelerate online sales growth.That said, let’s take a closer look at the aspects associated with these deals and how they will benefit this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.Sam's Club-Instacart to Strengthen Delivery ServicesSam's Club is a warehouse chain and a vital unit of Walmart’s business. The unit is expected to witness substantial boost in the sale of its food products and everyday essentials through the partnership with Instacart. Per the deal, Sam’s Club customers can get their orders delivered at their doorstep within an hour’s time.With Instacart’s fame in same-day delivery services, shopping with Sam’s Club is expected to be all the more enticing for customers. This is likely to drive Walmart’s online and app-based sales. Further, management stated that Sam’s Club will continue expanding same-day delivery services in 2018 across the United States. As of now, the unit will offer same-day delivery benefits in Austin, St. Louis and Dallas-Fort Worth.Well, the deal is quite a bonus for Instacart’s expanding business, offering it the opportunity to add many of Sam’s Club’s valued brands to its portfolio and widen customer base. Moreover, Instacart members will now be able to avail Sam’s Club’s bulk shopping choices and its signature savings.Speaking of same-day delivery services, Walmart’s efforts to enrich consumers’ experiences by providing easy shopping methods and seamless deliveries are quite praiseworthy. In October 2017, the company acquired a delivery startup, Parcel, Inc., which is a last-mile delivery service and specializes in same-day delivery for perishable and non-perishable products. Also, the company has been testing same-day deliveries with Deliv for quite some time now.Additionally, the company’s Walmart Pickup program enables customers to place orders online and pick them up at stores for free. In earlier developments, Walmart partnered with ride hailing services — Uber and Lyft — for speedy online grocery deliveries.Other Vital E-Commerce InitiativesApart from strengthening grocery sales, Walmart has been striving to increase the sales of furniture and home décor products. To this end, the company launched a new online platform. The site will include a wide range of curated furniture collections to suit a variety of customer needs. Further, Walmart has been expanding in the e-commerce space through buyouts and strategic alliances.Recently, the company inked a deal with Rakuten — a leading Japanese e-commerce firm. Per the deal, the companies will collaborate to sell online groceries in Japan as well as e-books and audio books in the United States. Apart from this, Walmart’s buyouts of ShoeBuy, Moosejaw, Bonobos, ModCloth and Jet.com as well as deals with Lord and Taylor underscore the company’s plan to build an impressive digital brand portfolio.All said, Walmart’s constant expansion efforts and strong e-commerce business have made the stock a preferred pick for investors. Shares of this retail giant have soared almost 31.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s rally of 24.5%. Moreover, we expect that the company’s latest initiatives will widen its presence and offer improved services in the online realm. This will aid the company reach greater highs in the forthcoming periods.Wrapping It UpDriven by such efforts, Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales soared 23% in the fourth quarter, while the pace of e-commerce growth marked a slowdown from the previous quarter’s surge of 50%. Although this was a jolt to investors, it must be noted that Jet.com’s buyout boosted the company’s e-commerce sales in 2017, when it was acquired. A slowdown in e-commerce sales was witnessed in the fourth quarter, as the company factored in Jet.com's sales in the year-ago quarter.  Nevertheless, Walmart remains committed toward fortifying its e-commerce business to accelerate growth. The company’s efforts to enhance delivery services and expand product categories resonate well with its strategy of growing in the online space. We believe that such strategic endeavors will help Walmart offer multiple choices to online shoppers amid increasing competition.Looking for More Promising Bets?

915,DLTR,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), also known as AB InBev, is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 1. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 12.7%.In fact, AB InBev has been missing estimates for the last seven quarters. It recorded an average negative surprise of 28.4% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior this announcement.What to ExpectThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.10 per share, reflecting year-over-year growth of 155.8%. Moreover, the estimate has been stable in the last 30 days. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate total revenues of 14.5 billion, which reflects growth of 2.2% year over year. Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price and EPS Surprise  Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Quote Additionally, the AB InBev stock has been witnessing a downtrend lately, mainly due to the dismal performance. The stock has declined 7.2% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s 1.6% fall. This reflects that the market has been bearish on the stock in the recent past.  Factors at PlayAB InBev has put up a dismal show lately as it continues to battle soft volumes, higher cost of sales, adverse currency impacts and consumers’ changing preferences. Management believes that cost of sales will continue to rise, owing to the lingering currency woes and growth of premium brands. Management also anticipates that some of its core regions will remain volatile. These factors are likely to dent the company’s performance.Further, consumers’ shifting preference toward booming craft spirits in the United States might take a toll on the growth of the company’s Budweiser brand. Apparently, in the last quarter, Budweiser brand’s revenues fell 2.2%.However, AB InBev’s robust brand portfolio and solid geographical reach remain its major strength. Further, given the rising demand for craft beer space, we expect the company to benefit from its constant expansion in this category. Also, it keeps introducing near-beer alternatives along with no- and low-alcohol beers, which is encouraging.Though the expansion might take time, we believe that AB InBev will return to its growth trajectory backed by its strength of Budweiser brand and robust initiatives.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that AB InBev is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.AB InBev has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and a Zacks Rank #3.

916,DLTR,"Last week, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) suffered its worst day on Wall Street in more than 30 years, with shares plunging 10.2% on a single day after it reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter results, primarily because of slower e-commerce sales growth.Naturally, investors are concerned but the company is confident of bouncing back by doubling down on its investments in e-commerce and online grocery sales. Moreover, slower e-commerce sales growth was somewhat expected as this was also the first time that Jet.com sales in the year-ago period was included in e-commerce revenues. Hence, the picture isn’t as gloomy as it looks at first glance.Why Walmart Slipped UpThe most eye-catching development was Walmart’s e-commerce sales growth in the United States that slowed to 23% in the fourth quarter, marking a sharp decline from 50% in the prior quarter. This might have been viewed as a setback for investors but it’s too early to draw conclusions.Incidentally, what most people are overlooking is that last year’s results got a big boost because of its acquisition of Jet.com. Moreover, it was expected that growth would slow because Jet.com’s sales in the year-ago period was included in Walmart’s e-commerce revenues for the first time.That said, Walmart is hopeful of registering 40% growth in online sales this year, which should boost investors’ confidence. Moreover, the panic among investors is not a result of Walmart’s slower e-commerce sales growth but because of increasing competition from Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), which has in the last few years changed the entire retail ballgame by bridging the gap between traditional and online retail. How Amazon Has Changed the Retail GameThe biggest move in the brick-and-mortar space was made by Amazon when it acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in 2017. It slashed the prices of a number of products to enhance its online retail sales, which worked in its favor.The Whole Foods’ acquisition came within a year after Walmart decided to penetrate the e-commerce space with the $3.3 billion acquisition of Jet.com. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus providing it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart, Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report). Walmart has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Moreover, Amazon recently announced that it will offer free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods’ stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.Amazon certainly has established its dominance in the online retail space but the other players aren’t lagging either. Walmart continues to be the country’s largest grocer and is trying to tap this space by offering customers the option of ordering online and a free pick-up from the store. Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm. Interestingly, Walmart’s shares have increased 28.32% in the last year, while that of Target has risen 13.38%. Dollar Tree and Dollar General’s shares have increased 34.25% and 19.85%, respectively, in the last 12 months.Walmart Fights BackBesides registering slower-than-expected e-commerce sales, Walmart also acknowledged a few mistakes it made during the fourth quarter that negatively impacted its sales. One of these was an increase in TVs, toys and electronics in its warehouses that eliminated space for basic items during peak holiday sales.However, it’s not the end of the road for Walmart as it seems on track to boost its online sales. The company has plans of investing extensively in e-commerce this year, which is expected to drive organic sales by 40% in fiscal 2019. Since acquiring Jet.com, Walmart has spruced up its online services and increased the number of available items.Moreover, it has acquired brands such as Bonobos and ModCloth and intends to revamp its website with a focus on fashion. Also, Walmart recently launched a home shopping vertical on its website with a focus on furniture, accessories and other decorative items. The company is also making huge investments in training its employees.Beyond Brick and MortarOne of biggest strategic moves made by the company lately was to do away with “Stores” from its corporate name in order to give an impression to customers that it doesn’t want to restrict itself to a traditional brick and mortar company. Walmarts’ stores, however, give it an edge over Amazon, its biggest competitor. Keeping that in mind, the company is planning to double the locations offering grocery delivery, which is likely to boost sales.The biggest advantage for Walmart is that it is a lot larger than Amazon in terms of revenues. The company’s 2017 sales crossed $500 billion, making it three times bigger than Amazon. Moreover, while Walmart’s stock nosedived last week, it traded at an all-time high with a 12-month gain of more than 60% in late January just before the market entered correction territory.Not the End of the RoadThe sharp decline in the company’s shares might have made investors skeptical but Walmart has a lot of things going in its favor, with the Republican tax cut likely to help retailers save an astounding $175 billion, per the National Retail Federation (NRA). Moreover, the company is confident of registering 40% growth in online sales in fiscal 2019 with huge investments in e-commerce to include a re-launch of its website along with other initiatives.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

However, at least one retail industry—discount retail—actually seems to be better off these days.There are an array of reasons that off-priced sellers are bucking sector-wide trends, most of which relate directly to the socioeconomic background of their customers and physical retail locations.The discount retail uptick occurred even before the new Republican tax law was passed, but now analysts seem more confident in the sector based on these GOP-related headwinds.

918,DLTR,"While most sectors are in the last leg of the earnings season, the main show is left for the Retail-Wholesale sector, which occupies the top 13% (2 out of 16) position in the list of Zacks sectors. Per the report, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 9% and 7.3%, respectively, this earnings season.Gradual wage acceleration, a 17-year low unemployment rate and rising consumer sentiment are working in tandem for the sector. Additionally, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives.Further, an individual tax cut would pave way for higher disposable income, which may trigger demand for discretionary items.

922,DLTR,"Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this discount store retailer will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.While Dollar Tree delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter, the company has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 1.5% in the trailing four quarters. So let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Dollar Tree, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 87 cents, compared with 72 cents reported in the year-ago period. We note that the Zacks Consensus estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of roughly $5.2 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayWhile Dollar Tree’s bottom-line fell a penny short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last reported quarter, both top and bottom-lines improved year over year. In fact, Dollar Tree’s results have been witnessing year-over-year growth for quite some time now. The company has been gaining from its long- growth initiatives like store expansion and productivity enhancement, tapping of new markets and adding innovative sales channels to serve its patrons better.Further, the company is well on track with Family Dollar’s integration and is undertaking expansion efforts for both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar. The company’s strategic investments in technological advancements also reflect promise. Notably, these factors helped Dollar Tree to post its 37th straight quarter of comps improvement in the last reported quarter.However, sales in the last reported quarter were somewhat impacted by reduced SNAP benefits, which may hamper performance this time too. Also, top-line growth remains vulnerable to stiff competition from biggies, mainly on grounds of pricing. Further, management’s lowered earnings view for fiscal 2017 raises concerns.As for the second quarter, consolidated sales are projected in the range of $5.18-$5.28 billion, based on comps growth of range between slightly positive to low single-digit increase for the combined entity. While Dollar Tree’s shares have declined 5.5% in the last six months, it fared better than the industry’s 10.2% decline. All said, we prefer to wait and see what’s in store for Dollar Tree this time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dollar Tree is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Dollar Tree currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.29%.

923,DLTR,"U.S. retail sales fell for the second straight month in June, reflecting a scenario where consumers are reining in their spending. This casts a doubt over the expected rebound in the economy during the second half of 2017. The dismal sales report overshadowed steady job additions and gradual wage acceleration. Fed officials definitely have their eyes on the latest developments in the economy and the recent event may influence their future action plan. For now, soft retail sales may compel investors to revisit their portfolio.The Commerce Department stated that U.S. retail and food services sales in June declined 0.2% to $473.5 billion – following a revised reading of 0.1% decrease registered in May – as people curtailed their spending on clothes and spent less at gasoline stations, department stores and restaurants. However, retail sales increased 2.8% from Jun 2016.The report states that sales at clothing & clothing accessories stores declined 0.1%, while receipts at gasoline stations fell 1.3%. Sales at food & beverage stores dropped 0.4%. Department store sales decreased 0.7% and were down 3.9% from the prior-year period. Sales at non-store retailers, however, inched up 0.4% in June and increased 9.2% from the prior-year period.The abovementioned data strongly suggests that consumer spending, which plays a pivotal role in driving the economy, lost momentum. The Fed, which raised the benchmark interest rate in June for the second time in 2017, will certainly consider the retail sales report while contemplating an interest rate hike.Current Retail LandscapeThe Retail-Wholesale sector, which is at the bottom 6% of the Zacks Sector Rank (15 out of 16), has been undergoing a fundamental change. With a digital transformation in shopping and consumers splurging online, store and mall traffic has been hit hard. As a result, most retailers, including big-box, are struggling to compete with e-commerce channels and are being forced to trim their store count to focus more on an online model.Nevertheless, the sector still holds some promise, given the favorable economic indicators. We note that so far in the year, the sector has registered an increase of 15.1% compared with the S&P 500 that has risen roughly 10%. The rebound in oil prices from all-time lows, decelerating unemployment rate, and a gradual improvement in the housing market signal that the economy is on a recovery mode. These factors are playing a crucial role in raising consumers’ confidence that rose to 118.9 in June from May’s reading of 117.6.Strategies to Counter the ChallengesThe multiple challenges in the sector, as mentioned above, have compelled retailers to reconsider their strategies. They are now focusing more on enhancing their omni-channel capabilities, optimizing store fleet and restructuring activities.Retailers are efficiently allocating a large chunk of their capital toward a multi-channel growth strategy focused on improving merchandise offerings, developing IT infrastructure to enhance the web and mobile experience of customers, renovating stores, developing fulfillment centers to enable speedy delivery, implementing an enterprise-wide inventory management system as well as enhancing their relationship with existing and new customers.The Children's Place, Inc. (PLCE  -  Free Report), Best Buy Co., Inc. (BBY  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), Staples, Inc. , Macy's, Inc. (M  -  Free Report) and other renowned retailers are trying all means to reach their target customers.Zacks RankAmong the aforementioned stocks, The Children's Place and Best Buy sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while the remaining stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

924,DLTR,"The recent volatility in the Wall Street rattled even the most ardent of investors, who started taking stock of their portfolio, overlooking the impressive earnings display by corporates for a while.

The earnings season is in full swing, with results from more than 340 S&P 500 members out by now. But the main highlight of the show is yet to come for the Retail-Wholesale sector.How Is the Sector Faring?The Retail-Wholesale sector, which currently occupies the top 6% (1 out of 16) position in the list of 16 Zacks sectors, has advanced approximately 27% in a year and comfortably outperformed the S&P 500’s growth of roughly 14%. Moreover, according to the latest Earnings Trends, the sector is expected to record top and bottom-line growth of 8.9% and 7.2%, respectively, this earnings season.Favorable economic indicators along with friendlier fiscal and regulatory policies from the current regime bode well for the sector. Industry experts are of the opinion that gradual wage acceleration, a 17-year low unemployment rate and rising consumer confidence are enough to trigger consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.For obvious reasons, retailers are the end gainers. Moreover, National Retail Federation’s recent projection of an uptick in U.S. retail sales of 3.8-4.4% this year raises optimism. In addition, the recent cut in corporate tax rate will allow retailers to channelize the surplus money toward best possible alternatives. They may opt for a dividend hike or reduce debt load, or even create a corpus to fund acquisitions, otherwise invest in omni-channel capabilities, product launches and other innovations.Picking the Probable Winners This SeasonWe used the Zacks methodology and identified retail stocks that not only boast solid fundamentals but are also poised to beat estimates this earnings season.

Candy makers will draw around $1.8 billion this year.However, this year, cocoa – the key ingredient of chocolate – is a boring bet from an investing point of view.

926,DLTR,"Groceries, until recently an insular market in the fiercely competitive retail zone, may see a radical shift in the days to come. The landscape is seeing a rapid change, with more players jumping on the offline bandwagon. The latest move in this space comes from Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), which is offering free, two-hour delivery from Whole Foods stores to its Prime members in four cities — Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach.  This is perhaps the beginning of a battle that will only intensify in the days and months to come.  The move comes within a year of the e-commerce giant’s $13.7-billion acquisition of supermarket chain Whole Foods. Customers in Austin, Dallas, Cincinnati and Virginia Beach can now order fresh produce, meat, seafood, flowers and other items that their local Whole Foods stores stock.Such a move was expected by Amazon given that it has specific plans of exploring and adding novelty to the untapped online groceries market, and the Whole Foods acquisition was a giant leap toward this direction. Needless to say, this will most likely set alarm bells ringing for brick-and-mortar grocers that so long rested assured of business safety.Consumer Focus Route to Success That said, besides sparking fear among the traditional brick-and-mortar stores, the two-hour free delivery service has been introduced keeping in mind customer demands. Consumers look for convenience and good bargains and Amazon is focusing on both. Per a Walker Sands survey, 40% would buy groceries online if they were less expensive and 23% would for it if it were more convenient. The Whole Foods acquisition was certainly a strategic move by Amazon and perhaps the best option, as most of its other technology-driven food delivery initiatives such as Amazon Go have faltered. The acquisition immediately gave Amazon access to Whole Foods’ 450 stores across the United States, thus giving it enough power to compete with brick-and-mortar giants like Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report), Target (TGT  -  Free Report), Dollar Tree (DLTR  -  Free Report) and Dollar General (DG  -  Free Report). Target has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In doing so, the first step taken by the e-commerce behemoth was to slash prices of avocados, eggs, fruits, fish and prepared food by as much as 50%. Now, its two-hour, free-delivery service is only going to heat up competition for brick-and-mortar grocers. The idea is to lure more customers on the convenience quotient.According to David J. Livingston, a supermarket analyst for DJL Research, people generally buy the same groceries every week. And the biggest question in their mind is if they really need to go and spend an hour at Walmart or Giant for that.Grocery War at Its HeightWhile Amazon is clearing thinking big and taking bold steps, the likes of Walmart, Dollar Tree and Dollar General too are going the online way, thus creating a perfect setup for an intense war in the groceries space. According to NPD Group, about 7% of U.S. households bought groceries online last year. Among them, most prefer their orders delivered to their doors, while the rest pick up from the store. While Walmart, the country’s largest grocer is leaving no stone unturned to tap this area by offering customers the option to order online and a free pick-up from the store, Target brought online grocery-delivery company Shift to add muscle to it online delivery arm.However, Amazon seems to be playing to its strength — a strong delivery wing. The company will pull items from Whole Foods stores, bag them but get the goods delivered by its own drivers. Moreover, it is all free and within two-hours. That certainly is a big challenge for those that are trying to go the online way. More in StoreUnderstandably, there is a lot more that can be expected from retail giants in the near future. Walmart has already entered into a partnership with Japan’s Rakuten to sell e-books in the United States and strengthen its online grocery business in the Asian nation. Amazon’s move may have just ignited a fierce competition that’s only going to flare up. However, the others too seem very much in the race.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

928,DLTR,"Thanksgiving is just round the corner, marking the start of a busy period for retail stocks. While Thanksgiving is the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season, Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is one of the busiest shopping days of the year.According to a survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics last week, about 164 million people or 69% of Americans plan to shop over the weekend which includes Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, Small Business Saturday and Sunday as well as Cyber Monday. Both online and brick-and-mortar stores provide competitive offers and discounts during this period to attract customers.Black Friday is expected to be the busiest day this weekend with about 115 million people planning to shop this day. While 71 million people plan to shop on Saturday, Cyber Monday is expected to see about 78 million shoppers. With just 2% of consumers having completed their holiday shopping, Black Friday will be a very important day for e-commerce stocks and retailers with many companies reporting their highest profits on this day. The holiday season gives retailers the opportunity to improve traffic and bring in the numbers through promotions, early-store openings, heavy discounts, as well as free shipping on online purchases. People queuing up outside stores from the wee hours to take advantage of attractive deals and offers including early bird discounts is not an uncommon sight during this period.Retailers are gearing up for the holiday season with companies like Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report) announcing the hiring of additional team members for the peak holiday season. Target has introduced Weekend Deals this year featuring marquee prices on new items every weekend based on what customers are looking for at different times throughout the season. The company also said it would be offering some of its lowest prices of the year during big events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Companies like Kohl’s Corporation (KSS  -  Free Report) and Amazon have also announced their Black Friday deals.Low household debt burdens, growing consumer confidence, lower personal savings and higher income generation bode well for the upcoming holiday season.

929,DLTR,"Hibbett Sports Inc. (HIBB  -  Free Report) reported top and bottom-line beat in third-quarter fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s third straight quarter of bottom-line beat. Moreover, the company reversed its trend of having missed sales estimates in nine of the past 10 quarters. Following the robust quarter, the company substantially raised guidance for fiscal 2018.This led the shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock to rally 15.2% on Nov 17. Further, Hibbett has gained 57.6% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s 0.2% upside.Q3 HighlightsHibbett reported earnings of 37 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents. However, results compared unfavorably with earnings of 66 cents per share reported in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decline in the bottom line can be attributable to lower margins and higher expenses.Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Hibbett Sports, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hibbett Sports, Inc. QuoteNet sales inched up 0.4% to $237.8 million, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $218 million. Results were driven by improvement in the company’s footwear and apparel businesses, alongside strong e-commerce sales, which now accounts for nearly 5% of total sales. E-commerce sales mainly gained from the company’s early marketing plan and strong conversion from online traffic. Additionally, its ongoing marketing initiatives boosted sales by improving traffic and loyalty members, as well as site navigation strength and product assortments.However, comparable-store sales (comps) fell 1.3% driven by declines in August and September comps, offset by growth in October.Hibbett’s gross profit fell 9.2% to $76.1 million, while gross margin contracted 337 basis points (bps) to 32%. The decline in margin was due to increased promotions and markdowns related to clearing of excess and aged inventory, along with higher freight costs incurred for store-to-home and e-commerce shipments. Operating income of $11.8 million declined 49.1% from $23.2 million in the year-ago quarter. This can be attributed to lower gross margin as well as higher SG&A expenses due to increased marketing expenses related to the launch of e-commerce business. However, this was partly offset by lower logistics and store occupancy expenses.Other Financial AspectsHibbett ended the quarter with nearly $58.3 million in cash and cash equivalents, no outstanding bank debt and full availability under its $80 million revolving credit facility. Total shareholders’ investment, as of Oct 28, was roughly $318.4 million.The company’s capital expenditure was $4.5 million in the quarter toward omni-channel initiatives, persistent investments in new and existing stores as well as other projects to improve business. Further, Hibbett repurchased 1.2 million shares worth $15.9 million during the quarter. As of Oct 28, the company had roughly $213 million remaining under its standing share repurchase authorization.Store UpdateIn third-quarter fiscal 2018, Hibbett introduced 13 new stores, expanded one high-performing store and shut down 11 underperforming ones. As a result, it ended the quarter with 1,082 stores across 35 states. In the long run, Hibbett targets taking its store count to 1,500.OutlookFollowing the robust third quarter, management raised fiscal 2018 earnings guidance and adjusted comps view. The company now anticipates comps decline in the mid-single-digit range, compared with the prior guidance of negative mid to high-single digits. Further, the company now envisions earnings for fiscal 2018 in the range of $1.42-$1.50 per share, up significantly from the previous forecast of $1.25-$1.35.Key PicksBetter-ranked stocks in the retail space include Big Lots Inc.

931,DLTR,"Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report) has been riding on robust strategies, impressive comparable store-sales (comps) growth and a solid earnings surprise history. Moreover, the company has made multiple changes to its business model, to resonate well with the intensely competitive retail landscape.The company started business as a coat-focused off-price retailer, and is now focusing on “open to buy” off-price model. In fact, the current model is aiding customers to get nationally branded, fashionable, high quality and fair priced products. Also, over the years, the company has increased vendor counts, made technological advancements, initiated better marketing approach and focused on localized assortments.Additionally, the company’s focus on store expansion to drive top-line growth remains noteworthy. Management now intends to focus more on categories such as home, beauty and ladies apparel. It also believes that there is room to increase the store count to 1,000, over the long term.These strategic endeavors are quite well reflected in the company’s performance. Impressively, it delivered 16th straight quarter of a positive earnings surprise, when the company reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Moreover, the bottom line has shown constant improvement in the past several quarters. The company has been doing quite well on the revenue front as well. The company’s top line has outpaced the estimates in five out of the trailing seven quarters and also shown constant improvement over the past few quarters.The company now envisions fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.23-$4.27 per share compared with $3.24 reported in the prior year. For the fourth quarter, earnings are expected to come within the range of $2.02-$2.06 per share compared with $1.78 reported in the prior-year period. Burlington Stores forecasts total sales increase of 11-12%, including 5% from the 53rd week for the fourth quarter. Full-year sales are expected to increase in the band of 8.1-8.4%, including 1.4% from the 53rd week during fiscal 2017.Driven by consistent changes in the business model, comps have witnessed constant growth in the last few years. Apparently, it increased 4.5%, 2.1%, 4.9%, 4.7% and 1.2% in fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Impressively, the momentum has entered the current fiscal as well. The comps increased 0.5%, 3.5% and 3.1%, respectively, in the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2017. Management now projects comps growth of 2-3% for the final quarter, resulting in comps increase of 2.3-2.6% for fiscal 2017.Apart from Burlington Stores, retailers like Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report), Dollar General Corporation (DG  -  Free Report) and Big Lots, Inc.

932,DLTR,"A surge of 11% in 13 days! Yes, that’s how the stock of Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) has impressed. Ever since this discount store retailer released second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, it has been scaling up the charts. In fact, Dollar Tree has been in the green territory for a while now, as evident from the last three months performance. The company has gained 9.3%, against the industry’s 4.1% decline.So, let’s see what’s been driving this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, and if the growth drivers can help the company maintain its momentum amid a tough retail space.Solid Q2 Leads to a Raised ViewDollar Tree posted robust financial numbers in second-quarter fiscal 2017, wherein both the top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, the bottom line also surpassed the higher end of the company’s predicted range. Results were driven by continued strength in comps, along with margin expansion that was aided by reduced merchandise and freight expenses, and lower markdowns. Apart from strong performance by Dollar Tree’s stores, results also gained from the growth of the company’s online business, Dollar Tree Direct.Further, the company remains confident of its overall second-half performance. Thus, management now forecasts net sales for fiscal 2017 (which will contain an additional week) in the band of $22.07-$22.28 billion, compared with the old projection of $21.95-$22.25 billion. Earnings per share is expected in the range of $4.44-$4.60, compared with the previous forecast of $4.17-$4.43. Well, estimates for the third quarter and fiscal 2017 have gone up by 4 cents and 21 cents to 89 cents and $4.66 respectively, following the splendid outcome.Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and Consensus  Dollar Tree, Inc. Price and Consensus | Dollar Tree, Inc. QuoteSturdy Comps — a Major Driving FactorDollar Tree witnessed remarkable comparable-store sales (comps) growth, backed by its competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. The company continued with the positive trend in second-quarter fiscal 2017 that marked Dollar Tree’s 38th straight quarter of comps growth. The second-quarter comps growth was backed by improved transaction count, as well as average ticket. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in a low single-digit range for the third quarter and fiscal 2017.Integration of Family Dollar & Strategic Plans on TrackThe mega-merger of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar has been benefiting the former ever since the deal was concluded in July 2015. Notably, sales from the Family Dollar banner represented over 50% of the company’s consolidated sales in the second quarter. Further, Dollar Tree is undertaking significant store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar to attract more customers. While the increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company’s results for some time, it expects to generate annual run-rate synergies worth $300 million by the end of the third year of this buyout.Apart from this, we believe that the company is progressing well with its growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve patrons better. Also, we remain confident that the company will continue to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion to boost top-line performance.Can These Hurdles be Offset?Management stated that it expects store payroll expenses to remain pressurised on account of the elevating minimum wages. We believe that this could raise the SG&A costs and hurt the operating margin. Also, stiff competition from other industry players and the growing online presence thanks to Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) rising dominance remains a threat for Dollar Tree.Nevertheless, like most retailers Dollar Tree is also trying all means to stay afloat amid a challenging retail landscape. So, for now we suggest holding on to this Chesapeake, VA-based company and see if its considerable endeavours can help it sustain its bull run.Can’t Get Over Retail?

935,DLTR,"Dollar Tree Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report) seems to be gaining traction since the past one month, after the decline witnessed following the dismal earnings report in May and soft fiscal 2017 view. Notably, the stock recovered to decline only 5.7% in the last one month compared with the 10.8% fall recorded in the last three months.Further, the Chesapeake, VA-based discount store retailer has outperformed the Zacks categorized Retail – Discount Stores industry’s fall of 9.9% in the last one month. Though Dollar Tree is yet to take flight, let’s take a close look at some factors that have aided recovery.Robust Comps PerformanceDollar Tree has displayed remarkable comparable-store sales (comps) growth driven by its competitive pricing and strategic store expansion plans, including remodeling and relocations. The company’s positive comps trend continued in first-quarter fiscal 2017, which marked its 37th straight quarter of comps growth. The first-quarter comps growth was backed by improved transaction count and average ticket. Moreover, the company anticipates comps growth in the range of slightly positive to low-single digit increase in the second quarter and fiscal 2017.Strategic Growth InitiativesFurther, we believe the company is on track with its long-term growth initiatives, which include store expansion strategies, enhancement of store productivity, creating new store formats, tapping of new markets and incorporating innovative sales channels to serve patrons better. Further, the company continues to implement strategies such as increasing consumables mix, rolling out freezers/coolers at stores along with multi-price point expansion, aimed at boosting top-line performance. Additionally, it is focusing on imported goods, supply chain efficiency and aggressive cost cuts to improve operating margin.Store Expansion StrategyRegarding stores, the company leverages an extensive network of stores to effectively penetrate targeted markets, enabling it to generate healthy sales and gain market share. During first-quarter fiscal 2017, the company opened 164 new stores and expanded or relocated 51 stores. With this, the company remains on track to operate over 10,000 Dollar Tree and over 15,000 Family Dollar outlets across the U.S.Family Dollar IntegrationThe company is also well on track with Family Dollar’s integration, which it had acquired in Jul 2015. The company is set to undertake store renovation initiatives for Family Dollar in the second quarter, which is likely to attract more customers. While the increased costs and cannibalization during the integration and re-banner process are expected to weigh on the company’s results for some time, it anticipates generating annual run rate synergies worth at least $300 million by the end of the third year of this acquisition.In fact, on completion of the integration, Dollar Tree is on track to become a mega U.S. discount retailer that can counter competition single handedly from retail bellwethers in the dollar-discount store segment. Further, the company will be well poised to reach out to more value-seeking consumers through a network spanning vast geographies. It will not only offer broader and multiple assortments at more compelling prices, but also will be better positioned to negotiate with suppliers which will enhance purchasing power.DeterrentsDollar Tree’s earnings missed our estimate in the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2017, after posting back-to-back surprises in the last two. Though sales improved year over year, it was somewhat impacted by delay in tax refunds and cycling of reduced SNAP benefits from last year. Moreover, management cut  fiscal 2017 earnings view.Notably, reduction in SNAP benefits has been a concern for Dollar Tree for a while now, and with chances of President Trump’s proposed food stamp cut getting passed, the situation could get worse. Trump has suggested reducing food stamps program by $193 billion, which is approximately 25% of the budget for the program. Cut in SNAP benefits is likely to hamper Dollar Tree’s performance, as people with low income will have less money to spend and could restrict their spending to low margin products.Bottom LineThough the company’s near-term performance is likely to be troubled, its long-term initiatives and the Family Dollar integration provide a positive outlook for the future. With these initiatives on the cards, we believe the company can surely overcome these near term hurdles.Aptly, Dollar Tree currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Investors looking for growth may, however, consider placing bets on Target Corp. (TGT  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), as well as Dollar General Corp. (DG  -  Free Report) and Ross Stores Inc. (ROST  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Target has a long-term EPS growth rate of 5.4%. Moreover, the stock has seen positive estimate revisions in the last 60 days and has to its credit an average positive surprise of 16.5% in the trailing four quarters.Dollar General, with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.6%, has grown 2.1% in the last three months.Ross Stores, with long-term EPS growth rate of 10.5%, has witnessed positive estimate revisions in the last 60 days.

936,DLTR,"There is a long list of popular averages and ranges that investors like to use while looking at stocks, and that includes the 52-week low and 52-week high metrics. It’s great to find stocks right before they surge towards new highs, but it can be difficult for some to establish a new and consistent range.With that said, investors typically become interested in stocks as they breach 52-week highs because that momentum can oftentimes continue until a new range is established. If a stock is strong in a variety of key categories, it certainly can keep climbing well above that old 52-week high, and we can find those strong stocks using our Zacks methods.Here at Zacks, we place an emphasis on earnings-related data, especially earnings estimate revision activity, and this can definitely be applied to stocks approaching their 52-week highs. One way to ensure continued upward momentum is solid earnings momentum, so we can use the proven Zacks Rank system to identify companies that are impressing in this regard.Using this strategy, we have found five stocks that are seeing positive estimate revision activity and are hovering near their 52-week highs. Check them out now:1.       Target Corporation (TGT  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $77.90 / 52-Week High: $77.91After surpassing earnings estimates by five cents in its most recent quarter, Target witnessed several positive estimate revisions for its upcoming quarters. In fact, our consensus estimate for its upcoming fiscal year has gained more than $1.00 over the past 60 days. Meanwhile, shares have climbed roughly 25% in just 12 weeks. The stock is taking off like a rocket on the back of an improved outlook, and investors will not want to miss the gains that could come if Target can post another strong quarter. 2.       Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $62.22 / 52-Week High: $62.79Food distribution giant Sysco is experiencing strong momentum in the wake of its tenth-consecutive quarter or matching or surpassing earnings estimates. Shares of the company have soared about 14% over the past 12 weeks, lifting the stock toward the 52-week high it is hovering at today. But earnings estimates are improving for the current quarter and next quarter, so shares should keep climbing as Sysco’s outlook improves. Our consensus estimates are calling for the company’s bottom line to improve by 12% and 22%, respectively, over the next two quarters. 3.       CBOE Holdings, Inc. (CBOE  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $132.91 / 52-Week High: $133.31Earnings estimates are moving higher for both the current and next fiscal year for CBOE, an options exchange based in Chicago. This revision activity has been a driving force for the stock, which has now gained more than 20% over the last 12 weeks. Still, impressive top and bottom line growth in the current quarter should inspire even stronger momentum, and a rising rate environment over the next few years should help that momentum continue into the long term. 4.       Dollar Tree, Inc. (DLTR  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $112.90 / 52-Week High: $115.89Much has been made about the death of brick-and-mortar retail, but times have perhaps never been better for discount retailers like Dollar Tree. The company is riding high after two solid earnings beats, and the stock has moved more than 23% over the past 12 weeks. Meanwhile, our consensus estimate for Dollar Tree’s upcoming fiscal year earnings has gained a whopping 60 cents within the past 60 days. The company’s bottom line outlook is improving significantly, and investors will hope that this improvement inspires continued momentum. 5.       FedEx Corporation (FDX  -  Free Report)Prior Close: $272.25 / 52-Week High: $273.16Shipping behemoth FedEx is bouncing back strongly after a concerning down period. The company beat our consensus earnings estimate by more than 10% in the most recent quarter, and shares have soared more than 20% within the past 12 weeks. That surge has lifted FedEx to these 52-week high levels, but the stock should break higher soon on the back of its improved earnings outlook. Our consensus estimates are soaring thanks to a tidal wave of positive revisions, so investors should be able to capitalize soon. Bottom LineAll of these stocks are quickly approaching their 52-week highs, and that means they should be on your radar. Each stock is also sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) based on its strong earnings-related data, including recent positive estimate revisions. While there are no guarantees on the stock market, these five companies definitely appear to be well-equipped to establish new ranges soon.Want more analysis from this author?

Quarterly sales of $960 million topped the $933 million expected, representing 3% growth from a year ago. Although comps were down 2%, improved strength in the Asia-Pacific region and moving more wholesale diamonds helped Tiffany’s in the quarter.

Sales of $5.28 billion topped the Zacks consensus by $50 million in the quarter, up 5.7% year over year. Same-store sales of 2.4% represent a combination 3.9% growth in Dollar Tree stores and 1% growth in Family Dollar.

Bottom line losses of 23 cents per share was much improved from the -34 cents expected. Revenues of $779.3 million outpaced the $761.6 million we had been looking for. This is the first quarter in the last five where Abercrombie has actually topped earnings estimates.Jobless Claims Remain StrongStaying squarely within the 225-250K range of Initial Jobless Claims claims last week, a new read of 234K is a modest bump-up from the unrevised 232K from the previous week. Continuing claims of 1.954 million is also roughly unched for the week. While jobs growth has certainly moderated from levels we had been seeing over the past couple years, company layoffs and corporations moving offshore have been occurring less often of late, helping keep Americans relatively gainfully employed.Jackson Hole CommencesFor the next two days, Fed presidents and other monetary authorities gather to discuss global economic policies in light of Eurozone growth (European Central Bank [ECB] President Mario Draghi is scheduled to attend for the first time in 3 years) and adjustments in China and elsewhere in Asia.
