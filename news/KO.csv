Bloomberg News reported that Mnuchin prevailed in a debate on whether to invoke a 1977 law that blocks China from acquiring U.S. tech companies.Trump's economic team is split between a protectionist camp and a free-trade camp. Trade advisor Peter Navarro and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross represent the protectionists, while Mnuchin and economic advisor Larry Kudlow are generally regarded as in the free-trade camp.The stock market appears to favor the free-trade contingent, but conflicting signals within the administration has made the situation difficult for bulls.In the blue chip Dow this morning, Coca-Cola (KO) scored a 1% gain in fast turnover.

1,KO,"Kraft Heinz  (KHC) reportedly is interested in buying Campbell Soup (CPB), which is mulling strategic options as packaged-food giants struggle. Rivals such as General Mills (GIS) also could want to take a bite of the soup and snack giant.Campbell Soup stock jumped 9.4% to close at 42.23, and Kraft Heinz stock edged up 0.2% to 63.32 in the stock market today. General Mills stock added 1.8%. All three packaged-food stocks are still trading near multiyear lows.A Kraft-Campbell deal could boost Warren Buffett's exposure to the ailing packaged-food industry. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is a major shareholder of Kraft Heinz, which believes the soup and snack maker will likely put itself up for sale soon, sources told the New York Post.Campbell Soup said in May it was reviewing all aspects of its strategic plans and expects to discuss the outcome in August. CEO Denise Morrison abruptly resigned last month as Campbell Soup cut earnings guidance. The company has not yet named a permanent replacement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSoup giant Campbell looked for growth with purchases such as Bolthouse Farm juices, Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies. But its $6.1 billion buyout of Snyder's-Lance came just as the packaged-food industry slumped.The company's bleak full-year forecast pummeled the stock in May, ultimately taking a toll on the reign of its seven-year chief executive.The B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.15% to undercut the May low of 188.62.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO), another consumer products giant in which Berkshire holds a notable stake, rose 0.8%.Kraft Heinz arose through a 2015 merger of food giants Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz.Buffett owned 500 million shares of Heinz before the merger, while his investment partner, 3G Capital, owned a similar stake in Heinz. Buffett now owns 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz, valued at $20.3 billion as of March.Initially, Kraft Heinz stock rallied as the new owners boosted profits despite flat-to-falling sales by cutting costs. But like a ketchup bottle running low, cost-squeezing efforts seem to have run their course. Meanwhile, traditional branded food companies are facing multiple headwinds. They're struggling to appeal to changing consumer tastes toward organic and natural foods. Meanwhile, grocery sellers are stepping up house brands, with more attractive packaging and quality. Food companies also have cut marketing spending to boost short-term profit, but at the risk of losing long-term brand exposure.Kraft Heinz may see a Campbell Soup deal as a way to wring out more costs. Kraft in 2017 made a bid for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (UN), which rebuffed the offer.Buffett reportedly remains optimistic about companies that sell consumer packaged goods. Both Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola are top-five stock holdings in his widely followed investment portfolio.

2,KO,"Consumer staples have been slumping lately, and key exchange traded funds tracking the sector are down from 6% to 13% this year, through Tuesday's close.So what's the culprit? One of the key reasons: higher interest rates. The 10-year Treasury is now yielding about 3.08%, up sharply from around 2.4% at the beginning of the year. That makes bonds more attractive than dividends.Consumer staples stocks are considered a defensive play because people need these products no matter how the economy is doing, and the companies often offer steady dividends. When bond yields are low, dividend stocks look more compelling. But when bond yields rise, dividend stocks can look less attractive.Add to the sector's woes are a stronger dollar and weaker emerging-markets currencies, where consumer staples giants like Procter & Gamble (PG) and Colgate-Palmolive (CL) generate a sizable percentage of sales.

3,KO,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the stock market and how does the stock market work? Essentially, it's a marketplace that allows you to buy parts of publicly traded companies, making you a shareholder. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are the two world's largest stock exchanges, and the market's health is gauged by three indexes: the Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500. Sometimes the simplest questions are the most difficult to ask. And that's certainly the case when it comes to cluelessness about the stock market, and what it actually is. The stock market is like a supermarket where you can purchase a part of any company you like, as long as it is publicly traded.But it might be more akin to a medieval market, where the price of a good, in this case a share, is worth what a buyer will pay for it. So when demand is high, the market forces drive the price higher. When demand is low and many people are trying to sell, the price declines.A share is one of the equal parts into which a company is divided. In essence, you can own a part of any public entity you like. This means you can own a part of your favorite company, whether that's Disney (DIS), Coca-Cola (KO), or even the well-oiled world of the WWE (WWE). Many of the big beasts of tech are also publicly traded, including Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB).However, not all companies choose to become publicly traded. Candy giant Mars and ride-sharing service Uber, for example, are household names that are private corporations, which means they don't make parts of themselves available to buy on the stock market.When you ask yourself, ""what is the stock market,"" you may envision the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. In the United States there are a number of stock markets, and the NYSE, which is the world's largest, is one of them. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is the globe's second largest.There are also a number of major stock markets around the world, including Britain's London Stock Exchange, which traces its roots back to 1571, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Japan. Other leading stock exchanges are in Shanghai, Hong Kong, Paris and Frankfurt.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn contrast to every stock photo of Wall Street you've ever seen, most stock trading today is done electronically by supercomputers in New Jersey spitting out algorithms. So while men in oversized blue jackets on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange might dominate your Google Images searches, computers dominate trading activity.In fact, JPMorgan reportedly estimates that human traders now account for only 10% of daily stock-trading activity.But how does the stock market work in setting prices? Share prices are determined by the bid and the ask. The bid is the highest amount a buyer is willing to pay for an asset. Conversely, the ask is the lowest price a seller is willing to accept to sell. The difference between the two prices is the bid-ask spread, which affects the price at which a stock buy or sale occurs.The health of the U.S. stock market is gauged by the activity of a trio of indexes, or compilations of stocks, organized by certain criteria, whose overall value is calculated into a single number. Those three indexes are:But what is the stock market's effect on the economy, and how does the stock market work to actually hit pocketbooks? The health of the stock market isn't the same as the health of the overall economy.In general, what happens on Wall Street isn't a direct gauge of what is happening on Main Street, or what experts often call the ""real economy.""But given that half of U.S. households own stock, a steep rise or drop in markets could affect household confidence and actual spending or investment.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:How To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For BeginnersWhat Is The Dow Jones Industrial Average And What Does It Measure?What Is The SEC?

Prices reversed higher, with Brent crude up 1.6% to $74.25 per barrel and West Texas intermediate rising 1.3% and trading above $66 a barrel. Prices rose despite reports that Iran had softened its opposition to an agreement to increase production, making a boost in oil supply more likely.Much like the central banks that stimulated their economies through buying bonds and holding down interest rates, OPEC and Russia agreed in November 2016 to reduce oil output to bolster glut-weakened oil prices. The strategy was effective and, like the central banks that have gradually tapered their stimulus programs, OPEC appears set to release the cap on its production.How quickly they might do that is the question global energy and financial markets are asking. An analyst quoted by the Houston Chronicle said that a production increase of less than 500,000 barrels a day would be bullish for the oil market.  The Saudis have recommended a 600,000-barrel-per-day boost.

23,KO,"After a stunning 2017 during which the stock market pretty much went straight up, the last six weeks have been an unkind reminder that volatility is a natural part of the market, which can cause investors a lot of anxiety.If you're re-evaluating your risk tolerance and looking for investments to help you sleep better at night, you might want to look at low volatility ETFs, a group of funds that seek to offer a smoother ride during choppy waters.People buy these funds for risk mitigation when the market falls, by providing downside protection. Your losses should be much less than the broader market's during a decline. But of course, in return for less risk, you give up some profits when the market rallies.Since its May 2011 inception, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) has outperformed the S&P 500 in each of its 20 largest weekly declines — including the February correction, according to the company.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe $7.1 billion fund seeks to capture 75% of the upside and fall only 45% on the downside over market cycles. Not day-to-day, or week-to-week, but over a three- to five-year time horizon, says Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at PowerShares by Invesco.The fund does this by investing in the least risky stocks in the S&P 500. It holds the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past year and rebalances every quarter. The biggest sector weights in the portfolio include 22% in utilities, 20% in financials and 17% in industrials. Among its top holdings: Coca-Cola (KO), PepsiCo (PEP) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). Last year, SPLV returned 17.3% vs. the S&P 500's 21.8%. On a five-year annualized basis, the fund returned 11.9% vs. the S&P 500's 14.3%, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF charges a 0.25% expense ratio.""We get the best of low volatility by examining it on the Sharpe ratio basis. What is my return, per my unit of risk that I'm taking?"" said Kalivas. ""If you're an investor who wants equity return without great volatility, that is essentially where the low volatility strategy will shine.""For people who want a little more risk and closer tracking of the S&P 500, PowerShares S&P 500 Quality Portfolio (SPHQ) seeks to capture 97% of the upside of the index and 75% of the downside. It holds what it considers the 100 highest quality stocks in the benchmark. These stocks have the strongest balance sheets, highest return on equity, and lowest leverage determined by debt to equity. The $1.4 billion fund rates them according to those traits and rebalances twice a year.""The idea is to pick stocks that can weather difficult economic times,"" said Kalivas. ""Like the low volatility fund, it will lag when the market rises a lot and outperform when it falls.""SPHQ's portfolio contains 24% in information technology, 23% in industrials, 15% in health care and 14% in consumer staples. Top holdings include Visa (V), MasterCard (MA) and Boeing (BA). It earned 19.1% last year and a five-year annualized return of 14.3%. The expense ratio is 0.29%.""We like both of them in terms of reducing risk,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research. ""They go about it in different manners. SPHQ has no exposure to utilities and greater exposure to more economically sensitive sectors.""""These products haven't been tested in a severe market downturn like 2008,"" said Alex Bryan, Morningstar's director of passive strategies research, North America. ""While the downside capture has been pretty low, around 50%, I wouldn't expect that to always be the case in a more severe downturn.""Bryan says he likes iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor (QUAL) because it takes a sector-relative approach to stock selection and is cheaper at 0.15%. The $4.6 billion fund eliminates unintended sector bias or bets on certain sectors, he says, ""(and) I like it because it hasn't changed its benchmark as many times as the PowerShares ETF has changed its benchmark."" QUAL posted a 22.3% return last year and a three-year annualized return of 12.8%.For low volatility, Bryan recommends iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA (USMV). He said it uses a more complex methodology, as well as a holistic approach to construct the least volatile portfolio possible under a certain set of constraints for the sector weightings. The $14.6 billion fund's biggest sector weights include 21% in information technology, 17% in health care, and 13% in consumer staples. It returned 18.91% last year and a five-year annualized return of 13%. USMV carries a 0.15% expense ratio.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Blockchain Expands Beyond Bitcoin To Amazon, Nvidia, AlibabaIs Your Portfolio Ready To Handle Increased Market Volatility?Which Sectors Does Market Pro Expect To Outperform This Year?

29,KO,"U.S. stock indexes sauntered to small gains midday Friday, with only small caps holding a losing hand for the week. Volume was running higher on the NYSE but flat on the Nasdaq.X The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 added 0.3% and 0.1%, respectively, while the Dow Jones industrial average sagged 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000, which was on track for a loss for the week, rose 0.8%.Breakouts midday Friday in strong volume included Signature Bank (SBNY), up 3% in volume 78% above average, and Lions Gate Entertainment (LGFA), up 3% in volume 330% greater than usual. Lions Gate has been rallying on word that the company is in buyout talks.Investors also might want to monitor stocks that are either in buy zones or close to buy points. For example, despite rising 25% last year and 5% year to date, the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average still has some potential buy opportunities.Stocks in their 5% buy zones include Goldman Sachs (GS), 3M (MMM), Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and DowDuPont (DWDP).Dow stocks in bases and not far from potential buy points include Coca-Cola (KO) and Travelers Companies (TRV).Of the above seven Dow stocks, four are expected to accelerate earnings growth in 2018. The four are Apple, Travelers, DowDuPont and Coca-Cola. Each has a base that is either first or second stage.As a stock advances, it pauses to consolidate. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later stages.The base count is one reason why Apple may have more left as an investment. Also, Apple grew earnings 11% in fiscal 2017 ended in September, and the Street expects growth to pick up to 24% in fiscal 2018. While the 24% growth may be priced into the stock, earnings surprises offer the potential for additional thrust.Meanwhile, among IBD's 197 industry groups, three groups have shown uncommon strength this week.Over the past five sessions, the chip equipment group jumped 7% (think of stocks such as Applied Materials (AMAT)), while the commercial document group popped 4% (think label company Multi-Color (LABL)) and the hotel segment rose 3% (think La Quinta (LQ)).

This topped the consensus view for 46 cents a share.Biotech stock Amgen (AMGN) glided above a 191.20 buy point in volume 39% above average. Amgen will report Q4 and 2017 full-year results Feb. 1.

Leaders are generally acting well, big corporate tax cuts should continue to power earnings in 2018, while low interest rates could spur more M&A activity and a healthy IPO market.But it's important not to be too complacent, especially amid plenty of bullish sentiment in the market.

It advanced 7% from an early September bounce off the line to its Dec. 4 intraday high. SPLV was featured in this ETF column, which was published Sept. 27.The fund, which launched in May 2011, has gathered $7.5 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which comprises the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the past 12 months. The index also has the ability to respond dynamically to market conditions. So unlike some other low volatility indexes, it can move into better-performing sectors when deemed necessary.Financials account for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 21% of assets. Utilities make up about 20%, industrials 19%, and information technology and consumer staples roughly 10% each.

You can learn how at IBD University.Buffett tends to own some big dividend payers. For instance, Coca-Cola yields an annualized 3.2%, P&G offers 3.1%. SPLV's 12-month dividend is just north of 2%, above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout. And it has a dividend growth rate of 7% vs. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)'s 12%.SPLV is up 0.2% this year through Jan. 10, lagging the S&P 500's 2.9% gain. Its average annual returns of 10.2% and 13.6% over the past three and five years also slightly trail the benchmark index, which returned a respective 12.7% and 15.7%.Generally, SPLV tends to perform better if the stock market declines and low-volatility stocks fall less than growth stocks. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Thursday's pick, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), hit a new high but remains in a buy zone from a 42.69 flat-base entry.

55,KO,"You're looking for dividend stocks to invest in as a source of steady income, so how much emphasis should you put on fundamentals? A lot.X That's because if you want steady income you want to own the best dividend stocks — companies that offer above-market yields and a solid earnings and stock price track record to boot.And if that's the case, IBD's The Income Investor column can help. Each day on Investors.com and every week in IBD Weekly, the column features one or more companies that meet those criteria and have the potential to rise in price. That puts these stocks in more of the growth-and-income camp vs. simply, income.Why is it important to pay attention to earnings, yield and other factors? If a company hits a tough patch or its profits falter, that could hurt its ability to keep making those payouts.Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksTop Dividend Fund Manager Expects Growth In These Three SectorsHow Growth Stocks Can Yield Solid Income TooWhat Does Trump Tax Cut Mean For Dividends?General Electric (GE) provides a recent example. Shares dived 13% over two sessions after the diversified giant halved its prized dividends and lowered its outlook for 2018. The dividend cut was a shock to investors who've been relying on it for income. Its yield before the fall: 4.7%. The stock fell to its lowest levels in nearly six years. At the predividend cut annual payout of 96 cents a share, the stock's $13 decline this year offset the payouts earned over the past 13 years.GE's earnings have been volatile the past few years. They fell sharply in 2014 and 2015, increased last year and are expected to fall 8% this year.That's why a steady earnings track record is key, as is dividend growth rate. Most income investors would likely prefer to see a company raise its dividend rate, instead of reducing or keeping it the same.In addition to the daily column, you'll find three accompanying screens online and on The Income Investor page in the weekly edition. The Dividend, Utility and REIT Leaders offer other stocks that meet the same criteria as companies featured in the column, while the mini charts above the lists provide further details about six of those stocks. The mini charts appear only in the print edition.To access the dividend screens at Investors.com, go to the home page and click on the Stock Lists tab.The broadest screen is Dividend Leaders, featuring names such as Blackstone Group (BX). It's paid out a total of $2.32 per share in the past four quarters (or $2,303 per 1,000 shares). With the stock trading at 31.49, that amounts to a 7.35% annualized dividend yield. Plus the company sports a 24% dividend growth rate. Shares are up 18% this year, in line with the S&P 500, which yields just 1.91%. Blackstone is not your grandfather's dividend stock.A few other standout names on the list in terms of YTD price gains are Cisco Systems (CSCO), Toronto Dominion Bank (TD) and AbbVie (ABBV).But Steady Eddie names known for a steady earnings track record and dependable dividends like Coca-Cola (KO) and Chevron (CVX) often make the cut, too. Both stocks are S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, companies that have increased their dividends for at least the past 25 consecutive years.Utility Leaders show utility stocks, which are known for their defensive nature. They tend to hold up well when growth stocks are weakening. Their reliable revenue streams also enable most utilities to pay a steady dividend.IBD'S TAKE: Cisco has outperformed the broader market this year, but how does it rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.Like utilities, real estate investment trusts (REITs) offer a relative safe haven in a volatile market. REITs are structured in a way that allows them to avoid paying corporate taxes if they pass the bulk of their earnings through to shareholders. Since that's done in the form of cash dividends, many income investors favor REITs. Though not immune to a slowing economy, these companies enjoy a fairy stable revenue stream via rent payments and lease proceeds from buildings or other real estate assets they own and operate.That said, keep in mind that utilities and REITs can also fall sharply if the stock market enters a steep slide. For instance, the Dow utility average dropped 45% during the 2008-09 bear market. In such severe corrections, it's important to cut stock losses and raise cash.The three screens offer plenty of dividend stock ideas that have to meet certain fundamental and technical criteria. From there, investors can conduct further due diligence to narrow down their choices.Subscribers to MarketSmith, a sister company to IBD, have access to a proprietary metric: Earnings Stability. This metric is calculated using a company's quarterly per-share earnings over the past three to five years. The resulting number runs on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable).The accompanying table shows stocks with a dividend yield of 2% or higher and an Earnings Stability of 4 or lower. In general, a number below 25 is considered stable.

Tesla has turned in annual losses in seven of the past nine years.

IBD advises buying either the No. 1 or the No. 2 stock in a group, which in this case is Ferrari (RACE) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU).Ferrari grew earnings 46% in 2016, and the Street expects 31% EPS growth this year. Fiat Chrysler cranked up earnings growth 52% in 2016 and analysts expect 49% growth in 2017.In the IBD 50, a list of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, advancing issues led declining issues by a 4-to-3 ratio.

58,KO,"Stock wrestled to a positive finish Wednesday, overcoming an energy sector meltdown brought on by multiple global factors.The Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 climbed 0.2% apiece. The Nasdaq surged 0.4%, as NetEase (NTES), JD.com (JD) and American Airlines (AAL) led the Nasdaq 100 with gains of more than 2% each. Apple (AAPL) and the FANG stocks also had their say, with Apple up 0.6% and Amazon.com (AMZN) rising 0.7%.Preliminary data showed volume mixed, higher on the NYSE, lower on the Nasdaq, than end-of-day trade on Tuesday.In a day of whirling global news and events, oil took center stage as a Platt's survey outlined a surprise production increase of more than a quarter-million barrels per day by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, followed by a weekly inventories report from the Energy Information Administration that showed a 3.3 million-barrel increase in U.S. supplies. That number was almost 8 million barrels above the American Petroleum Institute's estimate released Tuesday, which showed a 4.6 million decrease during the same week. That estimate had helped send oil prices up nearly 2% on Tuesday.Oil was already being closely watched early Wednesday, as tensions rose in the Persian Gulf where Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain had effectively blockaded Qatar, and after reports of multiple armed attacks on official buildings in Tehran, Iran, that reportedly left at least 12 dead. News reports said the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the Tehran attacks.As a result, U.S.-based oil benchmarks led the declines, with West Texas Intermediate crude ending down nearly 5% to below $46 a barrel, its lowest mark since early May.On the stock market, oil-related groups took six of the session's 10 worst losses among industries. Drilling, U.S. E&P and field services were hardest hit.Airlines had one of the day's best performances, with Hawaiian Holdings (HA) surging 12% to break out above a 56.25 buy point. The owner of Hawaiian Airlines reported stronger-than-expected passenger traffic in May. Brazil-based Gol Intelligent Airlines (GOL) jumped 5% in weak trade.Oil plays took nine of the 10 hardest falls among S&P 500 stocks. Newfield Exploration (NFX) and Helmerich & Payne (HP) each fell about 6%. Also among those tumbles was beer-maker Molson Brewing (TAP), which tanked 6.5%.Near the top of the list, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) swung up more than 3% in moderate trade. The move was enough to clear a 62.08 flat-base buy point, but volume was only 20% above average – not enough to qualify as a breakout. Volume can sometimes kick in a day or two after a stock passes a buy point, confirming a breakout after the fact.Nike (NKE), UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and American Express (AXP) were among the Dow industrials to rise 1% or more. UnitedHealth hiked its quarterly dividend to 75 cents a share and Morgan Stanley initiated coverage on the stock with an overweight rating and a 202 price target.Coca-Cola (KO) dropped to the bottom of the list, down 1%, pressured by a downgrade from BMO Capital Markets to market perform from outperform.China-based stocks posted a strong session, with NetEase leading the Nasdaq 100 with a 3% gain in powerful trade. Standpoint Research trimmed the stock's rating to reduce, from buy, but also upped its price target to 360 from 345.On the IBD 50 list, New Oriental Education & Technology (EDU) and TAL Education (TAL) led, up 9% and 5% respectively. New Oriental remained extended and working on its eighth-straight weekly gain.

64,KO,"Stock indexes initially cranked up the intensity of selling Wednesday, but then regained much of the lost ground.The Nasdaq was down 0.3% midday after sinking 1% in the first 10 minutes of trade. The S&P 50 and the Dow Jones industrial average stumbled 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. The small-cap Russell 2000 shaved off 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE and lower on the Nasdaq vs. the previous session.Blue chips were mostly down, with declining issues leading advancers by an almost 4-1 ratio. In the 30-component Dow Jones industrial average, Caterpillar (CAT) took the hardest hit, down 2% in heavy volume. General Electric (GE) held the biggest gain in the Dow, up 1.3%, but that means little in the context of GE's 12% drop so far this week.Quality growth stocks also struggled. Apple (AAPL) and three of the FANG stocks — Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet (GOOGL) — were down. Facebook (FB) was slightly up.So-called ""quality"" value stocks weren't doing much if any better. Four of the five biggest holdings in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway fund were down. The losers included Wells Fargo (WFC), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Apple and Coca-Cola (KO). The only gainer in Buffett's top five was Bank of America (BAC), up about 2% in heavy volume as the money center bounced off its 50-day moving average line.On Tuesday, Berkshire reported its Q3 holdings. The fund added shares in Apple and Bank of America, while reducing exposure in IBM (IBM). Big Blue was down 1% Wednesday and struggling near its 50-day line. The stock is 19% off its high.For IBM bulls, the stock pays a tempting dividend. The current annualized dividend yield is 4%. IBM has increased its dividend for 22 straight years. Dividend increases are usually declared in April.Dividend investors were having their own problems Wednesday. The Dow Jones utility average fell 0.7%.Where is the place to hide in this market?Apart from those with profit cushions that allow them to sit through this minor turbulence, the day's three top gainers among 197 industry groups were retail apparel, meat and utility water suppliers.

68,KO,"Energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) reported mixed third-quarter results Wednesday after the market close.Estimates: Earnings per share growth of 21% to 40 cents, on revenue of $901 million, a 14% pop.Results: EPS rose to just 38 cents. Net sales rose 15% to $909.5 million.Stock: Monster Beverage fell 5.5% to 54.80 in after-hours trading, suggesting the stock will undercut a flat-base 57.35 entry. During the regular session, shares closed up 0.1% at 58 in the stock market today.Wall Street will likely be looking for signs indicating whether the company can keep growing internationally. Results in the U.S. could also be a focus as that segment laps easy comparisons.Monster's biggest growth prospects lie outside the U.S., analysts say, in large part through the expanded access to Coca-Cola's (KO) bottling and distribution network that the company gained via a deal announced in 2014.The company earlier this year began distributing through Coca-Cola bottlers in parts of the Caribbean and in nations like Jordan and Pakistan. In August, Monster said it would expand in Africa and that it continued to ""make progress"" toward a relaunch in India planned for this year.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said she'd be watching for updates on those regions as well as plans to begin distribution via Coca-Cola bottlers in Taiwan and Vietnam. Trends surrounding Mutant, an ultra-caffeinated response to PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew, and Hydro, an ultra-caffeinated response to water, are also points of interest.Monster's results also come as soda demand wanes amid a wellness boom. Cannabis also appears likely to grow as a rival to alcohol and caffeine in the beverage industry. Some companies already use THC and CBD in coffees, teas and sports drinks. Cowen cites ""emerging access to legal cannabis"" as an investment risk for Monster.IBD'S TAKE: Even as investors in the cannabis industry try to get in on the ground floor, investing in the space in the U.S. can be tricky.Some alcohol companies have begun to stir as marijuana-related startups proliferate. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ) late last month announced plans to buy a portion of a Canadian marijuana company Canopy Growth. Molson Coors (TAP) said last week it had a team in place to gauge the ""potential impacts and/or the opportunities"" of cannabis.Constellation Brands rose 1%.

70,KO,"Over the last three months, the top-performing mutual funds have continued to pick up shares in chip stocks like Applied Materials (AMAT) and Intel (INTC), as well as in building-related companies, including Thor Industries (THO), Pulte Group (PHM) and Stanley Black & Decker (SWK).XWith an eye toward the growth of industrial output, leading fund managers also invested in five chemical companies, including DowDuPont (DWDP), Sherwin-Williams (SHW) and plastics manufacturer Rogers (ROG).Fifty-one leading mutual funds also took a nearly $128 million gulp of energy drink leader Monster Beverage (MNST), which cleared a 57.35 buy point on, quite appropriately, Halloween.  The Coca-Cola (KO) partner is trading 1% above the entry, meaning it's still in the buy zone, which extends to 60.22.Monster sports a B+ Accumulation/Distribution Rating and five quarters of rising fund ownership. The maker of Monster Rehab and other drink brands is set to report Q3 earnings on Nov. 8, with analysts expecting 21% EPS growth. Note that it's risky to buy any stock just before it reports.DowDuPont received the biggest investment of any stock on the list, as 73 funds purchased $16.7 billion worth of shares. But that number is skewed by the merger of Dow Chemical Co. and E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. that was just completed in September to create the new entity. The chemical giant's market cap stands at just over $88 billion, and the stock has eased back into the buy zone after become extended from a breakout in September.Forty-two funds invested just over $1.7 billion in leading chip stock Intel, which broke out on Oct. 2, then soared over 7% on Oct. 27 after reporting third-quarter earnings. Intel is now about 22% above the initial buy point.UnitedHealth (UNH) was the only other company to join the billion-dollar club, with 67 funds investing $1.2 billion.  The megacap managed-care stock has continued to climb since a breakout in March 2016, clearly boosted by seven quarters of rising fund ownership.Semiconductor stocks like IBD 50 members Applied Materials and Lam Research (LRCX) have been on a tear since the beginning of 2016, but it's a cyclical industry, so investors should be ready to lock in gains if the stocks begin to show topping action.In addition to Applied Materials, Lam Research, IBD Big Cap 20 stock Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel, six more semiconductor-related companies made this month's list, a sign that institutional investors are continuing to put their chips on the table, so to speak. Time will tell if, in the short term, that turns out to be a good bet.Applied Materials is 19% above its recent 47.69 buy point in a later-stage cup with handle, putting just below a potential profit-taking zone. Lam Research is already in the 20% - 25% profit-taking area.Banking giant JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and automaker General Motors (GM) topped the list of new sells this month. JPMorgan showed 42 net sellers (89 selling minus 47 buying), while GM had 29 (43 selling, 14 buying).Megacap medical stock Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) came in third, with 24 net sellers (68 selling, 44 buying).Despite the selling, Johnson & Johnson is still within buy range after retaking a 137.18 entry on Oct. 17 after reporting a 13% rise in Q3 earnings.JPMorgan has continued to climb beyond a 95.32 buy point, but after reporting earnings on Oct. 24, General Motors has been giving back a chunk of the 25%-plus gains it made from a breakout in September.

72,KO,"On any given morning, you could smooth out your Pinzon Egyptian cotton sheets before tossing on a Goodthreads poplin dress shirt, Franklin Tailored sharkskin-gray suit and a pair of Franklin & Freeman penny loafers. Breakfast might be a bowl of 365 Everyday Value organic quick oats and Wickedly Prime dry-roasted almonds with a cup of Happy Belly organic Fair Trade coffee, as you lean back into your Strathwood chaise lounge.XDespite not bearing Amazon's (AMZN) signature arched arrow, they're all part of an army of more than 30 private labels that belong to the increasingly ubiquitous e-commerce behemoth, a bounty waiting to be innocently discovered online as modern shoppers ditch old-school name brands and seek out stuff that's cool but cheap.Meanwhile, Wal-Mart (WMT), Target (TGT) and other Amazon rivals also have been rushing out new, re-imagined house brands, as a flurry of private-label innovation and a shift in consumer habits challenge the value of a traditional name brand. For chains that find the right balance between their own labels and outside ones, long-moribund shares could see life again. But while private labels have been hiding in plain sight for decades, the current surge could deliver another jolt to the retail sector, if national brands lose ground and prices fall further.""With the advent of Amazon and the 'everything store,' you can pretty much get a national brand that you want, anywhere,"" said Kantar Retail analyst Tiffany Hogan. ""So I think we're seeing another swell in private-label development, being used less as a fill-in strategy, which is how many of them probably started,"" and more of an offensive play.It's already a massive business for supermarkets, drug chains and mass-merchandise stores, with sales hitting a record high of $118.4 billion in 2015, according to the Private Label Manufacturers Association. And so far in 2017, private-label manufacturing sourcing has grown 26% vs. the prior-year period, according to ThomasNet data, with notable pops in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.Today, what might have once prompted mockery at a school cafeteria is emerging from a makeover. Back in the day, store brands were meant to emulate well-known national names, offering what was perceived as a lower quality but cheaper option, rather than a distinct alternative on par with the bigger brands. Instead of red-and-white soda cans plastered with knockoff-style logos, there are now a lot more products like Whole Foods' 365 brand cola, proudly crafted with pure cane sugar and filtered carbonated water.For a retailer, owning a brand means margins are higher, prices are more competitive, and customers can't get the products anywhere else. At Amazon alone, the private-label market represents a $1 billion gross-profit opportunity, Morgan Stanley has estimated. Plus, there's greater control over product creation and speed to market, said Hogan.And companies are taking advantage of that control, crafting unique images meant to resonate with consumers' hearts and not just their wallets.""I am not a person who has or probably would ever get a tattoo, but if I were going to get one, I would want it to be the design on our coffee bag,"" says Liza Landsman, president of Jet.com, the e-commerce player acquired last year by Wal-Mart. ""I just think it's really beautiful.""She's talking about the creature on the cover of one of Jet.com's newly launched Uniquely J in-house products, an intricately inked Peruvian tiger. And it's not hard to see why: It looks more like a hipster's sleeve tattoo than a coffee container.Uniquely J's slim-but-growing collection of 50 or so items — salsa, avocado oil, sandwich bags, toilet paper — don't all sport edgy tigers. Some have cartoon bears and walruses. All are aimed at consumers of the ""metro-millennial lifestyle,"" and mark a pivot from the private-label game plan of old.""Over the last few years, the attitude toward private label among consumers has really evolved, and I think that's in response to the fact that it's not your father's private label anymore, that so much innovation and product and packaging and design is happening in that space that there (are) ample opportunities to bring really interesting offerings to market,"" said Landsman.Attitudes were much different in the early 1980s. Back then, high-end designer Halston inked a billion-dollar deal to create a lower-priced version of its apparel for J.C. Penney (JCP). But brand dilution was so frowned upon back then that Bergdorf Goodman expelled the Halston brand altogether from its upscale stores.In the 1990s, Target launched brands like Archer Farms and teamed up with architect Michael Graves for an exclusive designer partnership. Those efforts, plus in-house brands like Merona and Mossimo, which are now being retired, were better received and earned Target a devoted following among shoppers looking for reasonably fashionable but affordable items.""That was cool,"" said Jim Holbrook, CEO of private-label retail services firm Daymon. ""It was exclusive, you could only get it at Target; it was well designed, and at an affordable price. And to me that was sort of the advent of the differentiating strategy.""Target now wants to win back customers who knew and loved the ""Tar-zhay"" of yesteryear. It's in the process of debuting no fewer than a dozen brands, all either clothes or furnishing, including A New Day (womenswear), Goodfellow (menswear), Project 62 (home décor), Joylab (athleisure) and Hearth and Hand with Magnolia, a home and lifestyle label created in conjunction with HGTV stars Chip and Joanna Gaines.They hope to replicate the success of Cat & Jack, the company's shining example of what a good private label can accomplish. The cheery, on-trend kids clothing raked in $2 billion just in its first year, a remarkable feat for a debut in a home and apparel category that brings in $26 billion annually for Target — over a third of its total revenue.""Target kind of lost their way for a couple years, but (CEO) Brian Cornell's done a great job refocusing them on kids' apparel, home and launching of all these"" private-label brands, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough of Target's chief, who took the helm in 2014.And Macy's (M) — which has a well-regarded stable of 20 or so exclusives like the Martha Stewart Collection — plans to grow its private and exclusive brands to 40% from 29% of the business by 2020, saying they help stem store traffic losses at its department stores.But Kohl's (KSS) recent private-label venture offers a warning. The department store had pushed its private labels but upset the balance between major brands and in-house offerings, weighing on sales. That showed management that national brands still matter, Yarbrough said. The department store has since focused more in the other direction, partnering with Under Armour (UAA), for instance.""Now, the risk is, for some retailers, you don't want to go too far,"" he said.In other words, shoppers like a healthy smattering of unique store brands, so long as they can still find household names like Nike (NKE) or Coca-Cola (KO) on shelves.For 20- and 30-somethings who came of age during the Great Recession, however, brands may matter even less than ever, amid their existential hunt for authenticity and uniqueness.The online store Brandless, for example, is a curated selection of groceries, household and personal care items that sell for a straightforward $3 apiece but come without what the startup's CEO, Tina Sharkey, has termed the ""Brand Tax,"" i.e. marketing costs and the ""false narrative of cartoon characters and actors"" on packaging.Brandless doesn't sell any Starbucks. Instead, it offers a chocolate-colored bag of organic, fair-trade cold brew, simply labeled ""Cold Brew Coffee Bag."" Other items are similar. No Kleenex, just ""Facial Tissue."" No Chapstick, only ""Lip Balm.""They could be mistaken for cheap generics, but the company proudly touts merchandise that is carefully sourced and ""non-GMO, sometimes organic, fair trade, kosher, gluten-free, no added sugar and more.""""I think people would tell you that millennials are exponentially more open to buying brands they didn't grow up with and trying things that speak to their values, are affordable, are not wedded to things that were necessarily at their table for years,"" said Sharkey. ""So I think there's a huge openness (to new brands) and openness to private label.""Therein lies a challenge to companies' exclusive offerings, however. Modern millennial shoppers aren't brand loyal, so they're game to skip big-name labels in favor of private brands. But companies are banking on the hope that their unique products will cultivate some modicum of loyalty, or at least one or two return trips.Loyalty is what Amazon knows well as it tries to lure more subscribers to its Prime ecosystem with its own house brands, which includes a number of womenswear lines, not to mention its popular Amazon Basics and Amazon Essentials for tchotchkes around the house.Of Amazon's estimated 34 private-label brands, 19 are clothing collections. That there's an industrywide rise in interest in store-brand apparel manufacturing comes as no surprise to ThomasNet CEO Tony Uphoff, who pointed to store closures at Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch and the decline of traditional brands.But success, even for Amazon, is not guaranteed. Paris Sunday, its fashion-forward casual line of dresses and other clothes, is reportedly being phased out, according to a recent WWD story.Still, it's early days, and as department stores are waning in influence, Amazon's access to massive amounts of data means it wields gargantuan power.""Way back in the day, it would take several months to figure out what a trend was and what people wanted and analyze the data,"" said Daymon CEO Holbrook. ""And then the data got more available with point of sales scanner data and loyalty card data, so that would take several weeks. And now, Amazon's true competitive advantage is they know, real time, minute by minute, what people want.""In the first half of 2017, the young women's apparel line, Lark & Ro, made an estimated $1.9 million for Amazon — chump change — but AmazonBasics has become a $210 million business, according to 1010data estimates.And sales of Amazon's in-house children's apparel, Scout & Ro, grew fivefold over that same time frame, said the research firm.""The brick-and-mortar retailers who get good at marketing and good at telling those stories and get good at the human touch, I think, can beat Amazon,"" said Holbrook.

74,KO,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow Jones industrial average were 0.15%-0.3% above fair value early Tuesday. That follows Monday's gains of more than 1% for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq composite and Dow industrials, all closing well within 1% of all-time intraday highs.XApple (AAPL), as the most valuable company and largest component of all three major averages, will have a lot to say about whether they do set new record levels Tuesday as the tech titan unveils its latest iPhone models. But don't forget about fellow Dow and S&P 500 stocks Microsoft (MSFT), McDonald's (MCD) and Coca-Cola (KO), which all moved into buy zones on Monday.All three Dow buys have notable dividends. Microsoft has a dividend yield of 2.1% and a 15% dividend growth rate. McDonald's has a 2.4% yield and a 6% growth rate. Coca-Cola boasts a 3.2% yield and an 8% growth rate. Apple lags with a 1.6% dividend yield but its growth rate is a robust 24%.Apple will unveil its latest iPhone handsets on Tuesday at an event starting at 10 a.m. PT. The tech titan reportedly will release an iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus and an iPhone X. That top-of-the-line iPhone X reportedly will have an OLED screen, facial recognition and other new features.One key question is when the iPhone will actually go on the market and if supplies will be extremely low for an extended period, especially for the iPhone X. Production problems for the newest iPhones have been widespread. Another issue is whether Apple can revive sales in China after several quarters of declining demand in the world's largest smartphone market as people there favor lower-priced domestic handsets.Apple shares rose 1.8% to 161.50 in Monday stock market trading after falling 3.3% last week. The stock is still in buy range from a 156.75 flat-base buy point. Apple climbed 0.9% to 162.91 before Tuesday's open.Keep in mind that Apple shares have tended to fall, modestly, on iPhone unveiling days and weeks as investors sell the news, so to speak.Microsoft rose just over 1% to 74.76 on Monday, nudging back above a 74.52 flat base-on-base formation initially cleared on Aug. 31. Microsoft has gradually but steadily advanced over the past year, mildly outperforming the S&P 500 index.  Microsoft is benefiting from big gains in cloud computing.McDonald's rose 1.1% to 161.53, closing above a 160.08 entry from a short flat base and notching a new record high. It's the first proper base for McDonald's since clearing a big cup-with-handle consolidation in early April.McDonald's has outperformed its restaurant peers thanks to menu changes, rapidly expanding delivery options and hopes for an upcoming mobile order-and-pay app.Coca-Cola edged up 0.5% to 46.52, closing right on a flat-base buy point and setting a two-year high.Coca-Cola has had several quarters of declining earnings and revenue. With soft-drink volumes steadily declining for the industry for years, it's hard to see Coke as a growth play going forward.RELATED:The Big Picture: Broad Rally Spurs Several New BreakoutsApple Stock Not Likely To Get Lift From iPhone Launch EventWatch These 5 Hot Apple Chip Stocks Before The Big iPhone RevealIncome Investor: How To Sift For Strength Among The Blue ChipsFast Food Makes Its Biggest Change Since The Drive-Thru Window

75,KO,"The battle for tax reform has begun. In a Wednesday night speech, President Trump called for a rewrite of the tax code. How this campaign plays out is anyone's guess today.How this might impact you and your retirement savings? One outcome could cost you plenty by ending the tax break that you now enjoy on contributions to a regular 401(k) account. Now, you get a tax deduction on that money and it is not counted as part of your taxable income.But those benefits would end if Congress changes 401(k) rules so that your contributions do count as part of your taxable income. It would do that to pay for other tax cuts. On Wednesday, Trump spoke at length about his desire for corporate tax cuts. He spoke fleetingly of personal tax cuts.In the bigger war over tax reform, one of many tax rules that Congress may battle over involves one of the pillars of retirement planning for millions of Americans, the tax deduction that workers receive when they put part of their pay into a 401(k) plan account. ""Many people in the retirement savings business are concerned that one way Congress might choose to pay for certain tax cuts is by eliminating the upfront tax break on contributions to 401(k) accounts,"" said Dennis Simmons, executive director of the Committee on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets (CIEBA). CIEBA's members are the chief investment officers and other managers of large pension and 401(k)-style retirement plans.Such a change could take the form of Rothifying 401(k) accounts — that is, forcing all 401(k) accounts to function the way only Roth 401(k)s and Roth IRAs do now. Contributions to regular 401(k) accounts would no longer escape being taxed as ordinary income.In regular 401(k) accounts and IRAs now, workers get tax deductions on their contributions. Those contributions are not counted as part of their taxable income for the year. That's why they are known as pretax contributions.In contrast, contributions to Roth 401(k) accounts and to Roth IRAs are after-tax contributions. They are not excluded from your taxable income calculation.Also unlike traditional 401(k) accounts and IRAs, money you withdraw from Roth accounts is tax-free after five years and you reach age 59-1/2.One thing that works the same with either type of retirement account: earnings that stay inside either regular or Roth 401(k)s or IRAs grow without being taxed.Converting all 401(k) accounts to Roth rules would recapture a lot of tax revenue that advocates of such a move call lost. A report by the U.S. House and Senate's Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that 401(k)-style retirement plans will cost the government $583.6 billion between 2016 and 2020.Recapturing that would help pay for tax cuts elsewhere. CIEBA's Simmons says that singling out those $583.6 billion would be unfair. ""They're not 'lost' taxes,"" he said. ""Workers do pay taxes on those contributions once they withdraw the money in retirement.""In contrast, funds from tax breaks such as the deductibility of mortgage interest payments and of state and local taxes are truly lost forever to the U.S. Treasury.Members of CIEBA, which represents retirement plan interests before Congress, regulators and the media, cited in a survey several downsides to Rothification of 401(k) plans. One is that it probably will lead many workers to stop contributing to their accounts. A whopping 78% said that would be likely. ""The upfront tax benefits are a big reason why many plan participants contribute,"" Simmons said. ""Without those benefits, many participants would not see sufficient reason to participate.""Rothification would also force employers to go through a costly and time consuming re-education effort. Eighty-two percent of CIEBA members said the new communications would be difficult.""There's a danger that many small companies would stop offering 401(k) plans altogether,"" Simmons said.And 96% said workers in their plans would view such a change negatively.Seventy-four percent of CIEBA members offer Roth options in their 401(k) plans already. But on average only 10% of plan members bother to use them. ""That shows limited interest in Roth accounts,"" Simmons said.The bottom line? ""This (Rothification) change would have a materially adverse impact on savings. The complexity (for both plan sponsors and members) would be pretty extreme. It would be throwing a bomb into a system that, with auto-enrollment, works well today.""RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeWhat's The Stock Market Doing Now?Are You A Newcomer To Stock Investing Who Wants A Few Pointers?

VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) dropped 1.2% and 0.9%, respectively.When it comes to stocks, do you prefer high or low volatility? Two plays that are at the opposite ends of the volatility spectrum are curiously near buy points. Which will win?PowerShares S&P 500 High Beta (SPHB) climbed past a 38.93 flat-base buy point early Wednesday, after trading between 35 and 39 for much of the past 10 months. After an 18% run from a November bounce off the 50-day moving average, the fund cleared a flat base in mid-February and edged higher before forming the current pattern.The 6-year-old fund, which tracks the S&P 500 High Beta Index, has gathered $152.9 million in assets. It invests in the 100 highest beta (or most volatile relative to the S&P 500) stocks in the S&P 500, which can lead to bigger swings in the fund's returns vs. the broader market.Industrials accounted for the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25, at nearly 24% of assets. Financials, at 23%, was next; information technology and energy weighed in with a respective 18% and 11%. Top holdings included construction gear provider United Rentals (URI), metal ores miner Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) and chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).SPHB has lagged the S&P 500 this year through Sept. 26, according to Morningstar Direct, with a 7.2% year-to-date return vs. 13.2% for the benchmark index. Its average annual return of 15% over the past five years, however, leads the S&P 500's 14% gain. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Advanced Micro Devices is a big chip designer, but how do its fundamentals and technicals rank in its industry group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.SPHB has a Relative Strength Rating of 62, higher than the 51 RS of its counterpart that was launched the same day: PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV). The $7 billion fund, which tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, provides exposure to large-cap stocks with — you guessed it — low volatility. Shares are near a 45.79 flat-base buy point initially cleared Sept. 11.SPLV was featured in this ETF column July 13 as it found support at its 50-day line. It climbed 3% from the support line to a Sept. 12 intraday high. Before that, shares rose 5% from a May bounce off the 50-day.SPLV takes the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks and weights them so those with the lowest volatility get the biggest weighting. Financials made up the biggest sector weighting as of Sept. 25 at 21%; industrials were at 18%, utilities at 17% and consumer staples at 12.5%. Information technology represented 11%. Top names included Republic Services (RSG), Coca-Cola (KO) and Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).The fund has returned 12% YTD and averaged a 12.9% annual return over the past five years. It also bears a 0.25% expense ratio.SPHB is likely to outperform if the market takes off on the wings of high-beta growth stocks. SPLV is likely to do better if the stock market heads lower and low-volatility stocks fall less than high-octane growth stocks.Tuesday's picks, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU), gave up some ground along with gold prices. Both held above their respective 50-day lines.RELATED:Apple Leads Dow; FANG Gains Fade; Did Gold Flash A Buy Signal?Apple, Techs Weigh On Stocks; Bitcoin Jumps; Time To Buy Gold?What An ETF For Extreme Stock Market Bulls Is Saying About Investors

78,KO,"The $2 billion AB Discovery Growth Fund (CHCLX) is in a strong rebound, shaking off a tough 2016, thanks to leading stocks like Grubhub (GRUB), up 44% so far this year; Align Technology (ALGN), up 95%; and Planet Fitness (PLNT), up 31%.XThe fund's 22.65% gain over the 12 months going into Wednesday outperformed 88% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct and the S&P 500's 19.63%. That was a big step up from calendar 2016's 4.78% return, which beat only 45% of its peers and was less than half the S&P 500's 11.96% advance.Last year and even in much of 2014 and 2015, many investors were driven by skittishness mostly into value-oriented stocks and defensive names, says lead manager Bruce Aronow. ""Those were strong performers,"" Aronow said. ""But they tend not to be strongly represented in the (AB Discovery Growth) portfolio.""This year the market has rotated back into the types of growth names Aronow and his teammates prefer. And stocks they like have more room to run, Aronow says. ""Valuations of companies in the profile we look for, being out of favor before, are quite compelling now,"" Aronow said. ""Even with strong performance year to date, they are still at a discount to their long-term average.""The fund's other managers are N. Kumar Kirpalani, Samantha Lau and Wen-Tse Tseng.Diversification is another key aspect of the managers' overall approach. And the managers limit their sector weightings to plus or minus 800 basis points of their bench mark's. ""Over time, we're usually within half of that range,"" Aronow said.He added, ""Idiosyncratic stock performance is more important to us than sector allocation. We are bottom-up investors. By constraining sector bets, we don't give back outperformance by individual stocks.""The fund's four biggest sectors are packed in a tight range from weightings of 23% for producer durables to 17% for health care. Technology is the third-largest sector, at 19%.The fund began to buy its current stake in Grubhub in January. ""We believe this is a winner-take-most opportunity,"" Aronow said. ""The network with the most choices will attract the most diners. Restaurants will favor the network with the most diners.""Earnings per share grew 45% and 13% the past two quarters. Aronow does not mind the slowdown. ""They're the leader in online ordering. They've been investing to solidify their position. We're fine with that. It solidifies their opportunity to sustain high levels of growth for a long time.""Aronow gives a thumbs up to investments like Grubhub's acquisition of rival Foodler and its even more recent partnerships with Yelp and Groupon. In addition, the low consumer penetration of food-delivery services gives Grubhub a long runway, Aronow says.Grubhub is also on Leaderboard — IBD's premium service that spotlights play-by-play of top stocks.Align Technology is the No. 1 rated stock in IBD's Medical-Products industry group thanks to such traits as a highest-possible 99 Composite Rating from IBD and an expected 46% increase in EPS this year.IBD'S TAKE: You can compare Align Technology's other technical and fundamental strengths with its rivals' at IBD's easy-to-use Stock Checkup tool.Align makes transparent orthodontic tooth aligners. Consumers usually pay out-of-pocket for the devices, so the company benefits from a growing economy. Most customers are adults. Aronow sees Align expanding into a teen market and foreign markets. He also expects the percentages of users in both of those markets to expand.""And Align will put up healthy, consistent growth as they grow the complexity of (dental) cases they can correct for,"" Aronow said.Discovery Growth Fund has boosted its stake in Planet Fitness in recent portfolio disclosures. The stock is appealing because ""it is the ultimate unAmazonable retail story,"" Aronow said. Consumers can't exercise online.The stock is also appealing because ""it is very early in its growth runway,"" Aronow said. ""They have about 1,300 units, with the potential to more than triple that count.""The company is benefiting from a virtuous cycle. ""As the leading national brand, they can put more advertising dollars behind their brand,"" Aronow said. ""That drives new member growth, which fuels more advertising.""In addition, Aronow calls the fitness center chain very capital efficient because many of its centers are owned by franchisees.The stock happens to be ranked No. 1 in IBD's Leisure-Services industry group.Grubhub, Align Technology and Planet Fitness are all members of the IBD 50 list of stocks that have strong relative price strength and fundamentals.RELATED:Hot Stocks Light A Fire Under AB Discovery Growth FundYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeThis Tax-Rule Change Could KO Your Retirement Account

80,KO,"The market's back in a confirmed uptrend, which raises the potential for more successful breakouts by stocks and ETFs alike.Today we'll highlight two dividend plays that may soon be ripe for the picking. First up is iShares Core Dividend Growth (DGRO), which tracks the Morningstar U.S. Dividend Growth Index. The $1.7 billion fund is just below a 31.19 buy point of a 12-week flat base.It advanced 5% from its prior flat-base breakout in early February to the start of the current pattern. And in November, DGRO gained 4% after clearing a previous flat base.Not surprisingly, the fund's top holdings are all blue chip components from the Dow Jones industrial average. Representing the latter group is Apple (AAPL), which started paying dividends in 2012. The iPhone maker currently pays an annualized 1.6% yield; its shares have rallied north of 30% this year.Microsoft (MSFT), which began offering a payout in 2003, yields 2.2%. Shares were up 13% this year through Tuesday's close. Other top holdings include S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats (companies that have raised their annual payout for 25 consecutive years) such as Coca-Cola (KO), Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Procter & Gamble (PG). Apple and Coca-Cola were among billionaire investor Warren Buffett's top holdings in Q1. DGRO's annualized return is 2.1%, slightly ahead of the S&P 500's average payout of 1.9%. It launched June 10, 2014.Schwab Dividend Equity (SCHD), which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, has also been building a flat base for about 12 weeks. The ideal buy point is 45.48, or 10 cents above the left-side high. The $5.5 billion ETF shows similar action to DGRO, with small gains after breakouts in November and February.SCHD's top three holdings as of May 26 were Microsoft, Coca-Cola and Home Depot (HD), according to Morningstar Inc. The fund has a five-year average return of 14.2%, close to the S&P 500's 15.3%. The ETF's annualized dividend is 2.9%.Of the two ETFs spotlighted early Tuesday, iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor USA (LRGF) edged closer to a 28.72 buy point, while iShares Russell Mid-Cap (IWR) dipped slightly but remained near a 190.98 entry.RELATED:Which 2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Own Nvidia As Top Holding?Like Big Dividends?

81,KO,"SodaStream (SODA) stock tanked Wednesday despite an earnings beat on both the top and bottom lines as growth in demand for carbonation refills accelerated.The maker of carbonated beverage systems reported earnings of 66 cents per share, up 129.3% year over year, as revenue jumped 14.3% to $115.3 million. That compared with consensus estimates for EPS of 38 cents per share and revenue of $109.8 million, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue from consumables, which generate the bulk of SodaStream's business, grew 6% to $72 million as unit sales of gas refill units increased 12%, which the company described as ""the strongest quarterly gain in several years."" In Q4, consumables revenue rose 5% and gas refill unit sales grew 10%.Meanwhile, revenue from sparkling water maker starter kits increased 37% to $40.6 million, holding steady vs. Q4's gain of 37%.Gross margin rose to 52.7% vs. 50.7% a year ago, which the company attributed to ""our continued production optimization, the leveraging of our fixed infrastructure for increased production volume and the introduction of the higher margin 'Fizzi' machine."" Shares fell 7% to 52.86 on the stock market today, paring losses after earlier diving as much as 13.2%. But the stock found support at its 50-day moving average and is now below the high end of the buy range, which maxes out at 53.92. Last month, SodaStream cleared a 51.35 buy point from a flat base but rose above buying territory soon after.Despite Wednesday's sell-off, shares of SodaStream have more than tripled in the last 12 month and are up by over 30% since the start of 2017. The top-notch price momentum contributed to a very solid IBD Composite Rating of 95, making it the No. 2 stock in the household-appliances industry group. By comparison, beverage giant Coca-Cola (KO) has slipped 4% in the last year amid shifting consumer tastes away from sugary drinks. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) and Monster Beverage (MNST) have been choppy but are also down from a year ago.SodaStream stock has ridden the wave of consumer demand for fizzy water.

Soros also dissolved his firm's positions in Amazon.com (AMZN) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and added to its stake in Facebook (FB), according to filings late Monday.David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital trimmed its Apple holdings to 4.2 million shares from 6.1 million in Q4, while more than quadrupling its stake in General Motors (GM) to 55 million shares from 13 million.In Q1, Berkshire grew its American Airlines (AAL) stake to 49.3 million shares, up 8.4% vs. the previous quarter, and its investment in Southwest Airlines (LUV) to 47.7 million, up 10.4%. It trimmed its position in Delta to 55 million shares, down 8.3%, while keeping its holdings in United Airlines (UAL) steady at 28.9 million.The regulatory filing confirmed news from early May that Berkshire's Buffett busily dumped tech giant IBM (IBM) in Q1. It had 64.6 million shares left at quarter-end, down 20%. (Even IBM Retirement Fund's unloaded 70,000 shares of IBM, leaving it with 12,451 IBM shares in Q1, according to the fund's 13F filing on May 10.)Meanwhile, the conglomerate's massive long-term stakes in Coca-Cola (KO), American Express (AXP) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) were left basically unchanged.Buffett had already said Berkshire more than doubled its Apple holdings in Q1, giving it a 2.5% stake in the iPhone maker's outstanding shares. Berkshire initiated a position in Apple, worth $1.1 billion, in Q1 2016 and doubled down on Apple as the year progressed.By contrast, Appaloosa Management slashed its stake in 2017's best-performing Dow component Apple by a third, to 300,000 shares, and trimmed Facebook by 12.6%, to 1.9 million shares in Q1, according to filings from Friday. The company also scooped up 100,000 shares of Snap, which tanked 17.5% last week on a dismal debut earnings reports following its March IPO.Similarly, Third Point exited its 1.85 million-share stake in Apple during Q1, while buying 2.25 million shares of Snap.Shares of Berkshire closed up 0.3% at 163.76 on the stock market today. Apple dipped 0.3%, down from Friday's fresh record high, and Snap rallied 8.4%, after last week's plunge. Facebook eased 0.1%, and IBM added 0.7%.Among Appaloosa's other notable moves, the fund entirely liquidated its massive stakes in two troubled stocks: chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) and retailer J.C. Penney (JCP).Appaloosa added a 1.6 million-share stake in Symantec (SYMC), which was leading a cybersecurity stock rally Monday on the heels of a global ransomware attack. Appaloosa also raised its Western Digital (WDC) stake by 16.1% to 1.3 million shares.But the hedge fund's biggest bet seems to be on an American industrial renaissance. It opened positions of roughly half a million shares each in AK Steel (AKS) and Nucor (NUE), while upping ArcelorMittal (MT) by more than 410%, to nearly 5 million shares.Other hefty new positions included Bank of America (BAC) and CBS (CBS) (8.8 million and 1.0 million shares, respectively).Third Point's other moves include adding to positions in T-Mobile (TMUS), Salesforce (CRM), Qualcomm and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD).The fund closed a small stake in Goldman Sachs (GS), and reduced holdings in Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase (JPM).Late Friday, Trian Fund Management also disclosed bigger positions in General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG) and a smaller stake in DuPont (DD).RELATED:What Will Berkshire Filing Show As Loeb Cuts Facebook, Apple Stakes?Why Buffett Still Isn't Sure If He'd Buy Amazon, Alphabet Stock Now

91,KO,"Warren Buffett, who long shunned investments in technology stocks and then made an ill-fated bet on IBM (IBM), said that mistake shouldn't discourage wagers on the broader industry.""I thought it would do better in the six years that have elapsed than it has,"" Buffett said of International Business Machines. Saturday, at the annual meeting of his Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB). ""And Apple, I regard them as being in a quite different business. I think Apple is much more of a consumer-products business"" with skill at finding opportunities that are difficult for rivals to duplicate.Apple (AAPL) has become one of Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire's largest holdings, valued at about $19.2 billion as of March 31. The billionaire said this week that he cut about a third of his stake in IBM, sending the shares down 2.5% Friday.Buffett and Vice Chairman Charles Munger built Berkshire into one of the world's largest companies with bets on consumer-product companies like Coca-Cola (KO) and older industries such as railroads. Munger said Saturday that avoiding Silicon Valley investments made sense for the pair, with some exceptions.""We avoided the tech stocks because we felt we had no advantage there, and other people did. And I think that's a good idea not to play where the other people are better,"" Munger said. ""But, you know, if you ask me in retrospect, 'What was our worst mistake in the tech field?' I think we were smart enough to figure out Google.""The stock of Alphabet (GOOGL), the parent of Google, has advanced 20% this year, and its co-founders became two of the richest people in the world. Buffett said Berkshire's Geico unit was an early customer of Google, paying the search-engine company when people clicked on the auto insurer's ads. Given the price that Geico was paying per click, Buffett said, he should have seen the technology company's promise.""I had plenty of ways to ask questions, or anything of the sort, and educate myself,"" Buffett said. ""But I blew it."" He also said he missed an opportunity by failing to invest in Amazon (AMZN).Buffett said time will tell about whether his recent wager on Apple is smarter than the 2011 IBM investment. He stressed that the companies have different types of customers, so each stock requires unique analysis.""They are two different types of decisions, and I was wrong on the first one,"" Buffett said. ""We'll find out whether I'm right or wrong on the second.""Munger said it was a ""very good sign"" that Buffett jumped into Apple.""It shows either one of two things: Either you've gone crazy, or you're learning,"" Munger said. ""I prefer the learning explanation.""RELATED:Berkshire To Start Meeting As Buffett Cuts IBM Stake; Apple In Focus

94,KO,"It may seem a bit far out — plans to send humans on a roughly seven-month, 34-million-mile ride to Mars, all for the privilege of standing where temperatures can get to 100 degrees below zero.XBut colonizing Mars is a central reason Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla (TSLA),  founded his rocket-ship company SpaceX 15 years ago. Musk, who spends equal time between Tesla and SpaceX, is one of four billionaires who are using their fortunes to fulfill a passion for space exploration and tourism.The four have attracted a fleet of venture capitalists, big corporations and other investors into a private-sector space race of sorts. They imagine a world where entrepreneurs can create business opportunities in space that include galaxies of small satellites controlling gadgets on the ground and initiatives to send humans on thrill rides to the moon, all outside the reach of government budget battles and a fickle voting public. Musk has said many times that the ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make Earth's population a space-faring society.SpaceX, based in Los Angeles County, already has taken a step into the heavens, ferrying supplies to the International Space Station. It's keeping an eye on further commercial exploration of the final frontier.""It's a fantastic time to be in the industry,"" said Carissa Bryce Christensen, founder of Bryce Space and Technology, a research and consulting firm for space and satellite industries.Startup space ventures have attracted more than $16.6 billion in investments since 2000, Christensen says. That money has funded 140 new companies, two-thirds of them in the last five years and most of them in the satellite business, she adds. Last year alone, $2.8 billion was pumped into 43 startup space ventures.""Musk changed the narrative, transforming the way people think and talk about space technology in a very inspirational way,"" Christensen said.Other billionaires doing business in the great beyond include Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, who established Blue Origin 16 years ago to make rocket ships for space tourism and science missions. Bezos recently said he sells about $1 billion in Amazon stock a year to finance his Blue Origin rocket company.Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Paul Allen has Stratolaunch Systems, which he co-founded to build the world's largest aircraft by wingspan, able to carry rockets to the edge of space to deliver small satellites into orbit. It has a partnership with Orbital ATK (OA).And Virgin Group founder Richard Branson is another space enthusiast. His company, Virgin Galactic, aims to be ready to launch its first passengers on thrill rides to suborbital space later this year. The cost per seat? $250,000. The spacecraft seats six with a two-person crew. Science missions are also planned.Musk, Bezos, Branson and Allen have brought back to life a U.S. space business that was demoralized by the retirement of the space shuttle fleet in 2011, Christensen says. Of the four, Musk has done the most to demonstrate an economic case for space, enticing previously reluctant venture capitalists to invest billions in the commercial transports outside the stratosphere.Musk founded SpaceX with $100 million of his own money, acquired from the sale of PayPal (PYPL), which he co-founded, to eBay (EBAY) for $1.4 billion. SpaceX now has a private-sector valuation of about $12 billion and holds multibillion-dollar contracts with NASA to resupply the International Space Station and deliver astronauts to and from the station. SpaceX also has extensive contracts to launch commercial satellites.Bezos' Blue Origin has made several test flights of its rocket, New Shepard, which is designed as a reusable spacecraft for space tourism that will fly passengers to the edge of space, about 62 miles high. It has made several successful launches but has not yet begun commercial operations.Blue Origin is building another rocket ship, called New Glenn, that it says will be taller and more powerful than the biggest rocket in development by SpaceX, the Falcon Heavy. The company's rockets are named after two of the original seven NASA Mercury astronauts, Alan Shepard and John Glenn.IBD'S TAKE: New products or services are part of the N in IBD's CAN SLIM investing system. New products or services are what ultimately generates stellar profitability. None of the four billionaire-founded space startups in this article trades publicly, but you can scroll our IBD 50 list of top stocks to discover other innovative companies. Bezos made billions from his creation of Amazon, which he has used to self-fund most of Blue Origin. He's pumped an estimated $1 billion in Blue Origin. In 2015, Google and Fidelity invested $1 billion in SpaceX.SpaceX initially fueled the jump in space activity by pushing down the cost of rocket launches. That put the ability to catch a ride to space well within the reach of entrepreneurs to create various commercial space operations.Phillip Spector, counsel at the Washington, D.C., office of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, says lowering the cost of space access was critical for commercial expansion. Before joining Milbank, Spector was executive vice president of business development and general counsel at Intelsat (I), one of the largest satellite operators worldwide.At Intelsat, ""The biggest issue we faced was around launch, the pricing for launch and availability. There were not enough suppliers,"" Spector said. ""The addition of competition from SpaceX was very welcome.""Investors have yet to benefit from this new wave of enthusiasm.Shares of many large space companies and government contractors have long traded on the public markets, including Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Orbital ATK, Harris Corp. (HRS), ViaSat (VSAT) and Orbcomm (ORBC). Boeing and Lockheed Martin have a joint venture called the United Launch Alliance that provides spacecraft launch services and competes against SpaceX.But there has yet to be a high-profile IPO from the crop of startup companies now flooding the market. The company best positioned for a possible IPO is SpaceX, which would undoubtedly draw widespread attention. But SpaceX recently shot down rumors that a public stock offering was in the planning.""Musk has been clear about not wanting to take SpaceX public,"" said Spector. ""We're not seeing a rush to IPOs among space companies out here today. I don't see Bezos or Branson having the need to take their company public.""But that hasn't stopped the chunks of money flowing into the market.""The funding environment for startup companies is robust,"" said Spector.Startup companies have focused on a number of narrow business models. One is building and launching fleets of small satellites to circle the Earth in a low orbit.They're using the satellites to study agriculture trends, track ships, produce high-frequency weather reports and study water pollution patterns, among other things. There's also a big market in the making with the advent of what's called the Internet of Things, which includes machine-to-machine communication.""These startups are doing some truly innovative things, using off-the-shelf technology and getting near the performance of assets that were 10 times the cost,"" said Dara Panahy, a Milbank partner who represents clients in aerospace and communications. ""That is a real game-changer.""Then there are massive projects such as OneWeb, which plans to launch the first of 700 satellites next year to provide high-speed internet and other communication services. Partners in the OneWeb venture include Branson, Qualcomm (QCOM), SoftBank (SFTBY), Airbus (EADSY) and Coca-Cola (KO). Investors plowed $1.2 billion into OneWeb in 2016.""The market has matured and grown and, along with some of the other enabling technologies, that lowered barriers to getting into space,"" said Panahy. ""So now you have true venture-capital-funded startups and angel-funded startups that can now launch on maybe less than $100,000.""That compares with launches in the tens of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases today.Among the space startups is Rocket Lab, which has developed a rocket from scratch that's designed for frequent launches to low Earth orbit. Rocket Lab had the first test of its rocket, called Electron, in May. It plans to conduct two more test flights in 2017 and launch customer payloads next year.At full production, Rocket Lab expects to launch more than 50 times a year. In comparison, last year saw 22 launches from the U.S. and 82 internationally, according to Rocket Lab.Acquisitions have helped draw venture capital. They're the primary way VCs get a return on investment. Fifteen space-related companies have been acquired for a total value of $3.2 billion since 2000, demonstrating a return on investment that venture capitalists want to see.Among the acquisitions, Europe-based satellite operator SES paid $703 million to buy the other half of a company called O3b it didn't already own. O3b is a big player in the small-satellite communication field.Another startup is Planet, a maker of small satellites, with about 100 now in orbit, some about the size of a shoe box. Planet, previously known as Planet Labs, can image the whole Earth every 24 hours, providing data that can be used to solve commercial, environmental and humanitarian challenges.RELATED: In Jeff Bezos-Elon Musk Space Race, Score One For Amazon's BezosSpaceX Rocket Explosion Comes At Worst Possible Time For MuskSpaceX Jumps Aboard Space Tourism With Planned Moon Flight For TwoBezos To Launch Blue Origin Rockets At Cape Canaveral

95,KO,"Energy-drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) missed second-quarter earnings forecasts after the close on Tuesday amid production issues with its coffee and protein drinks.XEstimates: Earnings per share are expected to jump 21% to 40 cents, with sales up 10% to $907 million.Results: EPS of 39 cents on net sales of $907.1 million. Monster said Q2 results were hurt by adverse foreign exchange rates and ""production shortages"" of its Java Monster and Muscle Monster drinks.Stock: Monster tumbled 5% late, indicating a drop below buy range after clearing a cup-with-handle base late last month. Shares closed down 0.45% at 52.63 on the stock market today.Zacks analysts say the company's new products this year should lift sales. Monster's distribution deal with Coca-Cola (KO) should also help it internationally, they said, adding that demand for energy drinks has held up even as consumers become more health conscious.Coca-Cola stock finished 0.1% lower at 45.60, and dipped 0.2% late. Coca-Cola is in a long cup-with-handle base with a 46.16 buy point. Coca-Cola cleared that entry on July 27, then pulled back slightly.National Beverage (FIZZ), which is currently extended from a flat-base entry, rose 1.5% to 110.58. National Beverage is a member of the elite IBD 50.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Berkshire Was Busy In Q2: What Stocks Did He Buy, Sell?National Beverage Dives To Buy Point Despite Strong Earnings, Sales

96,KO,"Charity: Disasters like the one unfolding in Houston show the worst in Mother Nature, but also show the best of a free society. Even before any government agency could act, volunteers, private businesses and charities from around the country were organizing relief efforts.There has been plenty of attention given to how well the government — particularly the federal government — is responding to the unfolding disaster in Houston. President Trump's tweet praising FEMA's response, for example, was instant news. But while there's no doubt that marshaling government resources in a time of crisis is vital, all this attention on government activities overlooks the far more important and inspiring voluntary efforts across the country.Over the weekend, dozens of people from Louisiana showed up in Houston as part of what's become known as the Cajun Navy. This is an all-volunteer group formed during Hurricane Katrina that has grown in size since.XThe Cajun Navy was part of what's been described as an ""armada of private boats"" that came to Houston to help rescue thousands of people stranded in their homes by Harvey's relentless deluge.Nobody ordered it, or organized it, or coordinated it, or directed it. Nobody's getting paid. But their efforts are a big reason why the death rate from Harvey has been so low.It's just one of many stories emerging from Houston that show how, in times of crisis, Americans come together, on their own, to help each other, save lives, and solve problems. A few examples:There are less obvious ways private companies help. Waffle House, for example, has become an indicator of how bad a weather disaster is, because the restaurant chain is so determined to keep operating in the worst conditions.Rory Carroll, writing for the UK-based Guardian newspaper about the outpouring of voluntary help in response to Harvey, put it this way: ""Here was the America of the ideal: one nation, indivisible. A republic of citizens looking out for each other. No politics or polarization. No fake news or social media bubbles. A crisis all could see, and a response all wanted to be part of.""Amen to that. The nation's moral character isn't measured by the number of federal programs, or how big their budgets are, or how many bureaucrats are involved. It is measured in the willingness of its citizens to rally, organize and respond to a crisis all on their own, freely donating their time and resources, experience and know-how to help strangers in need. Too, often, these private efforts get lost in the relentless focus on what government is or isn't doing.For all the terrible news to come out of Houston, the response from individuals, communities and businesses around the country is a beautiful thing to behold.Of course, not everyone has been inclined to see the good emerging from the Harvey tragedy.Chauncey Devega of the left-wing Salon, for example, could not contain his Trump bashing even for a moment, writing in a truly awful column about how ""many Americans face a massive natural disaster — but the disaster of this failed presidency is even worse.""Salon should send Devega to Houston so he can see what America is really about.RELATED:Hurricane Harvey's Nationalized Insurance Nightmare

97,KO,"Investors will look to quarterly filings from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), George Soros' Soros Fund Management, Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital, Dan Loeb's Third Point and other closely followed hedge funds — days after Warren Buffett's conglomerate reported results.XBerkshire's operating profits plunged 10.6% to $4.12 billion in the second quarter as lower investment gains and insurance underwriting losses offset improvements in its railroad business, it reported Friday.Over the past quarter, Berkshire Hathaway and its units made several key strategic moves to diversify its business and seize promising opportunities. Those initiatives included an agreement to buy Dallas-based power transmitter Oncor Electric Delivery for $9 billion; a 10% stake in Store Capital Group (STOR), a real estate investment trust or REIT that has rallied since Buffett's investment; and the rescue of a Canadian mortgage lender, Home Capital Group.The company ended the June quarter with about $99.7 billion of cash and equivalents, plus big stakes in Kraft Heinz (KHC), Wells Fargo (WFC), Apple (AAPL) and Coca-Cola (KO). It bought just over $3 billion of stocks in the quarter, Reuters reported, while it is poised to become Bank of America's (BAC) biggest shareholder thanks to a shrewd investment six years ago.Class-B shares of Berkshire Hathaway closed down 1% at 178.04 on the stock market today, snapping a 15-day win streak that was capped with a 52-week high of 179.99 Friday.IBD'S TAKE: The latest list of new buys of top-performing mutual funds shows strong demand for certain sectors and can also be used for stock investment ideas. Berkshire's rapid accumulation of Apple stock over the past year has been among its most notable portfolio moves.In Q1 2016, Berkshire had 9.8 million Apple shares, and that position grew to 15.2 million in Q2 2016, and ballooned to 57.4 million by Q4. In Q1 this year, Berkshire more than doubled its stake to 129.4 million.Berkshire's Apple purchases have coincided with dips amid concerns about slowing iPhone sales. But the legendary billionaire investor saw buy opportunities, and recently described Apple's resonance with customers as ""amazing"" and the iPhone as a ""sticky"" product.Apple shares ended Q2 of this year essentially unchanged vs. the start of Q2. But since Q3 has started, the stock has climbed into a new buy zone, helped by strong quarterly earnings and guidance.RELATED:Warren Buffett's Two Best Q1 Bets Include One He Didn't MakeStocks Edge Higher: Apple Retakes Buy Point; China Name Breaks Out

He pointed out that the Shanghai Composite cleared resistance at the 3,300 level for the first time since January 2016.Retail, homebuilders and energy were among the biggest sector gainers. Oil also fared well with VanEck Vectors Oil Services (OIH) up 1.5% and SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production (XOP) adding 0.3%. Biotech and chips were among the few losers.Gold ETFs perked up as the yellow metal's futures climbed 0.4% to $1,297.50. VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) and VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) rose 0.6% each. SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), iShares Gold Trust (IAU) and PowerShares DB Gold Fund (DGL) were up about 0.5% apiece.A pair of big-cap equity funds with stakes in three of Warren Buffett's biggest holdings are seeking support.Plenty of exchange traded funds have been pulling back to their 50-day moving average lines as the market has come off record highs.SPDR S&P 500 Growth (SPYG) has been trading near its 50-day the past week. It advanced nearly 4% from its last definitive bounce off the support line July 11 to its July 27 intraday high.The $871 million fund, which tracks the index bearing the same name, will mark its 17th anniversary next month. It provides exposure to the companies in the S&P 500 with the strongest growth characteristics based on sales growth, earnings change to price ratio, and momentum.That's led it to top five holdings in large-cap techs: Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). Billionaire investor Buffett upped his stake in Apple in Q2. Other big Buffett stocks in SPYG include American Express (AXP) and Coca-Cola (KO).Technology, at 36%, leads SPYG in terms of sector weighting as of Aug. 23. Consumer discretionary and health care make up about 16% each, followed by 11% in industrials.The ETF has outpaced the S&P 500 year to date through Aug. 23 with a 15.8% vs. 10.6% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. It's also topped the benchmark index over the longer haul. A 15-year average annual return of 8.9% edged past the S&P 500's 8.8% advance. SPYG carries a 0.15% expense ratio.Pacer Trendpilot 750 (PTLC), which tracks the Pacer Wilshire US Large-Cap Trendpilot Index, is also looking for support at its 50-day line. The two-year-old fund has attracted $530.2 million in assets. Its expense ratio is 0.62%.The Pacer Trendpilot series tries to avoid market downturns by paring exposure and investing in three-month U.S. Treasury bills if the underlying index closes below its 200-day average for five straight days. Likewise, if the underlying index closes above its 200-day line for five straight days, the funds will be fully invested in equities.PTLC's top holdings include the same techs as SPYG. It also owns the same Buffett stocks, as well as the two other Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) top-five positions: Kraft-Heinz (KHC) and Wells Fargo (WFC). The biggest sector weightings as of Aug. 22 were technology at 20%, financial services 16%, health care 13.5%, and consumer cyclical 11%.The ETF has performed roughly in line with the S&P 500. YTD, it's returned 10.2% vs. 10.6% for the S&P 500.Both of Thursday's picks, iShares S&P 100 (OEF) and Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG), closed lower along with the broader market as they continue to test their 50-day lines.RELATED:Retail, These 3 Sectors Score Gains; Are 2 Apple Plays In Play?3 Sectors Score Biggest Gains; Apple, Big Techs In Buy Range?These Unique ETF Strategies Shine When It Gets Ugly Out There

101,KO,"X Shares of IBM lurched 2.5% lower early Friday amid news that Warren Buffett has been dumping the tech giant in 2017. Investors digested the news ahead of Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) annual meeting, a day when the Berkshire CEO answers shareholders' questions.Late Friday, Berkshire reported Q1 net earnings dropped 27% to $4.14 billion as insurance losses and adjustments soared 146%, but revenue climbed 25% to $65.19 billion. Insurance premiums earned nearly doubled to $21.75 billion, and railroad, utilities and energy revenue grew 6.3% to $9.4 billion.Among the potential topics that billionaire investor could address are his reasons for selling IBM (IBM), Apple's (AAPL) rising dividends, turbulence in the airline industry and a merger snub for one of his top stocks.Buffett has sold a third of his stake in the tech giant over the first and second quarters, considerably trimming his 81 million shares as of December 2016, CNBC reported.""IBM is a big strong company, but they've got big strong competitors too,"" he said in an interview, adding IBM stock had not performed in line with his expectations.The iPhone maker is a sure bet for the spotlight at Saturday's meeting.Buffett doubled his stake in Apple at the start of this year, owning $17 billion of the stock as of February. He disclosed a position in Apple in 2016 after sitting out the tech giant's hot growth streak over the past decade. He attributed the change of heart to Apple's ""enormously useful product"" and intelligent deployment of capital.Buffett's ""invest in what you know"" principle made him a big buyer of the best high-dividend stocks such as Verizon (VZ), General Motors (GM), IBM (IBM) and Coca-Cola (KO). He likes financially sound companies with a durable competitive advantage that reward shareholders. Dividends can be a sign of a quality company.Apple's hefty dividend hike may make the stock more attractive for Buffett, though he said in February that Apple stock was ""at a price different than I would buy it now.""Apple shares rose 0.6% to 147.38 in morning trade on the stock market today. The stock fell fractionally Wednesday and Thursday after reporting tepid revenue and iPhone sales for the second fiscal quarter but significantly raising its dividend and buyback.Berkshire Hathaway has also been upping its stake in airline stocks — another big change of heart. He is reported to have owned more than 7% of the total common stock of each of Delta Air Lines (DAL), United Airlines (UAL), American Airlines (AAL) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) as of February.With airlines executives in congressional crosshairs after a spate of disturbing passenger-related incidents, Buffett may be grilled himself on his airline positions.Other headwinds for airline stocks include high labor costs, increased competition and discounted fares that cut into profits.Still, all four of the big U.S. carriers have moved back above their 50-day moving averages.If Buffett stays true to form, investors can expect some frank discussion of Kraft Heinz's (KHC) failed $143 billion merger bid for Unilever (UN) and what other steps Kraft may do to revive growth.Berkshire is one of the largest stakeholders in the $108 billion company behind beloved household names such as Jell-O and Kool-Aid.After Wednesday's market close, Kraft Heinz reported earnings per share and revenue below Wall Street views. EPS climbed 15% to 84 cents a share while sales dipped 3% to $6.36 billion. Analysts had expect EPS of 85 cents and sales of $6.462 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Sales have fallen for four of the last five quarters, while there may be limits to Kraft's aggressive cost-cutting measures under Berkshire and co-lead investor 3G.Kraft shares fell sharply intraday Thursday, but closed up 0.6%. The stock dipped 0.1% Friday morning.In previous annual meetings, Buffett has weighed in on Valeant Pharmaceuticals' (VRX) flawed business model, defended his sizable stake in Coca-Cola, and knocked hedge fund managers (between playing ping-pong with a giant paddle and doing a ukulele singalong).RELATED:Apple Investors Find Comfort In 10.5% Dividend HikeLawmakers Grill United CEO Munoz

102,KO,"Stocks opened Friday in tightly mixed formation, after April payrolls data topped expectations and investors looked toward Sunday's final-round presidential election in France.The Nasdaq composite rose 0.2% and the S&P 500 index 0.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average futures was just below negative.Friday's session is substantial on a number of fronts. The economic headline for the day, the Labor Department's April payrolls report, blew past expectations but with some mixed details. Nonfarm employers hired 211,000 workers during the month, more than double the initial March estimate of 98,000 new hires and a giant step above economist projections for 185,000 new jobs. But the department also revised its March estimate downward, to 79,000 from 98,000.The unemployment rate dipped to 4.4%. Consensus views projected an increase to 4.6%. Average hourly earnings climbed 0.3%, up from 0.2% in March and in line with estimates.Markets also are bracing for the final round of France's presidential election, set for Sunday, which could determine the future of the European Union. Stocks may also continue reacting to news out of Washington, where the GOP's health care bill moves to the Senate after winning approval in the House on Thursday.Crude oil will be closely watched Friday, after diving nearly 5% Thursday, to its lowest level since November.

IBM shares are trading below the 50- and 200-day moving averages and at the lowest level since Nov. 9.Monster Beverage (MNST) helped prop both the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500, trading up 4%, despite mixed first-quarter results. Earnings were hurt by distributor terminations as the company continues the integration in its partnership with Coca-Cola (KO). But revenue rose 9%, stronger than forecast, and the company reported a strong pipeline of new products for 2017. Monster shares have been trading tightly below their 200-day moving average since March, but moved above the line Friday.Universal Display (OLED) sailed 18.5% higher, reporting first-quarter results after Thursday's close that trashed analyst targets. The stock made a new high, and is now extended after a rebound from support at its 50-day line.Sierra Wireless (SWIR) bolted ahead 10%. A 200% earnings gain and a 13% rise in revenue topped expectations, and management boosted its second-quarter earnings and revenue guidance past views. The stock is in the sixth week of a consolidation. Shares climbed back above the 50-day moving average Friday.Herbalife (HLF) rattled off an 8.5% gain. The diet supplement marketer's first-quarter earnings and revenue slipped less than forecast. Second-quarter guidance was weak due to sales shifted into Q1 from China, but full-year earnings guidance was at the high end of expectations. Herbalife shares closed on Thursday just below a 62.60 buy point in a two-month cup base within a larger pattern.Fiber-optic networking gear maker Applied OptoElectronics (AAOI) flashed up 9%. The Sugar Land, Texas-based outfit reported late Thursday big earnings and revenue gains that met or beat expectations. The stock sold off alongside other fiber-optic issues in early April. It climbed back above its 10-week moving average Friday as it works on a new base.Zillow (Z) zipped up 7% in early action. The online real estate data mapping site's first-quarter earnings jumped 185% on a 32% rise in revenue, both easily clearing analysts targets. Shares closed at a new high on Thursday, still in buy range above a 39.15 cup base buy point.RELATED:2 Top Stocks Near Buy Zones, Payrolls Due: Investing Action PlanStock Futures Mixed As Oil Erases Overnight Gains

107,KO,"A persisting puzzle about the U.S. economy is how it can seem both strong and weak. On the one hand, it remains a citadel of innovation, producing new companies like Uber. On the other, the economy is expanding at a snail's pace of 2% annually since 2010. How could both be true? Why isn't innovation translating into faster growth? The answer — or part of the answer — is that American businesses are running on two separate tracks. Call them the ""youthful"" and ""middle-aged"" tracks.You can't miss youthful capitalism. The Googles of the world dazzle with their rapid innovation. Their dynamism is reassuring. Meanwhile, many less visible but more numerous older firms are treading water. They're struggling to generate higher revenues and profits from mature markets, while facing new competitive threats. It is arguably the firms running on the second track — middle-aged capitalism — that have dominated the economy since the Great Recession.To be sure, America's business aristocracy has shifted. In 1995, the largest five firms by market ""capitalization"" (the value of a company's shares) were old-line businesses: Exxon, AT&T  (T), Coca-Cola (KO), General Electric (GE) and Merck (MRK). By 2015, only Exxon (now Exxon Mobil (XOM)) remained. The others were replaced by Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN). (Note: Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO, owns The Washington Post.) Still, middle-aged capitalism has slowed the recovery.Bolstering the case is a new study, published in the Journal of Economic Perspectives by Kathleen Kahle of the University of Arizona and Rene Stulz of Ohio State University. The scholars examined all U.S. public companies over a 40-year period, from 1975 to 2015, and found pervasive evidence of a two-tiered capitalism. Companies are sorting themselves into the strong and the weak.(Recall: A public company has shares that are traded, typically on a stock exchange. Private firms, including most small and family businesses, are not publicly traded.)Profits became more concentrated, especially among large tech firms. In 2015, Apple, Google, Microsoft and Amazon had combined profits of $82 billion, fully 10% of all profits of publicly traded companies. In 1975, 109 firms accounted for half the profits; by 2015, 30 companies did. More disturbing, companies below the top 200 reported negative earnings as a whole; many of these firms had significant losses.A similar story applies to corporate investment in buildings and machinery (computers, vehicles). From 1975 to 2015, this capital investment has dropped from 8% of corporate assets to 4%. Interestingly, this decline in investment was mostly offset by increases in corporate research and development (R&D) — reflecting the need to develop new digital products and programs, say Kahle and Stulz. But the R&D spending was heavily skewed toward bigger firms. Half of publicly traded firms showed no R&D.Middle-aged capitalism prevails. Consider:All this is troublesome for President Trump or anyone wanting a stronger economy. If the primary forces holding it back are ill-considered government policies, then the remedy is obvious. Get rid of the policies. The economy will improve. This is the administration's position.But what if the weaknesses go deeper? For example: It's hard to argue that cuts in corporate taxes will accelerate economic growth if many companies are already suffering losses — and don't benefit from tax cuts. Similarly, large, very profitable firms, with huge piles of cash but few appealing investment projects, won't suddenly find new projects if their taxes are cut.Kahle and Stulz worry that the trends they outline may mean ""less investment, less growth, and less dynamism."" Companies will remain highly cautious. Entrepreneurship will further weaken. These hazards are hardly hypothetical.

113,KO,"A strange-bedfellows mix of Democrats and Republicans have called for resurrecting the Glass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era law that separated commercial and investment banking.For most of the 20th Century the law held back Main Street banks and shielded the big Wall Street banks from those smaller competitors. Why would anyone want that old problem back again?Democrats have blamed the law's 1999 repeal for causing the 2007-2008 financial crisis, while some Republicans have latched onto the old government mandate as a way to protect Main Street banks and consumers from Wall Street abuses. Both of these notions are dead wrong.The financial crisis was not caused by allowing commercial and investment banks to be owned by the same parent corporation. The institutions that failed were either predominantly commercial or investment banks, but not both.The commercial banks that failed, such as Wachovia, Washington Mutual and IndyMac, did so because they invested in subprime mortgages. The investment banks that got into trouble, such as Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers, had no commercial bank affiliations.The excessive risk-taking that lead to bank losses occurred in mortgage lending and securitization (the repackaging of pooled assets into securities), completely legal practices that would have occurred even under a Glass-Steagall regime.In fact, separating banking activities would have increased the severity of the crisis. Investment banks that found themselves in liquidity crunches, such as Merrill Lynch, were able to be acquired by larger deposit-taking institutions, namely Bank of America, rather than go bankrupt.Further, when Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) were under stress to acquire short-term funding, they were allowed to quickly reorganize into financial holding companies with commercial banking arms. The ability of these institutions to diversify their activities sheltered the financial system from further losses.The most-integrated banks, those with both commercial- and investment-banking arms, were the strongest during the crisis. This remains the case today. The most recent Federal Reserve stress tests show that the banks that engage in unified banking, such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), are in fact the healthiest.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, two banks that concentrate primarily on investment banking, came the closest to failing on key measurements. Simply separating bank activities does not make the financial system any safer, nor would have it prevented the 2007-08 crisis.The second mistake of Glass-Steagall proponents is their claim that they are ""taking on Wall Street."" In reality, piling on complex regulations only serves to enrich well-connected big banks at the expense of smaller ones. Glass-Steagall systematically destroyed Main Street investment banking over its 66-year reign.Prior to the government-imposed firewall, many commercial banks in cities throughout the country were active in securities underwriting and distribution.For example, the Trust Company of Georgia, predecessor of SunTrust Banks (STI), organized a stock offering of Coca-Cola (KO) in 1919. Local residents of Atlanta, who celebrated not having to sell out to ""New York interests,"" subsequently bought nearly half of Coca-Cola's stock.That would not be possible under Glass-Steagall. The firewall forbade local commercial banks from venturing into investment banking, relegating the latter to specialized firms in New York.Bringing back a failed government policy would only redistribute assets and activities among the existing big banks. The 10 largest banks would all remain designated as ""too-big-to-fail"" under a new Glass-Steagall, with the pure investment banks such as Goldman Sachs growing to become more systemically important, as American Enterprise Institute scholar Paul Kupiec has found.It is little wonder then why Gary Cohn, the director of President Trump's National Economic Council and former Goldman Sachs executive, is in favor of the measure.The real solution to today's financial woes is opening up the financial services sector to greater competition. House Republicans have been moving in the right direction by passing the Financial Choice Act this year, which would allow Main Street banks to grow their communities while removing Wall Street's protections.If the Senate does its part to pass the bill and send it to the President to sign, that is a policy that will foster an efficient and stable financial system that all Americans can rely upon.

A venture capitalist and consultant to Fortune 500 companies, Moran currently serves as president of Menlo College in Atherton, Calif.Evan Carmichael, author of ""Your One Word: The Powerful Secret to Creating a Business and Life That Matters,"" said that many people ""want to spend their time doing more meaningful work, but they can't define what that meaningful work looks like. They want to be a part of something great, but they don't actually believe that they have greatness within them.""Tips for upping your career status quo:Mine for gold. Carmichael, an acclaimed global business speaker, says start by asking yourself: What makes you happy?An exercise he suggests: Find a common theme between what your favorite movie is, who your favorite boss is, and the activities that make you feel most alive. Similarly, if need be, make a list of everything and everyone that makes you unhappy, and find what binds them together in order to articulate what the opposite is.He says finding your one word, one core value, one most important belief is ""the path to self-awareness, standing for something important, and breaking the chains of mediocrity in all areas of your life and business.""Carmichael's one word? ""Believe.""Sell yourself. People want to know what you stand for and what kind of company you are before they buy from you, Carmichael says.""Lead with the mission,"" he added. ""Lead with your why. Lead with your values. … Customers will come to you, buy more, and refer their friends because you're making them feel like they are a part of an important mission as well. That's 'core selling.' ""Follow through. Making a to-do list is not the same as getting things done, Moran points out.""Success in any organization is determined more by implementation, not planning,"" he states. ""There is no contest to win by having a long 'to-do list.' Pay attention to the 'done list.' ""Also, don't fall into the trap of getting things accomplished that don't matter as much, at the expense of what actually does.Stay relevant. Availability is not a skill, Moran says.""Just because you are available does not mean you are going to get snapped up into a new and rewarding career,"" he continued. ""Always be current in skills and be ready to change as the skills in demand change.""Be proactive. Carmichael offers this perspective for when you want to shake things up: ""Everything in your environment holds you exactly where you are."" This can mean your entire routine, including the way you think, what influences you and the people you hang out with.Make changes when need be. As futurist Alvin Toffler said, ""Change is not merely necessary to life, it is life.""Accomplish the basics. Just as losing weight is fundamentally about eating right and getting exercise, Moran says, success in business is fundamentally about ""setting a strategy, executing on the strategy and measuring results.""Make real face-time. People today, especially, can work from home, a local Starbucks (SBUX), or even out of the trunk of their car, Moran says, but the boss or your colleagues still need to know who you are.""One of the best parts of work is the relationships we develop,"" Moran said. ""Show up. Have coffee with colleagues. Go to the holiday party.""Forge ahead regardless. Moran writes that Bob Noyce was 41 when he founded Intel (INTC), John Pemberton 55 when he invented Coca-Cola (KO), Colonel Sanders 65 when he founded KFC (YUM).""So for all of you thinking of something big, of making a change, of starting something, the world has not passed you by,"" Moran wrote.

Its still-drink category — a proxy for some of its healthier options — rose 2%, but that remains a smaller piece of the business.While earnings were in line with views at 37 cents a share, Coke predicted an earnings decline of as much as 4% in the coming year. The company, which sells products in more than 200 countries, is dealing with especially strong headwinds in emerging markets such as Latin America.Coke is facing ""persistent macroeconomic pressures in our emerging and developing markets,"" Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said in a statement on Thursday.The news sent Coke shares down 2% in premarket action on the stock market today.The Atlanta-based soft-drink giant has been steering customers toward more wholesome beverages, water and smaller cans, especially in its home market. The idea is to appeal to health-conscious consumers, with the added bonus of generating higher profit margins.But currency fluctuations, sluggish international economies and pressure on its core business — soda — continue to cloud the company's future.While the global perspective was troubling, the picture was brighter in North America. Smaller package sizes helped revive soda sales in the fourth quarter and stem volume declines for the year. Sparkling-beverage volume grew 1% in the final three months of 2016.Still, the company is coming off a grim stretch for the soft-drink industry. U.S. per-capita consumption hit a three-decade low in 2015, according to Beverage-Digest, a trade publication.The great shrink-down of its containers has improved Coca-Cola's price mix, helping it meet earnings estimates in the latest quarter.

122,KO,"Snack and beverage giant PepsiCo (PEP) reported second-quarter earnings on Tuesday that topped analyst forecasts. So did sales growth.X Estimates: Earnings per share of $1.39, a 3% increase, as revenue advanced a percentage point higher to $15.59 billion, according to analysts tracked by Zacks Investment Research.Results: Pepsi earned $1.50 a share, including 6 cents from a one-time Britvic sale. That's an 11% gain. Revenue climbed 2% to $15.71 billion. Organic revenue, which includes currency swings and structural changes, advanced 3.1%. Organic volume rose 2% for snacks and other food but fell 2% for beverages.Outlook: Pepsi sees 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.13 a share. Analysts expect $5.12, according to Zacks.Pepsi sees foreign exchange cutting full-year core profit by 2 percentage points vs. its prior estimate of 3 percentage points. The dollar weakened at the end of Q2. The weakening dollar likely will be a notable factor in multinationals' results and guidance during the current earnings season.Shares fell 0.5% to 113.69 in the stock market today. The stock on Monday pierced through support at its 50-day line in heavy volume.PepsiCo, whose brands include its namesake soft drink as well as Mountain Dew, Tropicana, Doritos and Quaker, has tried to offer more ""guilt free"" products to an increasingly wellness-focused population with a deepening distaste for soda.More than 45% of the company's net revenue comes from those products, the company said during its first-quarter earnings call in April. Meanwhile, U.S. soda sales more broadly have fallen for 12 straight years, according to Beverage Digest, an industry trade publication.PepsiCo has introduced healthier, non-carbonated drinks, tested natural sweeteners in sodas, tried out new frying methods to cut fat in potato chips, and offered up healthier, grain-based snacks, Zacks notes. Emerging markets abroad, where consumption is still low, and a growing middle class in some nations could also drive growth and help demand, Zacks said.But turmoil and currency swings internationally risk cutting into sales figures. Pepsi has tightened up its pricing, which can help protect revenue and make up for weaker volumes. But that tactic's durability could become a bigger issue over time.Volumes in the company's large Frito-Lay North America division fell 1.5% in the first quarter. That marked the first decline in some five years, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said in a report, according to Bloomberg. Management said in April that the dip was temporary and partly a product of shifts in holidays, and that volume had begun to rebound.But Amazon (AMZN) looms over consumer products too. The Amazon-Whole Foods Market (WFM) deal raises the prospect of more private-label goods vs. branded packaged consumer products from the likes of General Mills (GIS), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Pepsi's Frito-Lay. Packaged goods firms are cutting market spending, Marketwatch reported, citing James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness, Crespi, Hardt to support profits. Cakmak wrote in a Monday note that the cuts are in part reflect less of an emphasis of fighting for shelf space in the age of Amazon and other e-commerce options such as Jet.com and Walmart.com from Wal-Mart (WMT). But cutting ads and marketing may only spur the push to commoditize packaged goods, reducing margins further.Coca-Cola (KO) dipped 0.1%. Coca-Cola fell below its 50-day line last week.Monster Beverage (MNST) slid 0.1%. Monster Beverage recently found 50-day support after a failed late June breakout. Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) rose 0.2%.National Beverage (FIZZ) edged down 0.2%. National Beverage, fueled by its Lacroix sparking water, shot up nearly 7% to 103.28 on Monday, now extended from Friday's breakout from a 96.15 buy point of a flat base.RELATED:Is This Unique Soda Maker Set To Pop Its Top, Or Fizzle?Thirsty Investors Drive Coca-Cola Shares Higher As Buy Point FormsNot Your Father's PepsiCo: Company Expands Into Healthy Fare

127,KO,"Looking for some ideas for your portfolio? Want to boost the octane in your retirement account? Then check out how American Funds and Fidelity Investments — the second- and third-largest mutual fund complexes after Vanguard as of Dec. 31, according to Morningstar Inc. — were allocating their shareholders' money.The main lesson for individual investors? Even the smart money, in the form of these two fund families, can disagree about some key decisions.The three sectors in which their stock fund weightings differed from each other the most were information technology, consumer staples and energy.Fidelity's stock funds overall had 26% of their shareholders' money in tech, the group's largest sector weighting, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research for research firm CFRA.American Funds was well below that, with just 18% in tech.American Funds had more in consumer staples, 9% vs. only 7% for Fidelity.And American Funds had more in energy, 10% vs. just 6% for Fidelity.We recently dissected recent big buys by Fidelity, so here's a look at some big fourth-quarter buys by American Funds, whose 64 stock mutual funds were up 4.90% year-to-date as of Feb. 28, according to Morningstar Inc. The broad market, measured by the S&P 500, was up 5.94%.American Funds boosted its share count in chipmaker Analog Devices (ADI) by a whopping 43%.Analog Devices has a top-notch 98 Composite Rating from IBD, a peg under the highest possible on a scale from 1-99. The stock's earnings per share rose 6%, 2% and 68% in the past three quarters. Share price is up 14% this year going into Monday.Drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) was another stock in which American Funds made a big increase in its share count, adding 40% more to its stake.Bristol-Myers has a weak 61 Composite Rating. Share price has been trending lower since mid-July. Shares are down 2% this year but have rallied 22% since Jan. 26, when the company reported fourth-quarter earnings that fell short of analysts' consensus view and cut its 2017 guidance.One reason for Bristol-Myers' rally is that its cancer drug Opdivo recently won approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat metastatic urothelial carcinoma, the most common type of bladder cancer. It got a similar green light in Europe last year.American Funds jacked up its number of shares in Facebook (FB) by a net 39% in Q4. The stock has a good 92 Comp Rating. Shares have climbed 19% so far this year.Alphabet (GOOGL) is another name in which American Funds raised its bet, by 16% in the social-media giant's case. Share price is up 7% so far this year.Additional tech-oriented bellwethers were among the stocks in which American Funds made net new buys, including consumer electronics giant Apple (AAPL), chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) and software titan Microsoft (MSFT).But the big fund family hedged its bets in some other tech titans, including net redemptions in chipmaker Intel (INTC) and Amazon (AMZN). It also trimmed big-box building products chain Home Depot (HD).Trims did not mean that individual mutual funds within the family had lost faith totally with individual stocks. Home Depot, a Q4 trim, remained a top-10 position in some of American Funds' largest portfolios.Home Depot was a top-10 holding by $84.9 billion Fundamental Investors (ANCFX), whose 10 biggest positions also included Amazon. Three net new buys — Broadcom, Microsoft and energy equipment and field services company Schlumberger (SLB) — were also top-10 positions in the fund, according to Rosenbluth.The $90.6 billion American Funds Washington Mutual Investors (AWSHX) also had top-10 positions in Home Depot, Microsoft and Schlumberger.While Schlumberger was prominent in some individual funds, American Funds overall also made Q4 net big buys in integrated energy giant Chevron (CVX), boosting its share count by 4.8% to 70 million by the end of Q4.The fund group also boosted its share count in Royal Dutch Shell by 7.3% to 96 million.American Funds trimmed its share counts in several consumer-staples stalwarts. It trimmed 15% of its shares in household products giant Procter& Gamble (PG), soft drink leader Coca-Cola (KO) by 9.2% to 234 million and tobacco company Philip Morris International (PM) by 4.1% to 157 million.RELATED:Despite Brief Jitters, Investors Still Favor Online Leaders And Infrastructure PlaysMutual Fund Managers Cite Tech, Financial, Energy And Industrial Names They Like For '17

137,KO,"Two exchange traded funds that offer market-beating dividends are in new high ground and hovering near their buy points.SPDR S&P Dividend (SDY) climbed past a 90.02 flat-base buy point intraday Friday, before settling just below the entry. On Monday, it closed fractionally lower. The current three-month pattern began forming two weeks after a February breakout from a flat base. It advanced 2% between the two bases.X The $15.6 billion fund tracks the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index, which comprises companies that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years.SDY is underperforming the broader market this year with a 5.5% return through June 2 vs. the S&P 500's 9.9% gain, according to Morningstar Inc. The ETF's five-year average annual return is 15.8%, closer to the S&P 500's 16.3%. But over a 10-year period, SDY has returned an average of 7.6%, just ahead of the S&P 500's 7%.The ETF's annualized dividend yield is 2.5%, ahead of the benchmark index's 1.9% payout. Top holdings in the fund include AT&T (T), Target (TGT) and AbbVie (ABBV). The three companies offer annualized dividend yields of 5%, 4.3% and 3.8% respectively. Also making SDY's top 10 is a longtime Warren Buffett favorite, Coca-Cola (KO), which is paying out an annualized 3.2% of its Friday stock price.WisdomTree LargeCap Dividend (DLN), which tracks the index of the same name, also owns Coca-Cola. It holds several other Buffett stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). The underlying index is made up of large-cap stocks that are weighted by the value of the dividend the company is projected to pay the next year.The fund, launched in June 2006, has attracted $1.95 billion in assets. It's slightly underperformed the S&P 500 index with YTD, five-year and 10-year average annual returns of 6.9%, 14.5% and 6.15%, respectively. DLN's annualized yield is 2.4%.Shares cleared an 84.59 flat-base entry on Friday and closed Monday a penny below the buy point. The ETF gained 4% from its prior flat-base breakout in February to the start of the current pattern in March.Checking in on Monday's ETF picks, the four India-focused funds closed largely unchanged to remain in buy range from recent rebounds off their respective 50-day lines. They are: iShares MSCI India (INDA), PowerShares India Portfolio (PIN), VanEck Vectors India Small-Cap (SCIF) and WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI).RELATED:These 4 Plays Offer Chances To Ride India's Stock Market RallyMiss Thursday's Breakouts? 2 Fresh Ideas As Market Hits Highs2 ETFs On Breakout Watch Hold Buffett Dividend Stocks

139,KO,"The stock market closed mixed Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average lagging the major indexes.The Dow closed 0.2% lower while the S&P 500 edged up 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite gained less than 0.2%. The S&P and Nasdaq erased mild losses earlier in the day, continuing a pattern of mild price changes.Small caps lagged again, with the Russell 2000 dropping about 0.2%.

The RV manufacturer surged past the 106.43 buy point and closed in buy range. But the base is a later-stage pattern, and volume was less than enthusiastic on the breakout. An analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co. upgraded Thor to outperform from neutral, citing optimism among dealers and upside potential on margins, according to TheFly.com.Steel, heavy-construction and some other cyclical stocks lagged.

Kent, who turns 65 next year, will remain chairman.The move will put the London-born executive in charge of the world's largest soft-drink company at a time when it's adapting to shifting consumer tastes.Many consumers in the U.S. and other developed countries are shying away from sugary beverages, putting pressure on Coke to diversify its lineup. During his two decades at the company, Quincey helped introduce smaller package sizes and other initiatives to cut the calories of its beverages.Coke shares were up 2.5% to 41.93 in morning trades. Coke had fallen 4.6% this year through Thursday.Warren Buffett, Coke's biggest investor, praised the incoming CEO.""I know James and like him, and believe the company has made a smart investment in its future with his selection,"" Buffett said in the statement.

143,KO,"Coca-Cola (KO) will pay $3.15 billion to buy Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) out of an African bottling joint venture after the Budweiser brewer's takeover of the U.S. beverage company's partner in the region.Wednesday's  announcement comes just over two months after the companies said they were in negotiations following AB InBev's completion of its takeover of SABMiller. Coca-Cola also agreed to buy AB InBev's interest in bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras for an undisclosed sum.For Coca-Cola, the acquisition of AB InBev's 54.5% stake in the venture provides a firm footing in a region that is probably one of the last where it can grow its core soft drinks products, said Sasha Naryshkine, an analyst at Johannesburg-based money manager Vestact Ltd. The transaction continues AB InBev's asset pruning following its purchase of SABMiller, coming only days after the brewer agreed to sell its central and eastern European assets to Asahi Group Holdings Ltd.""Considering the speed that this deal was done I would expect AB InBev to continue selling noncore assets quickly,"" Naryshkine said. ""It's a good price for Coca-Cola.""The U.S. drinks maker is looking to speed up the refranchising of its bottling operations as it seeks to reduce exposure to facilities that are more capital-intensive and lower-margin.Consumer and retail companies reported $306 billion in mergers this year, a 45% decline on the $556 billion in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AB InBev agreed to buy SABMiller for about $100 billion, a deal included in last year's figures.Rothschild advised Coca-Cola on the bottling deal and Lazard advised AB InBev.The deal with AB InBev is subject to relevant regulatory and minority approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2017, the companies said. It was only this year that South Africa's Competition Tribunal gave approval for SABMiller and Coca-Cola to combine their drinks companies' bottling operations on the continent, ending an 18-month process.Anheuser-Busch inched up 0.3% by midday Wednesday.

144,KO,"As more states legalize pot, video games become more amazing, Netflix (NFLX) spends billions on new programming and GrubHub (GRUB) makes ordering out easier than ever, Jack in the Box (JACK) on Tuesday wrestled with a question that could become more crucial to fast-food chains: Can burgers and fries be delivered and still taste good and fresh?The answer, so far, appears to be: Maybe. Probably?Speaking at this year's ICR Conference, management at the burger chain said that it was too early to discuss specific results from a late-night delivery partnership it recently struck with GrubHub rival DoorDash in California. However, the company indicated that a lot of diners not only like their burgers and fries delivered after 11 p.m., they don't necessarily mind if the food loses a little something during its journey to their doorsteps.""Consumers are actually more forgiving when they're ordering burgers and fries at that time of night,"" management said during the presentation.Pizza, by contrast, has long been a delivery item and holds up relatively well. Domino's Pizza (DPZ), which took the lead on mobile ordering, has benefited as people order in.Consumers' growing interest in delivery comes as Jack in the Box has worked over the past year to improve the quality and consumer perception of its core — burgers, fries and soda — which an outside researcher the company hired said was ""really suffering.""""We're a burger player, but still our best-selling product is tacos,"" CEO Lenny Comma said during the presentation. ""So we're a little bit weird in that way.""Many felt Jack in the Box's burgers weren't juicy, that the fries weren't consistently delivered and that the drinks were watered down, the company said. The company said it had changed ingredients for the burgers, tweaked the salting and heating of the fries, added Coca-Cola (KO) Freestyle machines and adjusted the syrup-to-carbonated-water ratio in the soda.Jack in the Box's tacos, beguilingly, have apparently needed no improvement. Some 554 million Jack in the Box tacos, which have been described as ""a wet envelope of cat food"" in the Wall Street Journal, are sold each year.IBD'S TAKE: Jack in the Box isn't the only restaurant chain trying to figure out what new delivery options mean for its business. Domino's Pizza CEO Patrick Doyle said the pizza chain was also closely watching services like GrubHub and Uber Eats. After a year focusing on better ingredients, the company said it would focus on new products this year. As bigger rivals compete more easily on value, Jack in the Box said its sales growth has come from its limited-time offerings and breakfast and late-night items, rather than from discounting.Jack in the Box and DoorDash announced their late-night delivery partnership in October. Under that partnership, food can be delivered as late as 3 a.m.""Unlike the daytime hours and the responsibilities that come with them, we believe that late night should be reserved for doing the things our guests enjoy the most,"" Iwona Alter, Jack in the Box's vice president of marketing, said then. ""Whether you're binge-watching your favorite show or gaming with friends, there's no need to stop the fun just because you're hungry!""Shares of Jack in the Box closed up 2% at 109.99 on the stock market today, and the stock continues to be one of the restaurant industry's stronger performers. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), which also presented at ICR, jumped 4.9% on strengthening same-store sales trends. Dave & Buster's (PLAY), another ICR presenter today, edged up 0.1%.

145,KO,"U.S. stock indexes posted modest gains Friday afternoon, as biotech stocks tried to rebound from a recent Trump-inspired dive.The Nasdaq, S&P 500 and the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average each gained 0.3%. The small-cap Russell 2000 inched down 0.1%. Volume in the stock market today was running lower on both major exchanges.Biotech stocks gained 1% after taking a 3% hit Wednesday. President-elect Donald Trump made some critical comments Wednesday on drug prices, rattling the high-end drugmakers.Biogen (BIIB), one of the big players in the group, rose 4% Friday but reversed lower to a 1% decline. A report leaked Thursday revealed progress on an Alzheimer's drug. Over the past five years, Biogen has spent 19% to 26% of its annual revenue on research and development. Any forced cuts in drug prices could lead to R&D cuts and thereby make new drugs scarcer.In addition to biotechs, pockets of strength were found in laggard groups Friday.Newspapers, book publishers and drugstores rose. Despite frequent anti-media comments from Trump, the newspaper stocks are up smartly since the election. The industry group is ranked 85 out of 197 groups and was No. 148 four weeks ago.For instance, the stock of the The New York Times Company (NYT) is up 25% since the Election Day close. And while Trump tweeted Nov. 13 that the Times was ""losing thousand of subscribers"" because of its ""inaccurate coverage"" of his movement, the Times pointed to a gain of 41,000 subscribers in the week following the election.On the downside Friday, the Trump trade appeared to be taking a break.  Steel makers and the cement group dropped. Banks, which may be as much a Federal Reserve play as a Trump play, retreated. The PowerShares KBW Bank (KBWB) ETF fell 0.7%.The losses among bank stocks, though, were mostly coming in diminished volume. That suggests digestion rather than an unwinding of the banks rally.In the IBD 50, declining issues led advancing issues by a 3-to-1 ratio. But gainers had an advantage in the blue chip Dow. Winners outnumbered losers by a 9-to-5 ratio.Blue chips have done better than the major averages in this uptrend. On Friday, Coca-Cola (KO) was the day's biggest gainer on the Dow. Coke popped 3% as it retook its 50-day line in heavy volume. The company announced CEO Muhtar Kent would step down May 1 and that Chief Operating Officer James Quincey would move up to the CEO spot.Coca-Cola is trading 10% off its April high and features a dividend with a 3.3% annualized yield.RELATED:3D Printing Taps 4th Industrial RevolutionIs Arista Poised To Pounce On An Opportunity?

147,KO,"The election of Donald Trump has propelled the Dow Jones Industrial Average ever closer to 20,000, with the possibility of infrastructure improvements, a stronger economy and fewer regulations offering the biggest boost to four stocks: Caterpillar (CAT), UnitedHealth (UNH), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS). Chevron (CVX), the index's fifth biggest gainer, has risen in tandem with oil prices.The Dow overall has risen more than 14% in 2016. All five of these stocks have more than doubled that performance.Heavy construction and mining equipment giant Caterpillar has led with a 39.1% gain year to date. Shares rose 0.2% to 94.55 Tuesday after taking off since Election Day.After battling weak international demand from construction and low commodity prices, Caterpillar is among the many companies that could see more business come its way if Trump's promise to upgrade the U.S.' aging roads, bridges and buildings goes forward as planned, not to mention increased mining activity.Caterpillar has suffered several quarters of sharply declining earnings and revenue, so easier comparisons and hopes for the future have definitely fueled Caterpillar's stock.RELATED:Caterpillar: 2017 Earnings Estimates Too OptimisticUnitedHealth, the nation's largest health insurer, has surged more than 38% so far this year. Shares fell 0.2% to 162.64 on the stock market today. The stock touched an all-time high on Dec. 16.Many on Wall Street expect Trump and a GOP-controlled Congress to act quickly in dismantling much of the Affordable Care Act, whose exchanges haven't delivered the profits or stability many health insurers had hoped for. UnitedHealth, whose profits this were also dented by a tax implemented by the law, already had planned to largely walk away from the exchange marketplaces next year.United's stock-market gains also come as more people get older and spend more on health care. Analysts also say that United's health services division, Optum, has helped lift the company's profits.RELATED:UnitedHealth, The Amazon Of Health Care, Isn't Sweating TrumpThe big U.S. banks, after being used during the campaign as a shorthand for the global elite, are also way up following Trump's election. Goldman Sachs, has risen more than 34% to a nine-year high, wiping away the declines it has suffered since the recession. JPMorgan is up 32% this year to all-time bests.IBD'S TAKE: As the Dow pushes higher following, so has consumer sentiment. The Consumer Confidence Index is at a 15-year high. Wall Street expects Trump and the GOP to cut away regulations the Obama industry placed on the financial industry in attempt to prevent another Lehman-esque crisis. Steven Mnuchin, Trump's choice to run the Treasury Department, has said he wanted to ""strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending.""Trump's plans to cut taxes and potentially boost infrastructure spending could boost demand. Increased demand has raised expectations for more inflation, which has pushed up longer-term bond yields as investors try to compensate for the dollar's declining buying power over time.The spread between short- and long-term bond yields has widened on expectations of a Trump fiscal boost and Federal Reserve rate hikes. That should boost banks' net interest margins. But rising short-term bond yields also may boost banks via credit card debt and other borrowing tied to the short end.JPMorgan climbed 0.1% to 87.13 Tuesday. Goldman Sachs, whose big fixed-income, currency and commodities desk could get a boost from extra volatility, inched up 0.2% to 241.56.RELATED:If These Blue Chip Banks Offer New Entries, Block Out Emotions; They Add RiskChevron, up 31.4% this year, has risen sharply since October as oil prices recover as world producers show more willingness to cut production. Shares fell 0.2% to 118.22 Tuesday.Exxon Mobil (XOM), the other Big Oil member of the Dow, has gained more than 16%.Goldman Sachs and some other analysts have argued that Chevron is in a better position than Exxon to boost production with crude prices back above $50 a barrel.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) is the Dow's biggest stock, but it's been a relative laggard, up more than 11% so far in 2016. But over the last six months, Apple has shot up roughly 28%, and is nearing a buy point.

151,KO,"Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are facing a wave of new soda taxes after it appeared four U.S. cities would pass the measures in Tuesday's election, part of an escalating war on sugary drinks.Proposals to slap a 1-cent-per-ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages are poised to pass in the California Bay Area cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Albany. In Boulder, Colo., meanwhile, a 2-cents-per-ounce tax was leading. Cook County, which includes Chicago, also has a similar penny-per-ounce tax written into its proposed 2017 budget.The levies bring fresh headaches to soda companies already coping with a shift in consumer tastes away from their core products. Per-capita soda consumption in the U.S. fell to a 30-year low in 2015, according to data compiled by Beverage Digest, a trade publication. But both Coke (KO) and PepsiCo (PEP) announced plans to deal with their sugar problems last month, including a move toward smaller beverage sizes.The new taxes underscore the need to take more dramatic action, according to Ali Dibadj, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.""It clearly accelerates it,"" he said on Tuesday. ""Soda taxes just add to the impetus for them to be mindful of price mix as an element of growth and innovations and other things,"" rather than just focusing on increasing volumes.The American Beverage Association, an industry trade group, said on Wednesday that it respected the decision of voters.""Our energy remains squarely focused on reducing the sugar consumed from beverages — engaging with prominent public health and community organizations to change behavior,"" the association said in a statement.Before the votes on Tuesday, Philadelphia and Berkeley, Calif., were the only U.S. cities to have similar measures on the books. Philadelphia became the first major city to pass such a tax in June after proponents changed tactics to focus on badly needed funding rather than health benefits.Since 2009, there have been more than 40 attempts to enact a soda tax in cities across the U.S.More than $40 million was spent on the battle over sugary drinks in the San Francisco Bay Area, $20 million of which came from the American Beverage Association, a trade group representing the big beverage companies, according to Bloomberg BNA.Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg gave more than $18 million to campaigns in support of the Oakland and San Francisco soda tax initiatives, finance records show. Bloomberg is the founder of Bloomberg LP, the parent organization of Bloomberg News.The latest ballot victories mean a large swath of the Bay Area — with the bordering cities of San Francisco, Oakland, Berkeley and Albany — all embracing a similar policy.The amount of industry spending makes it clear that the soda companies think the taxes put a lot at stake, according to Marion Nestle, a New York University nutrition professor and author of ""Soda Politics: Taking on Big Soda (and Winning)."" These taxes will also inspire other communities to follow suit.""Why would you put millions and millions and millions of dollars into fighting this in every community that is coming up with one of these if you didn't think it would make a difference and a big one,"" she said. ""It will have an enormous impact.""

154,KO,"U.S. companies will devote $150 billion in repatriated overseas cash for stock repurchases next year if Congress enacts President-elect Donald Trump's proposal to lower taxes on such moves, says Goldman Sachs.The top five overseas cash holders are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL),  Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Oracle (ORCL).Trump has proposed a one-time tax cut for the repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas, with tax rates falling from 35% to 10%. This plan would indeed spur companies to bring back overseas cash, says Goldman Sachs.In 2017, for only the second time in 20 years, stockrepurchases will account for the largest share of cash used by S&P 500 companies, forecasts Goldman Sachs. Share buybacks will rise by 30% to $780 billion in 2017, says the investment bank.IBD's TAKE: Apple has been raising its dividend aggressively. On Nov. 10, the iPhone and MacBook giant paid 57 cents a share in cash to shareholders. Learn more at IBD's Income Investor.""We estimate that $150 billion out of $780 billion of S&P 500 buybacks in 2017 will be driven by repatriated overseas cash,"" said Goldman Sachs in a research report. ""We forecast that S&P 500 companies will repatriate close to $200 billion of their $1 trillion of total overseas cash in 2017, which will be directed primarily toward share repurchases.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, by far the most of any company. No. 2 is Microsoft at $113 billion, then comes Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Alphabet at $49 billion.Biotech companies with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report.

155,KO,"Soft drink icon Coca-Cola (KO) posted third-quarter earnings on Wednesday that beat analyst estimates, helped by new beverages like sports drinks and sales of smaller, more-profitable package sizes, and shares got a lift in early trading.Adjusted earnings were 49 cents a share, the Atlanta-based company said in a prepared statement, ahead of analyst views for 48 cents. And while sales fell 6.9% to $10.6 billion, that beat analysts' $10.5 billion average projection.With consumers in developed markets abandoning soda for healthier beverages, Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has changed Coca-Cola's focus from boosting sales volume to increasing profit. His $3 billion cost-cutting initiative -- as well as a push to get consumers to buy smaller bottles and cans that sell for a higher price per ounce -- have supported earnings. And Coca-Cola has even managed to boost sales in some regions, with revenue in North America gaining 3.3%.""We're getting good revenue growth by focusing on smaller packs in sparkling, by innovation, new marketing, but we're also being innovative,"" Chief Operating Officer James Quincey said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.The company reaffirmed its earnings and sales forecasts for the year. Adjusted profit per share will decline 4% to 7% from last year. Organic revenue -- which excludes acquisitions, divestitures and currency exchange-rate fluctuations -- will increase 3%.Coca-Cola shares were up 0.7% in morning trades.Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) have faced declining sales volumes as consumers shun sugary drinks. Per capita soda consumption in the U.S. fell to a three-decade low in 2015, according to data from Beverage Digest, a trade publication.Some municipal governments are turning against soda, too. Last month, Philadelphia became the first major U.S. city to pass a tax on diet and sugar-added beverages. Soda taxes are on the ballot this November in the California Bay Area cities of San Francisco and Oakland, as well as Boulder, Colo.To help deal with consumer and government backlash toward its core soda business, Coca-Cola has diversified its portfolio of beverages to add bottled waters, juices, coffees and teas. It also has made investments in juice company Suja Life LLC, aloe-water maker L.A. Aloe LLC and dairy company Fairlife. Coca-Cola is partnering with Dunkin' Donuts to expand its presence in the U.S. bottled iced-coffee market.Sales volume for non-soda drinks, which Coca-Cola refers to as still beverages, rose 2% in North America last quarter, driven by water and sports drinks. Volume for sparkling beverages on the continent was ""slightly positive,"" the company said. Pricing in the North American soda business rose 3%, helped by the smaller-package strategy.

156,KO,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59.

158,KO,"Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) says franchisees are dragging their feet in opening new stores amid concerns about a higher minimum wage and the outcome of the coming election.The doughnut and coffee chain, which opened up 61 stores in the third quarter compared with 91 in the year-ago quarter, told Wall Street analysts on Thursday that it now expects to wind up at the low end of its target of 430 to 460 stores opened for the full year.The news comes just days after a survey of McDonald's (MCD) franchisees found growing tensions with the parent company, with the independent operators complaining of too much discounting even as wage pressures are growing and sales growth has slowed.Both developments highlight the difficulty digesting big wage hikes for quick-service chains that get most of their revenue from the royalties paid by franchisees. While franchise agreements differ from company to company, they all generally deliver a fixed percentage of sales to the parent company, regardless of the underlying profitability of the restaurants.Dunkin' Brands CEO Nigel Travis specifically mentioned a New York franchisee that put on hold consideration of opening another location after the state passed a law raising the minimum wage in the fast-food industry to $15 an hour, by 2019 in New York City and July 2021 in the rest of the state.IBD'S TAKE: Read why the push for a $15 minimum wage may expose underlying issues in the franchise agreements of McDonald's and other fast-food chains.Wendy's (WEN) said in an August conference call that it had tabled plans to franchise out its company-operated stores in the New York area, though management didn't elaborate on how the wage hike affected the decision.Travis related a conversation he had with a franchisee in one state that he wouldn't name: ""You're going to open one store this year, why don't you open two? And their response was, uncertainty, regulation, we don't know where the minimum wage is going.""Travis summed up the shift this way: ""What is driving franchisees towards the lower end is several factors and I've described it, put it together as uncertainty, as uncertainty over the general election, Senate, obviously, the House and local elections.""Hillary Clinton has backed an increase in the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour, but at times she has spoken favorably about raising the wage to $15. Still, Republicans remain solid favorites to retain the control of the House, so any big federal minimum-wage increase looks doubtful at the moment. Yet other states and municipalities could decide to follow the path of New York, California, Seattle and Washington, D.C., in boosting their own minimum wage.When Wal-Mart (WMT) pulled the plug on two planned store openings in D.C. in January, the retail giant reportedly told local officials that the city's consideration of a $15 wage was among the reasons.A study of Seattle's minimum-wage hike by University of Washington researchers found that the first-year rise in the minimum wage to $11 an hour was ""offset by modest reductions in employment and hours, thereby limiting the extent to which higher wages directly translated into higher average earnings.""Dunkin' stood by its forecast of 4%-6% U.S. growth in 2017. Still, it generally takes about 12 to 18 months to open a Dunkin' franchise, so major shifts in franchise growth in the short term are unlikely.To help make franchising economics work, Dunkin' management noted plans to share profits with franchisees related to its partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) to market ready-to-drink beverages in supermarkets and convenience stores starting early next year.RELATED:Dunkin' Earnings Growth Picks Up, But Sales Dip UnexpectedlyFast Food Pickle: Eating In Is Now Even CheaperMcDonald's Franchisees Are In A Funk — Like Its Stock

161,KO,"The 26th annual Schwab Impact conference kicked off at the San Diego Convention Center on Monday, spotlighting investing themes for 2017 and the strategies without which investment advisors risk being left behind.Here are some key take-aways from the event, which drew roughly 4,000 attendees and concludes Thursday:Earnings will grow in 2017, likely in the single digits and almost certainly not in the double-digit numbers that are being bandied about as corporate profits turn around, Jeffrey Kleintop, chief global investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said in Monday's keynote speech.The political rhetoric surrounding the November presidential election has some investors worrying about the multinationals in their stock portfolios, but Kleintop called the fears overdone.""The death of free trade has been greatly overstated,"" he said, describing any pullback in multinational stocks as a potential buying opportunity. It is especially reassuring to him that earnings growth across sectors globally looks fairly balanced, with no bubble in any one segment.Investors wondering where exactly to put their money to work internationally should consider Canada — ""one big levered energy ETF"" -- as well as Japan — ""one big financial ETF,"" Kleintop said.While Canada's biggest sector is financials, not energy, the banks are big lenders to the nation's massive natural resources industry and tend to track oil prices too, he explained.Meanwhile, Japan's stock market tends to tracks banks even though consumer discretionary is its biggest sector. A steeper yield curve may help to lift the Japanese stock market, an underperformer so far in 2016, Kleintop said.ETFs that offer exposure to multinationals include the S&P 500 trackers such as Vanguard 500 (VOO), as well as the more international First Trust Dow Jones Global Select Dividend (FGD).IShares MSCI Canada (EWC) and iShares MSCI Japan (EWJ) are among the most popular ETFs to target the respective countries.For U.S. stocks to break out of their range, earnings have to improve, especially for the large U.S. multinationals, one investing strategist told IBD on the sidelines of the Impact event.IBD's TAKE: For a quick look at how high your stocks' earnings rate, run them through Stock Checkup.""I expect one more leg up"" for the stock market, said Luciano Siracusano, WisdomTree's chief investment strategist. He believes that a move higher will require some fiscal stimulus too, in the form of infrastructure spending or tax reforms to spur the repatriation of corporate money stashed abroad.""That's the kind of thing companies would likely use for stock buybacks and raising dividends, which would be another catalyst"" for the stock market, he said.The earnings contraction is starting to bottom out in emerging markets (EM) as well as in the U.S., according to Siracusano. Many countries in this asset class are commodity driven and have benefited from this year's oil rally.Siracusano sees little reason to favor one single EM market over another right now. ETFs offering broadly diversified exposure to emerging markets include WisdomTree Emerging Markets High Dividend (DEM), which yields 4.90%.If rates head higher in 2017, as they seem likely to do, currency hedging could be hot again after a long hiatus, according to Siracusano.Currency hedged ETFs tend to outperform nonhedged peers when the local currency slides against the greenback. Rate hikes would strengthen the U.S. dollar and further weaken the yen, for example, benefiting Japan's export-heavy markets.Japan stock ETFs have already rallied strongly since July 8, as the yield on U.S. 10-Year Treasury notes started to move back up and the Japanese currency weakened.Amid those shifts, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity Fund (DXJ) edged out its unhedged rival EWJ with a 10.8% gain in the third quarter.Domestically, a tactical tilt toward the economically sensitive technology and financial sectors could pay off if rates were to rise. Siracusano advised investors to focus on quality companies in these areas.""You want to be conscious of the creditworthiness of companies"" at this late stage of the market cycle, he said.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) is an ETF investing in companies with high earnings expectations and has a roughly 20% portfolio stake in the technology sector.Its top three holdings are Coca-Cola (KO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL).In breakout education sessions, audience members discussed the outlook for advisory services, cybersecurity standards and the millennial opportunity, among other topics.The commodification of investment management by ETF-based roboadvisors and asset managers, such as Betterment and Schwab's subsidiary Windhaven, came under special scrutiny. Some panelists said the trend was forcing the advisor industry toward being more planning-centric.One Schwab expert pointed out that successful financial advisors have evolved with the marketplace over the past 20 years — initially from a role that involved pure investment management to wealth management, and now to what is described as lifestyle management.Financial advisors have to find ways to differentiate themselves as competitors encroach upon the value they provide to investors, said Jon Beatty, Schwab's senior vice president of advisor services.""This is a profession that's on the move,"" he added, describing ""lifestyle management"" as an umbrella term for new services such as generational wealth transfer, executive relocation and retirement downsizing.RELATED:Latest News On ETFs On The Move

"
168,KO,"Boston Red Sox designated hitter David Ortiz -- productive though ancient at age 40 among Major League Baseball players -- says he will retire after the season that is now nearing its end. But don't count on it. Big Papi may say he won't subject his aching feet and tired legs to the rigors of another 162-game season in uniform. Yet the aging, widely liked slugger will likely actively keep earning income as the pitchman for such product as MasterCard (MA), JetBlue (JBLU), Coca-Cola (KO) and Dunkin' Donuts (DNKN).And surely the Red Sox or some other ballclub will consider hiring Ortiz -- whose 536 career home runs rank 17 on the MLB all-time four-bagger list -- as a hitting coach.If Ortiz does keep drawing paychecks, he will be hanging up his spikes the same way that 70% of Americans who are still working want to: by working as long as possible during ""retirement,"" according to a new Bankrate.com (RATE) survey.The survey also found that 26% of Americans plan to work because they like it. Twenty-five percent said they will work because they need the money. And 19% they will continue to work for both reasons -- they like it and they need the income.Only 25% said they have no plans to work during retirement.Dreams of early retirement also seem to be fading. Only 13% of nonretired people who were surveyed said they hope to head to the postgame showers in their fifties. That was less than half of the respondents who were aiming to retire in their fifties when the question was asked in 2007.IBD'S TAKE: What if you're forced to retire early? Here's nuts-and-bolts advice about how to cope if it happens, how to prepare in advance financially.Still, as that popular but aging band of geriatrics known as the Rolling Stones once sang, you can't always get what you want. Most workers by far lack Ortiz's existing roster of endorsement clients. Only 17% of retirees find a job, according to the Society of Actuaries.So what are some real-world, practical steps you can take to land a paying position during your golden years?IBD'S TAKE: This IBD report explains ways to cut your debt and boost your income during retirement to make retirement more affordable.Cornfield's point is that many people have business and community connections that they can milk. If you are not already plugged into other organizations, look around for volunteer opportunities to get the process started.Post notices of your availability in local stores, the community center and in your local newspaper.""Tutors in New York City can make over $100,000 a year,"" Cornfield said. ""Even if you're making $15 to $35 an hour in a less heated market, that is very good for people with solid skills who like to teach.""""Chances are you can undercut high-cost professionals,"" Cornfield said. Post notices in your community calendar or community center. If you live in a large retirement community, odds are that you'll be handier, better known and lower cost than the professional repairman who lives a couple of miles away. ""This can be a gold mine,"" Cornfield said.What more could you ask for? RELATED:How Much Retirement Spending Can You Afford?The Money Move That 75% Of Retirees Wish They Had Made

170,KO,"The Summer Games aren't just a noble gathering of the world's athletic elite: The event is also a marketing gold mine for official brand partners and sponsors of individual athletes.And perhaps more so in 2016 than in prior Olympic years, trying to harness the life force of the internet can lead to unpredictable results, thanks to an often-rowdy digital commentariat on Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Snapchat and elsewhere. Brands can emerge from the melee as social-media stars or as sore losers.So here's a glimpse at how Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE) and others are performing in Rio so far:Not Coke's fault, but the soft drink giant got mixed up in a PR debacle when an Olympian from Egypt told NPR that there was no coffee in the Olympic Village, because it was a Coca-Cola-only zone.The story went semi-viral. The New York Daily News, Business Insider, Fusion and others picked up on the NPR segment -- Cosmopolitan even grouped it under a listicle called ""11 Rio Olympic Village Horror Stories.""Spokespeople from Coca-Cola, an official worldwide sponsor of the Games, told several of those outlets that no, the athletes aren't limited to Coke products and yes, there is coffee in Olympic Village, but the damage had been done.That's probably not what gold feels like.Shares rose 0.3% to 43.75 on the stock market today. Coca-Cola stock has been trading below its 200-day average since reporting Q2 results late last month.The Big Mac maker is doing lots of feel-good stuff around the Olympics -- it sent kids to the opening ceremony! Its McNuggets are pink-slime-free! -- but you can trust hungry, tired reporters to weed out the real news: there's no McDonald's in Olympic Park.According to USA Today, Olympiads of years past have prominently featured a McD's in the press center. But McDonald's told the paper that it wanted to get into the local spirit and feature dessert stands instead, of which there are 2,500 in Brazil.There is, however, a full-service McDonald's in Olympic Village. And it is very, very popular with the athletes.Line out the door at McDonald's in Olympic Athletes Village (via @JohnBranchNYT) pic.twitter.com/HJQrxqcP2k— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) August 9, 2016Shares rose 0.5% to 119.38 Thursday.

173,KO,"Monster Beverage (MNST) should report strong second-quarter earnings and revenue growth when it reports results Thursday, despite some analyst warnings.Analysts see Monster's second-quarter earnings jumping 30.4% to $1.03 per share and sales up nearly 16% to $804.1 million.But last month, Wells Fargo downgraded Monster Beverage to market perform from outperform, warning on lower-than-expected sales and no new products until the fourth quarter.Monster is planning to launch its products in China later this year but warned during its first-quarter conference call that the launch could be delayed by regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.Monster has been expanding its presence abroad and during the first quarter made market share gains in Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden as it continues to battle for market against European favorite Red Bull.IBD'S TAKE: Monster Beverage shares are in buy range despite a mini-selloff on the Wells Fargo note as energy drinks continue to gain popularity in the U.S. and overseas. The company has held a place on IBD's Leaderboard since early June. Much of Monster's international growth has come from Coca-Cola's (KO) ownership stake in the company.But the U.S. has the biggest energy drink market in the world. Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar, said in an earlier interview that U.S. energy drink volumes will continue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits in the foreseeable future.Monster Beverage stock rose 0.3% to 161.08 on the stock market today, just in range from a 154.06 entry point.

175,KO,"It was a busy week for business, economic and investing news. The stock market came under more pressure as Apple (AAPL) reported its first sales decline since 2003, while Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) turned on the gas. The Federal Reserve signaled it's in no rush to raise rates, while the U.S. economy crawls.The market rally came under more pressure amid a slew of earnings reports and big economic news. The Nasdaq tumbled 2.7% for the week, falling through its 200-day line on Thursday and its 50-day average on Friday, as losers such as Apple, Twitter (TWTR) and First Solar (FSLR) trumped big gains for Facebook and Amazon. The S&P 500 and Dow are well above those support levels, but also tumbled, with all of the losses coming Thursday-Friday. Oil prices continued to march higher, helped by a weaker dollar and further declines in U.S. production. The 10-year Treasury yield gave up much of its recent gains.How healthy are shares of Amazon and Facebook, and how do they compare to rivals? Find out at IBD Stock CheckupThe tech titan certainly wasn't a growth company in its fiscal second quarter, reporting its first revenue decline since 2003 as iPhone unit sales tumbled. Earnings per share fell 18%, worse than expected. And Apple gave weak guidance for the current quarter. Apple hasn't had a huge product since the big-screen iPhone 6, and smartphone sales generally are stagnating. At this point Apple is so huge it will be hard for a new product to really move the needle.In another sign of its shift from rapid growth to a more mature model, Apple added an additional $50 billion to its shareholder return program, with more buybacks and a higher dividend.Meanwhile, activist investor Carl Icahn decided to cash out of Apple stock, and so did others. Apple stock fell 11.3% for the week, nearly settling at its worst close since mid-2014.Apple chip suppliers generally fared relatively well, in part due to diversifying away from Apple or smartphones generally.Apple Investors Worry Glory Days Are OverThe Federal Reserve, as expected, voted to leave interest rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting and gave no hints that it would tighten before the fall at the earliest. The Fed noted that labor markets have strengthened even as economic growth slowed. And that's true, for now. The U.S. economy rose at a 0.5% annual rate in the first quarter, the weakest in two years. Meanwhile, jobless claims are near 42-year lows. If the economy is barely growing, it's hard to see how the U.S. can continue to add 200,000 jobs a month. But that's what analysts are expecting in Friday's April employment report.The Fed's go-slow approach -- coupled with the Bank of Japan's unexpected decision not to increase its stimulus efforts -- pushed the dollar to big losses. That could boost U.S. multinationals' profits and give a further lift to dollar-priced oil and other commodities.The e-commerce giant sees Q2 sales of $28 billion-$30.5 billion, largely above Wall St. views and a 26% gain at the midpoint. While that would mark a slowdown from Q1's 28% pop, the highest in nearly 4 years, it would still be faster than what was typical the past three years. Q1 earnings also crushed estimates, as cloud unit Amazon Web Services remained hot. China's version of Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), reports Thursday.Alphabet (GOOGL) unit Google, Ford Motor (F), Uber, Lyft and Volvo announced Tuesday the formation of a coalition to advocate for self-driving cars. The lobbying effort comes as automakers race to develop autonomous technologies. Alphabet is in late-stage talks with Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) about a partnership regarding autonomous cars, according to multiple reports. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) already has self-driving features in its electric cars, but has not unveiled plans to join the coalition. Tesla will report earnings on Wednesday, with autonomous tech firm Mobileye (MBLY) out Thursday.Social networking kings Facebook and LinkedIn had a good week, as both posted Q1 earnings that topped estimates and sent the stocks higher. Facebook reported its third straight quarter of accelerating earnings and revenue growth. Despite concerns about slowing user engagement, advertisers are definitely using Facebook. Mobile advertising accounted for 82% of Facebook's $5.2 billion in ad revenue, up from 73% in Q1 2015. Facebook stock spiked Thursday to a record high of 120.71, but pulled back to close the week modestly above a 117.09 buy point.LinkedIn renewed investor confidence after a harrowing Q4 that saw its stock plunge 44%. LinkedIn turned in a solid Q1 earnings that investors applauded.With the U.S. and global economy growing at a tepid pace, companies are stressing cost cuts to prop up earnings as revenue flatlines or falls. In the latest week, defense contractor Lockheed Martin, snack giant  Mondelez International (MDLZ) and Procter & Gamble (PG) announced recent or new efforts to curb expenses, restructure or sell assets. They join the likes of Coca-Cola (KO)  and banking giants JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC). While cuts may help companies in the short run, they need stronger top-line growth to fuel earnings longer term.Shifting priorities for media companies came into play last week, as a handful of megamergers captured the spotlight and served as an attempt to keep growing or simply cling to survival. Cable and content titan Comcast (CMCSA) sought to grow in foreign markets via a $3.8 billion deal to buy DreamWorks Animation (DWA), the studio responsible for ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda."" Meanwhile, it looks like Comcast rival Charter Communications (CHTR) will be able to keep up, as its $55 billion bid to buy Time Warner Cable (TWC) won regulatory approval. But survival in the struggling newspaper industry was on the mind of USA Today parent Gannett (GCI) as it bid $815 million to buy Tribune Publishing (TPUB), owner of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune.Crude oil futures continued to rise, hitting 2016 highs. But Big Oil is still adjusting to lower prices. Saudi Arabia aims to reduce its oil dependence and float less than 5% of Saudi Aramco in an IPO, valuing the world’s largest oil company in excess of $2 trillion Meanwhile,  ConocoPhillips (COP) slashed its 2016 capital spending even further and BP (BP) said it was considering further cuts in '17.  Baker Hughes (BHI) warned that N. American rig counts still have room to fall, but the U.S. count may stabilize later this year. Chevron (CVX) swung to a loss in Q1. While U.S. production falls overall, output for most majors rose even as investment fell. Exxon (XOM) lost its AAA rating at S&P, but still kept its commitment to its dividend, raising it to 75 cents from 73 cents.Quarterly results from shale players Continental Resources (CLR), EOG (EOG) and Carrizo (CRZO) are out this week.Medical merger activity took off Thursday. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) inked a $25 billion buyout deal with cardiac device giant St. Jude Medical (STJ). Abbott's former biopharma arm AbbVie (ABBV) agreed to buy biotech startup Stemcentrx for $5.8 billion plus up to $4 billion in possible milestone payments. Big French pharma Sanofi (SNY) made an unsolicited $9.3 billion cash bid for smaller drugmaker Medivation (MDVN). Medivation rejected Sanofi's offer, but Sanofi vowed to press on, and Medivation's stock traded as if investors are expecting Sanofi (and perhaps another bidder) to go higher. Both Stemcentrx and Medivation are focused on cancer treatments, a field that has provided some of the biggest drug launches of recent years.Chipotle Mexican Grill's (CMG) recovery might be slow-going, with April same-store sales down 26% to date, surprising many. The burrito king logged its first-ever quarterly loss -- of 88 cents per share -- in Q1, though Wall Street expected worse. A revenue decline to $834.5 million missed views, as comps plummeted 29.7%.But another fast-casual chain, Panera Bread (PNRA), reported strong results. Its stock is setting up in a short consolidation going back to March 8.Burger King parent Restaurant Brands International (QSR) turned in mixed results, Domino's Pizza (DPZ) missed completely and Dunkin' Brands (DNKN) edged past forecasts.

176,KO,"Sidney Weinberg was 16 when the panic of 1907 gripped Wall Street, setting off bank runs and pushing firms into bankruptcy. The Brooklynite later admitted that he was fuzzy on exactly what was going on. “(It) meant no more to me than if you said it was raining,” he said, according to Charles Ellis’ book “The Partnership: The Making of Goldman Sachs.”But even then Weinberg had an uncanny sense of how to turn a situation to his advantage by providing solutions for investors. He found steady work holding spots in the lines of customers desperate to withdraw their money from the banks. That intuition and his smarts helped Weinberg (1891-1969) propel an investment firm called Goldman Sachs (GS) from a respectable spot on Wall Street to a dominant perch over all of 20th-century finance.According to Ellis' book, the boy who grew up poor and started as a janitor's assistant was worth $5 million when he died in 1969. That's worth nearly $36 million now -- and Ellis quoted Weinberg as saying that his earning power would have been so much more had he not been spending so much time serving on other corporations' boards.  He served on the boards of more than 30 corporations.After skipping school for a full week, Weinberg was expelled. Now the short, working-class Jewish youth who spoke in the broadest Brooklynese “needed a real job,” Ellis wrote. Weinberg set his sights on one of the tallest buildings on Wall Street. He rode the elevator to the top floor one morning and “stuck my head in every office and asked as politely as I could, ‘Want a boy?’ ”The best -- and only -- offer came from investing firm Goldman Sachs, where Weinberg was hired as a janitor’s assistant at $5 a week. He charmed his way into the mailroom and upward from there. By 1927, he was a partner, and by 1930, he was in charge of the investment bank that was heading for domination.In 2014, Goldman saw net revenue of $34.53 billion, and its annual growth rate has been about 15% since it first went public in 1999, according to its annual report. Prominent Goldman alumni include former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson and Robert Rubin, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi and Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney.While all those men have risen high, few rose as far from humble roots as Weinberg. His father, a Polish immigrant, sold wholesale liquor. Pincus Weinberg and his wife, Sophie, had 11 children before the matriarch died. Sidney was the third-oldest.Sidney was a hustler from the start, wrote Lisa Endlich in the 2000 book ""Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success”: “One part Horatio Alger, one part Sammy Glick, he entered the workforce at the age of 10, selling newspapers at the Manhattan-Brooklyn ferry terminal, shucking oysters and carrying feathers for a milliner.”Once inside Goldman Sachs, the young Weinberg found the work unglamorous. He cleaned cuspidors, brushed the partners’ silk hats and wiped mud from their boots. For years, Endlich wrote, neither Henry Goldman nor Sam Sachs, the duo who headed the firm, even knew the young man’s name; each simply called him “boy.”Soon, Sam’s son Paul, a partner in the firm, took an interest in Weinberg. He gave Weinberg $25 for coursework at New York University and put him in charge of the mailroom, where the young man improved its operations.Weinberg took a break from the bank to join the Navy as a cook in World War I and was transferred to a job inspecting cargo. After the war ended in 1918, he rejoined Goldman Sachs, working as a salesman for commercial paper accounts. “Soon he was forming syndicates to sell underwritings, determining the pricing of new issues and supervising trading,” Endlich wrote. In 1927, the “boy” from Brooklyn, now a 35-year-old man with a family, was made a partner.One of Weinberg’s first challenges as partner was reminiscent of his early days in the firm, when he’d cleaned up after others. In 1918, the firm had hired economist and banker Waddill Catchings to establish a trading operation. Catchings set up an investment trust that was so swamped with investor interest that an initial issuance of $40 million was upped to $100 million (worth $1.4 billion today). Stock in the trust was issued at $100; within five days it more than doubled. Goldman partners bought 10% of the issuance, a sum that represented nearly half the firm’s total capital, Ellis wrote.Then came the crash of 1929. The stock's high of $326 quickly plunged to $1.75. Goldman Sachs, which had a stake in the trust, suddenly owed tens of millions to banks. Weinberg had to act fast to liquidate some of the firm’s holdings to make good. Goldman wouldn’t regain the same $10 million level of capital until the mid-1950s.And there was more fallout.“As one of the greatest investing debacles of the 20th century, the outcome of the (trading operation) brought the Goldman Sachs name into disrepute,” Endlich wrote.Weinberg, noting that the company’s reputation was “really in tatters,” knew that reputation was just as crucial as money, Endlich told IBD: “His notion was that the name of the firm was the most important thing, and the way to maintain and restore it was this maniacal focus on clients. Weinberg worked with clients for decades.”Goldman Sachs would take decades to turn around while facing two huge hurdles: its shaken reputation and the Great Depression. Weinberg moved tentatively, setting up a municipal finance operation and a retail sales desk. “The firm steered clear of any major losses, but it also realized few gains,” Endlich wrote.Weinberg realized that his time was best spent where he was truly considered a winner: networking, meeting people and building useful relationships. His talent was apparent early on, when Weinberg supported Franklin D. Roosevelt for president in 1932. After winning, FDR asked Weinberg to create a Business Advisory and Planning Council composed of executives who would interface between government and the private sector during the New Deal.“FDR dubbed him 'the Politician' for his skill at mediating among contentious parties,” wrote Malcolm Gladwell in a 2008 New Yorker profile. “He was known as 'the Body Snatcher' because of the way he persuaded promising young business executives to join the war effort. (Weinberg seems to have been the first to realize that signing up promising young executives for public service during the war was the surest way to sign them up as clients after the war.)”And sign them up he did. Weinberg leveraged his vast network to get business for Goldman, particularly as an underwriter. A 1958 Time magazine profile noted, “His most recent success was selling $350 million of Sears, Roebuck debentures -- history's biggest debt offering -- in a bond market so soggy that some underwriters doubted the issue could be marketed at all.”Meanwhile, Weinberg focused his networking on Wall Street.
"
177,KO,"“He averaged 250 committee or board meetings a year, and when he was not in meetings, he would often take a steam at the Hotel Biltmore’s Turkish baths with the likes of Robert Woodruff, of Coca-Cola (KO), and Bernard Gimbel, of Gimbels,” Gladwell wrote.Weinberg established some enduring relationships, going so far as to take steam baths with some of the heads of the companies on whose boards he sat, Gladwell wrote. That was good for Goldman; it brought in business from corporate behemoths like General Electric (GE) and Owens Corning (OC). He also helped with a massive restructuring of Ford Motor (F).Weinberg was high-energy but also kind. A 1956 New Yorker profile called him “irrepressibly antic and unabashedly outspoken” but also recounted an anecdote about his learning of a former business rival who’d “run into hard times.” Weinberg responded by sending the man $100 a week the rest of his life.Weinberg married Helen Livingston, daughter of a dressmaker, in 1920, and the couple lived in Scarsdale, N.Y., with two sons, Sidney Jr. and John. Both became directors at Goldman, and John ran the firm from 1976 to 1990.Sidney Weinberg wasn't about to be locked into the status quo, Endlich said, and that gave him an edge: “Outsiders tend not to believe you have to do things the way they’ve always been done. He was open-minded enough to take the firm into new areas.”But in the end, Weinberg’s idea of success went hand in hand with Goldman’s.“He really believed Goldman Sachs was and could be much more than anyone else did at the time,” Endlich said.Built a world-class investing firm that dominated finance for decades, through to the present day.Overcame: Early investing mishaps that left the firm’s reputation and balance sheet in tatters.Lesson: Believe in the power of your relationships; build networks and do your civic duty.“Weinberg was Goldman Sachs, turning it from a floundering, midtier partnership into the premier investment bank in the world,” wrote Malcolm Gladwell.Related:J.P.

178,KO,"Stocks flew in mixed formation Friday morning as tech stocks took some hard hits after quarterly earnings reports.The Nasdaq swooned 0.8%. The Dow dipped a mild 0.1%, and the S&P 500 held effectively flat.Volume was mixed, down 19% on the NYSE but 23% higher on the Nasdasq than turnover at the same time Thursday.Earnings news was the big driver for the stock market today, but more weak manufacturing sector news also hit investors.London-based researcher Markit reported that the preliminary reading on April manufacturing purchasing managers index slipped to 50.8, still narrowly in expansion mode but down from March's 51.4 tally and below expectations for a gain to 52. New business growth stalled during the month, manufacturing employment showed its weakest gain since June 2013, and the overall number was the lowest reading in more than six years, Markit said.More than two thirds of the Dow stocks were positive, with Microsoft (MSFT) dragging hard to the downside with a 7% loss. Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan (JPM) and Coca-Cola (KO) led the list with gains of more than 1%.About 75% of the Nasdaq 100 traded higher at the open. But big declines from Microsoft, American Airlines Group (AAL) and Alphabet (GOOGL) held the index back.American tumbled 6% after reporting that its first-quarter earnings fell less than expected and revenue declined in line with forecasts. Management also launched a $2 billion share buyback program, but passenger revenue and yield both declined more than 7%. American has been struggling against resistance at its 40-week moving average for the past 12 months.Alphabet traded down nearly 5%. Its Q1 report late Thursday showed earnings and revenue growth just shy of analyst projections. The stock has been climbing since February, building the right side of a choppy four-month cup base. Friday's move backed shares up for a test of support at their 10-week moving average.Southwestern Energy (SWN) soared 17%. The natural gas producer reported after Thursday's close that its first quarter revenue declined 38%, much better than forecasts. An eight cent per share loss for the quarter also topped views. The move put the shale gas innovator 135% above a February low and back above its 40-week moving average for the first time since July 2014.Scripps Networks (SNI) led the IBD 50 list, jumping almost 3% in rising trade. The stock is finding support at its 10-week line but needs to form a base.Universal Display (OLED) was also in an upward mood, gaining nearly 3% in strong trade. It is just pennies below its high notched on Tuesday, extended 14% above a 54.78 buy point and 12% past an alternate entry point at 56.01.

182,KO,"Venerable blue chip Coca-Cola (KO) is trading near a new high after raising its dividend and being on the receiving end of kind words from an analyst. The company announced Feb. 18 it was raising its dividend to 35 cents a share, up from 33 cents. The first payment will be made April 1 to shareholders of record March 15.…
"
183,KO,"So yesterday at about 3 pm EST the news hit the tape, the twitter sphere and the media outlets.....Headlines screamed:***BREAKING NEWS – SUNDAY APRIL 17, 2016 - ***Failure In Qatar - OPEC ministers unable to come to an agreement - oil mkts began to tremble - investors/traders now had to re-assess the reality of a fractured oil mkt......Oil which has rallied 18% from the early April lows and 30% off of the January lows and are now front and center as Asian mkts prepared to open - initial reactions saw oil plunge 6% as investors hit the sell button first only to ask questions later.....the headlines saturated the web.....who would be first to announce this failure and then the resulting mkt action? The headlines began...""Doha Summit Fails to Agree on Output Freeze""""Oil Freeze Talks End in Failure Amid Saud Demands Over Iran""""Oil Tumbles 5% on Doha Deal Disappointment""""Asia Stocks at Mercy of Post Doha Oil Moves""""Oil's Grand Bargain Falls Victim to Saudi Arabia's Iran Fixation""Futures around the globe plunged as day turned to night and the sun began to set in the US just as it began to rise across Asia….US futures were down 11 pts at 8 pm Sunday evening – while futures across Asia pointed in a similar direction as investors dealt with the fallout. News stories began detailing the talks that took place in Doha – the Qatari capital – which dragged on and on – going some 10 hrs past the original scheduled end time – as ""Howie Mandel"" shouted out –No Deal!Oil ministers from 16 nations, representing 50% of the world's production, gathered in the Qatari capital as they worked towards stabilizing the global mkt with artificial production quotas - the first real attempt at coordinating output among OPEC members and nations outside of the group since 2001. The barriers were numerous - would everyone fall into line? Would Iran come to the table? Could they really commit to restraining production? As we know - the Saudi's made it very clear from the beginning......they wouldn't restrain their production without commitments from other major producers including Iran, which had already made it clear that they had no such intention.The breaking story about a failure to agree on output or production quotas among the world's biggest oil producers now opens the flood gates to what many now expect to be a new retreat in oil prices.""Discussions stumbled after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations wouldn't agree to any deal unless all OPEC members joined including Iran, which wasn't present at the meeting…""Angus Nicholson – an analyst at IG Ltd in Melbourne, Australia had this to say:""The market has been so heavily positioned for a deal to go through, The change of tone from the Saudis, particularly driven over the last few weeks by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has been quite a surprise to the market. With Saudi Arabia fighting proxy wars with Iran in Yemen and Syria/Iraq, it is understandable that they had little inclination to freeze their own production and make way for newly sanctions-free Iran to increase their market share.""So then what happened? Was there really a change in tone from the Saudi's? Did investors get this all wrong? Once the idea of a freeze was floated (two months ago) – trader types started buying up oil – as it was assumed that any freeze would trim supply just as summer was about to begin and the driving season was about to take off… Oil rallied 30% off the lows as the excitement built…..but hey, buyer beware – remember it was the news sources that reported this ‘cease fire' all while the Saudi's and the Russians never really confirmed or denied the story - they let it play out in the media - they never explicitly committed. ….It all sounded good – but it did require that all members fall into line and Iran had said from the very beginning that they had no intention of ‘playing nice in the sandbox'.Overnight oil suffered a bit - with Brent down 4% and WTI (West Texas Intermediate) down about 4.5% - makes some sense - but equity mkts did NOT follow suit and implode the way many thought they might.....In fact - we have to ask: Is a ‘No-Deal' actually better for the mkts in the long run as it allows for supply and demand to find its ‘natural' level of equilibrium vs. ‘artificial production controls' which will only put off the inevitable? ( I mean look - we all know what artificial controls can do to mkts - think massive QE programs instituted by every central bank)As Asian mkts opened – the pressure came to bear - mkts sold off - but not to the extent that many were prepared for.....…..Japan was the outlier - falling some 3+% - but this had more to do with the major series of earthquakes in the past 3 days – vs. the oil story.... South Korea (Kospi) moved 0.28% lower, Australia stumbled by 0.4%, Hong Kong lost 0.9% and China was off 1.43% by the end of the day.As the sun sets on Asia it rises in Europe and as the clock ticked – European mkts were the next to react.....they too are under a bit of pressure – taking their cue from investor angst in Asia - but again - equities are not getting clobbered by any stretch.......Currently Brent North Sea Crude oil is off by 2% while WTI (West Texas Intermediate) is down by nearly 3% trading at $39/barrel. FTSE - 0.07%, CAC 40 - 0.04%, DAX +0.06%, EUROSTOXX - 0.18%, SPAIN -0.35% and ITALY +0.11%.US futures which were down 11 pts Sunday evening have recovered a bit from the initial ‘knee jerk' reaction trading last night – currently they are lower by 7 pts as the reality of this OPEC decision permeates the psyche. Since the equity mkts did not implode on this news (as many had expected) – we need to ask: Are investors trying to separate action in the oil/energy space from the rest of the mkt. Now while energy names will get hit today – think transports and manufacturers as beneficiaries of lower oil prices.Earnings will continue to ramp up this week as we enter the thick of it. Last week- the message was all about the banks….now while we saw trading revenues decrease and loan loss reserves increase and most reports miss revenue estimates - they all managed to beat the on the bottom line. Uncle Lloyd (Blankfein) released a strategic restructuring plan ahead of his earnings this week - Headlines read:""Goldman's Blankfein Demands Deepest Cost Cuts in Years"" -on the chopping block? Travel limits, Entertainment, deferring projects and Layoffs as he""has already adjusted his workforce, relying more on JUNIOR bankers, moving support staff to cheaper locations and investing in technology to improve productivity""(Junior bankers? I mean if you want a Jr banker there are so many other places to go - You don't go to GS for a Jr. Banker)The stock rallied on this news taking it to its down trending 100 dma at $163.... earnings are due tomorrow...so the clock is ticking....did he do a good enough job of acknowledging the disastrous industry environment for the sake of investors?Earnings today include Morgan Stanley (MS) - they beat the estimate - reported 0.55 cts/sh vs. exp 0.46 cts/sh, Pepsico (PEP) - beat reporting 0.89 cts/sh vs. the 0.81 cts/sh expected. HASBRO (HAS)toys also beat 0.38 vs. 0.23 cts/sh.....later in the week we will hear from American Express (AXP), McDonald's (MCD), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), IBM (IBM), Intel (INTC), Cocoa Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT)There is not major economic data points today..so the chatter will be about earnings and oil.....and the 3 FED speakers today....Dudley at 8:30 am, Kashkari at 12:30 pm and Rosengren at 7 pm....Take Good Care

185,KO,"Stocks were mixed Wednesday afternoon as investors awaited a Federal Reserve decision on interest rates.The Nasdaq rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 fell more than 0.3% and the Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.1%. Volume was running higher across the board in the stock market today. Oil futures fell 2.5% to $41.84 a barrel following surprise builds in U.S. crude and gasoline supplies.The Fed was set to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. ET following the central bank's two-day meeting. Policymakers are expected to hold interest rates steady at between 0.25% and 0.50% as concerns abroad offset generally positive U.S. economic data.Coca-Cola (KO) led the Dow lower, sinking nearly 4% after reporting weak sales and cutting revenue targets.Coca-Cola said Q2 profit fell 5% to 60 cents a share, which was better than expected. Sales also fell 5%, to a lower-than-expected $11.5 billion, on weak demand in China and parts of Latin America.The world's biggest beverage maker also lowered its full-year revenue forecast. Coca-Cola pierced its long-term 200-day moving average but continues to work on a long.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) boosted the Nasdaq by jumping nearly 7% after a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report released after the close Tuesday. The stock is testing resistance at its 40-week moving average as it tries to break a yearlong downtrend.Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) soared almost 10% after the restaurant chain posted a better-than-expected 13% gain in Q2 profit to $1.27 a share. Revenue rose 15% to $490.2 million.The strong results came a day after Stifel Nicolaus downgraded a number of restaurant stocks amid concern that a recession was on the horizon.IBD'S TAKE: To see how Buffalo Wild Wings stacks up against its rivals in the restaurant industry, check out IBD's Stock Checkup feature.In economic news Wednesday, orders for long-lasting durable goods dropped 4% in June, the biggest drop in 22 months and much worse than Wall Street had expected.Also Wednesday, pending home sales rose just 0.2% in June after dropping 3.7% in May, according to data from the National Association of Realtors.
"
186,KO,"Coca-Cola (KO) slashed its outlook for the year, while its soft-drink peer Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) did quite the opposite and gave full-year earnings guidance a boost.Coca-Cola reported an adjusted 60 cents in per-share earnings, down 5% from the prior year's Q2 but 2 cents above views.However, a 5% revenue decline to $11.52 billion was worse than expected, with CEO Muhtar Kent citing in a statement ""challenging macroeconomic conditions, structural changes and foreign-exchange headwinds"" as weighing on the quarter, as well as ""difficult external conditions"" in emerging markets. Analysts had projected $11.64 billion.That marks the fifth straight quarter of year-over-year earnings and revenue declines for Coca-Cola.Global unit case volume was flat for the quarter.Coca-Cola now expects a 4%-7% EPS decline and 3% in organic revenue growth in 2016, down from prior guidance for 4%-6% EPS growth and 4%-5% in organic revenue gains. Organic revenue excludes currency shifts. Wall Street sees a a 3% EPS decline and 4% revenue dip for the year.Shares closed down 3.3% to 43.40 on the stock market today, tumbling through the 200-day moving average. Coca-Cola hasn't closed below that support line since Oct. 2, 2015.IBD'S TAKE: The Beverages-Non-Alcoholic group ranks 136 out of 197 of IBD's industry groups. Coca-Cola has only earned a 39 Composite Rating. A non-boozy beverage stock that is currently in buy territory and boasts an 89 Composite Rating, however, is Monster Beverage. The New America takes a detailed look at the energy drink maker.""(Coca-Cola) delivered a solid Q2 above our expectations despite flat volume growth, as it was able to leverage solid performance in developed markets and positive pricing, together with ongoing productivity initiatives to deliver bottom-line results,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog.""While we are disappointed with the outlook, we continue to believe that the outlook for fiscal 2017 and beyond will improve with KO's revised business model once refranchising is complete,"" Herzog said.Meanwhile, Dr Pepper Snapple earned $1.25 in adjusted Q2 per-share profit, up 11%, coming in a nickel above estimates. Revenue grew over 2% to $1.7 billion, topping expectations for $1.68 billion.The beverage maker now sees $4.27-$4.35 in adjusted per-share profit, up from prior guidance for $4.20-$4.30 EPS and vs. current consensus for $4.35.Shares of Dr Pepper fell 1% to 96.20, dropping just below a recent 95.97 buy point.
"
187,KO,"Monster Beverage (MNST) is getting a boost from consumers' need for speed, but company's stock and energy products could easily fall from their caffeine high.Known for its distinctive tall can and ripped M logo, Monster is helping lead the energy-drink revolution as sodas and other carbonated drinks fall out of favor with Americans and consumers in many developed markets.Carbonated soft-drink volumes in the U.S. fell 1.54% in 2015, on top of a 0.97% drop in 2014, according to Beverage Marketing Corp. Meanwhile energy-drink volumes have risen dramatically, up 7.94% in 2015 and 7.34% in 2014, on top of double-digit increases in recent years.""Energy drinks have had very strong growth for over a decade now and the primary reason for that is there is a huge demand for energy and the products are well-formulated to deliver on that,"" said Gary Hemphill, managing director of research at Beverage Marketing.Monster cans come in 16 fluid ounces and contain two servings. Each serving has 86 milligrams of caffeine vs. 95 milligrams found in a typical cup of coffee. The drinks often contain other stimulants like guarana, taurine and B vitamins.""Consumers gravitate more toward things that are healthier for you, and consumers want variety and a change of pace,"" Hemphill said.Monster declined requests for an interview.But the company offers a variety of products including a low-carb version, Muscle Monster energy shakes and a football-themed version inspired by Rob Gronkowski, the energetic New England Patriots tight end who manages to simultaneously maintain a fun-loving lifestyle and still set National Football League records.Monster and Austria's Red Bull are the two global leaders in the energy drink market. Red Bull has more market share in Europe, as it tapped into the EU market before Monster did.But Monster leads in the U.S., the largest energy-drink market in the world with volumes at 629.3 million gallons last year, Beverage Marketing says. Monster is typically sold in the U.S. in a can twice the size as Red Bull, but at the same price.Smaller players in the energy beverage spectrum include Rockstar, along with Rip It by National Beverage (FIZZ) and 5 Hour Energy shots by capital management firm Innovations Ventures.Monster generally has been a highly rated stock, but Wells Fargo downgraded it to market perform from outperform this past Monday. That sent the stock tumbling as the analyst warned on lower-than-expected sales and no new products until the fourth quarter.But shares have gained back some ground since then, and remain in buy range. Shares ended trading up at the close Friday and were down fractionally at the close Monday to 160.07.Monster was founded under the name Hansen Natural in 1935 before switching its name to Monster Beverage in 2012 to emphasize its focus on energy drinks. During its first-quarter conference call in April, Monster said that according to Nielsen data, U.S. sales of its energy drinks grew 10.8% while sales of Red Bull increased 4.1% and sales PepsiCo's (PEP) Amp decreased 8.1%.Monster also is making headway overseas and saw market share gains during the first quarter in a slew of European nations. They include: Germany, France, Denmark, Belgium, Hungary, Ireland, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Much of Monster's international growth has come from Coca-Cola's (KO) ownership stake in the company. Last year Monster completed a deal to move its bottle and distribution to Coke bottlers and sold its non-energy drink assets, including Hansen's soda, to Coke. Coke sold its energy products such as its Burn drink, to Monster.""This opens up new channels, new areas to get product into more storefronts,"" said Adam Fleck, director of consumer equity research at Morningstar.""There have been lawsuits and continuing regulator concerns around the product,"" Fleck said. ""A company the size of Coke has some concerns about going all in on energy drinks. Instead they have chosen to take a minority stake in Monster and get out of the business entirely.""Fleck believes U.S. energy drink volumes will continue to grow in the high-single to low-double digits in the foreseeable future.Monster consumers tend to skew younger and male, Fleck said. Monster sponsors extreme sporting events and athletes in motocross, BMX, mountain biking, surfing and snowboarding. It also has an athlete development program for kids ages 13-21.IBD's TAKE: Monster shares are trying to recover from a mini-selloff after tumbling in the wake of an analyst's downgrade this past Monday, and remain about $4 short of a new high. The strongest player in the nonalcoholic beverages group is National Beverage. Its Stock Checkup is available here.But with the addition of a line of Java-themed products that include coffee, cream and a ""Monster energy blend"" the brand is looking to expand its reach past its key demographic.Monster is planning to launch its products in China later this year but warned during its first-quarter conference call that the launch could be delayed by regulatory approvals and finalization of distribution agreements.Monster settled two wrongful-death lawsuits last year after teenagers died of cardiac problems after drinking the energy drinks.Studies have shown that increases in blood pressure after drinking energy drinks can make people more susceptible to cardiovascular problems, and the World Health Organization said high caffeine levels can cause heart palpitations, hypertension and heart attacks in extreme cases.Middlebury College in Vermont has banned the sales of energy drinks on campus as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say mixing energy drinks with alcohol makes people three times more likely to binge drink.Because Monster relies so heavily on one product Fleck said investors need to have ""a larger margin of safety"" than with a more diversified beverage company like Coke, which relies on its signature drink along with bottled water and juices.""Health concerns are a real downside risk in the Monster story,"" he said. ""While the international growth rates remain pretty good, a U.S. slowdown will be a big risk.""

188,KO,"Techs led the market after the opening bell Wednesday, as heavyweight earnings reports stirred trading.The Nasdaq rose 0.5%, the Dow industrials climbed 0.3% and the S&P 500 added 0.1%.Action before the starting bell felt a strong impact from Apple (AAPL) following its fiscal third-quarter earnings report. Wednesday morning's earnings roster included reports from Boeing (BA), Coca-Cola (KO), GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and others.With the market's recent uptrend slowed to a crawl, trading after Wednesday afternoon's policy announcement from the Federal Open Market Committee will be key to watch. No change in policy is expected, but the Fed's views on the economy and the potential for a rate hike in September could influence the market.Orders for durable goods fell 4% in June, the Commerce Department estimated, deeper than consensus forecasts for a 1.3% dip. The department also revised its May estimated lower, to a 2.8% decline in orders. Minus transportation, orders slipped 0.5%, vs. economists target for a 0.3% increase.The National Association of Realtors reports pending home sales data for June at 10 a.m. ET. Weekly oil inventories stats are due out from the Energy Information Administration at 10:30 a.m. ET, and the Fed's policy announcement is set for 2 p.m. ET.Apple climbed 7% after its fiscal third-quarter earnings report showed iPhone sales declined less than expected.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) rumbled nearly 6% higher. After Tuesday's close, the heart device maker reported a strong second-quarter beat and raised its third-quarter and full-year guidance. Edwards ended Tuesday's session in buy range above a 107.69 buy point in a double-bottom base.Boeing climbed 3%, as earnings declined and revenue rose more than analysts expected. Malaysia Airlines also announced an order for 50 737 MAX jets, with a list-price value of $5.5 billion.Remote connectivity software brand Logmein (LOGM) sprung 19% higher after reporting strong second-quarter results and announcing a deal to merge into Citrix Systems' (CTXS) virtual meeting unit, GoTo. The company valued the deal at $1.8 billion. Citrix Systems shares slipped 3%.Switzerland-based Garmin (GRMN) rose 10% after topping analysts' Q2 expectations and raising its full-year guidance.Coca-Cola dropped 2.5% after reporting healthy second-quarter results early Wednesday but lowering full-year earnings guidance to below-consensus views.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) veered 15% lower after its second-quarter earnings met expectations, but revenue stopped short of consensus targets. Akamai management warned margins could narrow due to pricing pressure and strategy shifts among networking clients such as Apple and Facebook (FB).Microblogging site operator Twitter (TWTR) tumbled 12%. Twitter reported mixed second-quarter results and offered weak third-quarter guidance after the close of trade on Tuesday.Crude oil futures were unevenly lower, with West Texas Intermediate down a fraction to $42.86 a barrel. Brent crude dropped 1% to $44.51. Gold edged up less than 1% to $1,321 an ounce. The dollar was mixed -- up vs. the pound and the yen, but outpaced by a rising euro. The 10-year Treasury yield eased 1 basis point to 1.55%.China's markets booked a sharply mixed session, while in Japan, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 rebounded 1.7% on reports of a pending $265 billion stimulus package.European markets gained ground. The CAC 40 in Paris led the region, up 1.6% in afternoon trade.

Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA), Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD), Coca-Cola (KO) and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) report quarterly results, and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting wraps up.

"
191,KO,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) saw second-quarter net earnings rise 25% to $5 billion, or about $2.03 per Class B share, a penny above estimates.The conglomerate late Friday said revenue grew 6% to $54.46 billion, though total revenue was lighter than analyst consensus for $56.44 billion. Revenue from Berkshire's flagship insurance businesses climbed 9.9% to $43.59 billion.""Our insurance underwriting operations generated increased net earnings in the second quarter and first six months of 2016 compared to 2015,"" management said in a regulatory filing.That reflected foreign-exchange rate fluctuation for Berkshire's reinsurance activities overseas, as well as an increase in underwriting gains for its Geico business, partly offset by lower gains from General Re and Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group operations.Berkshire saw a 10.3% drop in its Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad revenue to $8.85 billion, down from $9.87 billion in the second quarter of 2015, as railroads continue to be slammed by lower shipments of petroleum, coal and other products.IBD'S TAKE: While Berkshire Hathaway and other large diversified manufacturers have generally reported middling results, smaller rivals have outperformed the market. To find out which companies in the group are the highest rated, go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Berkshire earlier in the year made a roughly $1 billion investment in Apple (AAPL) at a time when sales of its iPhone seemed to be slowing. However, in its July 26 earnings report, Apple reported stronger-than-expected iPhone sales, driving its stock up nearly 7% on July 27. Other core Berkshire holdings include Coca-Cola (KO), Wells Fargo (WFC) and oil and gas refiner Phillips 66 (PSX).But Berkshire's investment in Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell to $15.75 billion as of June 30 from $23.42 billion on Dec. 31, the company said in its 10-Q statement. Since the beginning of the year, Berkshire's total shareholders' equity has increased $7.5 billion.Berkshire's Class B shares dipped 0.1% to 145.56 in the stock market today. Its stock dropped to a 2016 low of 123.55 on Feb. 3, in sync with the early-year market pullback, and then turned up. It's risen 19% since then and was trading above both its 10-week average and its 200-day line.Apple rose 0.8% to 108.37. Kraft Heinz fell 4 cents to 88.75 after climbing 3.8% Friday on strong earnings.

192,KO,"A scruffy, bearded Michael Phelps swims punishing laps alone in a darkened pool as an Edith Piaf-like voice croons ""It's the last goodbye, I swear/I can't rely on a dime-a-day love that don't go anywhere.""Cue a montage of the elite swimmer lifting weights, enduring ice baths and fire-cupping therapy, staring wistfully at a leaf-strewn backyard pool as he contemplates something. Actually, it's pretty obvious what the Olympian -- who just won his 19th gold medal on Sunday -- is contemplating, even if Under Armour (UA) isn't allowed to say it explicitly in its ad.""It's what you do in the dark that puts you in the light,"" flashes on the pitch-black screen. ""Rule yourself.""Expect to see that commercial a whole lot over the next few weeks, thanks to a change to the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40 that finally allows non-Olympic sponsors to advertise athletes competing in the Games.The much-talked-about policy shift is a big positive for brands who aren't among the 11 official worldwide Olympic sponsors, like McDonald's (MCD), or any of the 28 U.S. sponsors, like Nike (NKE). But it could especially benefit Under Armour's march toward the global stage.Nike, the far-and-away leader in performance gear, still towers over Under Armour. But the littler athletic company's scrappy-underdog brand image and well-chosen endorsement deals have resonated with young people. Of the three major labels -- Nike, Adidas and Under Armour -- Under Armour is the only one that has not sponsored the quadrennial event before. But the new guidelines may mean that it doesn't have to in order to reap the benefits.""The Rule 40 change really gives (Under Armour) an opening to leverage their athletes,"" said analyst Matt Powell of the NPD Group market research company. ""Before, they were really restricted in how much they could actually (do).""Before Rio, Rule 40 meant that only companies that had plunked down major money to call themselves exclusive sponsors -- like Coca-Cola (KO) or Visa (V) -- were allowed to feature their Olympians in ads during the Games.The restriction ostensibly protected sponsor investments, but it also shut out athletes' ability to capitalize on their medal efforts after years of training, causing a kerfuffle at the 2012 London Games. Non-sponsor brands were not even allowed to tweet ""Good luck at the Olympics!"" to their qualifying athletes.They still aren't. But following the loosening of Rule 40, those that have gotten prior approval can now showcase their finest athletes in ""generic advertising,"" so long as the Olympic rings and the Games' associated verbiage -- ""Olympics,"" ""medal,"" even ""2016,"" depending on how it's used -- are nowhere to be found in the marketing material. Companies had to apply for the waiver six months ahead of the Games.Hence, Under Armour's sentimental Olympic-but-not-really-Olympic commercial that heavily alludes to Phelps' last appearance at the international event. Instead of being kept silent at the world's greatest sports stage, the Baltimore-based brand can tweet and post Facebook (FB) messages, and broadcast their heavy hitters from the rooftops.Under Armour's ode to Phelps brought the athlete to tears when he first watched it, a moment conveniently captured on film and posted on the brand's YouTube page. The reaction video has been viewed over half a million times. The ""Rule Yourself"" ad itself has attracted well over 5.8 million views, the company's second most-watched video on the site despite being posted only four months ago.
"
193,KO,"A similar Olympic-style campaign starring top U.S. gymnasts Madison Kocian, MyKayla Skinner and Maggie Nichols also made the rounds, garnering over 3 million YouTube views in the months before the Games. (Kocian made the Olympic team, and Skinner is an alternate.)""The changes to Rule 40 allow us to fulfill our No. 1 objective, which is to support the nearly 225 Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls tied to the Under Armour brand during the Games,"" an Under Armour spokesperson told IBD via email.And the timing of this effort coincides with Under Armour's push to assert itself not just at home, but abroad.International revenue, as of the company's June-ended second quarter, grew 72% year over year and accounted for 15% of total revenue. That's almost double the 8% of revenue that came from sales abroad just two years ago.""Between Nike and Under Armour, this is a big incremental opportunity for Under Armour and the reason they're being so aggressive,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner told IBD. ""Brazil is a huge market.""The Olympics' host country in particular has been a focus of Under Armour's push to grow its global soccer franchise and sell more cleats, he said. But for all the pomp and hype, the major sporting event only comes around every four years and lasts just two weeks, meaning it's not much of a needle-mover when it comes to stock price or annual revenue.For example, Ralph Lauren (RL), the official outfitter of Team USA, has seen its overall sales fall for four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue suffering declines for the next few years.And while the appeal of Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte in a preppy navy blazer and white pants has not been lost on his fans online, it is unclear whether that will translate into sales for a clothier whose Hamptons aesthetic is increasingly losing relevance on athleisure-dominated sidewalks.For Under Armour, the potential comes from establishing presence.""What it's going to do is allow them to get on conference calls and put together marketing with more confidence that they're one of the top three global brands -- help to solidify some long-term projections by country,"" said Weiner, adding, ""These are the kinds of events where you can drive home the point.""Powell echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an ""important"" Olympics for Under Armour.""But that said, the marketing around the Olympics is not really a visceral kind of marketing,"" but more to show ""that they're authentic and (their) Olympic athletes are performing at a high level.""He said he hasn't really witnessed a case of people watching the Olympics and then hopping aboard the brand train. Still, before the Games had even begun, at least one viewer of the Michael Phelps ""Rule Yourself"" campaign was sold.""I'll buy under armour (sic) just because of this commercial,"" said YouTube commenter Kevin Cass.

197,KO,"Talk about a tricky balancing act. That's what MFS Mid Cap Growth Fund (OTCIX) performs.The market has gone up and down like a kid on a trampoline for the past six months. Yet the $2.1 billion mutual fund's marching orders are to find companies that have the best opportunities for growth two to three years in the future and whose valuations underplay those growth prospects.So how does the mutual fund pursue those goals without getting crushed in the market's volatility in the meantime?""The benefit of a longer-term time horizon is that you can look through the market's short-term noise,"" said co-manager Paul Gordon, who runs the fund with colleagues Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel. ""We also tend to look for companies that are heavily in control of their own fate, so events in the world shouldn't disproportionately impact them. They can grow through those issues.""It's not that the fund is looking for stocks that play dead for two or three years, Gordon says. What the fund wants is stocks whose earnings keep on growing for at least two or three years more. ""We're willing to trade a stock with a high current rate of growth for one where we can be confident in the duration of its (slightly slower) growth,"" Gordon said.That approach has enabled the fund to keep its footing during the market's gyrations. Going into Friday, the fund was up 6.23% so far this year, topping 72% of its midcap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc., which averaged 4.54%. By comparison, the S&P 500 was up 7.49%. Over the past three years, the fund's 11.43% average annual gain beat 92% of its direct rivals, which averaged a 7.74% gain, while the big-cap bogey advanced at a 10.98% yearly pace.Also, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating is A. That means the its performance is among the top 10% of all mutual funds in that time.Helping to drive that record? Nine of the fund's top-10 holdings as of June 30 had a strong IBD Composite Rating of 80 or better. The Composite Rating, which starts at 1 and runs to 99, combines IBD's five performance ratings, including EPS and Relative Price Strength Ratings. Stocks poised to move higher often have a high Composite Rating.The portfolio also includes Mobileye (MBLY), Vulcan Materials (VMC) and Monster Beverage (MNST). The latter two are on IBD's Leaderboard.Mobileye stock is up 9% this year, though 28% off its 52-week high.IBD'S TAKE: Mobileye dipped sharply last week, despite beating Wall Street's Q2 expectations. The downer was news that Mobileye will not extend its relationship with Tesla Motors. IBD's Paul Whitfield recently explained that Mobileye still has other irons in the fire, including a deal with BMW.The Israel-based developer of software and related technologies for camera-based advanced driver assistance systems -- which play a central role in the rise of self-driving robo-cars -- has a strong IBD Composite Rating of 96.""Tesla is one of many Mobileye customers,"" Gordon said. ""They are not a significant percentage of sales currently."" Mobileye's pullback Tuesday was due to investors' fears that Tesla had found another supplier to provide autonomous driving chips at a lower price. Gordon doubts that's the case. ""And it's more difficult to imagine that a Ford (F), GM (GM) or even BMW (BMWYY) can do what Mobileye can.""Vulcan Materials, a building materials company, is up 26% so far this year. It pays a dividend yield of 0.6%, and it has a 97 Composite Rating from IBD, the second-highest possible.""Aggregates are a good business,"" Gordon said. ""It is highly localized, and Vulcan has a significant market share in its regions. As such, it has positive pricing (power), including through the last downturn.""With product volumes near all-time lows in a cyclical business, ""that tells us that Vulcan's risk-reward potential is skewed to the upside,"" Gordon said.The stock plunged 5% Monday to its 50-day moving average after Q2 revenue and earnings came in below analyst expectations.Monster Beverage is up 8% so far this year, having rallied from a steep decline in February.EPS growth rebounded 25% in the latest quarter, bouncing back from a 6% decline the prior quarter.IBD'S TAKE: IBD's Gillian Rich says Monster is riding a caffeine high, fueled by rising consumption of energy drinks.""Energy drink consumption continues to gain share of total beverage consumption,"" Gordon said. ""And their deal with (Coca-Cola (KO)) lets them significantly increase distribution internationally with little operational risk or costs to Monster.""Teen-targeting discount chain Five Below (FIVE) is up about 58% so far this year. EPS rose 26% and 50% the past two quarters, respectively.Shares have trended lower in recent years amid investor concerns about same-store sales, Gordon says. ""What's changed is that same-store sales have recovered,"" Gordon said, while the chain still has a large opportunity to open new stores. ""Another point,"" Gordon said, ""is that Five Below has the potential to be one of the longest duration growth names in the portfolio.""Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) is up about 70% this year. EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters.""They've traditionally had very strong market share in PC gaming,"" Gordon said. ""Now they are focusing that same technology on new growth markets, including data centers and automotive. They have big opportunities in virtual reality and autonomous driving.""""We love to own stocks for five years or more,"" Gordon said."" That's why duration of growth is so important to us.""

199,KO,"Coming to a retailer near you -- it's the stock market.That's the plan if companies like Stockpile have their way. The Silicon Valley fintech firm is literally bringing stock trading to the local grocer or toy store by offering equity gift cards.They're much like those offering $25 worth of food at The Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), or $150 in merchandise via Amazon (AMZN). The difference is theirs will offer small stakes in companies like Apple (AAPL), Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) or Facebook (FB) -- as well as the likes of Cheesecake Factory or Amazon. You could say Main Street actually is converging with Wall Street.Stockpile's aim is to ""democratize"" the market, and open it to the average Joe. The company hopes to appeal to consumers' desire to get in on what very few Americans do right now: buy stakes in Corporate America in order to save, invest and prepare for large expenses later on in life such as college educations, weddings and ultimately retirement.""Eighty-six percent of the population have never owned stock, but 93% have had gift cards pass through their hands,"" said Dan Schatt, Stockpile's chief commercial officer.Consumers simply buy the gift card at the checkout stand. Once the card is paid for, a redemption code is entered digitally with Stockpile and consumers then call or go online to register their investment.The key to what Stockpile proposes, and what other brokers like it are offering, is ""fractional"" shares in stock. Instead of paying, say, the 99.43 that was Thursday's closing price for a single share of Apple, consumers could pay a convenient $25 for part of a share, or $150 for an entire share and part of another.Stockpile spent several years ironing out the details on being able to offer partial shares of companies with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Schatt said.It now can offer stakes in more than 1,000 stocks and exchange traded funds. For those who can't afford the $750-plus for a full share of Alphabet, they can still get in on the parent of the world's top search engine.In case you're wondering, Stockpile has yet to offer stakes in hyper-expensive Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) (BRKB) Class ""A"" shares because they now go for more than $215,000 a pop and Stockpile has to hold on to whatever portions of shares aren't sold. But partial stakes in $145 Berkshire ""B"" shares are readily available.The concept of offering fractional shares is not new. Like Stockpile, San Mateo, Calif.-based Motif Investing is an online broker and offers piecemeal stakes in companies.Motif isn't making a permanent move into the retail space with gift cards like Stockpile, though it has had promotions in the past. Instead, it offers stakes in what could be described as minifunds based around any one of 200,000 themes -- along with stakes in individual equities if one so desires. Customers can even make up their own ""motif,"" or fund that suits their investing choices.""We want people to build portfolios around their insights,"" said Hardeep Walia, Motif's chief executive.He adds that what differentiates his product from Stockpile and other fractional share brokers is that investors are making what he calls ""real-time"" investments. That is, investors know the exact price of a stock at the moment they make their purchase.Stockpile says that once a recipient of a stock gift card goes online or phones in to register the card's code, they've committed to buying the stock. The purchase price, however, is where the stock finishes at the end of the next market close. But recipients can opt for another stock when they call in if they're unsure about the one listed on the card.Stockpile, which was founded in 2010, began offering its stock gift cards in October and already demand has blossomed, Schatt says. Cards now are available at 400 retail outlets.They include publicly traded outlets such as Office Depot (ODP) and its OfficeMax stores, Sears Holdings' (SHLD) Kmart stores and Minnesota-based grocer SuperValu (SVU), along with privately held Safeway, Wegman's and Giant Eagle. But it won't stop there.The company plans to expand to 14,000 retail outlets by September. Schatt says a number of big-name retailers will be included, though the company isn't disclosing now who they are. It's venturing into such outlets as privately held Toys R Us, and hopes to someday entice consumers by, say, positioning Coca-Cola (KO) stock gift cards next to Coke six-packs on the soda aisle.Stockpile also offers regular online brokerage services. One benefit of offering consumer-oriented investments is that Stockpile is picking up a demographic not normally associated with stock investing. Half its account base is under 30 years old and 20% of that is made up of teenagers. (Those under 18 can maintain investments under the supervision of a parent or guardian.)""That's sort of unheard of in the brokerage world,"" Schatt said.

202,KO,"Shares of burger chains of McDonald's (MCD) and Sonic (SONC) are breaking out, while Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) signals it has a ""Better Burger"" in mind.McDonald's shares rose 1.5% to 125.83 in the stock market today, rising out of a cup-shaped base with a buy point of 124.93 and hitting a record high. Shares found support at their 50-day line earlier in the month.McDonald's has benefited from a shift to all-day breakfast menus in the U.S. McDonald's also is getting a lift in recent weeks from a weaker dollar, along with several other Dow stocks such as General Electric (GE) and Coca-Cola (KO). General Electric and Coca-Cola, which broke out of their own consolidations in recent weeks, rose to new highs as well Wednesday.Sonic is positioned in buy range after recording better-than-expected second-quarter results and raising full-year earnings and comp guidance late Tuesday. The stock had been building a cup-with-handle base with 33.04 buy point for the last several months.Shares rose 6.2% to 34.58 to a 1-year high, breaking out of a three-month base and moving to the high end of a longer consolidation.Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported that Chipotle Mexican Grill earlier this month filed a trademark for ""Better Burger,"" suggesting it's interested in creating a burger chain.

Volume was mixed, slightly higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq vs. Thursday's total, according to preliminary figures. Winners outpaced losers by about a 5-4 margin on the NYSE and by 7-5 on the Nasdaq.Energy, investment banks and computer-related stocks led the downside in today's stock market action. Oil stocks were weighed down by a 3% slide in West Texas intermediate crude prices to $40.36 a barrel, ahead of an oil production meeting this weekend in Doha, Qatar.Super Micro Computer (SMCI) gapped down and sank 20%, slicing its 200-day moving average in hefty trade. Shares are now well below a 33.89 buy point initially cleared March 30. The maker of server systems and other computer gear guided fiscal Q3 earnings lower. It reports April 28 after the close.Apple (AAPL) provided the biggest drag on the Dow, shedding 2% to close back below the 200-day moving average, which it had regained Wednesday. Volume ran about 22% higher than usual. The iPad maker will continue with lowered iPhone production in the April to June quarter, according to the Nikkei Asian Review.Citigroup (C) rose as much as 3.5% intraday but pared its gains to close slightly lower. The big bank reported Q1 earnings that fell less than expected. Shares are 9% above their 50-day line but 9% below the 200-day line.Gold miners, utilities and apparel retailers bucked the downtrend. Among utilities, Aqua America (WTR) rose 2% to reclaim its 50-day moving average.

204,KO,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has become much more diversified and thus ""much less reliant"" on Warren Buffett's stock-market clairvoyance, evolving into a company positioned to outperform the S&P 500 amid economic uncertainty, UBS said Monday in initiating coverage of the investment firm.""We believe that the current uncertain economic and market environment plays into the hands of BRK, with its structural advantages of permanent capital, strong cash generation and industry-leading portfolio of businesses,"" UBS analyst Brian Meredith wrote in the initiation note, which gave Berkshire's A shares (BRKA) a buy rating and a 244,500 price target.""This enables BRK to make acquisitions and/or invest in its operating units despite challenging environments, positioning it to grow earnings and book value faster than the S&P 500,"" Meredith wrote.Berkshire over the years has become more of a diversified conglomerate and less of an insurance and investment firm, UBS said, helping cushion the company against difficulties in the insurance business and minimizing risk associated with Buffett's eventual departure from the company.""While Buffett's superior capital allocation skills and market 'clout' would be missed, as long as the culture does not change, we would expect the company to continue to outperform,"" Meredith said, adding that the market hasn't priced in a significant premium for him as CEO amid the shift to a diversified conglomerate.Berkshire Hathaway’s entry into insurance began with the 1967 purchase of National Indemnity. But over the years, it has diversified through acquisitions, growing into four main areas of operation that oversee such companies as Geico, Duracell and various energy, manufacturing and railroad companies.That diversification has cushioned the company against difficulties in the insurance business and would likely help minimize risk associated with Buffett’s departure from the company, UBS said.Berkshire's A shares closed up 0.8% in the stock market today. The more widely traded B shares also rose 0.8% Monday and have climbed nearly 14% since a Jan. 25 low.UBS' coverage comes as Buffett's stake in Wells Fargo (WFC) nears 10%, an amount that would necessitate a review from the Federal Reserve intended to protect against undue investor influence, Bloomberg reported.Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway has also been amassing a large stake in oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX), possibly foreshadowing a huge acquisition.Wells Fargo dipped 0.4% Monday, while Phillips 66 lost 0.65%. Among Berkshire's other top holdings, Coca-Cola (KO) added 0.5%, while American Express (AXP) eased 0.3%.

205,KO,"Stocks hung on to their early losses Thursday morning, as a firming dollar and weak oil prices pressured shares in the U.S. and Europe.The Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 were down 0.5% each. The Nasdaq stuck with its early 0.4% loss. Volume turned mixed -- up 9% on the NYSE, and dipping 1% on the Nasdaq -- relative to action at the same time Wednesday.The stock market today got off on weak footing, as a rising dollar pressured commodities in general, with oil skidding hard for a second straight session. Early hawkish comments from St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard may have amplified that effect. European markets reacted sharply, with the CAC 40 in Paris down 2% in afternoon trade. The FTSE 100 in London and Frankfurt's DAX showed declines of 1.5% apiece.A preliminary March estimate from researcher Markit showed the U.S. service sector ticking up into expansion mode. It put its services Purchasing Managers' Index at 51, up from February's 49.7, as East Coast businesses reported a marginal rebound from snow-stalled activity in February.The Dow industrials opened almost unanimously lower, with Goldman Sach (GS),  JPMorgan (JPM) and Boeing (BA) all dropping more than 1% each to lead the declines. Wal-Mart (WMT) rose 0.3%, and Coca-Cola (KO) eked up 0.1%, the index's lone early advancers.Staples (SPLS) jumped 8% to top the S&P 500. A federal district judge criticized the Federal Trade Commission for allegedly attempting to alter the testimony of an Amazon.com (AMZN) executive during antitrust proceedings. Staples is attempting to acquire Office Depot (ODP) in a $6.3 billion deal announced in February 2015. Office Depot shares spiked 12% in early trade.Apparel brand PVH (PVH) sewed up a 6% gain. The owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger brands reported late Wednesday its Q4 EPS and revenue topped consensus targets. Management also raised Q1 EPS guidance well above expectations. Shares are working on their ninth advance in 10 weeks, and they are just below their 40-week moving average in a six-month consolidation.Signet Jewelers (SIG) narrowed a 5% gain to 3%, boosted by fourth-quarter revenue and earnings, which met its preannounced (and above-consensus) guidance. The stock has been climbing off a February low, building the right side of a February consolidation.
"
206,KO,"The strong dollar has been a drag on U.S. multinationals for several quarters. But with the greenback turning flabby, investors are betting on better corporate results, pushing Dow stocks General Electric (GE), McDonald’s (MCD), Microsoft (MSFT) and Coca-Cola (KO) near or above buy points.Another Dow component, Nike (NKE), fell Wednesday after reporting weaker-than-expected revenue for its February quarter, in part due to the dollar. The athletic shoe and apparel giant's sales rose 8% but would have climbed 14% excluding currency swings.Yet the currency headwind is waning. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against the euro, yen and 4 other  currencies, has turned lower vs. a year earlier in the last few weeks -- down 0.9% as of Wednesday, even with a recent upturn. At this time last year, the dollar index was up 21%.The Federal Reserve's decision this month to trim its plans to hike interest rates certainly had an impact. When investors expect U.S. rates to be lower for longer, their view tends to negatively impact the greenback, which becomes less attractive to yield-seeking investors. The dollar has rallied somewhat in recent days on less-dovish comments from various Fed officials.Although companies are still using the dollar as a reason for negative guidance, they're using that reason ""a little less than before,"" said Gregory Harrison, a senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters.""It seems like other factors are a little more prominent now -- like the slowing global economy and the slowdown in China,"" he said.Uncertainty over the U.S. presidential election usually tends to make consumers pull back a bit in spending, he added, noting also that a sagging energy sector has been a much bigger drag on corporate earnings than the dollar.""That’s kind of expected to remain the case throughout the year -- at least until the fourth quarter,"" Harrison said.Meanwhile, central banks in Europe and Japan have gone to negative rates, but their recent moves unexpectedly lifted their currencies against the dollar. The Chinese yuan has erased its early 2016 losses vs. the greenback.And stocks have responded. General Electric saw its stock break out of a cup-with-handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17, a few weeks after Coca-Cola cleared a long consolidation to a record high.McDonald's briefly rose to 125 on the stock market today, hitting a record high and just passing a buy point of 124.93. But the below-average volume rise faded to a 0.3% gain at 124.19.Procter & Gamble (PG) stock is on the cusp of retaking a buy point at 83.10. Microsoft also is close to an entry point.Of course, the dollar isn't the only reason for their success.McDonald's decision to introduce an all-day breakfast boosted the fast-food chain in Q4 to its best U.S. quarterly sales in nearly four years after several years of struggling.Coca-Cola is in the middle of selling its U.S. manufacturing and distribution operations by next year. Instead, Coke plans to focus on its concentrate-making business, which is more profitable. Procter & Gamble is moving to focus on more-profitable core brands.GE is transitioning back to its industrial roots, with a strong digital footprint. The company is selling off much of its once-massive GE Capital financial services unit. General Electric is also moving its headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, a tech hub located near several major universities that should supply the company with fresh, young tech talent.Despite the market turbulence over the past 12 months, Microsoft has been a top performer, gaining 26% from a year ago; near the end of last year, it eclipsed its dot-com boom peak. The company has finally made a push into mobile, and its Windows 10 operating system has won praise -- especially after the debacle of Windows 8.As for Nike, the athletic brand king had been closing in on a new high but closed down 3.8% Wednesday. Nike reported after Tuesday's market close that fiscal Q3 earnings rose 22% and that currency-neutral futures orders leapt 17%, both results better than expected. But Nike sales fell short, and the company gave cautious fiscal 2017 guidance.A weakening dollar should provide a better business climate for blue-chip giants going forward. But if the Fed turns hawkish and the greenback firms up, investor optimism about profits may fade, threatening Dow breakouts.Those with a more skeptical view say that the window was closing on the tough year-over-year currency comparisons anyway and that the real story was corporate earnings finally catching up to the sluggish revenue environment.""Revenue growth has been somewhat constrained for quite some time,"" said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial. ""That just reflects you can only get so far on the expense side of the ledger and support earnings growth that way. Cost cutting can only take you so far.""

207,KO,"Many ETF investors are balancing mixed emotions: feelings of trepidation against the desire for opportunism.They see a young market uptrend and a recovering U.S. economy through their windshield, but the wild swings of the first quarter still lurk in the rear-view mirror.So, even as investors scout for tactical bets, dividend ETFs continue to hold sway over their hearts and minds. These exchange traded funds tend to hold tried-and-true stocks, after all.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth (DGRW) has a relative strength line bolting to new highs ahead of the share price, a particularly bullish sign.The $597.1 million ETF invests in U.S. large-cap, dividend-growing companies. Stocks are screened for quality and growth characteristics, including expectations for long-term earnings growth. They're weighted based on total dividends paid.It yields 2.10%.Some relatively lower-yielding dividend payers offer strong growth potential, according to WisdomTree.""These companies may be best positioned in an environment of economic growth and even rising interest rates, especially if they feature relatively low debt,"" Christopher Gannatti, the firm's associate director of research, wrote March 16.DGRW holds 290 stocks. The top three holdings are Coca-Cola (KO), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL).The top 25 stocks include tobacco giant Reynolds American (RAI), an IBD Leaderboard stock with a 96 Composite Rating out of a best-possible 99.The ETF invests in high-quality stocks based on return on equity (ROE) and return on assets (ROA).""The reason we included ROA in powering stock selection is that it penalizes the use of debt (leverage) in delivering ROE,"" Gannatti said. That means this strategy follows a key Warren Buffett sniff test for stocks.In a Feb. 28 annual shareholder letter for Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), Buffett said a business must earn good return on equity -- while employing little or no debt -- to pique his interest. Buffett's stock-picking success has made him a guru to many successful investors.DGRW jumped 3.96% in the month ended April 4 and has risen 3.78% year to date. By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad U.S. market, is up 3.43% and 1.69% over the same periods.Over the first quarter, DGRW absorbed $27.4 million in new money.A Relative Strength Rating of 71 shows it has outperformed 71% of stocks and ETFs tracked by IBD over the past 12 months. Its solid Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B points to institutional demand.DGRW can serve as either a complement to high-yielding dividend ETFs or a replacement for quality-focused, large-cap strategies.Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) is another exchange traded fund showing bullish momentum.

Stock fund managers are seeking durable-growth stocks as a hedge against the uncertainty, volatility and slowdown in corporate earnings that several told IBD they see in the months -- or longer -- ahead.Click Here To See A List Mutual Fund Quarterly Leaders""Before Brexit, the (investment) world was almost back to normal,"" said Matthew Ward, co-manager of Schroder U.S. Large Cap Equity strategy, which is run as a separate account. The Federal Reserve was edging toward an interest rate increase. First-quarter panic over the pace and sustainability of China's growth was subsiding. U.S. economic indicators were OK, with jobs and wages growing, home values inching up and consumers feeling confidence.""Then, Brexit,"" Ward said. ""We're back to uncertainty, and the market hates uncertainty.""As a result, going forward Ward says the stocks he wants are in a narrow group that have shown an ability to grow earnings regardless of the macro environment.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Six-Month Leaders""Our biggest overweight is in consumer discretionary,"" he said. ""It reflects our confidence in consumers. And in some durable secular trends. Amazon (AMZN) is at the top of our list.""Similarly, James Abate, sole manager of $156 million Centre American Select Equity (DHAMX) and of $53 million Multi-Asset Real Return (DHMUX), sees the best prospects for growth increasingly concentrated within an elite group. ""We're concentrating in names that somehow can buck the trend in terms of economic malaise,"" said Abate, who is also Centre's chief investment officer. ""The names in the new Nifty 50 bucket include Amazon, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck (MRK), Nvidia (NVDA) and General Mills (GIS).""Jim Swanson, lead manager of $3.4 billion MFS Diversified Income (DIFAX) and chief investment strategist of MFS Investment Management, was already bearish on stocks pre-Brexit.Click Here To See A List Of Mutual Fund Category Performance The outlook was already dim for corporate earnings growth, he said. He added that companies globally had already lost purchasing power. U.S. selling and general administrative costs, as well as labor costs, are rising. Productivity here, in Europe and in China is falling.Post-Brexit, the dollar is up vs. the Chinese yuan, which will hurt U.S. exports and U.S. multinationals' earnings, he said. A global movement toward trade protectionism, if realized, would also hurt earnings.""Brexit or not, we need to see excess capacity come out of the world manufacturing system and the return of some inflation so that companies can pass along price increases,"" Swanson said.Despite the threats to U.S. corporate earnings, Swanson is overweight in U.S. stocks vs. their Japanese and European peers, which have growth outlooks that look even dimmer to him. And he is underweight in stocks vs. bonds and cash.""U.S. corporate bonds are the place to be,"" he said. He's favoring a mix of high-grade and high-yield debt.Small-cap growth funds led market-capitalization and style groups among U.S. diversified stock funds in Q2, gaining 3.85%.World equity mutual funds barely advanced in Q2, edging up 0.27% while losing 0.64% in June. Latin American funds led all foreign regions, advancing 8.72% in Q2 and 10.72% in June.Up 26.16% year to date, Latin American funds have benefited primarily from a rebound from an excessive sell-off last year, as well as a rebound in the Brazilian real vs. the U.S. dollar and a bounce for oil and other commodities, according to Peter Taylor, a manager of $7.4 billion Aberdeen Emerging Markets (ABEAX) and $3.5 million Latin American Equity Fund (ALEAX). Brazilian stocks have also benefited from the ouster, at least temporarily, of President Dilma Rousseff and in market-friendly fiscal reforms, he says.The quarter's volatility enabled precious metals funds to lead sectors by soaring 40.63% in Q2, more than half of that in June.Going forward, Swanson feels best about the technology sector among U.S. stocks. ""Its free cash flow is the highest of all 11 S&P 500 sectors,"" he said. ""Despite talk of bubbles, the sector is trading cheaper than utilities in Ohio. Yet tech companies change the world.""Software is due to benefit from an overdue upgrade cycle, he says.His second-favorite sector is health care. ""Health care spending keeps rising as a portion of U.S. GDP,"" he said. ""It's priced fairly, not cheaply. It has the best profit outlook after tech.""Consumer discretionary is his third-favorite sector. ""Forward price-earnings ratios are high, but we're seeing year-over-year profit growth that's almost as good as tech's,"" he said.Among tech stocks, Facebook (FB) is one that Ward likes. ""They have exceptional top-line growth,"" he said. ""And they're growing their opportunities."" For one, viewers are tolerating a tripling of videos being shown by advertisers, which allows Facebook to triple the number of ads it inserts among videos.In health care, Ward says share prices have been beaten down, largely by investor concerns that drug pricing will draw additional regulatory scrutiny. But he still likes individual stocks in the sector, including Amgen (AMGN).""It is the cheapest with pharmaceuticals,"" he said. And it is creating market opportunities with a number of biosimilars, which are harder than previous generation treatments for rivals to replicate.Among consumer discretionary stocks, Ward likes Amazon because of top-line growth and its use of Prime to draw new site users. He also likes Amazon's use of its warehouse for storing inventory without the expense of purchasing it.Tractor Supply (TSCO) is another consumer discretionary name he likes. It caters to customers whose income is double the national average and who pursue a rural lifestyle, he says. Its sales are triple its next six competitors combined. Its scale enables Tractor Supply to customize inventory for different regions.In staples, he likes Monster Beverage (MNST). Its new carbonated drink, Mutant, and its distribution arrangement with partner Coca-Cola (KO) should keep growth in the high single digits or low double digits, he says. Wall Street expects low single digits, which makes the stock attractively valued, he says.David Harden, president of Summit Global Investments and lead manager of two of its funds -- $125 million U.S. Low Volatility Equity (LVOLX) and $11 million Small Cap Low Volatility (LVSMX) -- says that amid volatility he likes stocks with stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.One trait shared by stocks he likes is stability of revenue and earnings. ""These companies offer downside protection,"" he said.Another trait is low two-year beta. Each one's beta is below 1.0, which means each is less volatile than the overall stock market.

210,KO,"Some pockets of the stock market invariably do well when investor optimism is wobbling. Several consumer staples ETFs are making new highs or trading near highs as heightened uncertainty raises the sector's appeal.It's easy to see why it does. Consumers are going to need their soft drinks, bleach, cereal and flour no matter how the economy goes.The consumer staples sector generally outperforms during recessionary periods and, to a lesser extent, late in a market cycle, writes Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. It tends to underperform in the early innings.""As such, investors interested in this fund should hold a strong belief that the economy is at least headed toward a recessionary environment,"" Goldsborough noted. Unless, of course, it's part of a diversified portfolio where its role is to help limit portfolio volatility.Investors have hardly been dashing for the stock market exits in recent sessions, but Europe is a niggling worry. The fear is that the U.K's vote to leave the European Union could stoke a regional recession and even perhaps a broader economic slowdown.Against that backdrop, Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples (RHS) climbed on the stock market today to its best level in more than two years. This exchange traded fund holds 36 large-cap stocks in the consumer staples sector.As its name implies, the ETF veers away from the traditional weighting of stocks by market capitalization (or, the total value of all a company's shares of stock). Instead, each stock gets an identical weight in the portfolio.Procter & Gamble (PG) accounts for roughly 3% of portfolio assets. So does Whole Foods Market (WFM).By contrast, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP), a cap-weighted rival holding the same stocks, gives a 12% weight to Procter & Gamble, its largest stock holding. It has 0.6% weight in Whole Foods Market, its smallest holding.The top 10 holdings in XLP account for 62% of its portfolio assets vs. 29% in RHS.The equal-weighting method followed by the latter prevents a small handful of stocks from having an unduly large impact on performance.That may sometimes work in an investor's favor. But an investor can be sure they'll always get less of a bias toward large companies and a shot at outperforming traditional, cap-weighted rivals with lower volatility.RHS has delivered on that promise both year to date and over the longer run. It's up 11.7% in 2016 through July 1 -- far outpacing the S&P 500 -- and produced an average annual 17.5% gain over the past five years.By comparison, larger peers XLP and Vanguard Consumer Staples (VDC) gained roughly 10% and an average annual 14.8% over those same periods.VDC holds 101 cap-weighted stocks, including Coca-Cola (KO), tobacco giant Philip Morris (PM) and Monster Beverage (MNST), a top-rated IBD Leaderboard stock.Both XLP and VDC also made new multiyear highs on the stock market today.A potentially stronger dollar post-Brexit could act as a headwind for multinational firms such as Procter & Gamble, whose earnings rely on overseas sales. At the same time, investors are discounting the odds of a near-term rate hike. That should boost this dividend-paying sector.""Consumer staples stocks tend to be sensitive to interest-rate hikes because most experience less earnings growth during economic expansions to offset the negative impact of rising interest rates,"" Goldsborough writes.Guggenheim recently launched the 15th in its equal-weighted ETF suite. Guggenheim S&P 100 Equal Weight (OEW) invests in 100 of the largest and most stable companies in the S&P 500, giving each stock an equal portfolio weight. The cap-weighted S&P 100 Index (OEX) is widely used for derivatives and underlies OEX options.The oldest ETF in this innovative suite, S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP), has, since its 2003 inception, outperformed the cap-weighted S&P 500 in 100% of 10-year monthly rolling periods, 86% of five-year monthly rolling periods, and 81% of three-year monthly rolling periods, according to Guggenheim.Guggenheim's equal-weighted strategies are helped by a disciplined quarterly rebalancing to target weights, which helps them buy stocks low and sell high.

211,KO,"The $5.1 billion Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund (UMLGX) has hit a rough patch. Its year-to-date loss of about 8% going into Thursday lags the average 2.96% setback by its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 2.45% gain.But you're highly unlikely to hear sounds of panic from the fund's quarters. That's because this is not the first lobster bake for the Boston-based fund managers. They've encountered market volatility before. And they have a way of rebounding.Right now, the fund's IBD 36-Month Performance Rating through May is A+, the highest available. That means the fund's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Around the start of that period, the fund was also battling rough seas. In the second quarter of 2013, the fund lost ground while both its peer group and the broad market romped ahead.Usually, the fund makes the opposite happen. In the more than 53 quarters since the start of lead manager Thomas Galvin's tenure on Feb. 28, 2003 -- he's the longest tenured of three current managers -- the fund has outperformed both its direct rivals and the big-cap bogey 28 times. It has lagged both two quarters in a row only once.That helps explain why this fund is an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Awards winner, shining in three categories: U.S. stock funds, growth funds and large-cap funds. It outperformed the S&P 500 over the one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods ended Dec. 31.So how has the fund positioned itself for the future? How will it maneuver through a market that is widely expected not to favor a lot of growth names and to be volatile amid a slow-growth U.S. economy? And don't forget the additional headwind from Brexit.Buys and sells are based on which individual securities appear most promising. But it's clear where the managers expect to find most opportunities. They had 41% of their shareholders' money at work in the technology sector as of May 31. Another 34% was in health care. And 12% was in consumer discretionary.Amazon (AMZN) -- to many investors, both a tech and a consumer discretionary name -- has helped fund performance by trending higher since early February. After declining for four quarters, earnings per share have climbed for four frames at a triple-digit pace. EPS growth has accelerated, rising 118%, 122% and 992% in the past three quarters.Amazon was the fund's third-largest holding as of May 31.Amazon is no longer just an online retailer. It also has become a major cloud computing player. And it recently announced a new video streaming service that will compete with Netflix and Hulu. Amazon's Prime video streaming service will be available for $8.99 per month.Amid severe selling pressure in the general market after the Brexit vote, Amazon has climbed from a 603.34 buy point and from an alternate entry of 638.11, as IBD's market coverage has noted. Shares are trading around 725. A stock will often begin to consolidate after rising 20% to 25% past a buy point.Monster Beverage (MNST) is the thirteenth-largest holding. EPS grew 25% in Q1, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Trading around 160, shares are getting extended from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.The stock's six-month base began forming in December.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also boosted the number of outlets where Monster energy drinks are available.And Monster recently debuted a soda called Mutant to compete with PepsiCo's (PEP) Mountain Dew.The value of Monster to Coke? Coke's sales have declined three straight calendar years. Pepsi's fell last year and were flat in 2014. Monster's sales rose 10% each of the past two years.Sherwin-Williams' (SHW) EPS grew 18%, 39% and 31% in the past three quarters. Trending sideways since late April, shares are forming a flat base with a 309.10 buy point.Annual return on equity has grown six years in a row, gaining 43.3%, 64.8% and 113.1% in the past three years. The company is acquiring rival Valspar.Anna Rathbun, director of research for CBIZ Retirement Plan Services, recently told IBD, ""We have seen delayed spending by consumers since the 2008 crash and recession. But if they can spend on things that build equity like homes, they do. We've seen a lot of home improvement projects.""

212,KO,"Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) late Friday applied to the Federal Reserve for permission to expand its stake beyond 10% in Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire disclosed in March it had reached the 10% threshold. None of the other top-four U.S. lending banks have a single investor with an investment the size of Berkshire's stake in Wells Fargo, according to Bloomberg.""Berkshire is seeking permission to retain its current ownership position in Wells Fargo and to acquire additional shares of common stock of Wells Fargo for investment purposes,"" Berkshire said in Friday's filing. ""Berkshire does not have any specific transaction or dollar value in mind with respect to any such potential purchases.""Wells Fargo is among Berkshire's four top stock holdings, which also include American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO) and IBM (IBM).But Wells Fargo has struggled this year and reported a 5% drop in earnings per share last quarter. It's projected to see EPS shrink in both this quarter and the next.Wells Fargo's capital plan also received approval earlier this week from the Fed. But the lender hasn't announced any changes to its dividend or buyback plans, while peers like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) have OK'd massive returns to shareholders.Wells Fargo shares edged up less than 0.1% in late trading, after closing down 0.6% at 47. Its stock price has dropped 15% so far this year. Berkshire closed down 0.6% at 143.99 Friday.

213,KO,"Want to buff up your portfolio? Check out this top-performing mutual fund for ideas about stocks and using the fund's diversification.The $11.9 billion MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) has grabbed an A+ 36-month performance rating from Investor's Business Daily, which means that its performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Its 1.60% gain over the 12 months going into Friday topped 94% of the large-cap growth funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500, which was up 1.70%.At a time when its typical peer is down nearly 4% for the past year, how does MFS Growth do it? Foremost, the fund aims for companies that are positioned for years of growth. It looks for companies with high sustainable earnings growth and the ability to keep improving their fundamentals. And it prefers companies whose value is not fully appreciated by other investors.Also, right now its portfolio is virtually all U.S. stocks.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of the names that fulfills that wish list. In March the fund began its current stake in the maker of canned energy drinks. It was a top new buy for the fund in the first quarter.Share price is up 39% since its Feb. 11 low. First-quarter earnings per share rose 25%, rebounding from a 6% decline in the fourth quarter.Revenue was $680.2 million, which beat the consensus analysts' estimate of $656.9 million. Monster topped analyst estimates in only one of the four quarters in 2015.Trading just above 155 early Friday, Monster remains in a buy range from a 154.06 cup-with-handle entry.Monster benefits from distribution by its strategic partner and global beverage powerhouse Coca-Cola (KO). Coke bottlers have also expanded the number of outlets in which Monster Energy drinks are available.IBD's markets team has noted that Monster's revenue increases of 7% and 9% in the past two quarters were subpar based on CAN SLIM criteria. But Wall Street sees full-year sales picking up 14% in 2016. Also, Monster achieved a sharp bump up in after-tax margin to 24.4%, the highest in at least 19 quarters.Facebook (FB) was the fund's top holding as of April 30.The social media network titan's EPS growth has accelerated for three quarters, growing 16%, 33%, 46% and 83% in the past four frames. Revenue grew 39%, 41%, 52% and 52% the past four quarters.Trading around 113, Facebook is below its 50-day moving average and a 117.09 buy point. The stock gapped up over the buy point in late April on strong earnings, but hasn't made much progress since then.It could be forming a new flat base with a 121.18 entry, the markets team noted. Facebook's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a worst-possible E.The number of daily active Facebook users has topped 1 billion. Facebook's growing mobile platform draws in the bulk of the company's ad revenue.Facebook is launching its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headset. On March 4, Facebook said shipments of some of its Oculus Rift virtual-reality headsets will be delayed due to parts shortages. The company is also looking for ways to monetize its WhatsApp mobile messaging service.Earlier this month, Facebook's executive board announced a plan that would prevent Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg from retaining majority control of the company if he exits from management. One key reason for the plan is to make it easier to attract a high quality successor to Zuckerberg.Vulcan Materials (VMC) is up 51% since its Jan. 20 low. It held its own during Friday's early broad market sell-off and actually gained ground.Vulcan supplies raw materials -- crushed stone, sand, gravel -- for road and highway construction.Earnings per share growth is speeding up. It advanced 14%, 76%, 139% and 262% in the past four quarters. Revenues rose 13%, 19%, 14% and 20% in those periods.With profit growth like that, it's little wonder that 1,190 mutual funds owned the stock as of March 31, up from 1,011 as of June 30, 2015. Investors included top-notch funds like $107.8 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX) and $2.6 billion Invesco Mid Cap Growth (VGRAX).In April, MFS Growth added shares, tweaking its Vulcan weighting to 1.2%, up from 1.16% from March.Vulcan has bounced off support at its 50-day moving average. That sets up a follow-on entry.In its May 3 report, Vulcan said most of its businesses have rallied and that its customers are winning more construction projects lately. New federal funding for road and bridge projects is aiding the industry. Better weather than last year also helped. In Q2, profits are seen rising 138% to $1 a share.Broadcom (AVGO) is up 39% from its Feb. 11 low. Trading near 151, the stock has pulled back in mostly light volume and is now sitting below its 159.75 entry.Such declines so soon after a breakout are frustrating but also common in an uncertain market, IBD's markets team notes. The low of the pattern undercut the low of a prior shallow base, which served to reset the base count.Broadcom took over LSI Logic in 2014. That gave it access to the networking and storage chip space. In February, Avago completed its acquisition of Broadcom. The company uses Broadcom's name and Avago's ticker.During the fiscal second quarter, the company has been paying off debt by selling its wireless infrastructure unit to MaxLinear (MXL) and its internet of things segment to Cypress Semiconductor (CY). Proceeds could help pay for future mergers and acquisitions. On June 13, Nomura raised its price target to 200 from 190. Nomura said the next iPhone benefits Broadcom because it has more components in the new model.Earnings per share popped up 26% in the fiscal second quarter. It gained 15% in the prior quarter. Second-quarter revenues jumped 119%. They grew 8% in the previous stanza.MFS Growth Fund's bets on its best ideas are fairly bold. Its top 10 accounted for nearly 31% of assets as of May 31.Technology was the fund's largest sector, with a 23% weighting. Retailing was second, at 15%. Health care was next, with just under 15%.Managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel had just shy of 97% of their shareholders' money at work in U.S. stocks. Most of the balance was in cash.

214,KO,"Shares of Coca-Cola (KO), one of Warren Buffett's ""Big Four"" investments, touched an all-time high Tuesday as consumer stocks continued to show strength amid the recent market volatility.Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) has 400 million shares, or a 9.3% stake, in Coca-Cola. American Express (AXP), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are the rest of Berkshire's top four stock holdings.Coca-Cola shares closed down 0.1% at 45.24 on the stock market today after rising as high as 45.56 earlier. Its stock rose above a first-stage base with a 44.01 buy point on Feb. 22. It's risen about 11% from the low point of the base and was extended far above its 10-week and 200-day averages.Coca-Cola's earnings per share growth appears poised for a comeback. Growth over the last three quarters has improved from -14% to -8% and -6% last quarter. Wall Street consensus is for the company's EPS this quarter to be flat on a year-over-year basis; it's expected to then return to growth, posting a 3% increase next quarter.The company on Feb. 18 said that it was raising its quarterly divided to 35 cents a share from 33 cents, prompting RBC Capital analyst Nik Modi to say in a report that Coke is about to kick off a long-term bull run that could last three to eight years.Coke joins other consumer stocks, such as McDonald's (MCD), Home Depot (HD), Domino's Pizza (DPZ) and and Ross Stores (ROST), which are all trading in record high territory.McDonald's rose to a new high close at 124.61 on Feb. 1. On Tuesday, it rose 0.4% to at 123.43.Home Depot hit a fresh high at 134.74 on Nov. 27 before consolidating. It gained 0.7% Tuesday. Meanwhile, HD Supply (HDS), a home and building supplies distributor, gapped up as much as 6% after it reported better than expected earnings Tuesday and issued bullish guidance. Shares jumped 4.8% Tuesday.Domino's Pizza shot up 13% on Feb. 25 to 132.90 after reporting a 27% surge in quarterly EPS. Domino's dipped 1.1% Tuesday.

215,KO,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) CEO Warren Buffett's bet with a hedge fund may show that all you need is the pastoral eminence known as the S&P 500 -- rather than the fancy approach such funds use to beat the market.Buffett's 10-year bet that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (VFIAX), an S&P 500 index fund, could outperform five funds of hedge funds selected by Protege Partners appears to be paying off, says Fortune, which has followed the bet since first reporting on it in 2008.Protege's five funds of hedge funds rose 1.7% on average last year, in contrast to the 1.36% gain that the Vanguard fund brought in. However, Fortune notes, the Vanguard fund has gained 65.67% over the bet's first eight years, which include 2015, compared to 21.87% on average for the Protege funds of funds.Berkshire Hathaway's class B shares closed down 0.4% in the stock market today and are up 5% so far this year. The S&P 500 is down about 2.9% for 2016.The Berkshire Hathaway chief's hunch appears to be backed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which said Wednesday that most small-, mid- and large-cap managers have been underperforming S&P indexes.Last year, 66.11% of large-cap managers, 56.81% of midcap managers and 72.2% of small-cap managers underperformed the S&P 500, the S&P MidCap 400 and the S&P SmallCap 600, respectively.Over five years, 84.15% of large-cap managers, 76.69% of midcap managers and 90.13% of small-cap managers lagged their respective benchmarks. And over 10 years, 82.14% of large-cap managers, 87.61% of midcap managers and 88.42% of small-cap managers failed to outperform.But if Warren Buffett is so smart, why not just invest like the legendary ""Sage of Omaha""?Berkshire Hathaway's top stock holdings include American Express (AXP), Coca-Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC), and he has built up his position in Phillips 66 (PSX) in recent months.Many investors do try to mimic Berkshire Hathaway's investments, but Buffett thinks that's a bad idea.“I wouldn’t ever urge them to do anything based on what we do. If they want to do what Berkshire does, then they should buy Berkshire,” Buffett told CNBC last month. “I think they’re making a big mistake by piggybacking me or 10 other people whose names appear in the paper.”

216,KO,"FedEx (FDX) got a lower price target Thursday following the news that Amazon (AMZN) will lease planes for air cargo, while Coca-Cola (KO) and CVS Health (CVS) had their price targets raised.RBC Capital Markets cut its price target on FedEx to 153 from 157 and maintained its sector perform rating on the stock. The delivery company, along with peers such as UPS (UPS) and DHL, might feel a little pain from Amazon’s decision to operate its own fleet of jet freighters to deliver its packages.On Wednesday, Amazon confirmed a deal to lease 20 Boeing (BA) 767 jets from Air Transport Services Group (ATSG) as a way of grabbing more control over distribution and logistics amid rapid growth in its Prime service, which promises speedy delivery.FedEx shares closed down 0.1% on the stock market today. Amazon fell 0.1%, Boeing rose 0.1%, and Air Transport added 4.8%.Coca-Cola’s price target was raised to 55 from 47 by RBC Capital Markets, which maintained its outperform rating on the stock.In a Thursday morning note, RBC analyst Nik Modi said “we are at the precipice of Coca-Cola inflecting to a period of sustained outperformance, particularly among its consumer staples mega cap peers under our coverage.”Those peers include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Clorox (CL), Kimberly-Clark (KMB), PepsiCo (PEP), Altria Group (MO) and Reynolds American (RAI).Coca-Cola’s stock price touched a new stock high of 44.83 on Wednesday and moved 0.9% higher Thursday.

217,KO,"Utilities and consumer staples raced past most sector equity ETFs this year, but investors shouldn't get stuck in a defensive-minded, dividend-focused rut.""Consider cyclical sectors over defensive and high-dividend-paying sectors,"" BlackRock advises in its latest Investment Directions note. As of December 2015, BlackRock managed $4.64 trillion, more than any other investment firm in the world.Both utilities and consumer staples are vulnerable to rising yields, which BlackRock anticipates over the intermediate term as inflation expectations pick up.Consumer staples look particularly unattractive to the firm's strategists, with valuations appearing stretched despite the earnings stability of companies such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Coca-Cola (KO).""As the global growth outlook improves, we think cyclical stocks give more bang for the buck,"" the BlackRock team of global investment strategists wrote.Which sectors in particular? They're overweight consumer discretionary and technology.Job growth and low energy prices are fueling revenue and earnings momentum for consumer discretionary companies, including retail, media, automobile and leisure businesses. The sector is expected to deliver the best earnings growth among all sectors.SPDR S&P Retail (XRT) has gained 4.3% so far in 2016 through March 23, making it a best-performing consumer discretionary ETF. By comparison, its broadly diversified sibling, Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY), has jabbed 0.5% lower over the same period.The 96 stock holdings in the XRT portfolio include Ulta Beauty (ULTA), a highly rated IBD 50 stock. The beauty-store chain has grown earnings 24% annually over the past three years.

218,KO,"Stocks chalked up losses in early afternoon trading as the market shifted the focus of its worries.The Nasdaq and S&P 500 each fell 0.6%, while the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2%. The small-cap Russell 2000 flopped 1.7%, though small caps had been outperforming the major indexes recently.Volume in the stock market today was running slightly lower on both major exchanges.The indexes have recently patched over some worries. Strong jobs numbers last week eased concerns about a possible U.S. recession. Crude oil prices are working on their fourth consecutive week of gains. This has eased fears that job losses in the oil industry will offset any boost lower gasoline prices give to consumer spending.However, weak trade data from China thrust the Chinese economy back to the top of the worry list. Data for February showed that exports fell 25.4% from a year earlier.Oil, steel and mining stocks led the downside. In the S&P 500, Devon Energy (DVN) took the biggest hit, with the oil and natural gas explorer falling almost 9% in heavy volume, though there was no news specific to the stock.Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks also skidded. The chip groups have rallied about 20% off their February lows and were probably due for some profit-taking.Blue chips were mostly down. However, Coca-Cola (KO) popped almost 1% to a new 52-week high.Among other Dow stocks,  the best performers included Nike (NKE), up 1.7%; McDonald's (MCD) up 1.3%; and Home Depot (HD), up 1.1%.

219,KO,"The world's largest soft drink maker, Coca-Cola (KO), reported a fifth straight quarter of better than expected earnings per share.Coca-Cola said early Tuesday that its fourth-quarter EPS fell 14% to 38 cents on an 8.2% drop in revenue to $10 billion. Wall Street was expecting 37 cents EPS and $9.91 billion revenue.The beverage maker, which also sells teas, juices and energy drinks, says that it's agreed to refranchise its China bottling operations to China Foods and Swire Beverage Holdings, its partners there. Coke earlier shifted bottling operations to partners in Europe and Africa.The upside earnings surprise comes after Coke last year moved forward with a five-point plan that it laid out in late 2014 to reinvigorate growth and boost profits.CEO Muhtar Kent said in a statement that the results reflect the reorganization. ""Importantly, this top-line growth was led by our flagship market of North America, which delivered its strongest annual performance in three years.""Coke's unit case shipments grew 1% in China. Its case volume in Japan rose 3%, and the company saw double-digit growth in India.Its shares rose 1.5% to 43.30 in the stock market today. Its stock has been forming a flat base for two months with a current buy point of 44.01.Among other large soft drink makers, archrival PepsiCo (PEP) edged up 0.8%, Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) 1.5%, and energy drink maker Monster Beverage (MNST) 1%. Cocal-Cola has a big stake in Monster Beverage.

220,KO,"What do Coca-Cola (KO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) have in common, aside from the fact that they're megacap U.S. companies?All three were in billionaire stock guru Warren Buffett's top 10 holdings as of Dec. 31. They also make IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, which highlights companies with steady profit growth and dividends.Coca-Cola, No. 3 in Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKA) portfolio, has slipped back into a flat base after briefly clearing a 44.01 buy point last week. The Coke maker doesn't show up on Dividend Leaders in Tuesday's IBD, since the list is truncated due to space limitations. It pays an annualized yield of 3.2%, above the 2.25% average payout of the S&P 500.Procter & Gamble, No. 7, is near an 83.10 buy point of a long cup with handle. The Tide and Pampers maker pays a 3.3% annualized dividend. No. 9, Wal-Mart -- which offers a 3% yield -- is 20% off its high and isn't near an entry.Two other stocks that are smaller Berkshire Hathaway positions also make the Dividend Leaders. AT&T (T), with a 5.2% annual dividend, tops the IBD screen. The telecom services giant was added to IBD's Leaderboard in early February as a defensive play and has held up well. Shares are up 8.7% so far this year. They're still in buy range from a 36.55 entry.AT&T has a three-year Earnings Stability Factor of 2 on a scale from 0 (most stable) to 99 (least stable). Its Composite Rating of 99 is best in its 18-stock industry group.Verizon Communications (VZ), the other Buffett telecom stock, is second with a 98 Composite. Shares, up 11% this year, are just above a 51.30 buy point. Volume has been light the past few weeks. The telecom services provider's dividend yields 4.5%, and its three-year Earnings Stability Factor is also a 2.

221,KO,"After a mild pullback in April, and again in mid-May, low volatility ETFs are on the upswing again. These strategies cushion portfolios against big market drawdowns like the ones investors saw early this year.PowerShares S&P MidCap Low Volatility (XMLV) posted a fresh 52-week high of 38.09 on the stock market today. Its bolting RS line is a sign that it is outperforming the benchmark S&P 500.The exchange traded fund invests in roughly 80 of the least volatile midcap stocks, including salvaged-car auctioneer Copart (CPRT), ranked No. 1 by IBD in the auto parts industry group.Stocks with the lowest price volatility get the biggest weighting in the XMLV portfolio.However, two industry experts strike notes of caution about this popular asset class.Low volatility ETFs tend to be stuffed with more established, dividend-paying names. A potential Fed interest-rate hike in June or July could dent high-dividend sectors such as utilities or consumer staples, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote June 1. His research note preceded Friday's dismal jobs report, which was perceived to set back the likelihood of an imminent rate hike.Rosenbluth suggests that investors may want to consider a small, new rival to the hugely popular iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV).Like SPLV, PowerShares S&P 500 ex-Rate Sensitive Low Volatility (XRLV) invests in low volatility stocks in the S&P 500. But there's a difference.SPLV looks for the 100 stocks with the lowest volatility over the past 12 months. XRLV invests in the 100 stocks that show both low volatility and low interest-rate risk. It removes stocks that have historically lagged when rates are rising.XRLV has a zero weighting in utilities and 14.6% in consumer staples, both of which are rate-sensitive sectors. By comparison, SPLV has 21.1% and 20.8% weightings in the respective sectors. Also, XRLV has a 17.5% weighting in the financial sector vs. 13.0% for SPLV. Banks and some other financial services tend to benefit from increasing rates.Coca-Cola (KO), Waste Management (WM) and PepsiCo (PEP) and a host of other stocks are common to both portfolios.But medical equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) and credit-ratings agency Equifax (EFX) are among XRLV holdings not to be found in SPLV.As a new ETF, XRLV should be traded with care.Moreover, low volatility stocks may be starting to look expensive. ""As more money has piled in (to low or minimum volatility ETFs), valuations have richened commensurately,"" Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research for Morningstar Inc., wrote in a May report.Johnson looked at the historical relationship between the beginning value of the MSCI USA Minimum Volatility Index's price-to-cash-earnings ratio and subsequent 3-year annualized returns. He found that the richer the starting valuation, the lower the ensuing return.""At current levels, newcomers to the low volatility part could be setting themselves up for disappointing future returns,"" Johnson cautioned.This year, low volatility ETFs focused on U.S. large caps have surged in popularity.IShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV) absorbed a staggering $5.37 billion in new money through May, more than any other equity exchange traded fund. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) soaked in $1.04 billion over the same period.Smart fund investors are looking beyond large caps for less risky stocks. Both XMLV and PowerShares S&P SmallCap Low Volatility (XSLV) have positive net flow year to date.They're outperforming their large-cap peers too. XMLV was up 11.6% year to date through June 2 vs. 8.9% for XSLV, 6.8% for XRLV and 6.6% for SPLV.By comparison, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), a proxy for the broad market, gained 4.0%.

222,KO,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRKB) investments took a hit in the first quarter as financial stocks pulled down the value of his ""Big Four"" companies.Berkshire's holdings in American Express (AXP) and Wells Fargo (WFC) both fell in value, partly offset by increases in the other half of the ""Big Four"" -- top food and beverage stock, Coca-Cola (KO), and IBM (IBM), which both grew in value. Coke closed down 0.2% Monday, and IBM ended virtually flat.Financials were among the hardest-hit industries in the first quarter as interest rates lingered near record lows and the energy slump continued. Berkshire Hathaway reported first-quarter financial results on Friday after the market closed.Berkshire reported an 8% increase in first-quarter revenue to $52.4 billion. Net earnings rose 8.1% to $5.66 billion.And railroad, utilities and energy revenue slid 11% to $8.85 billion amid a slump in the railroad industry. The company expects that to change.""As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we concluded that there were no unrealized losses that were other than temporary,"" Berkshire said in its report on Friday.The Big Four accounted for about 60% of Berkshire's stock holdings as of March 31, up a bit from 59% the prior quarter. The value of the holdings changed from the end of 2015 to March 31 for various reasons, including company stock buybacks that boosted share values.The value of Berkshire's Coca-Cola shares rose to $18.6 billion at the end of the first quarter from $17.2 billion at the end of 2015. Its holdings in IBM grew to $12.3 billion from $11.2 billion.However, the value of its Wells Fargo stock slid to $24.2 billion from $27.2 billion and American Express fell to $9.3 billion from $10.5 billion.Railroad, utilities and energy stock holdings rose to $1.29 billion from $1.24 billion even as revenue from Berkshire-owned companies in its Railroad, Utilities and Energy business fell 11% to $8.85 billion, including a sharp drop by its BNSF Railway, which has been battered by lower shipments of energy products including coal and oil.Berkshire total stock investments in finance companies' stocks declined 5% to $106.42 billion.Berkshire bought 425 million shares of H.J. Heinz, now a subsidiary of Kraft Heinz (KHC) in June 2013 and has added to those holdings, which it said in the report have a ""liquidation preference of $8 billion"" as of March 31. Aggregate costs for the Kraft Heinz stock investments was $12.25 billion. Kraft Heinz rose 0.2% to 84.19 Monday afternoon.It also has $2.1 billion worth of gum maker Wrigley, which is owned by privately held candy and snacks maker Mars. It has 3 million shares of plastics and agricultural products maker Dow Chemical (DOW), valued at about $3 billion, and owns 9% of Canada-based Restaurant Brands International (QSR), parent of the Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains. Restaurant Brands was down 1%.Berkshire Hathaway shares closed down 1.2% in the stock market today. It fell to a 123.55 low on Feb. 3 before turning up.

It stretched their losing streak into a third straight week and sixth in the past seven weeks, according to Lipper Inc.Signs that the U.S. is carving out steady economic growth spiced up the week's stock market news.But investors were more concerned about the slowdown in China's economy and the drop-off in China's demand for goods and services from around the globe.Only a trio of U.S. diversified stock mutual funds gained ground in the latest week.

233,KO,"For Dennis Lynch, investing is a family affair. The 45-year-old lead manager of $3.5 billion Morgan Stanley Growth is following in the footsteps of his father, who was a money manager and co-founder of Lynch & Mayer, starting in the 1970s.The elder Lynch (also named Dennis) can be proud. Morgan Stanley Growth was the 25th-best-performing U.S. diversified stock fund in 2015. It outperformed 95% of its peer mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. over the past five years.And with a 9.4% gain in the fourth quarter that topped 97% of his direct rivals, Lynch was again among the top-performing mutual fund managers.With Lynch at the helm since mid-2004, the fund has focused on its managers' best ideas rather than on overdiversifying. It has aimed for securities in the stock market that benefit from competitive advantages such as a network effect among site visitors and from a steady flow of subscription-based revenues.And in an industry that employs battalions of analysts who are experts at diving into the details of earnings reports, a key member of Lynch's team is a futurist whose job is to spot emerging investment trends years before they generate revenues and profits.Lynch talked with IBD about his investment approach from his office in Manhattan.IBD: Dennis, your fund has outperformed in 2015 and long-term. But in 2012 and 2014 it was middle of the pack. What went against the fund's approach in those years?Lynch: We try to add value through stock picking and identifying what we think are mispriced or undervalued companies, companies that are undervalued because investors don't understand the quality of their business or how they can grow over time.Along the way, there can be periods when specific ideas are not working or the market is not in agreement with our ideas. We had a challenging period in 2012. In the back part of the year we did poorly, given a large allocation to Facebook (FB). It came public with a lot of public enthusiasm, then went through a vicious and challenging period when the stock price more than halved.We actually added to our position during that challenging period, then later on we benefited as the stock price rebounded.Generally, when we have ups and downs relative to the market or peer groups, sometimes it's because we're going through a period when the market thinks we're wrong. And we also make mistakes from time to time.IBD: Your concentrated portfolio is the flip side of your long-term approach, right?Lynch: Yes. Why we do well in any given year reflects decisions made in previous years rather than anything we do in the current year.Amazon.com (AMZN) is a company we've owned continuously for roughly 13 years. The reasons we got involved were a combination of the online advantages that made them tough to beat. They offer inventory that they don't necessarily possess themselves, but which they have access to.At the same time, they've slowly built a very large logistical infrastructure in the physical world.And they target increasingly technology through their Amazon Web Services.IBD: Is there anything that could disrupt a juggernaut like Facebook?Lynch: You don't have to worry that another social network will get bigger. That's highly unlikely.But is there something out there that can take people's attention away, like virtual reality or some other technology that still in its early stages now?In the absence of something like that, it's unlikely that Facebook's network effect will be challenged anytime soon.IBD: LinkedIn's (LNKD) third-quarter profit jumped 50%, a nice rebound from Q2. This is another network-effect play, isn't it?Lynch: Both holdings have strong network effects of users connected to each other.Both have users who cross-connect. It's hard to displace them. Even though both have that at their core, they make money in different ways. So we're not exposed to the same end markets or even the same spending patterns.Earlier in the year, LinkedIn made changes to its workforce that surprised people. But each quarter, results have seen the fruits of LinkedIn's longer-term thinking.IBD: The key to Monster Beverage (MNST) is how their deal with Coke (KO) gives them a shot at foreign expansion, right?Lynch: With Coca Cola becoming a substantial owner, it opens opportunities for distribution to become more efficient in the U.S. and increases chances of capturing more global share. They've had less success outside the U.S.IBD: Is Salesforce.com (CRM) one of those subscription-revenue companies you like?Lynch: They provide customer relationship management services that in the past were sold on a high license-fee basis. They had a novel approach of offering those services in a subscription format rather than requiring large upfront fees, which can be costly.It gives customers the ability to benefit from upgrades to the whole system rather than having to buy a new version of the software for each upgrade cycle.As a result, they built a high recurring-revenue business. On an annual basis, revenue renewal is over 90%. So that gives their revenue a lot of visibility.They are figuring out how to meet other important needs for large organizations. They're expanding into marketing.IBD: Why has Athenahealth's (ATHN) share price been choppy recently?Lynch: Athenahealth is the dominant provider for doctors to get reimbursed by insurers.And the way their system works, every doctor can learn (about methods for improving insurance reimbursements) from the experience of other doctors on the platform.Once Athena figures out how to apply new rules for one doctor, all doctors benefit.So it's hard for a doctor not to join the network. This is an inherent network effect. But their penetration is still less than 10% of the overall doctor market, so they've got a lot of room for growth.And they've diversified into electronic health records. Once you get a lot of doctors to join, you can provide other services, which draws in more doctors.IBD: After a rough patch,Intuitive Surgical's (ISRG) earnings-per-share growth is accelerating again. Is this improvement for real?Lynch: That rough period was when they were transitioning from a first-generation platform to the next generation.And it's a razor-and-razor-blades model. There are a lot of consumables that need to be reordered each time.So it's a high recurring revenue model. It continues to take share.When a company has an upgrade cycle, customers wonder if they should order the old system or the new one. Sales can slow. It happened a couple of years ago. Now things are heading back in the right direction.IBD: Dennis, how does your team differ from its rivals?Lynch: One thing I try to emphasize when I talk with people who are thinking about whether to put money in the fund is what skin in the game do people running a product have?Here, we're not going to do well every quarter or every 12 months. There can be periods when things go badly, but through Morgan Stanley's deferred compensation program, the vast majority of team pay is deferred, and most goes into our products.We have significant personal exposure through co-ownership with our clients in the products we make for them.IBD: Tell me about the person on your team whose job is to scout ahead for emerging trends or disruptive new technologies.Lynch: Yes, in addition to our expert work, meetings with companies, looking at financial statements — those conventional activities — we've dedicated one person to research topics that have the potential to be disruptive in industries or sectors.IBD: What is your change researcher looking at these days?Lynch: More recently, he's been focused on Bitcoin and virtual reality. These are potentially powerful emerging themes and disruptive trends.IBD: Who is your disruptor expert?Lynch: Stan Delaney.IBD: How do you and the five other managers on this fund — David Cohen, Sam Chainani, Alexander Norton, Jason Yeung and Armistead Nash — divide your workload? Is each manager responsible for different industrial sectors, for example?Lynch: I act as a generalist. Outside of me, everyone has a sector and industry expertise. Sam follows the Internet and financials. David follows consumer, which sounds like one industry but is really multidimensional. Jason follow health care and some consumer staples. Armistead follows business services and software. Alex does technology — we think of technology differently than the Internet. Companies use the Internet to create. They are not selling semiconductors or software. Alex focuses on those kinds of business models and things like industrials.My dad managed large- and midcap growth stocks, starting in the 1970s in a time when managers tended to be generalists. Today people tend to be experts in a category but lacking the perspective of knowing multiple categories and being able to compare. We believe we benefit from taking the generalist approach, and we can leverage the experts.

294,KO,"AllianzGI Focused Growth Fund makes success look easy. In May, when fund lead manager Scott Migliori spoke with IBD, the now-$756 million portfolio was up about 8% for the year, topping 89% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. and the S&P 500's 4% gain.Now, going into Tuesday, the fund, which carries an A+ 36-Month Performance Rating from IBD, is up 11.1% for the year, outperforming 93% of its peer mutual funds and the S&P 500's gain, stuck at 3%.That good trend has required hard work and savvy moves.""If anything, the stock market today is more narrow,"" Migliori said. ""Fewer names are making newer highs. I wouldn't call it the Nifty 50. There are maybe 10 to 15 stocks that are consistently performing well, mainly in the tech and consumer discretionary spaces. We've owned enough of those to generate outperformance, but it's gotten tougher.""How? The health care sector has rolled over. ""It had been in leadership for a number of years,"" Migliori said. ""But it's fallen off the last few months because earnings revisions were not as strong as investors wanted, and because of potential political challenges over price controls.""The fund has cut exposure to drugmakers and biotechs, including Gilead (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB).Proceeds from those trims have been rotated into names like Palo Alto Networks (PANW).Trading around 187, shares in the next-generation firewall and security software maker are close to a 189.82 buy point.Since going public in 2012, revenue has swelled nearly 1,800% to $928 million. And the firm, which is on IBD's Leaderboard, has notched three quarters of triple-digit earnings per share gains.""The security area is fast growing, given the cyberattacks that governments and corporations are facing,"" Migliori said.The fund recently started its stake in Accenture (ACN), which performs consulting and provides IT services. Many investors were concerned that Accenture's business would be hurt as customers shifted to cloud-based software.""But what we've seen is fairly robust business for Accenture in integrating cloud-based services with (customers') existing IT infrastructures,"" Migliori said. ""The cloud has not only not been negative; it's been a positive growth driver.""Increasingly, amid a slow-growth economy and the prospect of rising interest rates, the fund looks for companies that can boost earnings in any market.Monster Beverage (MNST) is one of those. ""Energy drinks are taking share of the overall beverage market,"" Migliori said. ""Their partnership with Coke (KO) will let them grow more quickly. They'll be able to expand distribution more quickly.""Still Likes FacebookThe fund is high on Facebook (FB), yet recently took some profits. Why? Because the stock had enjoyed a big run and because its growth rate had slowed slightly.""But we still like it,"" Migliori said. ""They're just starting to monetize Instagram. The amount of their capital spending is not as bad as people had feared. They're consolidating after a big run, but there's nothing to fundamentally derail the story at this point.""Amazon (AMZN) is another name that Migliori thinks can carve out growth in any macro environment.Also, last year's spending on warehouse improvements is contributing to this year's operating efficiencies. ""And AWS (Amazon Web Services) is growing faster than people realize,"" Migliori said.

298,KO,"Columbia Select Large Cap Growth Fund has rewarded loyal investors. Since Tom Galvin became the $7.3 billion fund's lead manager in 2003, it has handily topped its benchmark.Galvin manages the fund with a focused strategy. ""We maintain a high-conviction portfolio of companies with quality earnings that grow consistently at a high level,"" he said. ""We think the market is efficient over long periods of time, and companies with excess earnings power will ultimately garner excess investment returns.""Galvin and his team typically hold 25 to 35 companies. ""We have a longer-term time horizon and generally low turnover because of the high conviction,"" he said. ""We also utilize risk-awareness tools like cross-correlation to consider how we can have more independent outcomes for the portfolio.""Columbia Select Large Cap Growth gained 8.23% so far this year going into Wednesday, vs. 5.63% by its large growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. The fund has topped the annual average of returns in the category by 455 basis points over the past three years and 211 basis points during the last 10 years.Galvin says the unit growers that he seeks are more in control of their own destiny. ""For the first nine months of the year, the average company in our portfolio saw approximately 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 20% profit growth,"" he said. ""S&P 500 profits have been about flat this year.""Monster ReturnsSelect Large Cap Growth's top holding as of Sept. 30 was Monster Beverage (MNST). ""It does not manufacture its products, so it has an asset-light business model that generates very strong returns on invested capital,"" Galvin said. ""Energy drinks are the fastest-growing category in the beverage industry, and Monster is a play on this opportunity. Its recent deal with Coca-Cola (KO) will serve to nearly double Monster's international volumes over the next several years.""Shares of Monster have climbed 41% this year.LinkedIn (LNKD) was the fund's No. 2 holding; it's been a part of the portfolio since 2012. ""It is a very disruptive force, changing the way companies recruit workers,"" Galvin said. ""It has a base of over 400 million registered users, which provides a significant amount of information to recruiters.""The company has seen its stock price rise 7.5% year-to-date.Another top tech-sector holding that Galvin has also owned since 2012 is Facebook (FB). ""Facebook's size and scale is very attractive to advertisers, so it continues to gain significant market share of ad spending budgets,"" he said. The stock has rallied 36% on the year.The Columbia Select team sees Visa (V) as a key beneficiary of a global shift from cash and checks to plastic and online payment. ""We're expecting double-digit unit volume growth and continuing operating leverage to sustain double-digit EPS growth for the next several years,"" Galvin said. Visa shares have spiked 22% in 2015.Galvin recently added Fitbit (FIT) to the portfolio. ""Fitbit is benefiting from the growing interest in better health and wellness monitored through wearable devices, of which it is the market leader,"" he said. ""It's a secular lifestyle shift and not just a fad.""

307,KO,"The most heavily traded ETFs rallied steadily higher last month, but it's been more of a mixed bag so far this month. PowerShares QQQ (QQQ) has held up the best in the past month, followed by SPDR S&P 500 (SPY). Unlike those large-cap peers, iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) has returned to where it was a month ago.Small-cap ETFs found their way into investors' ETF strategies as the dollar marched steadily higher at the start of the year. That currency move was expected to act as a headwind for large caps and to benefit small caps, which are less reliant on international revenues.Only one half of that equation has borne out so far.Despite more mixed action for the greenback lately,Coca-Cola (KO),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and other large U.S. companies report that relative dollar strength continues to take a bite out of revenues and profits.But the expected boost for small caps has yet to materialize. Why is that?Small caps are more sensitive to changes in monetary policy, Russ Koesterich, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, wrote Nov. 8.""While small caps do have less exposure to international sales, they have proved more vulnerable to rising real interest rates (the interest rate after inflation) and investor anticipation of monetary tightening,"" he said.""Historically, small cap relative performance has been strongest when short-term rates — those controlled by the Fed — are falling,"" he added.The minutes of the latest Federal Reserve meeting, released today, show that many policymakers are leaning toward a rate liftoff in December.Koesterich expects the small-cap segment to benefit if the Fed decides to wait. Overall, he advises investors to stay neutral as far as size bias in U.S. stock investing goes.IWM holds nearly 2,000 small-cap stocks including more volatile microcaps. Highly rated IBD 50 stocks in the portfolio include enterprise software firm Manhattan Associates (MANH) and the regional Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK).The ETF has $27.34 billion in assets and a 0.20% expense ratio.It has an average daily dollar volume of more than $4 billion — ahead of QQQ but far behind SPY's $25 billion.The average market cap is $1.49 billion — about half the typical fund in this category, says Morningstar analyst Michael Rawson.He notes that the ETF isn't top-heavy — the 10 largest holdings account for just 3% of assets.But he adds that it's far from the cheapest ETF in its category. Schwab U.S. Small-Cap (SCHA) charges 0.08% in expenses.IWM has given up 3.2% year to date through Tuesday vs. an 8.6% gain for QQQ and 1.4% for SPY.Over a much longer time horizon, it's a different story. IWM produced an average annual 12.8% gain in the past 15 years vs. 3.5% for QQQ and 4.7% for SPY.Small-cap ETFs diversify investment portfolios and are tried-and-tested strategies for successful investing.Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter @IBD_ANarayanan.

That's big news, and a big hurdle for the market to clear.While Friday's premarket action was not encouraging, the Nasdaq does open the session with a 1.4% gain for the week, the S&P 500 is ahead 1.5%, and both indexes have gained in nine of the past 11 weeks.The economic calendar closes out the week on a quiet note, with only the preliminary reading on U.S. services due out from researcher Markit at 9:45 a.m. ET, and regional surveys expected from the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank at 10 a.m. and from the Kansas City Federal Reserve at 11 a.m. Baker Hughes (BHI) releases its weekly rig count data at 1 pm.About half of the Dow's 30 stocks moved lower, the other half remained flat in premarket trade.

Same-store-sales rose 0.8%, vs. expectations for a 2% increase. The stock has been scooping out a consolidation in tight trade since June.Homebuilder Lennar (LEN) rose more than 1% as its fiscal Q4 earnings easily beat consensus views. Revenue growth stopped just short of forecasts, but new home deliveries rose 10% and orders for even newer homes jumped 20%. Lennar shares have been in a gradually weakening consolidation since August.Handheld device maker BlackBerry (BBRY) grabbed a 6% gain. The Ontario, Canada, firm reported not-as-bad-as-expected Q3 sales and losses.Among leaders, open source software developer Red Hat (RHT) jumped more than 6% to lead the IBD 50 list. The Raleigh, N.C., company late Thursday delivered Q3 revenue and earnings above consensus forecasts. Management's Q4 revenue guidance was above, earnings guidance was below, analyst consensus views. The stock has been working to retake its 50-day moving average, and ended Thursday 3% below an 81.59 cup-base buy point.Qihoo 360 Technology (QIHU) climbed almost 2% after finally inking a deal to be taken private by a group of investors led by company chairman Zhou Hongyi for $9.3 billion. Zhou had proposed the deal earlier in the year, before markets in China slumped into a serious correction.Oil prices slipped — West Texas Intermediate crude shed more than 1% to below $35 a barrel and down just over 3% for the week. Brent crude was a fraction lower, just below $37 and down almost 3% on the week. Gold rose a fraction, still standing tight near the $1,055 per ounce level.

344,KO,"Monster Beverage's (MNST) first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street forecasts on costs related to the termination of distribution agreements following its partnership with Coca-Cola.The energy drink maker's earnings grew 14% to 62 cents per share, below estimates for 68 cents. Net sales, excluding acceleration of deferred revenue, increased 9.5% to $587 million, missing views for $601.2 million.Shares were down 3.8% in extended trading after closing up 2% on the stock market today.Monster's international prospects are getting lift from its partnership with Coca-Cola (KO), which is acquiring a 16.7% stake in Monster and is its preferred distribution partner worldwide.Under the terms of the $2.15 billion transaction announced last year, Coke will transfer ownership of its energy-drink brands, including NOS and Full Throttle, to Monster. And Monster will transfer to Coke its nonenergy drinks business, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea.""To date we have transitioned approximately 84% of our targeted distribution rights in the United States to the Coca-Cola Company and its distribution network, which was accomplished with minimal disruption in the retail trade,"" CEO Rodney Sacks said Thursday in a statement.

345,KO,"Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) late Thursday said its Keurig Kold cold-beverage maker won't fully roll out until the 2016 holiday season. That left investors feeling cold. Shareholders already have been burned by weak sales of the Keurig 2.0 brewer.Keurig Green Mountain will start selling the single-serve brewer for iced coffee, sodas, sports drinks, and iced tea online this fall. It will be available online and select retail stores this holiday. It won't reach all retail stores until the 2016 holiday season.BThe Kold device is supposed to have ""one-button simplicity"" — but executives said they will provide instructions on how to use the device.The Kold device was developed with Coca-Cola (KO). Coca-Cola has bought a significant stake in Keurig.There will be 16 brands of drinks to start, including Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper (DPS) and 6 Keurig options. Single-serve pods will cost 99 cents to $1.29.The Keurig Kold will start at $300, which left some analysts cold on Thursday's call.The Kold device is expected to take on SodaStream (SODA).Keurig shares fell 9% to 93.77 Friday on the stock market today, undercutting the 52-week low set last week on Keurig's disappointing earnings and outlook.Keurig launched its Keurig 2.0 brewer with high hopes last year. But shoppers balked at technology that prevented other coffee pods from working with the 2.0.Sales growth has stalled, with profits actually falling in the last two quarters. Keurig conceded in last week's post-earnings call that it made a mistake and said it would bring back refillable K-Cups.SodaStream shares, which have been in a long downtrend amid plunging sales, were little changed late Thursday.Follow Ed Carson on Twitter: @IBD_ECarson.

"
366,KO,"Fox, now 72, left office in 2006 with a 70% approval rating. Some predecessors stole the silverware on the way out of the palace to live high in exile; he is building Mexico's first presidential library to be a center to promote honesty and transparency in public institutions.

"
370,KO,"In 1960, he enrolled in the business administration program at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City and graduated four years later. But he was too antsy for a desk job.

"
371,KO,"He rose quickly, married Coke receptionist Lilian de la Concha in 1969 and was named president of Coca-Cola Mexico in 1974 (the same year he earned a diploma in management from Harvard after the firm gave him six months off).

374,KO,"Over the next eight years, he and Lilian realized they couldn't have their own children yet couldn't adopt because Mexican mothers rarely give up their babies.

"
386,KO,"PAN had only 28% of registered voters nationally. However, Fox had worked with local deputies for the PRI and the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution (Partido de la Revolucion Democratica, or PRD) to get things done, so he reached beyond his base to create the Alliance for Change in 1999.

That badly undershot consensus for $1.08.The company also cut its 2015 sales outlook to flat to up by low-single digits from a prior view of growth in the mid-single to high-single digits.Keurig will host a webcast for investors and analysts on May 14 to give an update on the Keurig Kold beverage maker it's been developing in partnership with Coca-Cola (KO).In February Coke boosted its stake in Keurig to 16%, fueling speculation it may eventually buy the whole company.Keurig has said it plans to launch Keurig Kold this fall, along with 30 flavors that can be used to make soft drinks, iced tea and other cold beverages.Reports said that, unlike rival SodaStream's (SODA) home soft drink machines, Keurig Kold won't require a CO2 canister to make carbonated soft drinks.SodaStream shares plunged more than 8% after reporting Q1 EPS jumped to 29 cents from 9 cents, beating views, while revenue fell 23% to $91.3 million, missing.Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.

414,KO,"The year 1982 marked a turning point for S. Truett Cathy — and in the trajectory of the restaurant chain he founded, Chick-fil-A. Chick-fil-A had experienced nearly uninterrupted growth since its debut 15 years earlier.About 100 of Cathy's chicken sandwich restaurants dotted the country, mostly in the South.But that year, Chick-fil-A experienced its first (and only) decline in same-store sales.Fewer malls — where all of Cathy's restaurants were located then — were being built.And McDonald's and Wendy's were about to enter the quick-serve chicken market by offering chicken sandwiches and nuggets, which helped poultry prices soar.""All of that focus on chicken would be good for us in the long run,"" Cathy explained in ""Eat Mor Chikin, Inspire More People,"" his 2002 memoir, ""but the immediate effect was a double punch that caused me many sleepless nights.""Prudent InvestingCautious by nature, Cathy was also anxious about a corporate plan to double the number of Chick-fil-A's in two years and spend $10 million on a new corporate headquarters in Atlanta.Having grown up watching his mother struggle to run a boarding house in their home, Cathy hated the idea of carrying debt.So Cathy (1921-2014) invited his small executive committee on a two-day retreat.Instead of thinking up ways to cut costs, the execs reflected on why they were in the restaurant business to begin with.This discussion of first principles prompted Cathy and his team to articulate the following corporate mission statement:""To glorify God by being a faithful steward of all that is entrusted to us. To have a positive influence on all who come in contact with Chick-fil-A.""That simple act worked. ""Wonderful things began to happen,"" Cathy told Philanthropy magazine. ""I felt confident in the future.""The company grew by 29% in the next year and would go on to become one of the nation's largest family-owned companies. From then on, Cathy also began to focus more of his resources on charity, launching several endeavors that improved thousands of lives.Samuel Truett Cathy was born in Eatonton, Ga., and was an unlikely candidate to become a restaurant mogul. Growing up, he was a slow reader and learner.""I didn't have much confidence in my ability,"" he wrote in ""How Did You Do It, Truett?"" another autobiography. He was a C student and never attended college.Cathy took on jobs — newspaper delivery boy, Coke (KO) stand operator — that instilled in him the importance of keeping the customer satisfied: ""The key to succeeding with a paper route — and the restaurant business, I would later learn — is to take care of the customer.""After high school and a stint in the Army, Cathy and his brother Ben borrowed $10,000 to open a restaurant in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville in 1946.They called the restaurant Dwarf Grill because of its small size, later renaming it Dwarf House.Tragedy struck in 1949 when two of Cathy's brothers, including Ben, died when a plane they were flying in crashed. The year before, Truett had married Jeanette McNeil, with whom he had three children: Dan, Don (""Bubba"") and Trudy.Jeanette was instrumental in getting Cathy to recommit to his Southern Baptist faith. ""Her level of commitment showed me a new way to live,"" he wrote.Cathy built his business one satisfied customer at a time. But when he built a second restaurant, it promptly burned down.Cathy was philosophical about the loss. ""When I had two restaurants, I had one too many,"" he later reflected. ""So the Lord burned one down and gave me the chance to start Chick-fil-A.""With only one restaurant to manage, Cathy had more time to develop what would become his signature chicken sandwich.He took his time. ""I worked for years, adding this, taking away that,"" he wrote. ""I was up to more than 20 seasonings and breading ingredients — twice as many as Col. Sanders had in his secret recipe.""Southern StartCathy tested all of his variations on customers, gauging their reactions. It wasn't long before Cathy had trademarked the name Chick-fil-A and begun selling his chicken sandwiches to restaurants across the South. And in 1967, Cathy opened the first Chick-fil-A restaurant, in an Atlanta mall.Chick-fil-A was unique in two ways. It was the first fast-food restaurant to serve a skinless, boneless-breast chicken sandwich, and the first to operate in shopping malls. It was an immediate success.Over the succeeding decades, Chick-fil-A grew to more than 1,800 locations scattered across 40 states. Chick-fil-A opened its first freestanding restaurant in 1986 and its first drive-thru-only location in 1993.At the time of his death at age 93, Cathy's net worth was $1.9 billion, according to Bloomberg.The year before, the company took in more than $5 billion, making it the country's largest fast-food chicken restaurant by sales.In 2010, Chick-fil-A became the industry leader in average sales in its restaurants: $2.7 million per.Chick-fil-A's massive growth was helped by its ""Eat Mor Chikin"" ad campaign. It featured hapless dairy cows trying to persuade the public to eat chicken sandwiches instead of hamburgers by, in one example, painting ""Eat mor chikin"" on a billboard. The amusing campaign has remained a core part of Chick-fil-A's ads for two decades, winning numerous industry awards.Cathy succeeded by following four key principles: 1. The main reason companies fail is their desire to grow too fast too soon. Cathy exercised caution and patience. He spent 21 years owning just one restaurant, learning the trade and saving enough money to try new ventures. He never went into debt and never took his company public, which made him accountable only to God, himself and his customers. 2. As restaurant consultant and marketing expert Aaron Allen told IBD, Chick-fil-A ""focuses on speed, accuracy, cleanliness. They're not showy. As other companies start to drift, it has remained focused on fundamentals.""Chick-fil-A offers a basic chicken sandwich and a small menu that rarely changes. By doing so, it can focus on quality. Result: In 2014, Consumer Reports ranked Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwich No. 1. 3. The company's faith-based corporate culture is most clearly seen in its policy of closing on Sundays. Cathy said the policy is the result of his desire that employees save at least one day a week for God and family. 4. The ""loyalty effect"" is something Cathy instilled in employees and customers.Denise Lee Yohn, author of the book ""What Great Brands Do,"" says that Chick-fil-A has engendered a deep devotion from customers by serving a high-quality product and through top customer service. Chick-fil-A ""really does go the extra mile to serve its customers,"" she said. That includes everything from community-building promotions to college scholarships for staffers. Many call Chick-fil-A's employees among the industry's kindest. They often respond to customer requests with a hearty ""my pleasure.""Tasteful Loyalty""In the past 60 years, no matter the ups and downs, I have learned that the number one thing to do is to please the customer and they will come back,"" Cathy once said.As he became wealthy, Cathy donated more of his time and money to charities and started one of his own, called the WinShape Foundation, which provides scholarships and foster homes to needy children. Cathy himself was a foster parent for more than 30 years. He liked to say that some 150 children called him Grandpa.""People ask me why I invest so much in the foster homes,"" he said. ""The one thing I take more joy in than anything else in the world is seeing young people develop. They grow and make good decisions. They want to be winners despite the odds against them.""That's an aspiration that Cathy helped thousands of people, including himself, realize.

442,KO,"A wild run-up in a stock you own is exciting, but what you ideally want to see while the stock is basing is just the opposite type of action. When a stock is consolidating after a pronounced advance in price, the calmer the action, the better.Instead of wide and loose price action on big spikes in volume, look for stocks with tight weekly closes in calm, quiet trade.""On a weekly chart, tightness is defined as small price variations from high to low for the week, with several consecutive weeks' prices closing unchanged or remarkably near the previous week's close,"" IBD founder and Chairman William O'Neil wrote in ""How to Make Money in Stocks.""""If the base pattern has a wide spread between the week's high and low points every week, it's been constantly in the market's eye and frequently will not succeed when it breaks out,"" he wrote.Tight weekly closes signal accumulation by the big money: mutual funds, pensions, banks and other institutional investors.Let's say the market is selling off, but a leading stock on your watch list is trading tightly, with small price changes from week to week. That's a sign that some big money managers may be building a position in the stock but spreading purchases out over weeks or months, instead of causing a big price and volume spike by buying a stake at once.If large-fund managers are dumping shares, a stock will go down in heavy volume. Likewise, if they are snapping up shares, the stock will rise in brisk turnover.Tight trading is easier to spot in a flat base, due in part to the pattern's nature. The correction from a price high is contained within 15% from the base's peak to the trough. But it's a bullish trait that can occur in cup, cup-with-handle and double-bottom bases, too.Monster Beverage (MNST) saw some wild and loose overall price action in 2012 and into 2013, but trading began to tighten up in subsequent bases. The stock cleared a cup-with-handle base in December 2013, and rose 19% before consolidating again.The new pattern, which kicked off in February 2014, featured several areas of tight trading with a weekly change of less than 1%.Shares rocketed nearly 35% in the week ended Aug. 15, triggering the eight-week hold rule for winners that rally more than 20% in three weeks or less. That week, Coca-Cola (KO) said it would take a 16.7% ownership stake in Monster as part of a deal in which Coke would transfer its energy drink portfolio to Monster.The next week, shares fell 7.6% to start the left side of a new base. Weekly price action stayed in a fairly narrow range for the seven-week duration of the flat base, including a 1% or smaller price change for four straight weeks (1).Volume was light in the base, which is ideal. Monster cleared the 95.03 buy point Oct. 10, but heavy trade didn't kick in until the week ended Nov. 7, when the stock rallied 7% in above-average volume (2).The tight trading in calm volume helped set Monster up for a big run. Shares advanced as much as 64% from the entry to its early August peak of 155.83.

443,KO,"Talk about caffeine highs and lows. After negative publicity surrounding the health risks of consuming too much caffeine slowed growth in 2013, the energy-drink market resumed its run last year.Health risks apparently weren't shown to be strong enough to hold back core energy-drink consumers for too long.""The fact is, a lot of core consumers of energy drinks — young males — don't tend to pay a lot of attention to health concerns,"" Amit Sharma, an analyst with BMO Capital Markets, told IBD.Industry watchers say the category is poised for healthy growth the next few years at least.That's good news for the two dominant players in the energy-drink market: Corona, Calif.-based Monster Beverage (MNST) and its chief rival, the Austrian company Red Bull.Sharma, for one, recently assured his clients that it was safe not only for most people to consume energy drinks, but also to invest in Monster Beverage.Energy-Drink Safety BuzzIn a client note, Sharma pointed to ""mounting scientific evidence"" that consuming energy drinks in moderate amounts is safe. Together with Monster Beverage's voluntary labeling and marketing changes, he said, the risk of adverse regulatory action is largely removed.Monster now displays its total caffeine on packaging and an advisory warning that its energy drinks are not recommended for children, caffeine-sensitive people and pregnant or nursing women. It also reduced marketing programs to consumers under 18.How does Monster view health risks related to its energy drinks? Company executives declined to comment on any aspect of the business. But the first comment from CEO Rodney Sacks in a Feb. 26 conference call following its fourth-quarter report said it all: ""We reiterate that our products are safe.""Monster's gross sales in the quarter grew 12.1% vs. the prior year to $696.3 million. Earnings shot up 63% to 72 cents per share, sending Monster's stock up 13% to 141.Earnings for the full year jumped 42% over 2013 to $2.77 per share vs. 5% year-over-year growth in 2013. Gross sales for the year grew 9.3% to $2.8 billion.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2015 earnings to rise 22% to $3.37.""We think there is more upside to the stock,"" said Sharma, who has an outperform rating on it.The energy-drink market peaked in 2011 and 2012 on double-digit sales growth, according to the Mintel Group, a global market research agency. Mintel forecasts that energy-drink sales in the U.S. will grow around 40% from 2014 to 2019, or nearly 7% a year on average, as new users join the core cohort of 18- to 34-year-old males.Red Bull is the market leader in energy drinks worldwide.

But in the U.S., where Monster derives most of its sales, Monster and Red Bull are running neck and neck.""Monster has been pulling up on Red Bull, and they are almost tied now,"" said John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest.Monster Beverage was called Hansen Natural until the name got changed in 2012 to reflect the company's greater sales from Monster energy drinks than from natural soda and tea.Hansen launched its first energy drinks in 1997 and followed five years later with Monster Energy, which still comes in supersized, 16-ounce black cans featuring neon claws and Goth lettering on the outside and various vitamins and herbs on the inside — in addition to a blast of caffeine.Brand Grows RapidlyNearly 80% of Monster's sales are in the U.S., where Monster is growing faster than the overall energy-drink market.Red Bull is growing a little faster than Monster this year, however, due to the launch of new flavors, Sharma says. But he expects Monster's U.S. sales this year to grow in double digits.Monster is rolling out at least a couple of new products this year, such as recently launched Monster Energy Ultra Citron and Monster Rehab Peach Tea + Energy.But the biggest change will come from a deal with Coca-Cola (KO), set to close in the current quarter. Coke will acquire a 16.7% stake in Monster and become its preferred distribution partner worldwide.Under terms of the $2.15 billion transaction, Coke will transfer ownership of its energy-drink brands, including NOS and Full Throttle, to Monster. And Monster will transfer to Coke its nonenergy drinks business, such as Hansen's Natural Sodas and Peace Tea.""Monster gets access to the powerful Coke bottling system,"" said Sicher. ""Coke gets a significant equity stake in a very fast-growing beverage company, and its bottlers get more distribution of Monster.""Coke's new role ""will certainly accelerate the timeline for Monster's expansion into international markets,"" Sharma said.Going For The GlobeMonster's international sales have already been growing faster than domestic sales. Sacks said in the call that Japan is ""becoming one of our largest international markets."" He added that expansion in Germany, Great Britain, Greece, the Netherlands and Chile is also going well.One potential new market is China, Sharma says.""You could argue that over time, Coca-Cola will help Monster go into that market,"" he said. ""It's one of the biggest energy-drink markets, and Monster is not in that market today.""In a recent research report, analyst Theo Brito of BTIG suggested that at least $1.2 billion in new revenue opportunities could be up for Monster under the Coke ""brand swap"" from expansion into new consumer niches.Such new niche segments could include ""edgy millennial women,"" baby boomers and more affluent consumers overall, he noted. But still, young males ""may always be the largest energy drink consumer.""

477,KO,"Greg Steltenpohl is a pioneer in the nonalcoholic beverage industry. And he has advice for the entrepreneur who thirsts to make it big. If you want to win in a product category, study hard and truly grasp what your competitors do.Then go out and create something unique. Or make the product a different way.That advice from the head of Califia Farms may be easy to swallow, yet it's hard to do.How does one get started on the right path and do both things well?The CEO revs up his team by inspiring it to imagine, think, design and execute steps into the future.""At Califia we're trying to build innovation and kind of asking the question about the question after the question,"" Steltenpohl told IBD. ""We're trying to build that kind of culture of inquiry into everything that we do. And when you apply that type of cultural attribute to fundamental business aspects like manufacturing, it emerges as a core strategy.""Sweet TriumphsSteltenpohl knows about success in the tough field of beverages.He turned the U.S. fruit and vegetable juice market on its head after co-founding the Odwalla brand in 1980. That firm focused on minimally processed juice. He sold it to Coca-Cola (KO) in 2001 for $181 million, worth $242 million today.Steltenpohl is doing it again, this time via 5-year-old Pasadena, Calif.-based Califia Farms, which he co-founded with Sun Pacific.Califia has become a giant in almond milk, one of the fastest-growing niches in the food and beverage industry. How does Califia take Steltenpohl's advice to heart?When he started the company in 2010 and began production in 2011, he re-entered the citrus juice market. In his eyes, since citrus is the No. 1 beverage-flavoring agent in the world, Califia could not become a serious player without having at least one product in that category.So his team pondered this point: What could grow to become as popular as orange juice?They decided to develop a market in specialty flavors such as mandarin orange and clementine.Four years later, according to Steltenpohl, Califia is the country's largest producer of tangerine juice.Califia created California Lemonade with its different taste. ""The Meyer lemon has 10% to 15% less acid (than other lemon types). It has a much rounder flavor, and so you can lower the sugar content (and) increase the drinkability and the (beneficial) effects on people's stomachs,"" Steltenpohl said.Soon he moved into almond milk. Before making a single quart, his team thought hard about how to approach the market.Here's To Improvement""We weren't the first to market. Our thought process was, 'How can you make it better? How can you leapfrog where the pack is and really make something that provides a benefit and is not simply another brand?'"" Steltenpohl said.His solution was to reinvent the manufacturing process. Large almond milk makers cook up the nuts with heat and oil, then mix the resulting butter with water.Such a process creates oxidized byproducts, affecting taste.In contrast, Steltenpohl uses a method that he equates to recipes that date back to the Middle Ages.Rather than heat the almonds, Califia artisans blanch the skin off, make what Steltenpohl calls soaked milk flour, and then apply filtering steps. ""This allows us to place more almonds per ounce than most of our competitors and come up with an ultracreamy, velvety mouth feel without traditional food science techniques and lots of gums and binders,"" he said.Califia continues to innovate with products that range from almond-milk-based horchata to Double Espresso Pure Cold Brew Coffee With Almondmilk to agua fresca drinks with flavors such as watermelon, strawberry, mango, basil, ginger and chili lime.As of July, Califia products are in 27,000 retail outlets, including Kroger (KR), Safeway, Wal-Mart (WMT), Whole Foods (WFM), Gelson's Markets, Fresh & Easy and Stater Bros.Steltenpohl forecasts annual sales to hit $100 million in 2016.""Greg is a once-in-a-lifetime leader with whom to work,"" said Kaitlin Walter, a Califia marketing officer who joined the firm after a stint at Coke. ""Greg takes everyone's point of view seriously, weighing the various opinions from his team carefully before making executive decisions. He encourages all Califia employees to think creatively and out of the box, both by example and through encouragement.""Big MoneyFurther growth looks likely. On Sept. 15, Califia announced a $50 million investment by Stripes Group, a New York equity firm focused on consumers and tech.While almond milk industry sales are growing at a 40% annual clip, according to a report in May by market researcher Packaged Facts, Califia's Almondmilk brand enjoys 177% yearly growth.Dan Marriott, managing partner at Stripes, calls Steltenpohl a ""true product visionary"" and adds, ""Greg is assembling an amazing team and has cultivated a culture of rapid innovation focused on delivering premium, healthful products.""Steltenpohl, 60, has lived near oranges his entire life. During childhood, his family moved from Homestead, Fla., to Southern California's Highland area, once a hotbed of orange growth.""My father always picked houses away from people and near orange groves, so I was raised near the smell of orange blossoms,"" he said. ""This made a deep imprint on me. So when I was just out of college and broke, making fresh squeezed orange juice just made sense.""That college was Stanford, where he says he was the first to design and complete an undergraduate degree in environmental studies.After college, he joined two partners to start Odwalla as a simple business, selling fresh-squeezed orange juice out of a van in Santa Cruz, Calif. The idea was to offer something of premium quality.Sales grew, and Odwalla expanded outside of California by 1994.Two years later, an outbreak of E. coli bacteria contaminated a batch of apple juice shipments. Odwalla juice used blemished fruit, killing a child and sickening 66.It was not only tragic but also a public relations disaster. Sales dropped 90%, according to a Harvard Business School case study published in 1997. In 1998, Odwalla agreed to pay $1.5 million and admit guilt to charges of selling contaminated juice.Steltenpohl learned that to prevent such a calamity from recurring, a leader must have operating principles in place for factory workers to report any problems directly to top management.Steltenpohl is married with three sons, all of whom work in the beverage industry. He carries such passion for his products that he hasn't let a liver transplant several years ago slow his effort to meet with buyers at big trade shows such as Expo West in Anaheim, Calif.Winning WayIt's clear to Steltenpohl that corporate culture is vital.""One of the biggest things I learned is that you can use your culture as a significant competitive advantage and as a kind of business systems strategy,"" he said, adding: ""All of a sudden, you're bringing in all sorts of creative opportunities. You're bringing in a higher degree of quality control. And you're bringing kind of an excitement, you're infusing culture with a closeness to the product. I feel all of those pay off in the long run. I learned that at Odwalla, and I've been applying it in spades here at Califia.""

"
481,KO,"Broad Street - now known as 'experience square' has a dozen Ferrari's on display - 'only to look at - no touching allowed' ...which will only serve to drive the men into a frenzy..... The IPO was priced last night at $52/share - at the high end of the range - and was 'way oversubscribed' .....so instead of raising the IPO price to cool demand - they decided to remain within the range to create the 'desire' in the aftermarket......You can feel the excitement building, the tingle in your spine, the rapid breathing, the toe curling excitement and the rush of blood as the heart beats faster and faster exploding with fury as the opening bell rings.....( What a great way to start the day - I 'm exhausted already...)
"
482,KO,"Stocks chopped yesterday - as healthcare stocks got whacked over more political wrangling and investors/traders grew concerned about IBM (IBM) earnings and mounting concerns over Marissa Meyers options at Yahoo (YHOO) .......... The choppy trading on Wall Street suggests that traders are uncertain about the near-term direction of equities following the recent volatility and continuing disappointments in earnings reports and forward guidance.
"
483,KO,"IBM shares dropped 5.75% (or $8.50) after the company reported lower quarterly revenue for the 14th straight quarter - they also lowered guidance for the fiscal year.
"
484,KO,"So - investors and traders reacted to how far off the mark IBM's stock price was from fundamentals. The stronger dollar in this case - did hurt. The stock has been in a downtrend since July as investors began to re-price the company based on $ concerns..........breaking every support level it had only to find support at the $140 level in late August....churning and building a new base...............It was only in the last month that investors/traders thought that maybe the market had adjusted for it and punished it enough causing some to go on a bargain hunting spree. Well - that didn't work out too well...yesterday's news sent the stock right back down to those lows.....the question now is: Will it find support in here at $140/share?
"
485,KO,"YHOO - also disappointed - and warned about what the future holds - putting Mayer's turnaround plan in jeopardy.....causing her to announce a new plan - a resetting of sorts after two top executive 'flew the coop'.....saying that the changes are 'the result of careful planning' - one should ask - who's planning was it?
"
486,KO,"More broadly - 70% of companies so far have beat on the bottom line while only 40% of companies have beat on the top revenue line...this is becoming more of a problem, causing a disconnect between fundamentals and stock prices.....despite all of the rhetoric from Washington that the economy is doing just fine......
"
487,KO,"When the recession of 2008 hit and continued to hammer earnings, stock prices eventually fell hard. Are we gearing up for another fall? Technically, we are still struggling, bulls and bears are locked in a battle.....All of the major indexes are still in a downtrend....their 50 dma's are trending below their 200 dma's and all have found resistance as they have recently approached this longer-term technical indicator. So we remain locked in a tight range.
"
488,KO,"Next up - Oil and energy stocks.....what will they say about the current state of the economy? My sense is that stocks will stay in a sideways channel (1985/2050) as long as oil prices remain in the $43 to $50 range. If oil breaks $43 then look for stocks to come under renewed pressure breaking below 1985...and if for some reason - oil pierces $50 (unlikely in the short term) then we will see renewed excitement for stocks....taking us to the longer-term resistance at 2060. Now overnight oil fell 2% and is now trading at $45.75/barrel.....which will only cause some to remain laser-focused on today's EIA report. (Energy Information Admin).
"
489,KO,"Look for reports from BA, KO, ABT, BHI, BIOGEN, NT, GM, EMC, STJ and ITW today - as well as one FED Governor - Jerome Powell who will be speaking at 1:30 pm. - Will he give us a clue about what rates will do in October? My money says - no rate hike..... .

"
496,KO,"Ok...so what happened last night? All that hype about the China macro data kept everyone on edge over the weekend...what would they report? Would it be a disaster? What would that say about the health of the Chinese economy and then by default the global economy? In the end - it was NOT a blockbuster, in fact it was rather boring really....
"
497,KO,"At 10:00 pm est - China released a bunch of data - and it was mixed.....no disasters but no upside surprises either.........3rd Qtr GDP came in above expectations at 6.9% (exp was for 6.8%), Industrial Production did rise 5.7%, but that was below the exp of 6%. Fixed Asset Investments (FAI) - a key reading - came in at 10.3% - below the expectation of 10.8% and Retail Sales - that beat at 10.9% vs. the exp of 10.8%... So what does it all mean? Well - to start with - the data implies that the world is not ending and that the Chinese economy appears to be stabilizing - which in the end is a positive.
"
498,KO,"Angus Nicholson - Market Analyst at IG sums it up like this:
"
499,KO,"""It's hard to be overly optimistic about the headline number, especially given the range of other data released today. Nonetheless, markets have clearly been buoyed by the better than expected headline number, and it shows that China's economy has not deteriorated as much as some had thought""
"
500,KO,"James Laurenceson - Deputy Director of the Australia-China Relations Institute added that:
"
501,KO,"""The data show a rebalancing away from growth driven by investment and secondary sector production towards consumption and the services sector. It's time we accept that Chinese growth isn't solely at the mercy of industrial production and fixed asset investment""
"
502,KO,"So maybe, just maybe this is the 'new normal' for China. Maybe the world will see a China growing at a 6 handle and that's ok. Analysts are already looking out to the 4th qtr and suspect that by year end China will achieve annual growth of 6.8% -7% on continued fiscal and monetary support.
"
503,KO,"Global markets are not panicking with on these reports. In fact - there appears to be a little bit of 'risk on' as the investors/traders are relieved that the data was NOT as bad as analysts had prepared us for. Asian markets essentially ended flat. Japan - the worst performer - ended the day -0.88%, Hong Kong + 0.04%, China + 0.14% and ASX +0.03%.
"
504,KO,"European markets are also higher - discounting the China data and refocusing on earnings. FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.32%, DAX + 0.86%, EUROSTOXX + 0.53%, SPAIN flat, and ITALY + 0.61%.
"
505,KO,"France's Danone Group up 2.5% beat estimates, Germany's Deutsche Bank +3.1%, announces a big management shakeup and restructuring plan - heads to roll and that is helping to send other financials higher. German retailer Metro - announces a rise in sales and is talking all bullish about the coming Christmas season sending this stock up by 3.7%. Air France- KLM announces job CUTS in 2016 and investors love it - sending that stock higher.... and not to be left in the dark - Italian carmaker Ferrari is getting ready to price its IPO tomorrow and will start trading on the NYSE on Thursday.
"
506,KO,"This morning US futures are off 1 pt.....Now prior to the China report - US futures were pointing lower on the expectation that we were gonna get hit hard....and when that did not happen - Futures moved to the plus side and are now flat. I suspect that the market will test resistance at 2040 and then back off trying to find support in the 2025 range - if not, then definitely the 1980 range.
"
507,KO,"As much as there is plenty of US macro data this week - the focus will now return to US corp earnings. This week and next week will see hundreds of reports for investors to chew on. Earnings to include: HAS, MS, HAL, GPC, IBM, ZION, AXP, BA, KO, MCD, MSFT, and PG to name just a few.
"
508,KO,"NOTE: Fed's Lacker is due to speak today at 12 pm.
"
509,KO,"Up til now - earnings have been, well, not so good. Not horrible, but not great. 70% are beating the estimates while only 48% of those are beating on top line revenue growth. Despite the economic weakness and a bunch of downgrades - stocks have not done so badly.....with the DOW, S&P and Nasdaq all closing close to 2 month highs.... All of these indexes have now pierced their down trending 50 dma's and are now challenging their intermediate term resistance - or 100 dma's. Now here we may hit some trouble - but I think that is just a matter of time....unless earnings completely implode - then I suspect that we will test resistance one or two more times before 'breaking out' and challenging the longer term resistance levels defined by their 200 dma's. And as is usual - as we move thru the 4th qtr - FOMO (fear of missing out) will help to lift stocks going into year end.
"
510,KO,"Now on the other hand - small caps are lagging...... The most recent lows for small caps came early October and it was much lower than the August 24th sell-off lows. The most recent highs were just two weeks ago and those highs were lower than the highs set in mid-September. - suggesting that a bearish downtrend (lower lows and lower highs) remains intact from a small cap perspective. And why would this be so?
"
511,KO,"Well - it is earnings season, and it is more common for the large cap/mid cap companies to be able to borrow money to buy back shares which will serve to 'doll up"" their earnings per share. (Small cap companies are not nearly as active buying back stock to create the illusion of better earnings and so you have the disconnect.) Or it could be that small caps are more risky and at a time of global nervousness - investors may want the security of large cap, liquid, dividend paying names....It's just a thought.....
"
512,KO,"The fact that small caps continue to lag might suggest that the selling pressure is not over yet....but until we get thru earnings season the divergence will continue. Then it will be Thanksgiving, and the debt debacle in DC, and then the FED December decision.... so there is plenty ahead to keep investors on their toes the question is: Does the market have enough strength to support another ""Santa Clause"" rally into the end of the year?

523,KO,"Earnings season is winding down, but there are still top stocks due to report, including drug giant Actavis (ACT), one of several drug stocks reporting earnings that day, including Intrexon (XON), Impax Laboratories (IPXL) and Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Actavis is on the IBD 50 list of the very best stocks. Three other IBD 50 stocks — Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Monster…
"
524,KO,"Stocks bolted higher in quiet trade Friday after a mixed April jobs report pointed to no near-term rate hike from the Federal Reserve.
"
525,KO,"The Dow Jones industrial average jumped out to a 1.4% gain. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 swung up 1.2% each. Volume was mixed, a shade higher on the Nasdaq and down 8% on the NYSE, compared to action at the same time Thursday.
"
526,KO,"The stock market today got what it wanted — a generally weak April payrolls report. Payrolls expanded slightly more than expected for the month, to 223,000 vs. consensus estimates for 220,000. That was a positive. But private employers added fewer new jobs than expected, and the Labor Department sharply revised its March estimate downward to 85,000 new hires from an initial 123,000. Even more important, from a market standpoint, was the average hourly earnings number: up 0.1%. That compared to a 0.3% increase in March and economist projections for a 0.2% gain. The number has become a crucial metric for the Federal Reserve in deciding whether and when to raise target interest rates.
"
527,KO,"A week wage number suggests no rate increase. And no rate increase from the Fed means more cheap money for longer. So investors piled back into stocks Friday after two days of jittery nerves.
"
528,KO,"A full 30% of the Nasdaq 100 stocks posted gains of 2% or more. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Tractor Supply (TSCO) led, up 3% each. Also up 3% were Home Depot (HD) and Boeing (BA), topping the Dow.
"
529,KO,"WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) popped almost 8% at the open on generally positive first-quarter results. Earnings per share cleared consensus forecasts by two cents, while revenue growth of 10% stopped just shy of expectations. Management's Q2 and full-year sales and earnings guidance was at or above consensus. The heavy-volume, gap-up gain left shares at a new high.
"
530,KO,"Cruise fleet operators were hopping, with Royal Caribbean (RCL) torquing up 4% and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) climbing 3%. The Miami-based Royal announced late Thursday its capital spending outlook for the next five years, and that it had ordered a fourth ""quantum"" class ship for delivery in 2019. Norwegian shares jumped for a second day, now up 10% for the week after reporting a strong first quarter on Thursday.
"
531,KO,"Despite all the jubilation, there were losers.
"
532,KO,"Monster Beverage (MNST) dropped 10% after its transition in distribution rights linked to its deal with Coca-Cola (KO) took a bigger bite than expected from first-quarter earnings. The loss sent shares well below their 10-week moving average in powerful trade.
"
533,KO,"Medivation (MDVN) crumbled almost 5% after its Q1 earnings didn't rise far enough and a 48% surge in revenue missed consensus targets. Collaboration revenue from sales of its prostate cancer treatment Xtandi rose 81% in the U.S. and 177% overseas. The stock had been struggling below its 10-week moving average for two weeks, and is now 17% below its late-March high.Stocks bolted higher in quiet trade Friday after a mixed April jobs report pointed to no near-term rate hike from the Federal Reserve.The Dow Jones industrial average jumped out to a 1.4% gain.

So investors piled back into stocks Friday after two days of jittery nerves.A full 30% of the Nasdaq 100 stocks posted gains of 2% or more. NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) and Tractor Supply (TSCO) led, up 3% each. Also up 3% were Home Depot (HD) and Boeing (BA), topping the Dow.WhiteWave Foods (WWAV) popped almost 8% at the open on generally positive first-quarter results. Earnings per share cleared consensus forecasts by two cents, while revenue growth of 10% stopped just shy of expectations. Management's Q2 and full-year sales and earnings guidance was at or above consensus. The heavy-volume, gap-up gain left shares at a new high.Cruise fleet operators were hopping, with Royal Caribbean (RCL) torquing up 4% and Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) climbing 3%. The Miami-based Royal announced late Thursday its capital spending outlook for the next five years, and that it had ordered a fourth ""quantum"" class ship for delivery in 2019. Norwegian shares jumped for a second day, now up 10% for the week after reporting a strong first quarter on Thursday.Despite all the jubilation, there were losers.Monster Beverage (MNST) dropped 10% after its transition in distribution rights linked to its deal with Coca-Cola (KO) took a bigger bite than expected from first-quarter earnings. The loss sent shares well below their 10-week moving average in powerful trade.Medivation (MDVN) crumbled almost 5% after its Q1 earnings didn't rise far enough and a 48% surge in revenue missed consensus targets. Collaboration revenue from sales of its prostate cancer treatment Xtandi rose 81% in the U.S. and 177% overseas. The stock had been struggling below its 10-week moving average for two weeks, and is now 17% below its late-March high.

534,KO,"Refiners are finding a place among the market leadership in the current stock market. Oil refiners Tesoro (TSO) and Phillips 66 (PSX) nailed the No. 18 and No. 44 slots in Monday's IBD 50. Both stocks, though, are extended from buy points, which makes them too risky to buy. An extended stock can trigger the 8% sell rule with normal action.
"
535,KO,"However, the Stock Spotlight screen offers another refining stock — big cap Valero Energy (VLO) — and it is just under a 71.60 buy point.
"
536,KO,"Valero has built three first-stage bases since mid-2014. Breakouts from the first two led to gains of 8% and 10%, which is why the base count remains early stage.

538,KO,"Refiners are doing well because lower crude oil prices improve margins for the gasoline that refiners produce.
"
539,KO,"In the first nine months of 2015, for example, gasoline profit margins increased sharply. Valero estimates that the jump in gasoline margins per barrel boosted Valero's refining margin about $1.8 billion.
"
540,KO,"Margins for other Valero refined products — such as petroleum coke, sulfur and propane — also ballooned. Over nine months, the boost helped these other products' margins to the tune of $1.3 billion.
"
541,KO,"Revenue on a year-earlier basis, though, plunged 37%, 28% and 34% in the past three quarters, largely because of the decrease in refined product prices.
"
542,KO,"The cost of sales, however, decreased even more, which is how Valero reaped earnings increases of 21%, 118% and 39% in recent quarters.

557,KO,"Monster Beverage (MNST) flexed its muscles with double-digit sales gains across retail channels last month as more consumers opted to quench their thirst with its energy drinks.Monster's dollar sales were up a solid 11.2% from a year earlier during the four-week period ending Sept. 5, according to a report on beverage sales by Wells Fargo Securities analyst Bonnie Herzog, citing Nielsen's ""all channel"" data — including grocery, drug, mass, and convenience stores.Monster's unit sales were up 12.6% from a year earlier during the period and its average unit pricing was down 1.3%.Monster's lineup of energy drinks now include Coca-Cola (KO) energy brands as a part of a partnership deal with the soft drink giant that closed in June. Under the pact, Coke transferred ownership of its energy drink business to Monster and in return, Monster transferred its non-energy drink business to Coke. Coke has also become Monster's preferred global distribution partner.Coke now owns about 16.7% stake in Monster.The energy drink category overall remained strong during the month with dollar sales up 11.1% vs. a year earlier, Herzog noted in her report.Rockstar led the pack with a hefty 29.5% gain in dollar sales for the month.Energy drink hot shot Red Bull saw a 9.4% increase in dollar sales for the four-week period.But total carbonated soft drink dollar sales (excluding energy drinks) in all channels fizzled with a 1.0% decline for the month, noted Herzog.Coke's dollar sales overall were up 2.2% vs. a year earlier for the four-week period amid ""solid growth"" from juices, water, and teas, which ""partially offset declines"" in carbonated soft drinks, Herzog noted.Pepsico (PEP) saw dollar sales rise 0.9% during the month, according to the report. ""Soft"" results in carbonated soft drinks were ""offset"" by ""slight growth"" in snacks and by ""solid"" growth in water, sports drinks, and shelf-stable juices, Herzog noted.Pepsi recently expanded an alliance with home-based Sodastream (SODA). That comes as Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and Coca-Cola are developing Keurig Kold device for soft drinks. Coke also owns a significant stake in Keurig Green Mountain.Dollar sales for Dr Pepper Snapple Group (DPS) were up 2.2% during the four-week period, driven by ""modest growth"" in carbonated soft drinks and ""strong"" results in juices and teas, Herzog noted.Monster is part of IBD's Beverage-Non-Alcoholic industry group, where it ranks No. 2 with a Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) ranks No. 1 with a Composite Rating of 99.Monster's stock closed up 1.1% to 133.93 Wednesday in the stock market today.

650,KO,"With interest rates at record lows in the past several years, ETFs that invest in dividend-paying stocks have been a popular income alternative for some investors. But will they remain advantageous now that the Federal Reserve is seriously considering hiking rates?It depends on the specific investment objectives of each fund, according to Michael Rawson, research analyst at Morningstar Inc.""When you look at stocks with a high dividend payout, they typically underperform when the economy is doing well,"" he says. ""Those companies usually invest less in future growth (utilities, REITs, consumer staples), therefore they don't participate as much when the economy is growing very rapidly.""Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF (VYM) has over $10 billion in assets and a 12-month yield (net of fees) of 2.72%. However, it is tilted toward value stocks, notes Rawson, so it is not the most favorable to be in when the economy is growing.So what should an investor look at when considering a dividend ETF?Value Stock Tilt?Rawson says it's important to consider whether an ETF ""is tilting toward higher-yielding dividend-paying stocks, which tend to be value stocks, or does it tilt toward stocks which might grow their dividend in the future?""Companies that are able to increase their dividends consistently are usually companies with very strong brand names or very strong market positions,"" he notes. An example is Apple (AAPL), which yields 1.5%, though its dividend hasn't been steady.Dividend growth is one of the reasons he likes $21 billion Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG). It looks for companies that have raised their dividends for 10 straight years. It has a lower yield at 1.91%, but focuses on quality stocks, thus having a slightly bigger exposure to growth companies.In addition, it has a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.10%. It has returned an average annual 14.15% in the past three years vs. the S&P 500's 16.57% advance. Top holdings are Wal-Mart Stores (WMT), PepsiCo (PEP), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""If the Fed were likely to raise rates, I think Vanguard High Dividend Yield might get hurt more than Vanguard Dividend Appreciation,"" Rawson said.Another element to consider is the fund's tilt toward size: whether it's in large-cap or small-cap stocks.IShares Select Dividend (DVY) is one of the highest-yielding ETFs with a 3.03% yield. But the $15 billion fund is tilted toward midcap deep-value stocks, which can make it more volatile. In addition, its 0.39% expense ratio makes it one of the more expensive dividend ETFs, notes Morningstar analyst Abby Woodham in her report.When the Fed raises rates, investors might consider shifting out of stocks and more toward bonds, said Rawson. The reasons people usually hold bonds is for income, diversification and stability. The reason why dividend ETFs are not always a good substitute for bond ETFs is that they don't have the stability of bonds, he said.Investors also need to be mindful of expenses. If those are high, they tend to eat into the yield of the ETF.Cheapest ETF AvailableSchwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) is the cheapest among all dividend ETFs, with an expense ratio of just 0.07%. With nearly $3 billion in assets, it has a pretty attractive yield of 2.58%, while still maintaining the focus on quality stocks.It looks at companies that have paid dividends in the past 10 years and selects those that do well on fundamental metrics such cash flow/debt, return on equity, dividend yield and dividend growth. It's returned an average annual 15.93% in the past three years. Top holdings are Pfizer (PFE), Verizon Communications (VZ), Chevron (CVX) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).International funds tend to provide higher yields, but investors need to be able to stomach higher volatility due to currency fluctuations. The dollar's recent strength has hit the returns of nonhedged ETFs such as the WisdomTree Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund (DEM) and iShares International Select Dividend (IDV).

Including restructuring and impairment charges, the remeasurement of monetary assets at Venezuelan entities, a pension lump sum settlement charge, and mark-to-market net losses on commodity hedges, PepsiCo earned $1.3 billion, or 87 cents a share.Revenue was negatively impacted by foreign exchange translation, including ""significant currency volatility"" in Russia and Venezuela, and dipped 0.8% to $19.95 billion. But that still beat consensus estimates for $19.66 billion.Cheetos and SunChips maker Frito-Lay North America grew net revenue by 3%, while Quaker Foods North America revenue fell 2%.Asia, Middle East and Africa segment revenue rose 4%, but the stronger dollar bogged down the Latin America Foods segment, with net revenue dipping 0.5% despite an 11% rise in organic revenue driven by growth in Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.

663,KO,"Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett will give his insight into the company and markets at Saturday's eagerly awaited annual shareholders meeting in Omaha, Neb.Buffett made Berkshire Hathaway's largest-ever purchase in January and reshuffled the company's portfolio.On Jan. 29, Berkshire announced it had completed the $37.2 billion (including debt) purchase of Precision Castparts, its biggest buyout ever.Berkshire's net worth rose by $15.4 billion in 2015 as the company bought more shares of favorites IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire expects about 40,000 shareholders from around the world to attend the event. But you don't have to visit Omaha in person: For the first time ever, the so-called ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" will be streamed live, on Yahoo Finance. Buffett will offer his comments in what a press statement described as a ""no holds barred"" Q&A with him and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger.Buffett, 85, has said in the past that he and the board have agreed on a successor, but he hasn't disclosed who that is. Munger is 92.S&P Capital IQ analyst Cathy Seifert said in a recent report that Berkshire's growth strategy is continuing to pay off.""Our buy opinion reflects our view that Berkshire's ability to grow its revenue base (both organically and through acquisitions) and maintain margins, despite a mixed economic outlook, will enable the shares to retain their premium valuation"" vs. its peers and the broader market. S&P Capital IQ has a 152 price target on Berkshire's Class B stock.For the full year 2015, net earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion, and revenue grew 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014. Net earnings for the Dec. 31-ended quarter climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share minus one-time items for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in the fourth quarter, well above analyst estimates of $1.75.The consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters is for EPS to rise 3% to $1.78 for the current quarter, up from $1.72 in Q1 2015. Berkshire's BNSF Railroad continues to be a drag on earnings amid an oversupplied energy market and plunging coal shipments. BNSF's total railcar units for the week ended April 16 fell by 21% vs. the same quarter a year earlier to about 81,000 units.Berkshire Class B stock hasn't formed a viable base recently. It dropped to an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and has bounced nicely since then. It's risen about 18%, climbing above its 10-week average and 200-day line along the way. Berkshire's B shares closed up less than 0.1% at 146.18 in the stock market today.Berkshire Hathaway boasts a solid 81 IBD Composite Rating, meaning it's outperformed 81% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth in recent quarters.Image provided by Shutterstock.

715,KO,"There's something for everyone in the vast universe of sector funds, from consumer staples to health care to technology.When a sector is in favor, those funds can rack up big returns. But they can also be prone to bigger declines, since they're more concentrated in specific areas than a diversified fund.IBD ran a screen of actively managed funds with at least $100 million in assets that have beaten their benchmarks in each of the past one, three, five and 10 years. Two sectors were the clear winner: The five best sector funds ranked by 10-year performance all focus on biotech or health sciences. (See our full list of best sector mutual funds.)To highlight the best mutual funds in the top-performing sectors, the ""best of the best"" list of IBD Best Mutual Funds 2016 Award winners includes the top fund in each of six sectors.Click Here To View A Table Of Top Performing Mutual Funds By CategoryFidelity Select Biotechnology Portfolio (FBIOX) came out on top with a 10-year average annual return of 16.9%, well ahead of the S&P 500's 7.31%. The fund held $9.7 billion in net assets as of Feb. 29. Its expense ratio is 0.74%. Rajiv Kaul has managed the fund since October 2005.Like most sectors, biotech has seen its fair share of volatility. But that's not necessarily a negative.""In the next five to 10 years, there's going to be a renaissance for the industry in terms of the golden age of innovation,"" Kaul told IBD. ""It's not going to be in a straight line. Biotech is volatile for investors. That's the amazing opportunity that happens.""As of Jan. 31, biotech stocks made up 86% of the portfolio and pharmaceuticals 13%. Fidelity Select Biotech held 277 stocks in all. Top holdings at the end of Q4 included Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX), Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Celgene (CELG).All five stocks belong to IBD's biotech industry group, which surged more than 800% from a November 2008 low to its July 2015 peak. Turnover in the fund tends to run fairly low, at about 29%.There are high barriers to entry in the biotech field, including expertise, capital and regulatory hurdles, Kaul points out. ""But when you do get a major breakthrough in a medication, you really improve people's lives and help save costs for the health care system.""How does Kaul pick stocks for the fund?""You have to understand the management and what is the track record of success,"" he said. ""We have that kind of historical understanding and depth of understanding of the industry and the individual players. Equally important is the ability of these companies to access capital at a low cost. I want my companies to be self-reliant.""The five top biotech funds all owned big-cap biotech and Soliris maker Alexion in their recently reported quarters. Four of the five funds also held biotechs Celgene and Gilead, which focus on cancer and hepatitis C, respectively.

""Over the past 10 years, strength has been broad-based, with biotech likely having the highest level of performance."" The fund's expense ratio is 0.77%.Prudential Jennison Health Sciences (PHLAX), with a 15.8% return over the past 10 years, has been closed to new investors since the end of June 2012.

""Although the realization of these companies’ values may encounter intermittent setbacks, we believe the market will recognize and reward them over the longer term.""Franklin Biotechnology Discovery (FBDIX), with $1.1 billion in total net assets as of Feb. 29, has a 10-year return of 15%. Biotech stocks made up 84% of the portfolio, followed by 13% in pharmaceuticals and nearly 3% in life sciences tools and services.""We focus on biotechnology and generally have limited exposure to other areas in health care,"" Evan McCulloch, senior vice president and lead portfolio manager of the fund, said. ""We avoid more traditional large-cap pharmaceuticals companies, which have less favorable growth prospects and do not show the same levels of innovation we see in biotechnology.""Celgene, Gilead Sciences, Biogen (BIIB), Amgen (AMGN) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were among top positions in the 119-stock fund. The fund, which closed to new investors in July 2014, has an expense ratio of 1%.""Overall, we believe there are strong fundamentals underlying the biotechnology sector's recent growth which have also helped our fund,"" McCulloch said. ""Innovation remains very strong, with promising new treatments in areas like immuno-oncology, gene therapy, Alzheimer's disease, GI (gastrointestinal) disorders, central nervous system diseases and others.""Rydex Biotechnology (RYOAX) rounds out the top-five sector funds with a 10-year return of 14.7%.

716,KO,"Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL) has snared iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as a customer for its Google Cloud Platform, a deal that could help Google's service catch up with industry leader Amazon.com (AMZN), says an industry note from Pacific Crest Securities on Thursday.Amazon unit Amazon Web Services (AWS) is now the biggest provider of infrastructure as a service (IaaS), where customers rent computer servers and data storage systems via the Internet. Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet's Google rank next.Apple signed a contract worth between $400 million and $600 million to use Google's Cloud Platform, according to CRN. Apple now uses cloud services from Amazon and Microsoft, but intends to end its reliance on all its rivals in the next few years, as it builds its own data centers, according to Re/Code.While Apple has reportedly used AWS historically for iCloud, ""the more surprising shift is from Apple to Google, which are odd bedfellows given the two companies' mudslinging and competition in other areas,"" wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Evan Wilson. ""Did Google throw in free cloud as a way to renegotiate the search contract? Definitely adds to the perception of Google's momentum,"" Wilson added.The deal has not been confirmed by Google or Apple, but Apple did disclose its reliance on AWS and on Microsoft's Azure in a 2014 white paper.The alleged Apple-Google accord would help ""Google Cloud Platform catch up to Amazon and Microsoft -- at least in terms of perception -- as a real third player in the space instead of a distant third. Google has done similar deals with Snapchat, PricewaterhouseCoopers, General Mills (GIS) Coca-Cola (KO), HTC and Best Buy (BBY),"" said Wilson.In total, the cloud opportunity is big enough for all three Internet powerhouses, said Wilson, who estimated ""a potential $25 billion windfall opportunity in cloud services for Amazon, Microsoft and Google, collectively.""While AWS has been the biggest IaaS price-cutter of the last decade, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has been aggressive since moving into the market. Google slashed prices in March 2014, October 2014 and May-June 2015, Goldman analyst Heather Bellini said in an industry report last month.Goldman Sachs says that the top three service providers are gaining share as Verizon Communications (VZ),  Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and others exit the public IaaS market and focus on private clouds.Goldman Sachs estimates that AWS' revenue will hit $12.5 billion in 2016, up from $7.88 billion last year.Apple stock was down a fraction in midday trading in the stock market today, near 106.

The Orlando-based owner of the Olive Garden, Red Lobster and other chains reported healthy fiscal fourth-quarter results and announced plans to slice off a portion of its real estate assets into a separate real estate investment trust. The stock popped to a new high, paring some gains but holding just above a cup-base buy point of 70.48.Citrix Systems (CTXS) pecked out a 2% gain, the best increase among Nasdaq 100 stocks. The Fort Lauderdale-headquartered software developer is still in buying range, 4% above a 69.33 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Among leaders, most of the IBD 50 list posted modest gains and losses — with a couple of dramatic exceptions.Ambarella (AMBA) led the list with a 9% rebound. The stock tumbled 21% Monday, following a short-seller's report on Friday that questioned the stock's valuation. The stock remains extended after a mid-May rebound from 10-week support and is well above its 10-week moving average.At the bottom of the group, burger joint Sonic (SONC) dived 11% in massive trade. Fiscal third quarter sales and profits met consensus expectations, but full-year earnings guidance didn't. The sell-off stopped at a test of the stock's 10-week moving average, seriously damaging efforts to shape a three-month cup base.

734,KO,"Monster Beverage (MNST) had an energy crash late Thursday, badly missing Q4 forecasts as it continues to transition distribution of its energy drinks to strategic partner Coca-Cola (KO).Monster's earnings per share fell 6.9% to 67 cents. Analysts expected a 14% increase to 82 cents. It was the third time in the past five quarters that Monster has reported lower-than-expected earnings.Net sales grew 6.6% to $645.4 million, well below analyst consensus of $698.4 million.Shares sank 8% in after-hours trading in the stock market today despite Monster also announcing a $1.75 billion addition to its share buyback plan, bringing the current total to $2 billion. Coca-Cola was flat in late trading.Sales were hurt as customers rushed to buy ahead of a price hike in Q3, reducing Q4 sales by about $11 million. Sales were also affected by destocking in certain Europe-Middle East-Africa markets.“Distributor transitions and uncertainties in portions of our international non-Coca-Cola distribution network limited further revenue growth during the quarter,"" Monster CEO Rodney Sacks said in a statement, adding that currency rates also jarred results.Last year, Coca-Cola acquired 17% of Monster in a strategic partnership in which Coke transferred its global energy drink business to Monster and took over the energy drink maker's nonenergy brands, including Hansen's Natural Sodas.The deal gave Monster access to Coke's global distribution network, which should give it a lift as it expands internationally.Earlier in the week, Monster announced that it's agreed to buy longtime flavor supplier American Fruits & Flavors for $690 million. After the deal closes, which is expected this quarter, Monster plans to ""further enhance (American Fruits) flavor development and global flavor footprint capabilities.""Monster said it expects the acquisition to add to earnings in 2016.Among other large beverage makers, Coke's archrival PepsiCo (PEP) rose 1% to 100.67.

747,KO,"Warren Buffett said Saturday that the net worth of Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) rose $15.4 billion in 2015, boosting the per-share book value of both its Class A and Class B stock by 6.4%.Buffett was upbeat in his annual letter to shareholders, saying it's been a terrible mistake to bet against America for 240 years, and ""now is no time to start.""""America's golden goose of commerce and innovation will continue to lay more and larger eggs,"" Buffett said in the letter.In the 31-page missive, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway said net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders in the fourth quarter, which ended Dec. 31, climbed 31.8% to $5.478 billion. Earnings per share for Class B shares rose to $2.22 in Q4, crushing consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $1.75.For the full year, earnings grew 21.2% to $24.08 billion. Total revenue for the year rose 8% to $210.8 billion, up from $194.7 billion in 2014.Berkshire owns Geico Insurance, BNSF railroad, Dairy Queen, and as of January, Precision Castparts. Berkshire also holds significant holdings in companies such as Kraft Heinz (KHC), IBM (IBM) and  Wells Fargo (WFC).It should be no surprise that the company's Railroads, Utilities and Energy business fared the worst amid declining rail shipments and plunging gas prices.  Still, revenue for that business was down just 1.7% in Q4 at $40.004 billion. Earnings fell 2.9% to $1.507 billion.Total revenue for the company's flagship insurance businesses continued to show big gains, rising 10.9% in the quarter to $162.89 billion. But earnings fell to $4.9 billion in 2015 vs. $5.2 billion in 2014.  Earnings for the underwriting business soared 60% to $306 million, while earnings for the Insurance-investment income unit were up 17.4% at $1.033 billion.Earnings for other businesses and miscellaneous items climbed 36.3% to $1.827 billion.Buffett commented on the $37.2 billion purchase in January of aerospace components maker Precision Castparts, which he described as a newcomer to the ""Powerhouse Six"" businesses in the company's Railroads/Utility/Energy group. ""PCC fits perfectly into the Berkshire model and will substantially increase our normalized per-share earnings power.""He also commented on a proxy proposal regarding climate change that's on the agenda for the company's annual meeting, which is slated to be streamed live for the first time ever on the morning of April 30. Buffett said concerns about how climate change might affect the company's insurance payouts are unwarranted because Berkshire's insurance policies are typically repriced every year, factoring in increased risk such as climate change.Commenting on stock investments, Buffett said the company increased its interest in each of its top four holdings last year: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM and Wells Fargo.  Coca-Cola and Wells Fargo shares were essentially flat in 2015, while IBM and American Express were big losers.Berkshire most recently has been buying big blocks of oil refiner Philips 66 (PSX) and as of Dec. 31 owned 55.38 million shares, giving it a 10.5% stake in the company, which has continued rising this year.Buffett also noted that in 2015 Berkshire invested $16 billion in property, plant and equipment, 86% of it deployed in the U.S.Berkshire Hathaway shares declined for most of 2015 and into early 2016, and hasn't been above its 200-day line since a brief spell last July. But the stock is up 7% from an intraday low of 123.55 on Feb. 3 and closed at 131.92 in Friday trading on the stock market today, down 0.3% for the day.

750,KO,"The stock market is always a case of, ""OK, that was nice, but what have you done for me lately?""IBD's soft drink group has outperformed both major indexes since the bull market began in March 2009. Going into Wednesday's market, soft drinks were up 406% vs. 228% for the Nasdaq and 166% for the S&P 500.What, though, has the Beverages-Non-Alcoholic group done for investors lately?Year to date, the soft drink group has retreated 6% -- less than the Nasdaq's 11% drop but about in line with the S&P 500. However, beginning with Feb. 11's closing lows, soft drinks are back to outperforming (up about 7% vs 4% to 5% for the major indexes).Let's look at what's happening among the highly rated soft drink stocks.Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) cleared an 81.55 buy point in strong volume in August, but the stock immediately rolled over and triggered the 8% sell rule. The decline turned into a new pattern.The new pattern featured an entry at 83.67. The stock broke above that in low volume Oct. 9.However, let's back up a little because this gets tricky.  On Oct. 5, the stock retook the previous buy point at 81.55 in volume 37% above average. The previous buy point was probably a more natural area of resistance because that's where the failure occurred.Individual investors who re-entered on the retake are sitting on a 12% gain -- not bad in this market.Dr Pepper currently has shaped a flat base-like structure on top of the prior base; the potential new buy point is 95.36.The stock has a Composite Rating of 96, putting it in the top 4% among all the stocks in IBD's database. The Composite Rating combines all five IBD ratings into a single number.Coca-Cola (KO) is known as one of Warren Buffett's long-term holdings. Coke is the third-largest holding in the Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA) portfolio, making up 13% of assets.The stock has a Composite Rating of 85, which is decent for a conservative blue chip.Coke is working on a flat base with a potential buy point at 44.01.Two other stocks in the group need to do some work on the right side.Monster Beverage (MNST) undercut its August low when the stock bottomed Feb. 11.The current consolidation is 30% deep, which is about twice as deep as the market's recent pullback. For growth stocks, a sell-off fiercer than the major indexes isn't unusual.Monster has a Composite Rating of 92 but needs to retake its 200-day and 50-day lines.Coca-Cola Bottling (COKE) has retaken its 200-day line but remains just under its 50-day line.If a new base develops now, the pattern would be late stage.As a stock climbs, it pause to consolidate or form a new base. Breakouts from the first two stages are more likely to work than those from later stage patterns. The stock's Composite Rating is a best possible 99.

753,KO,"Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) continued to build its stock portfolio last year while shedding bond holdings.On Saturday, Berkshire released its list of stock holdings, along with full-year 2015 and fourth-quarter financial results.Buffett's top 15 stock holdings include what he calls the company's ""Big Four"" investments: American Express (AXP), Coca Cola (KO), IBM (IBM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).Berkshire purchased additional shares of IBM during the year, boosting its total ownership to 81.03 million shares, or an 8.4% ownership stake at the end of the year vs. 7.8% at the end of 2014. Wells Fargo grew to 500 million shares, or a 9.8% stake, up from 9.4%.At Coke and American Express, share buybacks raised Berkshire's percentage ownership. Its 400 million shares of Coke are a 9.3% stake, up from 9.2%. And it owns 151.6 million shares of American Express, or 15.6%, up from 14.8%.Buffett said a major Berkshire equity position that's not on the list of 15 is Bank of America (BAC).""We can buy 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time prior to September 2021 for $5 billion. At year-end, these shares were worth $11.8 billion,"" he said, adding that it's likely Berkshire will buy them just before the options expire.Buffett added: ""It is important for you to realize that Bank of America is, in effect, our fourth-largest equity investment.""Berkshire's class B shares closed up 1.7% in the stock market today, and they are up nearly 10% from a Feb. 3 intraday low. Although its position improved, its stock still traded below both its 50-day and 200-day averages.American Express rose 0.4%, Coke ended flat, IBM fell 0.8%, but Wells Fargo slid 2.4%.Among other Berkshire top stock holdings, it has 46.6 million shares of IBD Leaderboard stock AT&T (T) (0.8% ownership), 24.7 million shares of credit rating and research agency Moody's (MCO) (12.6%), 18.5 million shares of dialysis services company DaVita Healthcare Partners (DVA) (8.8%), and 22.16 million shares of heavy equipment maker Deere (DE) (7%).Berkshire has also been buying big blocks of oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX) since last summer, fueling speculation that it may be Buffett's next acquisition target. As of Dec. 31, Berkshire owned 55.38 million shares or 10.5% of the company, and its stake has since risen to around 15%. Phillips was up 1.5% at 80.27 Monday.Meanwhile, for a sixth year in a row, Buffett reduced his bond holdings amid continued low yields. Berkshire owned about $25 billion in aggregate, on an amortized cost basis as of Dec. 31, down from nearly $35 billion at the end of 2009, Bloomberg said. Buffett said bonds are such a poor investment tool that they ""should come with a warning label.""At the end of 2015, his biggest bond holdings were in foreign bonds, followed by corporate bonds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities.

The alliance is expected to announce a 2017 launch for the project.A number of different areas could be put under the microscope, including health insurance providers, treatment outcomes and pharmacy-benefit managers.Marc Reed, Verizon Communication's (VZ) chief administrative officer, told the Journal that the goal is to make health care ""sustainable"" so that employers can continue providing it to their workers.He said the group could wind up becoming a cooperative that buys health-care services on behalf of their employees.

758,KO,"Dozens of ""sustainable"" mutual funds and ETFs have hit the market in recent years to satisfy rising demand for socially conscious investing.Financial advisors have noticed.As more consumers seek to invest their assets in funds that track environmental, social and governance (ESG) indexes, some financial advisors are marketing their socially responsible bona fides. The sustainable-investing niche capitalizes  on the public’s growing awareness of companies’ policies and strategies -- and to what extent these corporate activities align with an investor’s values.""I've been in the socially responsible investment space since 2002, and people have more knowledge and awareness today than ever before,"" said Sanjay Das, a financial planner in Seattle. ""Now they come in with a lot more questions like 'What am I supporting with my money?' and 'Does this company give political contributions to certain groups?' ""When he first started tapping this niche, Das spent more time teaching investors about it. He led adult education classes at a local college on socially responsible investing (SRI) and reached out to nonprofit organizations ""that tend to have more progressive employees who are concerned with climate change, human rights"" and other issues, he says.Today, his clients don't just possess a better understanding of SRI concerns. They also want their investments to reflect their values, so they ""do their research beforehand on what they want and don't want to support,"" Das adds.In terms of investment products, he sifts through more choices than ever. While specialty firms such as Pax World Funds and Calvert Investments used to dominate the niche, many mainstream financial services companies now operate sustainable-investing units.""There's more competition in the financial community,"" Das said. ""About 40 or 50 mutual fund companies have SRI products. That's way up from just two or three years ago.""For financial advisors, part of the challenge of harnessing the sustainable-investing niche is staying on top of ever-changing societal trends. The issues that investors care about can ebb and flow based on a range of factors.When George Gay started to focus on SRI in the late 1980s, global headlines included the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 and anti-apartheid protests in South Africa. At the time, Gay was a certified financial planner and chief operating officer of First Affirmative Financial Network in Colorado Springs, Colo.""Today, new areas of concern include sustainable (retail) food chains and factory farming,"" said Gay, now First Affirmative's chief executive officer. ""These things are getting more complicated.""Gay's firm, which works with about 100 financial advisors across the U.S., hosts an annual SRI conference for financial planners to discuss the latest developments and investment strategies within their niche. For example, advisors often compare notes on how to serve millennials who embrace ""impact investing."" Gay finds that ""younger clients are more interested"" in SRI and advisors often want to attract more entrepreneurs and professionals in their 20s and 30s.Advisors engage in deep discussions with their clients about their values -- and the types of investments that they like and dislike. To gain a better sense of an investor's preferences, financial advisors often ask clients to fill out a questionnaire.Investors will check boxes of stock screens they'd like to set up. Examples include seeking companies with high marks for gender diversity or avoiding companies that make or sell military weapons.""We use their answers to craft portfolios that are aligned with their values,"" said Allan Moskowitz, a certified financial planner in El Cerrito, Calif. ""I had a client who was a doctor. He was looking to avoid funds with Coke (KO) or Pepsi (PEP), because he felt they caused obesity.""Moskowitz, who has focused on SRI for 25 years, says that the niche has soared in popularity. In addition to joining First Affirmative's network, he says that clients find him through his website and a listing on National Green Pages, an online directory. He has also adopted a lifestyle that embodies his values.""I bought an office building 1-1/2 years ago and lowered my carbon footprint by about 80%,"" he said. ""I have solar panels on the roof. I drive a Nissan Leaf.""He also seeks to hold companies accountable for their stated commitment to ESG standards. A shareholder activist, he has joined coalitions to fight ""greenwashing"" (when organizations falsely claim they're environmentally friendly) and highlight other social-justice issues.All the effort pays off. Moskowitz says his clients appreciate working with an advisor who walks the talk.""Clients in this niche are stickier,"" he said. ""They're loyal. My retention rate is high.""

But he took a slightly different tack from others, offering two lists: a Recession Playbook and a Recovery Playbook.Among other top picks on his Recession Playbook are Campbell Soup (CPB), Coca-Cola (KO), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Hormel Foods (HRL).Philip Morris stock closed up 0.3% Tuesday, and Reynolds American, the maker of Camel cigarettes, added 1.3%. Merck gained 0.7%, and Pfizer rose 1.9%. Campbell Soup climbed 1.7%, while Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble ended flat.Glionna said of his Recovery Playbook: ""The best performing sectors in previous periods of economic recovery -- using the exit of a recession as indicative of a recovery -- have been energy, materials, industrials and consumer discretionary.""Among stocks on that list: Ford Motor (F), General Electric, General Motors (GM), Harley-Davidson (HOG) and Viacom (VIA).Ford ended down 2%, and GM lost 2.8% Tuesday. GE ticked up 0.4%. Harley-Davidson fell 1.5%, and Viacom plunged more than 21% on worse-than-expected results for the December-ended quarter.Meanwhile, Cowen analysts put out their own list of recession stocks Tuesday, saying, ""We believe stocks that appeal to the low-end consumer and have minimal global exposure appear well-suited to weather an economic downturn.""Among their top picks: off-price clothing retailer Ross Stores (ROST) and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT).Ross Stores climbed 2.25%, and Wal-Mart fell 1.6%.

It saw a nice pop in sales for all in-store carbonated soft drink categories and the beer category for the four weeks that ended Dec. 20, according to a report by analyst Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo Securities citing Nielsen data.Herzog credits lower gas prices for the ""strong"" in-store sales at U.S. convenience stores across all categories during the four weeks.Strong average price growth drove total carbonated beverage dollar sales in the U.S. convenience-store channel, excluding the energy drink category, up a solid 3.6% vs. a year earlier for the four weeks ending Dec. 20, Herzog noted.Continued strong growth for Monster and Red Bull fueled the energy drink category to dollar sales growth of 10.9% at convenience stores for the four-week period, Herzog said.IBD 50 stock Monster is in IBD's Beverages-Non-Alcoholic industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group: 95 out of a possible 99. It's primed for growth this year as it benefits from a partnership with Coca-Cola (KO) that should boost its business overseas as well as in the U.S.Monster saw a hefty 12.4% rise in dollar sales at convenience stores for the four-week period.""We attribute MNST's strong results to overall industry tailwinds given lower retail gas prices and more specifically the incremental penetration of MNST's new innovation(s),"" Herzog wrote. ""We remain encouraged by the KO-MNST partnership as well as positive results from innovation, and we believe growth should continue to accelerate heading into FY2015 and beyond, particularly if retail gas prices continue to support strong in-store sales.""Unit growth of 2% and pricing growth of 2.8% drove beer dollar sales in the U.S. convenience-store channel up a solid 4.8% for the four week period, Herzog wrote.Alcoholic beverage distributor Constellation continued its strong sales growth trends of a 21.9% increase from a year earlier for the four-week period, while Boston Beer saw dollar sales rise 19.8%.Constellation and Boston Beer are a part of IBD's Beverages-Alcoholic industry group. Boston Beer has the highest IBD Composite Rating in the group at 97. Constellation ranks third with a Composite Rating of 93.Beverage industry giant Coca-Cola has also been seeing strong sales gains. A strong price increase drove its carbonated soft drink dollar sales up 4.8% for the four-week period.""We remain encouraged KO's solid dollar sales growth and share gains, which we attribute to retail gas price tailwinds (and) its best-in-class price pack architecture,"" wrote Herzog.

763,KO,"2014 saw the fewest planned job cuts since 1997, according to placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Layoffs announced in December were down 9.2% from November, the second straight month of declines, and took 2014 totals 5.0% below those notched in 2013.Fewer layoffs are good news for job seekers, Challenger said, because they ""will not only find more employment opportunities in 2015 but will enjoy increased job security once they are in those new positions.""Challenger's figures point to not only a firming job market but also one with more churn. The two industries with the greatest number of layoffs were computer and retail. Both, Challenger acknowledged, are benefiting from the economic expansion.The computer industry saw a 69% jump in layoffs last year to 59,528. But much of that downsizing came thanks to efforts by Microsoft (MSFT) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) to compete better with more streamlined operations.Lower oil prices might help the overall economy but could lead to layoffs this year in the energy and energy-related fields. U.S. Steel (X) said this month that it would shut a plant that makes specialized pipes for the energy industry, cutting 768 jobs.Coca-Cola (KO) said Thursday it will cut 1,600-1,800 jobs as part of a previously announced $3 billion cost-cutting plan amid stalling soda sales. Caterpillar (CAT) said Wednesday it will 200 jobs, mostly related to mining equipment, which has struggled as low commodity prices and demand hit mining.Those three companies' job cut announcements will show up in Challenger's January report.The Labor Department releases its December employment report on Friday morning.

777,KO,"With Frank Caruso at the helm since mid-February 2012 -- almost exactly four years -- the $2.7 billion AB Large Cap Growth Fund (APGAX) has topped 98% of its peers tracked by Morningstar Inc. through Jan. 31.The fund notched a 14.55% average annual gain in that time vs. 10.71% for its direct rivals and 12.08% for the S&P 500. It garners an A+ 36-month Performance Rating from IBD, meaning it's performance is among the top 5% of all mutual funds in that time.Lately, the mutual fund has shown it can outperform in ugly markets as well as in beautiful ones. By losing less than its peers and the broad market over the turbulent past three months, the fund ranked in the top 8% of its category. It fell 6.08% last month, a little better than the average U.S. diversified stocks fund's 6.25% decline.Caruso, who is 59 years old, is a member of the AB fund complex, which last year changed its name from AllianceBernstein. Caruso, the lead manager on this fund, discussed with IBD at his Manhattan office how his team invests.IBD: How have you achieved outperformance in bad markets as well as good?Caruso: It's our focus on great businesses, our obsession with the fundamental integrity of holdings and the way we manage risk. Looking at data from March 31, 2012, through Dec. 31, in the 28 up months in that time we were in the 23rd percentile of our peers. In the down months, we were in the 2nd percentile, beating 98% of our peers. The risk-adjusted performance of the portfolio is extremely good.IBD: Business cycles are not your focus, right?Caruso: I don't want people to associate with us any overarching concern about business cycles. We look for consistent performance. That's particularly important in growth stock investing. Companies we want need to have the kind of business that has a long runway to invest those high returns and earn returns in excess of their cost of capital. So it's a combination of persistence and duration that creates and unleashes the power of compounding. Rather than saying we look for high-growing companies, we look for returns and look for that in these really good businesses.IBD: You are looking for companies that can meet your requirements for several years, right?Caruso: Our window is three to five years. For companies in the Russell 1000, you've got a high-teens number of earnings forecasts for this year and next, then it falls off a cliff. As you get fewer estimates three, four, five years out, the variability about forecasts increases a lot. Longer time horizons lead to inefficiency in growth stock investing.IBD: In other words, by having a longer time horizon than most other investors, it's easier for you to find companies that are priced inefficiently?Caruso: It is. Absolutely.IBD: What's a recent example, please?Caruso: Most investors look at Nike (NKE) and see one of the most efficiently priced stocks in the market. But that changes longer-term. What's provocative is that they've been experimenting with new manufacturing technology, a weaving technology. Most people would say Nike's biggest cost is labor. But it's not. It's shipping, tariffs and duties. You can eliminate a lot of those if you localize manufacturing. Weaving technology might let them do that. Instead of (needing a lot of low-paid) workers cutting, banging, stitching, gluing, coloring and packing products, what if they have . . . smaller factories all over the world, decreasing those shipping, tariff and duties costs?So when we model Nike, we can push the profitability up by hundreds of basis points. That gives us confidence in the long term. It informs us about how we might want to behave in the short term if there's volatility.IBD: For a manager who pays little attention to the short term, you're doing well in the short term. Luck or design?Caruso: The fact that stocks go up and down doesn't impact the way we manage the portfolio. Having said that, a year ago we had had good, consistent performance for the last four years. We started to see a lot of risk exposure to momentum (stocks), and we spent the entire year managing that down to more conservative levels. And we have seen reversion to the mean.IBD: In the recent months of volatility, what have you trimmed and what have you added to?Caruso: Part of why we've done well in 2016 is that the market continues to be concerned about earnings, and our portfolio is delivering. But we've reduced our size in excess winners last year and redeployed into more, not defensive, but more edgy, controversial companies that had not been leadership stocks. Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) is one of those names.IBD: Which of the FANGs do you own, and which have you trimmed?Caruso: We don't own Amazon.com (AMZN) or Netflix (NFLX). We have Facebook (FB) and Google (Alphabet (GOOGL)), and haven't trimmed them.We've been more inclined to trim some discretionary stocks. We took profits and reduced positions in Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike because we thought in the moment it was pretty fully valued. But we would welcome an opportunity to build that back through volatility.Disney (DIS) was trimmed. Monster (MNST) and Staples (SPLS) -- which has been a phenomenal performer -- were trimmed.What we've added to: Last summer, we were basically market weight in health care, a little overweight. Those were put through the grinder in late summer, early fall. Into and emerging from that correction, we started increasing our exposure there. We added to Intuitive Surgical last summer. We rebalanced into Biogen (BIIB). We introduced (a position in) Edwards Lifesciences (EW).We did a number of things in tech. We introduced Adobe (ADBE) and Cognizant (CTSH), and we did some adds to longer-term positions, such as ServiceNow (NOW).IBD: Why do you like Intuitive Surgical?Caruso: The company has unbelievable returns. It has $3 billion in enterprise cash and no debt. We’re seeing the utilization of robotics in an ever-increasing number of procedures.For this company to win long-term, we must see more surgeon adoption of robotics, and we’re seeing that. The stock suffered a fair amount of underperformance the past couple of years. But we stuck to our knitting. We added to our stake opportunistically, and we’re starting to see a contribution to fund performance from this stock.IBD: You weren’t in on Facebook’s IPO, but you bought when many others were fleeing. What’s your thesis?Caruso: We were controversial buyers when the rest of the Street was puking it out. We’re proud of that.If you go back to the IPO in the summer of 2012, every banker that bought them had a five-year forecast model -- 2016 was the terminal year. Now their current forecasts are 40% to 60% higher than they were back then. My point is that fundamentals overachievement is really hard to model. But Facebook has potential to drive tremendous excess performance.IBD: Go back to Monster Beverage: Why did you trim it?Caruso: They were on the verge of deploying a lot of capital to be able to sell overseas. Then Coke (KO) took a strategic position in the company. As shareholders, we appreciated before many others that Monster would not have to spend $1 billion to become a global company. They would be able to leverage Coke’s best-on-the-planet global distribution platform. They would get to profits we thought they'd see in 2017-18 in the year 2016.The growth opportunity is increasing exponentially. So the sizing decision was really another one of those Starbucks-type decisions, where these have been unbelievably successful stocks. But the valuations got a little uncomfortable in the short term, so we reduced our exposure. There’s no diminution of our long-term conviction.IBD: You boosted your current stake in Cognizant in between September and November. What’s the attraction?Caruso: They bring a level of expertise in software-as-a-service and mobility solutions to companies that are trying to figure out how to get their IT architecture to the next level.Positioning in key technologies interests us. Cognizant was a stock we talked about at the end of 2013. We stepped away and more recently started to build it back.IBD: Adobe posted earnings-per-share gains for five quarters after suffering EPS declines in seven of the eight prior stanzas. What’s the crux of why things are working?Caruso: They used to put a product in a shrink-wrapped box and sell it. They’ve switched to a subscription model. That allows them to be consistent in how upgrades are managed and deployed. Customers don’t have to wait for upgrades. That model is destined to compress the ups and downs of their business. The lower volatility that results is good from a valuation point of view. And this model lets them manage the risk of piracy in a more head-on fashion. So the long-term value of their subscription model is more attractive than their old model.IBD: Are you among the investors who started to like Alphabet more when the company brought in Ruth Porat as CFO?Caruso: Yes, we became excited when they brought in Porat from Morgan Stanley (MS).Google had a great business, focused on search. But they used cash flow to fund a variety of initiatives that in many cases didn’t appear to make a lot of sense.With the appearance of a strong CFO, we hoped there was finally an adult in the room who would bring financial discipline to the way they thought about allocating capital. So far, she’s done that.Now they’ve got two companies, basically. One is focused on advertising, whether it’s YouTube, which is growing into an economically handsome property, or search.Then you’ve got essentially all of these call options about driverless cars, robotics. They’ve been deploying capital to build out telecom networks in cities. So it’s a portfolio of early-stage companies, some acquired, some nurtured, some ready for prime time, some needing more incubation.The split in the company lets investors have more transparency to properly value the businesses.

Monster's stock gapped down May 8 after reporting disappointing Q1 results a day earlier, beginning a stint below its 50-day moving average that persisted through Tuesday.Nicholson said that decline was due to research indicating that Monster's market share had ""come under a bit of pressure,"" Benzinga reported.Looking ahead, Citi sees Monster's stock price rising due to a variety of factors.Among them: the possibility that Coca-Cola (KO) will raise its stake in the company, new products, opportunities to get into new markets such as China, new distribution deals in nations like Brazil and indications ""that U.S. distribution transition has stabilized,"" according to StreetInsider.Coca-Cola on Friday completed a $2.15 billion purchase of a 16.7% stake in Monster. Under the terms of that agreement, Coke handed over its energy-product business to Monster in exchange for Monster's nonenergy drinks.

1006,KO,"Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) and big backer Coca-Cola (KO) are working to dethrone incumbent cold drink machine maker SodaStream (SODA) with their Keurig Kold, but a new appliance from Whirlpool (WHR) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) is also making waves.The B.blend, which is the result of a four-year collaboration between the appliance maker and beer company, is an all-in-one machine that can make hot coffee as well as cold juice and soda. The device went on sale Tuesday in Sao Paulo, Brazil, for about $1,150.The B.blend is based on technology that comes from a licensing deal with Bevyz, which Keurig fully acquired at the end of last year, several months after the August announcement from Whirlpool about the launch of the platform.Depending on demand, Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch plan to expand sales to the entire South American country and beyond.Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch shares were down a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today.Keurig Kold, which can make iced coffee, soda, sports drinks and iced tea, will start selling online this fall and in select stores this holiday, but it won't reach all retail stores until the 2016 holiday season.It's priced starting at $300, which left some analysts cold on last week's post-earnings conference call.The Keurig 2.0 carafe-and-pod duo is $200, but sales have been weak, in part due to backlash over the latest brewer's unlicensed pod lockout technology.Argus Research analyst John Staszak on Wednesday downgraded the at-home beverage machine maker to hold from buy, and says Keurig is seen facing pressure from price cuts on its K-cup pods that it manufactures for Starbucks (SBUX) and Kraft Foods (KRFT).Costs associated with the new Kold machine, as well as 2.0 markdowns, are expected to weigh on near-term earnings, Staszak says.Keurig shares rose fractionally Wednesday afternoon. The stock is trading a steep 43% off of its all-time high of 158.87 reached last November. Just this month, shares have dropped 23%.And in addition to competition from the high-end, early-adopter machine from Whirlpool and Anheuser-Busch, Keurig also faces pressure from SodaStream, whose machines range in price from $80 to $180.But SodaStream sales have been plunging. Shares are in an extended downtrend and are 73% below their August 2011 all-time high of 79.72.Follow Alissa Williams on Twitter: @IBD_AWilliams.

1027,KO," Nahin Monsoor just can't seem to have enough Nike basketball shoes.The 12-year-old New York City native already owns four pairs of Nike (NKE) basketball shoes and was eying several more at the Foot Locker (FL) store on Manhattan's Upper East Side on the last Sunday in October.Monsoor says he only wears Nike basketball shoes.""The style is really good and they're comfortable,"" said Monsoor, who has worn Nike basketball sneakers since he was seven.Monsoor isn't alone. Basketball shoes continue to be big winners in the hotly competitive athletic footwear game, with IBD 50 stock Nike scoring big points among consumers with its namesake and Jordan brands as well as collections from basketball stars LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Kobe Bryant, say followers.The apparel and footwear powerhouse has stayed on top of its game by continually rolling out more shoes named after star basketball athletes. Its latest was the LeBron 12 'HRT of a Lion' basketball shoe launched at retail on Oct. 30 after being delayed due to what Nike said was a ""small cosmetic issue."" The debut coincided with the Cleveland Cavaliers forward playing in his first NBA regular-season game for the team in four years that evening.Playing The FieldNike has been gaining traction on several fronts. Ongoing innovation in areas such as its Flyknit technology, now expanded beyond use in running shoes to several other categories such as football and basketball shoes, has helped vault Nike's business to new heights.It has also seen a big jump in its business in Western Europe and in China; and Nike is also riding the crest of the athleticwear wave that's taken workout clothes and sneakers out of the gym and onto Main Street as ""the"" fashion trend.Nike scored a slam dunk in its most recent fiscal 2015 first quarter. Earnings soared 27% to $1.09 a share, ahead of views by 21 cents. Revenue rose 15% to $7.98 billion, beating analyst forecasts for $7.83 billion. It was Nike's biggest quarterly revenue gain since the second quarter of fiscal 2012. Nike has logged double-digit revenue gains the past three quarters.Revenue climbed 25% in Western Europe, 12% in North America and 20% in greater China.Strong performance came from Nike's direct-to-consumer business, which includes its owned in-line and factory stores, as well as online sales through its website. Revenue increased 22%, driven by 11% same-store sales growth and significantly higher Nike.com revenue.""In this current macro environment and given the size of the company, for Nike to be able to grow this quarter's revenue 15% with the expectation of 20% EPS growth for the full year, this early in the fiscal year, is nothing short of an outstanding performance, we think,"" wrote Nomura analyst Bob Drbul in a note following the results.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to climb 21% to $3.60 a share, roughly double the 10% gain it saw the prior year. They see a 15% gain in fiscal 2016 and a 14% rise in 2017.Nike Stock JumpsNike shares hit an all-time high on Friday. They have surged 17% since the company reported first-quarter results on Sept. 25, and more than 30% from a February low.""The reason Nike's stock is doing so well is their products are some of the only ones selling with strength globally,"" Brian Sozzi, CEO of Belus Capital Advisors, told IBD. ""So they are not having to cut prices for their products.""Adds Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Svezia: ""They've executed pretty well. To some investors who need to look at big consumer discretionary names, Nike is doing well in the face of fiscal and global economic challenges vs. its consumer discretionary peers like McDonald's (MCD) and Coke (KO).""Basketball's Bank ShotThe basketball shoe category was among Nike's fastest growers and strongest performers in the quarter, with double-digit sales gains in North America.""Nike has always dominated the basketball business,"" said John Horan, publisher of Sporting Goods Intelligence, a weekly newsletter. ""Clearly we're in a big basketball up-cycle (as) fashion. Nike has been through these up-cycles in basketball before and never has been able to sustain the up-cycle the way it has this one.""In this up-cycle, he adds, Nike's product development is much ""broader and deeper"" than it was before in terms of materials, colors and technology used in designing the shoes, and they're keeping the products new and fresh.He cites the point that Nike has continued to broaden the offerings in its Air Jordan franchise, which the company has ""kept bigger than ever, and it's been years since Michael Jordan played his last game.""Among the technologies he refers to is Flyknit, a special yarn and computer-controlled weaving method that lets footwear be ""engineered to provide a more precise fit for the specific needs of the foot,"" according to RunningShoesGuru.com.Nike's popular Flyknit athletic shoes are known for comfortable woven uppers that still provide support and come in bright colors and patterns.A Friend In The TrendNike is also benefiting from how athleticwear has become a go-to wardrobe for women and men to sport in most any casual setting. Power brand Under Armour (UA) is also cashing in on this trend.""Nike owns this business in theory,"" said analyst Svezia. ""It's the $30 billion gorilla in the market. They have significant market share and scale and have their weight behind them in terms of growing this business. They should do better than anyone else.""Drbul is upbeat about Nike's recent performance and prospects.""Overall, we think Nike has separated itself from the competition at the greatest level in the history of the company,"" he said. ""They are the creative machine and the innovation they have is second to none. They're hitting on all cylinders with growth in footwear, in apparel and in equipment. There's really very little weakness in its business.""In a report, Drbul said he was ""encouraged"" by Nike's ""robust"" direct-to-consumer performance in the first quarter, which was driven by a 70% increase in e-commerce and comp growth of 15%.He also noted that the company's efforts to ""reset the Chinese market are also clearly paying off.""He expects the Greater China region to grow at a low-mid teens rate for the full year.Sozzi expects Nike to be the ""winner"" in holiday season sales along with Under Armour and the new Apple (AAPL) iPhone 6 and Apple iPhone 6 Plus smartphones.Nike competes with sports apparel outfits such as Under Armour and yoga-inspired clothing company Lululemon (LULU). It's part of IBD's Apparel-Shoes & Retail Manufacturing group, which also includes highly-rated Skechers USA (SKX).

1222,KO,"Mobileye's technology goes into camera-based advanced driver assistance systems. Its technology is used in cars by most major automakers, and is thought to be in some new Tesla Motors ' (TSLA) vehicles.Owning well-established blue chips that generate slow but steady gains and dividends is one way to play the stock market.But investors looking for a little more sizzle should be on the lookout for newer names with the potential for fast growth. Think of the N in CAN SLIM, which stands for new products, new management, new companies — and even new highs.Big caps such as Coca-Cola (KO), General Electric (GE) and Procter & Gamble (PG), all components of the Dow Jones industrial average, have a long history and tend to provide fairly stable profits as well as an income stream. They also have market caps near $200 billion or higher, and have more than 2 billion shares outstanding.What they don't usually offer, however, is a big run-up in stock price over a relatively short period. And most are cyclical — more subject to what's going on in the economy. The price performance this year for the three Dow stocks mentioned above ranges from -4% to a 9% gain. The overall Dow is up 7%.By comparison, the Nasdaq composite, which tends to house newer, younger companies, has risen 13%. The S&P 500 is up 11%. So adding some newer stocks to your portfolio could help boost performance.What's considered young?IBD research has found that companies tend to make their biggest advance during the first several years after coming public. As a rule of thumb, a newer company is one that has been publicly traded for less than 15 years.That's not to say an older company won't make a second big run. Most don't — but one exception is Apple (AAPL), 37 years old as a public company.

1233,KO,"Microsoft on Tuesday unveiled its third-generation Surface tablet, a device it hopes will sell as a replacement for notebook computers.While tablets have been billed for a few years as laptop PC replacements, the truth is that most tablet owners still use notebooks as well, Panos Panay, corporate vice president of Microsoft (MSFT) Surface, said at a press event in New York City.Usability trade-offs have kept tablets from replacing notebooks, he said. Panay noted how 96% of Apple (AAPL) iPad owners also own notebook computers.The new Surface Pro 3 tablet features a bigger screen, an improved attachable keyboard and a digital pen for making handwritten notes and drawings on screen.The new tablet will be available for pre-order on Wednesday starting at $799. The optional Surface Pro Type cover costs $129.99. The Surface Pro 3 will be in stores on June 20 in the U.S. and Canada, the company said.Microsoft needed to try something different to compete against tablet leaders Apple and Samsung, FBR Capital Markets analyst Daniel Ives said.Positioning the Surface Pro 3 as a laptop replacement ""gives Microsoft a more unique selling feature than being another 'me too' tablet product,"" Ives said. ""Strategically they are definitely taking a different direction.""Because the third-generation Surface Pro, with keyboard cover, costs $830 at a minimum, Microsoft has to position the device against high-end laptops like Apple's MacBook Air, Gartner analyst Mike Silver said.He points out that Microsoft's two earlier Pro tablets also were pitched as laptop replacements. But the tech giant is now ""being bolder about how they communicate that,"" Silver said.Microsoft appears to be targeting enterprise and business users with the Surface Pro 3. At the press event, the company showed usage scenarios for architects and creative professionals.Buyers Include BMW, CokeCompanies such as BMW Group and Coca-Cola (KO) have already committed to purchasing and deploying the device inside their organizations, Microsoft said.Microsoft also is selling a desktop docking station and keyboard that costs $199.99 and targets office workers.The Surface Pro 3 runs on fourth-generation Intel (INTC) Core processors. The tablet is 0.36-inch thin and weighs 1.76 pounds. It boasts up to nine hours of Web-browsing battery life.The basic model comes with 4 gigabytes of RAM, 64 GB of flash storage and Intel's Core i3 processor. Microsoft is selling five configurations of the Surface Pro 3. The top-of-the-line model costs $1,949 and comes with 8 GB of RAM, 512 GB of storage and Intel's i7 chip.Like its predecessors, the Surface Pro 3 can double as a tablet and notebook. It features a more rigid dockable keyboard and adjustable screen kickstand that will allow for laptop typing, something that was difficult with earlier models.The keyboard's trackpad was enlarged and improved as well.Plus, the device features a special pen for writing digital ink on documents, editing photos and other tasks where pen input is preferable.The Surface Pro 3 has a 12-inch screen; the previous model had a 10.6-inch display. The new screen is 38% bigger than Surface Pro 2, with 50% more pixels.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is the tablet that can replace your laptop — the Surface Pro 3,"" Panay said as he held up the ultrathin, lightweight device.A key application of the new tablet is to replace an analog pen and notepad. Clicking the top of the special pen commands the Surface tablet to turn on with a OneNote writing surface displayed.Click the Surface Pen again, and the note is synced to the Internet cloud via Microsoft's OneDrive.The software leader's executives also demonstrated using the pen to do a New York Times crossword puzzle app and to edit images in Adobe Systems' (ADBE) Photoshop.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella spoke at the press event about how Surface hardware is part of the company's ""mobile first, cloud first"" strategy.Microsoft released its first-generation Surface tablets in October 2012. The first Pro configuration came out in February 2013.Microsoft came out with its second generation Surface tablets in October 2013.""They're hoping the third time will be the charm,"" Ives said.The first two waves of Surface tablets barely put a dent in the tablet market, which is dominated by Apple's iPad and Google (GOOGL) Android-based devices.Not discussed at Tuesday's press event were any new consumer Surface RT tablets or a rumored mini tablet.

""Future opportunities include the development of private-label and retailer-owned brands,"" he said in a Thursday note.He noted Costco's (COST) Kirkland Signature K-Cup and the addition of Target (TGT) as an Archer Farms brand partner.Since its K-Cup patent expired in 2012, Keurig has had to compete with unlicensed portion-pack makers.The Keurig 2.0 brewer is designed to work only with licensed K-Cups, but it is unclear if it will be effective in shutting out imitators.Williams Capital upped its price target on Keurig on Thursday to $131 from $125.""Keurig Green Mountain remains a vital participant in the long-term growth of single-serve beverage consumption ,"" Riddick said in his note, adding that Keurig is an ""important contributor"" as a growth generator for its partners.Earlier this year, Coca-Cola (KO) initiated and expanded a stake in Keurig, with plans to develop a Keurig Cold machine for release in the next several months.Last week, Keurig said it would hike prices by up to 9% on its portion packs and bagged coffee, starting Nov. 3. Other coffee sellers have raised prices in recent months following a drought in Brazil's coffee-growing region.Kraft has been working its coffee game, too. Earlier in the week, Kraft announced that it would bring McDonald's (MCD) McCafe java to grocery stores.In addition to McCafe, Kraft brands such as Maxwell House, Gevalia and Yuban will be available in single-serve K-Cups, four-cup K-Carafes that fit the new Keurig 2.0, and Keurig Bolt packs that brew half-gallon pots, the companies said.""This agreement offers the opportunity for expanded distribution across multiple channels and is another example of our focus on long-term growth in action,"" said Kraft Executive Vice President Dino Bianco in a release.

It raised its adjusted EPS target to 68-75. But that's still below Wall Street views for 86 cents and suggest a 20% year-over-year drop at the midpoint.Keurig shares fell 2% after the close. During the regular session, the stock rose 39 cents to 118.13. It hit a record 128.50 on July 3.In Q3, portion pack sales rose 10% to $826.3 million, including a 15% unit gain. But that shift to packs spurred other product sales to fall 17%. Brewer and accessory sales dipped 4% to $128 million.Hot And ColdEarlier in the year, Coca-Cola (KO) bought 16% of Keurig, which is developing a cold beverage brewer that is expected to be released next fiscal year. SodaStream (SODA), the carbonated at-home soda maker company, has recently seen earnings declines.Keurig plans to introduce to the market this fall a new Keurig machine that brews carafes of coffee in addition to single-serve cups.""Our solid year-over-year brewer shipment growth of 13% and our 15% unit growth in portion packs is indicative of the continued expansion of the Keurig system across the U.S. and Canada,"" said CEO Brian Kelley in a press release. ""We also are excited about the imminent launch of our new Keurig 2.0 hot platform; the addition of formerly unlicensed and new brands to the Keurig hot beverage system during the quarter; and our progress on the new Keurig Cold beverage system.""The company said that it will give fiscal 2015 guidance some time this quarter.Analyst views on Keurig have been mixed. Argus Research recently upgraded it to buy from hold on anticipated K-Cup and brewer sales, but Buckingham Research downgraded the company to neutral from buy on Keurig's investments in its cold beverage brewer.Keurig said in June that it would partner with Subway to install single-serve Keurig K150 brewers in thousands of the ubiquitous sandwich chain's North American locations.Since its patent on K-Cup expired two years ago, Keurig has seen increased competition from companies making similarly styled portion packs for its coffee makers at lower costs.But the Keurig 2.0 won't accept unlicensed K-Cups, though it's not clear if the technology will keep out all copycats.Keurig, which has had a partnership with Starbucks (SBUX) for several years, has announced deals in the past month with Harris Teeter Supermarkets (HTSI) and Cafe Bustelo to make K-Cup packs. It also forged an alliance with Nestle USA to create Coffee-mate branded K-Cups that include coffee with creamer.

"
1567,KO,"Leading stocks show strength in several different ways.They break out of well-formed bases in heavy volume. They show tight weekly closes after a breakout. They get consistent support at their 10-week moving average during long advances.Another way a stock shows strength is by forming a base-on-base structure. If you want to find great market winners, keep an eye out for this special chart pattern.The pattern forms after a stock breaks out of base. But instead of going on a lengthy uptrend, it rallies for a bit — typically less than 20% from the base's recent entry point — then settles into another base. You'll often see a flat base form atop a first base, but a cup could emerge on top of a prior cup. A base-on-base pattern counts as one base.Examples abound throughout market history. Coca-Cola (KO) did it coming out of the Depression in 1934, and Boeing (BA) did it in 1978.Base-on-base patterns don't form any old time. They tend to form when selling pressure starts to build in the broad market. When the market takes a turn for the better, historical precedent shows that base-on-base patterns can deliver the strongest upside moves.That was the case with Ascend Communications soon after it went public in May 1994. It cleared a second-stage base-on-base pattern in December 1994. Its first base didn't look all that great due to wide-and-loose price action. Still, the stock managed to break out and rally 26% in three weeks. Because the bullish move triggered IBD's eight-week hold rule, those who bought at the initial breakout could sit tight as the second base formed.The second base looked much better than the first, mostly because of tighter, more orderly trade from week to week. The second base formed above the first, just what you want to see, and the base showed some tight weekly closes at the bottom of the base, near the 10-week moving average. Even better, weekly volume in the second breakout (1) was much stronger than the first.Ascend Communications was also showing strength in a relative way. It started building the right side of its base-on-base pattern when the Nasdaq was still in the throes of a pullback. Ascend was going up while the market was going down.The Nasdaq eventually bottomed and followed through in December, right at the time Ascend was breaking out past a 35.60 entry. The Nasdaq continued to gain traction and followed suit with a breakout of its own to new highs in February 2005. By that time, Ascend Communications had already rallied 67% past the buy point.

1580,KO,"Robert Ludlum was one of the hottest authors of all time.Upon his death at age 73, his novels had sold 200 million to 300 million copies globally and been translated into dozens of languages.Yet Ludlum (1927-2001) didn't write his first novel until he was 42.His life is an inspiration to those who ponder the prudence of a late second career. Yes, it can be done, and Ludlum proved it.""People called me all kinds of a nut,"" he told the press in 1973. ""But my wife said, 'If you really feel this way, do it.'""Ludlum ended up writing 25 novels, earning advances from publishers as high as $4 million.Some of these novels were converted into Hollywood blockbusters, from ""The Holcroft Covenant"" in 1985 to ""The Bourne Identity"" in 2002. The latter was such a smash, it spawned three more films based on the Jason Bourne saga.More To ComeTwo additional movies based on Ludlum's work are planned for 2013 and 2014: ""The Matarese Circle,"" starring Denzel Washington, and ""The Chancellor Manuscript,"" with Leonardo DiCaprio headed for the top of the marquee.Ludlum's second career as a novelist built on his first as an actor and producer.Born in New York City, he found himself drawn to theater. As a teenager, he started acting in plays.Little did Ludlum know it, but he was learning through acting the art of storytelling that would make him a premier crafter of thrillers.Acting enriched his sense of how to set a scene, devise compelling dialogue and keep audiences on edge. Above all, it taught him the power of plot twists, which became his hallmark as a novelist.""He was a master of plotting,"" Jeremy Lott, editor of Real Clear Books, told IBD. ""He made you want to turn to the next page.""That early exposure to the dramatic arts helped Ludlum lap other budding novelists.""I equate suspense and good theater in a very similar way. I think it's all suspense and what-happens-next,"" he once mused.Ludlum also learned from his early acting how to sell a product. For a time, he made money working in commercials. Long before he generated a stream of marketable books, he was appearing in ads and doing voice-overs for such products as Tuna Helper.He enjoyed telling his friends that he financed part of his son's college education on ""Plunge works fast,"" a line he spoke in a widely seen toilet cleaner ad.His work in plays and commercials was even more valuable in teaching him how to engage and persuade audiences. He performed at the North Jersey Playhouse and in some early TV shows, hobnobbing with such actors as Jack Lemmon.Ludlum ultimately found acting too stifling. He didn't want to speak lines handed to him; he wanted to write his own. ""Usually I got cast as a lawyer or a homicidal killer,"" he told the Chicago Tribune. ""But I got bored with the total lack of control an actor has.""He tried to remedy his boredom by moving from acting to producing — and started the Playhouse on the Mall in Paramus, N.J.But producing brought its own share of frustrations. Crowds remained small in spite of the quality of his plays or his eye for talent; he enlisted a young Alan Alda for one of his plays.Ludlum joked that when ""you did something exciting and good, you could shoot a moose in the lobby for all the people who ever came.""He also found himself entangled in noncreative matters, such as contract negotiations and union disputes, which left him exhausted. ""I couldn't stand it anymore,"" he said.From Stage To PageAfter two decades in the theater, Ludlum performed a second act as a novelist that many wouldn't have thought possible.It wasn't easy. He struggled to find a publisher for his first novel, ""The Scarlatti Inheritance,"" a story set in Washington during World War II that revolves around the potential defection of a Nazi in possession of an explosive secret file.Ten publishers passed on it, before World Publishing finally rolled the presses with it in 1971.That novel and all the succeeding 24 were New York Times best-sellers.Ludlum's success derived in part from his penchant for tapping into a growing discontent with oversized institutions and into the public's wariness of powerful elites.""What I don't like in this country and the world is largeness — large corporations, large governments,"" he told the Los Angeles Times.Another nut in his writing approach: innovation.Reviewers observed that he eschewed older, staler genres (such as crime fiction) and in effect established his own field of fiction — the conspiratorial thriller in which an individual, who is at once flawed and heroic, defeats large and nefarious global forces.This sphere fit with the mood of modern readers, who hungered for an answer to the baffling events of a war-saturated 20th century and longed for the triumph of good over evil if only in escapist fare. ""He was in tune with the times,"" said Charles Coletta, an instructor in the Department of Popular Culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. ""He knew how to tell a good story"" and how to give people a sense that he was pulling back the curtain on dark times and showing them ""what was really going on.""The FizzAdded Coletta: ""He has become a brand name like Coca-Cola (KO). People know what to expect.""The power of his brand, added Coletta, can be measured in its influence on other books and movies: ""His hero Jason Bourne is a more realistic version of James Bond, and that has influenced the last few Bond movies.""Most people assume familiarity breeds contempt; Ludlum grasped its power to breed attachment. This is why the template of his titles — ""The"" followed by a proper noun and noun — never varied.So familiar and powerful is Ludlum's brand that it has continued after his death. He has been ""Bourne again,"" noted Publisher's Weekly in 2009, reporting that the ""Ludlum brand is nearly as strong today as when he was alive.""Ludlum worked hard on his books, rising at 4:30 in the morning and churning out at least 2,000 words a day by hand.His research was meticulous. He understood that he needed to display factual expertise in order to engross readers, so he would spend months studying up on military and intelligence details and traveling abroad.To garner a global audience, he cultivated global themes.Long before 9/11, he explored the potent subject of international terrorism in ""The Holcroft Covenant"" and ""The Matarese Circle.""Rumored international conspiracies that fascinated the public also figured in his novels. In the Bourne books, he fed readers' endless appetite for CIA-related intrigue.Some critics panned his books as airport novels — books that gave jet passengers cheap thrills as they soared over the world he was describing. The brickbats of the critics didn't bother him. He wrote for the common man.""I don't believe that my first name is Leo, or that my last name is Tolstoy. I'm a storyteller,"" he said.

Salesforce.com stock is up more than 35% this year.Salesforce.com's (CRM) northward growth trajectory is expected to continue as the company replaces aging customer relationship management systems with its cloud-based software and attracts more customers to its burgeoning marketing services business.Salesforce.com is the No. 1 provider of customer relationship management software, delivering its software as a service via the Internet ""cloud."" It's set to report its earnings for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 31 after the close Monday, with its stock trading near all-time highs.Salesforce.com's cloud-based service is an alternative to often more expensive on-premise systems sold by Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP) and other rivals.The company earlier targeted its cloud service to small and midsize corporate customers, but it's been signing up larger customers, such as Coca-Cola (KO). The transition to larger customers could gain steam in the second half of this year, says Brad Sills, an analyst for Maxim Group.""That is when large enterprises typically sign agreements ... so the expectation is that those large enterprise replacement deals start to close in Q3, Q4,"" Sills told IBD.In July, Salesforce closed its $2.5 billion acquisition of ExactTarget, a marketing services company that Salesforce has combined with earlier acquisitions of Buddy Media, a social media marketing services company, and Radian6, a social media monitoring firm. Its goal is to create a one-stop shop for marketing and social media business applications.ExactTarget will likely provide significant upside to Q3 revenue, Sills says.""You only had three weeks of ExactTarget's revenue in last quarter's numbers and now you have a full quarter, which in my model is $55 million in total revenue,"" he said.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Salesforce to report total revenue of $1.05 billion, up 34% from the year-earlier period. They expect earnings per share minus items of 9 cents, up a penny.For the current quarter, analysts expect revenue of $1.12 billion, up 34%, with EPS ex-items of 7 cents, down from 13 cents. The decline stems from restructuring charges associated with integrating ExactTarget.Salesforce.com stock was flat in midday trading in the stock marketFriday, near 57.

1621,KO,"Patent expiration often heralds slower growth for innovative firms.Such has been the case with Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR), which sells single-cup coffee brewers along with single portion K-Cups of their own and licensed brands of coffee.The expiration of key patents in September 2012 let unlicensed rivals win share in the lucrative K-Cup market.Keurig, which boosted sales at a compound annual clip of roughly 55% from 2009 to 2013, was forced to make do with more pedestrian low double-digit growth levels. Some bearish observers wondered if the market for single cup-coffee was as robust as Keurig claimed.But Keurig, on the verge of introducing two major products, thinks it has the solution to slowing growth. And Wall Street seems convinced. Keurig stock, which ended 2013 priced just under $75, recently fetched over $120.Keurig's Composite Rating — 98 of a possible 99 —puts it first among the eight firms in IBD's Wholesale-Food industry group. With a market value of just over $20 billion, it ranks second in size only to Sysco (SYY) among those eight.Still, the company has had to weather declining revenue growth in the past two years. Sales growth, which as recently as the quarter ended Sept. 30, 2012, stood at 33%, was just 10% in the quarter ended March 31. Even with slower revenue growth, Keurig has been able to expand earnings per share nicely: EPS rose 16% last quarter.Later this year, Keurig will unveil a new system that brews whole carafes of coffee as well as its familiar one-cup servings. Perhaps more important, the Keurig 2.0 brewers threaten to lock out unlicensed purveyors of K-Cup compatibles.Coca-Cola StakeNext year Keurig will carve out new product territory with its Keurig Cold system for at-home carbonation of soft drinks.Coca-Cola Co. (KO) has invested in the at-home carbonation concept by purchasing 16% of Keurig shares. Coke's share purchases seem to validate Keurig's carbonation product plan. They've also fueled speculation of a buyout.Akshay Jagdale, analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, makes the bullish case. ""We think the company can triple to quadruple its earnings in a three to five year period. It has the potential to do that,"" he said in a phone interview.He believes Keurig's core brewing business is far from saturation and that Keurig Cold will offer new capabilities beyond those of existing home-carbonation platforms.""Five years from now, they have the potential to earn $8.20 from the hot platform and $3.50 from the cold,"" he said. Jagdale has a price target of $150. If Keurig's hot and cold businesses flourish as he anticipates, the stock would be ""a steal"" at his price target of $150.Others have their doubts. Theo Brito, an analyst with BTIG, a New York-based trader for hedge funds, mutual funds and other institutional clients, begins by throwing cold carbonated water on the notion of a Coke buyout, which he terms ""very unlikely."" His fundamental skepticism is centered on Keurig's core brewing business.Pods And ProfitKeurig brewers are in roughly 18 million U.S. households. Suzanne DuLong, Keurig vice president of investor relations, notes that there are 90 million coffee-drinking households in America. ""We think there's still ample opportunity with our Hot systems,"" she said.Brito questions whether all those 90 million households have the income or inclination to purchase a Keurig brewer, which can run from $80 to $189.Brito claims that as Keurig has expanded sales, the average number of cups brewed on its machines — the attachment rate, in industry lingo — has declined.""Over the last five years, there's been an annual decline of around 10%,"" Brito told IBD. ""I expect the decline to continue.""That's important because Keurig derives the bulk of its profit from K-Cups, not brewers. Declining K-Cup sales would definitely pinch margins, he contends.Still, Wall Street bulls have been winning the argument on Keurig this year. And KeyBanc's Jagdale tackles the bearish doubts head-on. He contends that Keurig has the potential to vastly increase the household presence of its brewers.In Europe, he notes, single-serve brewers are in 30%-35% of households. Keurig currently has just 20% penetration.And Jagdale foresees huge gains in single portion coffee as the new Keurig 2.0 locks out unlicensed packet providers. In just the last year and a half, unlicensed sellers have gone from zero to roughly 14% of the K-Cup market, he notes.""The Keurig 2.0 brewer will not allow any unlicensed cups to work with it,"" he said.Jagdale sees signs that the strategy is already working. He notes that several retailers — including Target (TGT) — that had been unlicensed have recently entered into licensing arrangements with Keurig. He suggests that retailers prefer sharing coffee packet revenue with Keurig to being locked out of the business entirely.Jagdale does not venture to predict the likelihood of Coca-Cola expanding its equity ownership in Keurig Green Mountain. ""It's hard to predict what will happen with buyouts,"" he said.He does think the likelihood of buyout ""will increase with the success of Keurig Cold.""The Cool FactorKeurig Cold systems will hit the market in 2015. Keurig spokeswoman DuLong says that at $80 to $189, Keurig Cold units will carry similar pricing to Keurig brewers.Consumers have other choices for at home carbonation, including products from market leader SodaStream International (SODA).Still, the market is in its infancy and Jagdale is impressed with one expected Keurig Cold feature: ""It will be the only product that can produce a cold beverage.""The Keurig carbonators could begin to contribute as much as $3.50 in EPS just three years after their 2015 introduction , Jagdale estimates. That's one reason he expects Keurig to get back on the fast growth track.""You're going to see an acceleration in top-line growth for Keurig,"" he said.

"
1653,KO,"Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds. The fund beat 24% of its large-cap blend peers in 2011, 46% in 2013 and is ahead of 83% this year through July 31, says Morningstar Inc.
"
1654,KO,"The fund changed its brand name from Legg Mason on March 1.
"
1655,KO,"Peters, 45, discussed his investment approach from his office overlooking Baltimore Inner Harbor.
"
1656,KO,"IBD: Is the crux of your strategy the pursuit of mispriced stocks?
"
1657,KO,"Peters: We look at traditional growth stocks and traditional value stocks. We go up and down the quality spectrum. We try to come up with a reasonable range of business values (for a stock) under future scenarios. I'm a valuation manager. But the real expertise is looking at stocks and free cash flow analysis, then over time figuring out what powers a stock's return and finding those with a price-to-value gap.
"
1658,KO,"IBD: Many people say no one can do that consistently for long periods.
"
1659,KO,"Peters: Any time you're an active manager, you have to take a humble approach. The market's tough to beat. Once an analyst comes to me with a stock whose valuation is 60 or 70 or 80 cents to the dollar, I ask what is the market getting wrong? I look for things that strengthen or weaken the investment case. I look for reasons why the market's expectations are wrong. Most of the time, it is not wrong. We look at hundreds of stocks to find a few where the market is wrong.
"
1660,KO,"IBD: How come you don't end up with a lot of broken stocks?
"
1661,KO,"Peters: I don't want Frankenstein. I want the most diversification I can get in a concentrated portfolio — I own only 40 to 50 names — but I don't want to pay for it. We've got to be disciplined. It takes time for (mispriced stocks') price and value to converge. That's why our average holding period is three-plus years.
"
1662,KO,"IBD: How does your approach differ from Bill Miller's?
"
1663,KO,"Peters: I became co-manager in November 2010. He was a good coach. I started changing some things. He encouraged me. I like to cast my net wider, for example. We were very underweight in health care when I came on board. And I have a health care stocks background. So we went from 4% underweight (vs. the S&P 500) to about 6% overweight. I cut some financials and housing stock to do that. I also sold some tech names.
"
1664,KO,"We're overweight energy. We weren't when I came on board. We're very overweight financials now and we're overweight tech. Health care peaked at 6% overweight earlier this year.
"
1665,KO,"IBD: For people who may not know, what is your health care background?
"
1666,KO,"Peters: I managed the global health care team at Fidelity and managed Fidelity Select Health Care and Select Medical Equipment funds from January 2004 to April 2005.
"
1667,KO,"IBD: How else does your approach differ from Miller's?
"
1668,KO,"Peters: Take breadth. Let's say there are 10 great price gap stocks. If two are home runs you can hit out of the park, Bill will concentrate on those. I'll take more names, even if there's less upside. I'll add four or five nice valuation bets and diversify the fund more.
"
1669,KO,"IBD: Is the purpose of added diversification to cut volatility?
"
1670,KO,"Peters: It's not necessarily to make the fund less volatile. But the result is that it is less volatile over time.
"
1671,KO,"IBD: What's your biggest bet?
"
1672,KO,"Peters: I'll answer that this way. My biggest overweight is a bet on higher interest rates. That's moved against me year-to-date, but I'm still ahead of the market.
"
1673,KO,"IBD: Do you still pick Miller's brain?
"
1674,KO,"Peters: He's been my biggest mentor. Always will be. We are very close friends. I have the utmost respect for him.
"
1675,KO,"He was relieved when I charted my own course. That contrarian streak in buying negative price momentum and being differentiated, that got reinforced by and I learned a lot from Bill. I learned about being intellectually diverse, reading widely, talking with people, not being dogmatic, all from Bill. Yet it allowed me to be different from Bill.
"
1676,KO,"We talk investing, but we rarely talk individual names.
"
1677,KO,"Bill is a huge contrarian (too). We share that common DNA, and he pushed me to really think for myself and look at the facts, which is essential if you are going to have a contrarian approach. Be contrary to opinions and not facts.
"
1678,KO,"IBD: How much skin do you have in the game?
"
1679,KO,"Peters: I'm one of the larger shareholders in the fund, which is how it should be. It's the largest chunk of my net worth. My SEC disclosure has me over the $1 million mark. When I get bonuses, I add to the fund. I am the largest individual shareholder in the fund, though some institutional shareholders have more.
"
1680,KO,"IBD: Your June disclosure shows your stake in Apple (AAPL) jumped to 1.3 million shares from 205,000 as of April 30. Apple had a 7-for-1 split, so did you also trim?
"
1681,KO,"Peters: Yes, Apple had a split, and I've actually been trimming.
"
1682,KO,"I typically buy when a negative narrative goes too far. I get excited if the hurdle goes from 4 feet high to an inch high. That was the case with Apple at 400. At 650 it's a tougher case. (Post-split Apple is trading around 95.)
"
1683,KO,"People are excited about a 6-inch screen (on the iPhone) and a watch that are supposedly coming.
"
1684,KO,"But Apple is discounting flattish margins. It is discounting some growth. And it's a higher hurdle to jump over. It's not massively overvalued. But it's less interesting than it was.
"
1685,KO,"IBD: Celgene (CELG) is another recent split, right?
"
1686,KO,"Peters: It is. This is a classic for us. We got involved before the big biotech run, when it was a value stock. When I joined the fund, health care was in the dumps.
"
1687,KO,"I love positive price momentum. I just don't want to pay for it. We trimmed before biotech got hit in March. Then when Celgene got sold (by the market) in Q2 we added back when expectations got reset. I think Celgene will be a long-term winner. And we think Celgene will prevail on its Revlimid patents (in its court fight against Natco, which is developing a generic rival for Revlimid).
"
1688,KO,"IBD: Is fracking the bedrock of your Halliburton (HAL) play?
"
1689,KO,"Peters: They put straws a mile down into the ground, go out 5,000 feet horizontally, then blow up rock underground to drive more oil up. The more complex those wells are, the better the economics for Halliburton.
"
1690,KO,"What we noticed about the shale revolution is that rig productivity is doubling every three years, which is amazing. Halliburton is capturing a lot of those efficiencies.
"
1691,KO,"IBD: Why did you trim Broadcom (BRCM) between April and June?
"
1692,KO,"Peters: This was classic for us. Broadcom was doing some bad things, throwing huge amounts of money into chasing Qualcomm's (QCOM) monopoly in baseband chips. They made no headway. They diluted their own fundamentals on an uneconomical bet.
"
1693,KO,"They ended up with the lowest valuation of all large-cap semiconductor stocks. We bought when everyone told us we shouldn't. It was in the high 20s. (Now it's trading in the high 30s.) It was so bad, it was good. We thought they would get pressure from employees, shareholders, their own board to fix things. We felt if they made changes for the better, the stock would go up a lot.
"
1694,KO,"And last quarter, lo and behold they said 'Uncle.' They stopped chasing Qualcomm's monopoly in baseband. They said they'd give back more to shareholders. Profit margins would go up. So you'll see positive earnings revisions.
"
1695,KO,"We still think the business value is higher, somewhere in the 40s. Now it has positive momentum. We have a big position. So you'll see us trim a little.
"
1696,KO,"IBD: Calpine (CPN) earnings-per-share growth has accelerated for three quarters. What's your thesis?
"
1697,KO,"Peters: We began buying early this year around 19. Late first quarter, early second quarter. They're taking a 12% free cash flow yield, which is extremely high, and buying back a lot of stock. So we got in effect a high tax-efficient yield. In a 2.5% 10-year Treasury world, that's a good way to win.
"
1698,KO,"We (the U.S.) reward underbuilding utility power supply in the U.S. Especially in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Maryland. We're having lots of coal utility retirements. We're not building new nukes (power plants). So power supply is getting tighter. We think this will set up a lot of power pricing volatility. Which is great for Calpine.
"
1699,KO,"IBD: UnitedHealth Group (UNH) is uptrending despite modest EPS results. What's your view?
"
1700,KO,"Peters: They got hit with negative earnings revisions due to ObamaCare. But the stock was cheap enough to withstand it. Now estimates have stabilized. They have growth in services, growth in their core managed care side. Mixed with low valuation and better earnings as we look into 2015, it will result in a nice stock. A low valuation lets you be timing agnostic.
"
1701,KO,"IBD: When did Expedia (EXPE) look like a value play to you?
"
1702,KO,"Peters: We bought it last fall when it stumbled on earnings last summer. It became very cheap.
"
1703,KO,"I met management in the fall and became comfortable that they had gotten their technology platform in good enough shape to manage pressure from Priceline (PCLN). I felt we should see positive earnings surprises against a lower bar.
"
1704,KO,"And we think the online travel space is a good cash generator.
"
1705,KO,"IBD: What do you like about truck and parts maker Paccar (PCAR)?
"
1706,KO,"Peters: Trucking capacity is getting tight. You can't get drivers. And the (national) fleet is getting old, so it's set for a replacement cycle in a big way. That's building a big fundamental tailwind for Paccar. And they're good about capital allocation.
"
1707,KO,"IBD: Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS) is uptrending, so why do you still like it?
"
1708,KO,"Peters: They've done a good job turning no top-line growth into bottom-line growth by smart capital allocations. And they're buying back a lot of stock well below its business value.
"
1709,KO,"They've driven profit margins higher and rationalized their business. Also — and this bothers me a little — people have been looking for domestic plays. Dr Pepper is a North American beverage play unlike Coke (KO) and Pepsi (PEP). Its valuation is getting less attractive. But we're still holding it.
"
1710,KO,"IBD: What bothers you about investors liking U.S. stocks?
"
1711,KO,"Peters: We try and find uncrowded games, and the U.S. is seen as the safe zone right now. That may be true, but high investor expectations and crowding make it a risk.
"
1712,KO,"IBD: Wells Fargo (WFC) has met or topped consensus expectations in recent quarters. What else do you like?
"
1713,KO,"Peters: They're incredibly well managed. After their last stress test regulators said basically that they can return about 100% of their earnings to shareholders if they want to, which is unprecedented, with Citigroup (C) hanging out at zero. And they're dominant in the mortgage market. Return on equity is well into the double digits. They're selling below business value. And if we get higher interest rates, that's going to be good for large banks and life insurers.How do you follow a legend?That's been one of the challenges for Sam Peters, who has been lead manager of $2.7 billion ClearBridge Value since taking the baton from Bill Miller about two years ago.Miller — who still runs $2.1 billion Legg Mason Opportunity — ran Value from its April 16, 1982 inception until April 30, 2012. He famously beat the broad stock market as measured by the S&P 500 for 15 years in a row — from 1991 to 2005.Miller's winning streak came to an end. Peters joined as co-manager in late 2010 and took the lead in April 2012.Peters has made progress in returning Value to the apex among top mutual funds.

1735,KO,"Quarterly profit gains have cooled recently from 58% to 39% to 26% to 16%. Analysts expect a further slowdown to 7% in Q2. BTIG on Wednesday began covering Keurig, which recently announced a deal to install its brewers in privately held Subway sandwich shops, with a neutral rating.This week's Big Cap 20 list showed a few changes from last week, as Apple (AAPL), Encana (ECA) and Magna International (MGA) fell out and were replaced by Celgene (CELG), Spectra Energy (SE) and Southwest Airlines (LUV) .Energy plays still dominate amid continued unrest in Iraq. Oil- and gas-related stocks comprise more than half of this week's list as most extend their gains. But they're also extended past their buy points.Health care and technology account for the next biggest groups, with three from each. The rest are lone rangers hailing from various industries, including an airline, a restaurant operator and the maker of the Keurig single-cup brewer.In fact, the two latter stocks, plus a biotech, happen to be among the few Big Cap stocks that are either basing or still within buying range.Celgene is just off a record high after clearing a 163.60 cup-with-handle buy point on Thursday in above-average volume. The stock surged June 19, after shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock split at their annual meeting the prior day. The number of authorized shares will double to 1.15 billion and shares outstanding to 399 million, on June 25.That marks the biotech's fourth split since going public 14 years ago. The prior three stock splits were in 2006, 2004 and 2000. Celgene's best-selling drugs last year were Revlimid at 66% of revenue, Vidaza 12% and Abraxane 10%. The Summit, N.J.-based company has grown sales and profit by double digits or better since 2004.Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) is still working on the right side of a cup base with a potential buy point of 623. The stock advanced the past five weeks, though in below-average trade. It's logged four heavy-volume down weeks along the left side of the base.The fast-casual restaurant operator's profit growth slowed to 12% in Q1 and is expected to further slow to 8% in Q2. But full-year consensus estimates call for 21% growth this year and a 27% jump the next.Chipotle leads its 56-stock Retail-Restaurants group with a 97 Composite Rating.Keurig Green Mountain (GMCR) emerged from a cup-with-handle pattern on June 17 in fast turnover but hasn't made much headway since. It's pulled back to 2% below the 123.72 buy point.

Health care names, especially in biotech and ethical drugs, did the heavy lifting once again. The S&P 500 added 0.1% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, weighed down by Coca-Cola (KO). Shares fell 4% on disappointing…
"
1808,KO,"If Coca-Cola (KO) were a country, you could argue that its economically bigger than the GDP of almost 75 nations — including Guatemala, Kenya and Panama.Such comparisons are imperfect, but long-term investors have reason to appreciate Coke's size. Coke has paid dividends every year since 1920 and has increased the payout for 50 consecutive years.The current yield is 2.6%.Price performance also has been strong. Without calculating for dividends, Coca-Cola beat the S&P 500 in seven of the past 10 years and went 5-5 against the Nasdaq.The 10-year cumulative return is even better. Through 2011, Coke rose 48%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 10% and 34%, respectively.So far this year, Coca-Cola's 11% gain leads the S&P 500 but trails the Nasdaq.Return on equity last year was 28.5%, well above the 17% minimum associated with top stocks.The five-year EPS stability rating is a calm 3 on a scale of 0 to 99.Drawbacks include a pretax margin in 2011 that was the lowest (25.4%) in at least nine years. Inflation in commodity prices hurt margins.Also, the three- to five-year EPS growth rates of 10% and 9%, respectively, point to the reality that Coke's size makes rapid growth unlikely. Annual profit growth topped 20% in only one of the past 20 years.And because Coca-Cola operates in more than 200 countries, political and economic risks are present.The company uses unit-case volume to measure its strength because it gauges trends at the consumer level. In Q1, unit-case volume grew 20% in India, 14% in the Mideast and North Africa, 10% in South Africa, 9% in China and 5% in Latin America.The slower growth was in Japan, 3%; North America, 2%; and Europe, 1%.This trend of faster growth outside developed countries is expected to continue.If the U.S. slips into recession later this year — as the Economic Cycle Research Institute is predicting — Coke will be hit along with the rest of the market. But Coke's decline started later and was more subdued than the S&P 500's slide in the 2007-09 bear market. The S&P 500 lost 58% while Coke fell 43%.

1822,KO,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  unveiled plans to pay special dividend of $103.75 per share, setting a conditional record date on Jul 6, 2018. This is with respect to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Dr Pepper Snapple and Maple Parent Holdings Corp, the indirect parent of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. Closure of this merger transaction depends on stockholder approvals after Annual Meeting on Jun 29 as well as other regulatory closing conditions. However, the closing is slated for Jul 9, 2018.Per the terms of the merger, Maple Parent is expected to merge with a special purpose merger subsidiary of Dr Pepper Snapple. As a result, it will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. On completion of the merger, Dr Pepper Snapple will be renamed as Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. and will trade under the symbol ""KDP"" on the New York Stock Exchange.This merger announcement dates back to January 2018, when the leading coffee maker, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple. Under the terms of the deal, which was then approved by Dr Pepper Snapple’s board of directors, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $103.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders were likely to retain 13% ownership of the combined entity, while Keurig shareholders were about to own the remaining 87%.Previously, it was revealed that European investment fund JAB Holding will make a $9 billion equity investment to finance the transaction. Also, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), JAB Holding's partner in Keurig, was about to have 13-14% stake in the merged entity.The combined company, Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021. The merger creates a portfolio that will contain a number of iconic brands, including Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W, Mott’s, Canada Dry and Clamato, among others. The merged entity is likely to gain from Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network, while Keurig's online presence will boost sales through digital platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, analysts are of opinion that the combined company can give a tough competition to beverage giants, including The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).We note that Dr Pepper Snapple has been witnessing weak volumes of carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, owing to CSD category headwinds. Further, cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. In the past month, the stock lost 0.1% against the industry’s 5.4% rally.So, it remains to be seen whether this merger transaction can really prove to be meaningful.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.(We are reissuing this article to correct a mistake.

1823,KO,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 28. The Midland-based company has a positive earnings surprise record for the trailing four quarters, with a 9.9% beat delivered in the last reported quarter. Let’s see what’s in store for McCormick this time around.What to ExpectThe current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 93 cents, which shows a 13.4% rise from 82 cents recorded in the year-ago period. The estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.32 billion, up 18.1% from the year-ago reported figure. McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated Quote Factors Driving the QuarterMcCormick has been gaining from its focus on buyouts, product innovations, cost-containment measures and efficient marketing initiatives. These factors contributed to its robust results, in the last reported quarter, helping the company keep its earnings and sales streak alive for the fifth and fourth consecutive time, respectively. Favorable currency translation drove top-line growth in the previous quarter, which is expected to remain for a while now.The company is on track with its Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program that aims at cost savings and increased efficiency. Savings from the CCI program are being used by the company toward increasing investment that will further drive profits and sales.Further, McCormick remains poised on strategic acquisitions that enhance its portfolio. The addition of Reckitt Benckiser (RBGLY  -  Free Report), including Frank's RedHot, French's Mustard and other well-known condiment brands into McCormick portfolio is likely to fuel the company’s performance.However, the company is exposed to higher raw material cost inflation. The company's profits are under threat due to the stiff competition it faces from its peers, which may compel it to lower prices. High marketing and freight expense are also significant concerns, although increase in brand expense is likely to be cushioned by the CCI program.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that McCormick is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.McCormick has an Earnings ESP of -1.89%, along with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1824,KO,"The knockout stage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Saturday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Telemundo. With half of the original 32 teams eliminated and ratings up, World Cup drama is really just beginning. So let’s see how some of the biggest FIFA and World Cup sponsors have performed, along with a quick look at the TV ratings.RatingsThe early World Cup ratings on Fox were down 44% compared to the 2014 tournament on ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report), according to Nielsen. Meanwhile, Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), saw a comparable drop. This downward trend then quickly flipped.Germany’s June 23 stoppage-time victory grabbed 5.4 million viewers on Fox, which made it the most-watched non-U.S. men’s group stage game on English-language TV in 28 years. Other games also grabbed big numbers, with viewership on Day 14 up 34% compared to 2014.Fox noted that its overall group stage viewership was up 1%, compared to the average of the last four World Cups. This might not sound like much, but many expected Fox’s ratings to suffer since the U.S. did not qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.Meanwhile, overall TV ratings are down, including the NFL’s. So with that said, let’s quickly look at how these integral parts of the tournament in the U.S. have performed on the stock market.Fox & TelemundoFox and Telemundo won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. Both networks also own rights to the 2026 World Cup that will be held in North America.Sponsors Now let’s move onto some official FIFA partners and World Cup sponsors, which reportedly pay between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 8.4% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 82% climb.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since it signed its new FIFA deal. However, it is worth noting that the company’s surge currently lags rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) climb, which is also a major player at the World Cup in terms of team and player sponsorships.  Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

1826,KO,"Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 29.Notably, the company looks quite appeasing on the earnings front, having delivered 14th consecutive beat in fourth-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, this was the company’s 19th straight quarter of year-over-year bottom-line growth. In the trailing four quarters, Constellation Brands pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 12.2%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.44, which portrays an improvement of 4.3% from the year-ago quarter. However, the estimate moved south by 4 cents in the past 30 days.Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Constellation Brands Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Constellation Brands Inc QuoteLet’s delve deep to see how things are shaping up prior to the quarterly earnings release.What You Should KnowConstellation Brands is benefiting from its robust brand portfolio, strategic initiatives and strength in beer business. Moreover, its consistent focus on brand building and initiatives to include new products are commendable. Also, its top line has been gaining from solid depletions in both beer and wine & spirits businesses.Over the years, Constellation Brands’ beer business has been performing exceeding well. In fact, the solid depletions in the beer business mainly stemmed from strength in Modelo and Corona brand families. Further, the launch of Corona Familiar new packages in regionally-expanded markets that positioned it among the top 10 high-end beer share gainers, proved conducive to the company. These factors are expected to drive Constellation Brands’ top line and boost profitability in first-quarter fiscal 2019.For the to-be-reported quarter, analysts polled by Zacks envision total revenues to come in at $2.05 billion, which is roughly 5.8% higher than the year-ago quarter.In the past three months, Constellation Brands has gained 5.5% against the industry’s decline of 7.6%. This outperformance can be attributed to the company’s robust strategic actions.Additionally, management remains encouraged by significant market share gains, margin expansion, strong free cash flow and solid execution. As a result, it provided an upbeat outlook for fiscal 2019, which boosts optimism for first-quarter results.However, stiff competition from other well-established players in the industry along with higher taxes remains concerns. This, in turn, might impact the company’s margins and hurt profitability. Also, higher debt position may adversely affect the company’s creditworthiness and make it more susceptible to macroeconomic headwinds.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Constellation Brands is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

1828,KO,"Craft beer, which till some time back was a favorite with Americans, seems to be losing its appeal. According to market research firm IRI Worldwide, craft beer growth slowed in the first half of 2018 and the rest of the year doesn’t look good either. Moreover beer shipments from U.S. breweries too are down so far this year. An increasing number of Americans is opting for non-alcoholic beverages that have resulted in demand for energy drinks to shoot over the last few years.Understandably, this has made soft beverage manufacturing companies focus more on healthier drinks, especially non carbonated, low sugary and energy drinks. So much so, that even alcoholic drink manufacturers are focusing on non-alcoholic beverages.Craft Beer Losing AppealTill a few years back, craft beer was a favorite with Americans. However, with changing tastes and preferences of the new generation, the appeal for craft beer is fading. And the change seems to be more evident this year. According to the Beer Institute, beer shipments from U.S. breweries are already down 3.5% this year.Per IRI, worldwide sales of craft beer across large-scale retail stores grew only 1.7% in the first half of 2018. Interestingly, in 2002, beer comprised 54% of overall alcohol sales but in 2017 beer contributed only 46% of total alcohol sales. This is certainly taking a toll on prominent beer manufacturers like Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), which are struggling to cope with declining demand for beer.The reason for this sudden beer-apathy is the growing preference for healthier drinks. An increasing number of Americans is becoming health conscious, which has seen a decline in demand for carbonated beverages. The carbonated soft drink market has shrunk for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Industry Swings Toward Non-Alcoholic and Energy DrinksThe global non-alcoholic beverage market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 5.5% between 2018 and 2023, according to Market Research Future. Analysts believe that growing consumer awareness and increasing interest in a healthier lifestyle is making people shun alcoholic and carbonated drinks.This has resulted in the energy drink market to grow at a rapid pace over the last few years. Energy drinks continue to outperform the overall soft drink market in terms of value. The global value of energy drinks reached more than $51 billion in 2017.Understandably, millennials are opting for healthier and non-alcoholic drinks, which has made not only soft beverages companies shift focus toward healthier drinks, but also beer manufacturers reorient their product line with low-alcohol content.Beer manufacturers like Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report), The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) and Craft Brew Alliance, Inc. (BREW  -  Free Report) are trying to come up with innovative products and adding new flavors that have less alcohol content. The Boston Beer Company recently launched Fuzzy Traveler Peach Shandy that is low on alcohol content. Craft Brew Alliance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.On the other hand, almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

1829,KO,"NIKE Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 28. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this leading sports apparel retailer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of nearly 30.8%. Moreover, it has maintained a spectacular record for more than three years, delivering positive earnings surprises for 23 straight quarters. In the trailing four quarters, the company recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 22.5%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 64 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 6.8%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter has been stable in the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $9.4 billion, reflecting an increase of 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise NIKE, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | NIKE, Inc. QuoteMoreover, NIKE outperformed the industry in the past month, indicating a positive sentiment ahead of the earnings release. Its shares increased 6.1% compared with 4.2% growth recorded by the industry. Additionally, the company’s shares have witnessed growth of 17.4% in the last three months.Factors at PlayGains from NIKE’s robust growth and innovation efforts, alongside its strategy of acquiring sponsorships for various sporting events across the globe, are well reflected in its robust sales and earnings surprise trend. The company’s performance graph is influenced by strength in international business and the global NIKE Direct business. It has also made significant progress on its Consumer Direct Offense strategy, positioning it for robust growth in the future.Further, the company closed third-quarter fiscal 2018 with expectations of a trend reversal in its North America business in the fiscal fourth quarter, backed by the introduction of innovation platforms and differentiated customer experiences in the marketplace. Consequently, it provided robust guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 along with initial view for fiscal 2019.In the to-be-reported quarter, the company expects revenue growth of high-single digit, backed by persistent strength in international regions and the reversal of the trend in North America. Revenue growth in North America is now anticipated to be nearly flat compared with the prior-year quarter, with expectations to return to growth in the first half of fiscal 2019.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues in North America is $3,764 million, reflecting 0.3% gain from the year-ago quarter.However, the company’s higher SG&A expenses, along with a soft margin trend, are likely to continue hurting results in the fiscal fourth quarter. It expects gross margin to be flat to up slightly in the to-be-reported quarter. Further, the company expects SG&A expenses to increase in the low-teens range, driven by continued investments in digital and NIKE+ membership.While soft margins and higher S&A expenses pose concerns for the short term, the above-mentioned strategies clearly profess that NIKE has significant growth potential in the days ahead.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not show that NIKE is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.NIKE has an Earnings ESP of -0.26% and a Zacks Rank #3. Although the stock’s Zacks Rank increases the predictive power of ESP, its negative ESP makes earnings prediction difficult.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.57% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Aaron’s Inc. (AAN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +10.66% and a Zacks Rank #3.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.16% and a Zacks Rank #3.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1830,KO,"As the countdown has begun for the FIFA World Cup, to be held in Russia starting Jun 14, football is now set to take center stage for a month. Apart from sports lovers, the event also means big for the business world. So, we have a game plan for investors who want to cash in on the mania.ConsumerThe list of FIFA partners and sponsors includes big consumer stocks like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and McDonald's MCD. As a result, consumer ETFs like Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (FSTA) and Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC) will benefit from their considerable exposure to KO.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY  -  Free Report) also come under the spotlight owing to their exposure to MCD.Media & TelecomAs followers of the event will stay tuned on television and newspaper, media stocks should profit out of the event. Twenty-First Century FoxInc.'s FOXA Fox Sports is the official broadcaster, while Telemundo, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will be airing the matches in some South American countries.So, investors can definitely take a look at media ETFs like Invesco Dynamic Media ETF (PBS  -  Free Report)) and iShares Evolved U.S. Media and Entertainment ETF(IEME) (read: Comcast Might Thwart Disney-Fox Deal: Media ETFs in Focus).Internet & Social MediaMore than television, social media rules any event these days. And if the event is as high profile as FIFA World Cup, social media stocks like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) are sure to gain. Needless to say, the pure-play social media ETF Global X Social Media Index ETF (SOCL  -  Free Report) has every reason to do well ahead.Also, extreme usage of search engines to gain information on the World Cup will veer investors’ attention to Internet ETFs like First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (FDN  -  Free Report) and Invesco NASDAQ Internet ETF (PNQI  -  Free Report) (read: Social Media ETFs to Gain as Twitter Prepares for S&P 500).TourismDemand for hotels, airlines, food and drinks will invariably be high, keeping tourism and entertainment stocks steady. Per the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, foreigners will shell out around $1.6 billion in the upcoming FIFA World Cup.As a result, airlines stocks and the ETF US Global Jets ETF (JETS) should gain some traction on higher passenger load factor. Several hotel stocks including Marriott International Inc. MAR and Hyatt Hotels Corporation H will likely benefit from this global multi-sport event.While fine-dining restaurants are likely to lose, takeaway restaurants are sure to score high as fans won’t want to miss out on a moment of the match. Pizza joints like Domino’s Pizza DPZ should benefit from higher takeaway sales. Investors can thus bet on Invesco Dynamic Leisure and Entertainment ETF (PEJ  -  Free Report) to gain exposure to a full array of leisure stocks(read: 4 ETF Ideas to Follow Millennials' Lifestyle).Russia Stocks and ETFsThe Russian economy should get a boost in the form of more temporary job creation, higher demand for consumer products and services and increased investments in infrastructure. Russia’s deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich expects the tournament to feed in about $30 billion to the economy, much higher the $11 billion of the cost incurred.Though the gain is minimal compared with the size of the economy, a short-term pickup is anticipated. So, investors can take a look at VanEck Vectors Russia ETFRSX and iShares MSCI Russia ETF ERUS for some gains (read: 4 Country ETFs That Should be Beneficiaries of $70 Oil).        Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week. Get it free >>

1831,KO,"For investors seeking momentum, Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) is probably on radar now. The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up roughly 8% from its 52-week low price of $48.76/share.But are more gains in store for this ETF? Let’s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed:XLP in FocusXLP focuses on the consumer staples segment of the U.S. market. The fund has a large-cap focus with key holdings in the beverages, household products, food & staples retailing and food products segments. XLP charges investors 13 basis points a year in fees and has top holdings in Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) (see: all the Consumer Staples ETFs here).Why the Move?The consumer staples sector has been an area to watch lately given the risk-off sentiments. The bitter exchange of tit-for-tat tariff threats has sparked fears of global recession, thereby raising the appeal for consumer staples stocks. This is because the sector generally acts as a safe haven amid political and economic turmoil. Stocks in these sectors generally outperform during periods of low growth and high uncertainty.More Gains Ahead?Currently, XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #5 (Strong Sell) with a Medium risk outlook, suggesting that outperformance could stall in the months ahead. However, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank, so there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1832,KO,"U.S. stock markets continues their winning streak for the fourth straight session as all three major indexes ended up in positive territory on Tuesday. Investors have pinned high hopes on second-quarter 2018 earnings resulting in evaporation of trade war concerns at least for the time being. A robust U.S. economy also boosted investor’s confidence on equities. Boyed by these positives, the S&P 500 recorded its highest closing in more than five months.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) closed at 24,919.66, increasing 0.6% or 143.07 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) up 0.4% to close at 2,793.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 7,759.20, gaining 3 points.

Total earnings of the S&P 500 index is expected to be up 19% from the same period last year backed by 8.2% year-over-year growth in revenues. A big driver of these positive revisions is obviously the direct impact of the tax cuts. (Read More: What's Keeping Bank Stocks Down?)Beverage and soft drinks behemoth PepsiCo Inc.

1833,KO,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is nearing its climax, with the final set to kick off this Sunday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). And although the final matchup isn’t set and the victorious nation has not hoisted the trophy, Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) already beat its rival Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) at the World Cup.When the tournament began on June 14, Adidas held the early lead over Nike. Not only is the German sportswear giant one of just seven official FIFA partners along with Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways, the company also edged out Nike in terms of total team sponsorships.JerseysAdidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970, and will be the official ball of the world’s biggest sporting even until at least 2030. The company also sponsored 12 of the 32 teams at this year’s tournament, including three favorites Germany, Spain, and Argentina. But, Germany didn’t make it out of the group stage and Spain and Argentina were eliminated in the round of 16.Oregon-based Nike spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. Since then, Nike has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world. Nike began the 2018 World Cup with 10 teams sporting its iconic swoosh, including Brazil.More importantly, three out of the four teams that made it to the semi-finals of the World Cup were Nike teams. Furthermore, France defeated Belgium, the lone Adidas team, in the first semi-final game Tuesday. Now, even before England play Croatia on Wednesday in the second semi-final, the World Cup winners are guaranteed to be wearing Nike—all of whom are currently on the front page of Nike’s website.This is great exposure for Nike, especially since Adidas pays millions to be an official FIFA partner, which according to The Telegraph costs between $25 million and $50 million annually.Stars Although the three most famous soccer stars on the planet, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar, are all out of the World Cup, there are certainly some big names left.Adidas’ only remaining star is France’s Paul Pogba, who sports a Nike kit for France. The third biggest team sponsor, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list, was Puma. The German sportswear company’s biggest individual star, Antoine Griezmann also happens to play for France (also listen to: A Sportswear Industry Overview Amid Puma's Basketball Push).Meanwhile, two of Nike’s rising soccer stars are England’s Harry Kane and Kylian Mbappe of France, both also play for Nike-sponsored club teams. Nike tweeted from its main Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account for the first time in a month to congratulate Mbappe on Tuesday.Nike noted that Kane’s Tottenham and the World Cup were two of the big places the company spent money. “Fourth quarter demand creation increased 25% primarily driven by investments in new sports marketing assets such as Chelsea, Tottenham and the NBA, brand marketing around key global sporting events such as the NBA Finals and the World Cup,” CFO Andy Campion said on Nike’s recent quarterly earnings call.Bottom LineSome people might say that sports sponsorships don’t matter, and maybe they are less quantifiable to Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) or McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), which are official 2018 World Cup sponsors. But for sportswear companies such as Nike, they are important, especially since the company is actively expanding its reach in the sport. Investors should also note that Nike’s overall soccer revenues climbed 8% to $2.15 billion during its recently completed fiscal year, trailing only sportswear and basketball in terms of growth.The World Cup also offers the chance to reach billions of people around the world, as well as across social media channels such as Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) in highlights that will live for years to come. The 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil reached 3.2 billion people total, with one billion reportedly tuned into the final. And while Americans might not love the sport, 60% of Nike’s revenues come from outside of its domestic market.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1834,KO,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2018 results, wherein earnings topped estimates while sales lagged. Notably, this marked the ninth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise.

The foreign exchange translation had a positive impact of 1 percentage point on reported EPS.SalesNet revenues of $16,090 million increased 2.4% from the year-ago level. Foreign exchange (Fx) had 1 percentage point positive impact on revenue growth. However, reported revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $16,125 million.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.6% on an organic basis, primarily driven by strength in the majority of the company’s businesses, particularly international divisions that gained from persistent growth in emerging and developing markets. Among these, Latin America; Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA); Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA); and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments reported organic revenue growth in the second quarter.Total volume grew 1% in the reported quarter, unchanged from the previous quarter.

1835,KO,"Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  and Keurig Green Mountain have announced the board of directors of the new company — Keurig Dr Pepper — after the shareholders of Dr Pepper unanimously voted in favor of the merger deal on Jun 29. With other necessary regulatory approvals for the deal already obtained in the United States and Canada, the companies are on track to close the transaction on Jul 9. Moreover, on Jul 10, Keurig Dr Pepper will start trading on the New York Stock Exchange, under the new ticker symbol — “KDP”.The board will include 12 members, working under the leadership of CEO Bob Gamgort. The board members will work together to make KDP a leading beverage company, delivering upon substantial value creation opportunities.This merger announcement dates back to January 2018 when the leading coffee maker, Keurig Green Mountain, Inc., agreed to buy Dr Pepper Snapple. Under the terms of the deal, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $103.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders will retain 13% ownership of the combined entity while Keurig shareholders will own 87%.Previously, it was revealed that European investment fund JAB Holding will make a $9-billion equity investment to finance the transaction. Also, Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report), JAB Holding's partner in Keurig, was about to have 13-14% stake in the merged entity.The combined company, Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021. This will make it the seventh-largest company in the U.S. food and beverage sector, and the third-largest non-alcoholic beverage company. The company’s portfolio will contain a number of iconic brands, including Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W, Mott’s, Canada Dry and Clamato, among others. The merged entity is likely to gain from Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network while Keurig's online presence will boost sales through digital platforms like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). In fact, analysts are of opinion that the combined company can pose tough competition to beverage giants, including The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).We note that Dr Pepper Snapple has been witnessing weak volumes of carbonated beverages, including the diet versions, owing to CSD category headwinds. Further, cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness among consumers are hurting CSD category growth. Moreover, new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. Consequently, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Dr Pepper increased 1.4% yesterday. Moreover, the stock has gained 4.5% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 1.7%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1836,KO,"Pre-market futures are once again in the red this morning, in a holiday-shortened week that will be cleaved in half with Wednesday’s observance of Independence Day, when the U.S. shook off control of a hostile foreign power following passage of the most egalitarian governmental policy document in the history of the world, July 4, 1776 — a mere 242 years ago; a blink in the history of time.We “celebrate” the week of the 4th of July, not to mention the first trading day of the second half of the calendar year, re-stoking the fires of a global trade war, with President Trump over the weekend calling the European Union (EU) “worse than China” on trade with the U.S., and threatening a 20% tariff on imported foreign cars from Europe. This would effect companies like Daimler AG, which owns the Mercedes brand of vehicles. The EU, in return, has earmarked a total of $294 billion in U.S. goods imported to Europe if Trump goes after car imports.We’ve already seen how threats to EU imports have impacted companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) and Kentucky bourbon distributor Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report). This morning, Zacks Stock Strategist David Borun contemplates which corporate domino might be next to fall amid our current trade friction scenario: Harley-Davidson Reacts to EU Tariffs; Who’s Next?For Canada’s part, our neighbor to the north’s retaliatory measures are even more specific: while the country looks to charge 25% on imported U.S. steel and iron, a further 10% tax would be levied on consumer goods from tomato ketchup to coffee beans to dishwasher soap, totaling $12.6 billion in goods, total. This would have a negative effect on companies like Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).Mexico has just elected a new president, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO), so it remains to be seen how new leadership in the country will deal with Trump’s new trade tactics. Reportedly, the country has already targeted U.S. imports on items like Florida orange juice such as Minute Maid, owned by The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).June PMI ManufacturingWe see some key manufacturing data for the month of June this morning after the opening bell: Project Management Institute (PMI) and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) results. The Markit Manufacturing PMI's previous month reported 54.6. ISM reports new results around 10am ET, along with new Construction spending for May. ISM is expected to come in at 58.3% for June following the 58.7% previously, whereas construction looks for break-even results after a +1.8% headline read in the prior month.

1837,KO,"Investors in The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jun 15, 2018 $29.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Coca-Cola Company shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Coca-Cola Company is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Beverages - Soft drinks industry that ranks in the Bottom 5% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while seven analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 63 cents per share to 61 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Coca-Cola Company right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

1838,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, is witnessing mixed sentiments as investors are concerned about its dismal surprise history while its strategic initiatives reflect potential. The dismal top- and bottom-line performances in recent quarters have led shares of this bottler for Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) to decline significantly in the last three months. This has also led to a downward trend in estimates.The stock declined 9.3% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s fall of 4.3%. Additionally, the company has declined 7.6% since reporting dismal first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.FEMSA posted lower-than-expected earnings and sales for first-quarter 2018. With this, the company reported a negative earnings surprise in six of the trailing seven quarters. Revenues lagged estimates in four of the last five quarters. The unfavorable result can be attributed to the negative foreign exchange rate as the higher U.S. dollar-denominated cash position at FEMSA was impacted by rise in Mexican peso.Estimates Trend DownThe dismal past performances have weighed on analysts’ view for the stock, as evident from the downtrend in its earnings estimates. In the last 30 days, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents and $4.42 for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as fiscal 2019 moved down by 2 cents and 5 cents, respectively. However, the company’s earnings estimate for fiscal 2018 of $4.02 per share has been stable during the same period.Strategies Supporting FEMSA’s GrowthWhile the downside story looks convincing, we remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures, which include increasing store count, diversifying its business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. FEMSA has been taking prudent steps to diversify its product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bodes well for future operating performance. Moreover, the company’s focus on achieving growth via acquisitions bode well.We believe, its drugstore operations also possess significant growth potential. Furthermore, its exposure to various industries — including beverage, beer and retail — gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. The company gets its exposure in the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF  -  Free Report) while the exposure to the beer industry relates to its 14.76% stake in Heineken (HEINY  -  Free Report).Bottom LineFEMSA is oscillating between long-term positives and near-term hurdles. On that note, we would suggest holding on to the stock for the long term. Rightly, FEMSA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1839,KO,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report), with 32 nations set to compete in a 64-match tournament over the next month. Billions of people from over 200 countries are expected to watch, which means, for many, the stars are likely the main attraction. And there are few more well-known and revered athletes—or people—in the world than Lionel Messi. This means the Argentinian superstar makes a lot of money off the field, so let’s take a look at how to invest in one of soccer’s biggest stars.The World Cup is a big-budget marketing dream, attracting the likes of Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and many more to spend millions of dollars to promote and attach their brands to FIFA. Meanwhile, Messi himself is linked to one of the World Cup’s biggest partners and other powerhouse companies.Sponsors Messi made his debut for FC Barcelona—one of the richest and most famous clubs in the world—in 2004. The 5-foot-7 inch soccer giant made his first appearance for Argentina in 2005 and played in his first World Cup the following year in Germany. Since then, he has transformed into one of the best soccer players ever and a major brand ambassador. The German sportswear powerhouse Adidas signed Messi to a contract in 2006. Today, he is one of the faces of the brand and signed a “lifetime” deal with Adidas last year—similar to Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) deal with LeBron James. Messi’s Adidas deal helps contribute to the $27 million in sponsorship money he made over the last year. These off-the-field earnings lifted Messi’s overall earnings to $111 million—boosted by his massive new Barcelona contract—landing him second on Forbes’ list of the world’s highest-paid athletes.Messi is an Adidas man, but he also generates millions of dollars for rival Nike because Barcelona is sponsored by the Oregon-based company. In fact, Messi reportedly generated $111 million in value for Nike over the past 12 months through social media—with rival and Nike star Cristiano Ronaldo doing the same thing for Adidas since his club side, Real Madrid, is sponsored by Adidas. A post shared by Leo Messi (@leomessi) on May 30, 2018 at 12:02pm PDTCleary, investors will note just how impactful one of Messi’s sponsored Adidas posts can be on Instagram, where he boasts 93 million followers—among the most on the platform. He also has over 88 million Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) followers, and his own dedicated YouTube (GOOGL  -  Free Report) page—he notably does not have a Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) account.His social media reach helped him land the number three spot on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list, behind only Ronaldo and James. This is also part of the reason why he is a valuable partner to a slew of other companies aside from Adidas.The 30-year-old is also a pitchman for Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), through Gatorade, Lays, and Pepsi, as well as wireless company Ooredoo, and many more. So now let’s take a look to see how the companies Messi is directly involved with have performed since the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, where Messi and Argentina lost in the final to Germany. Clearly, Adidas stock has surged over the last four years. Meanwhile, Mastercard stock is up big since the last World Cup, while Pepsi has trailed the S&P 500, as consumers’ eating and drinking habits rapidly shift.Messi is one of a few players who is able to have an outsized impact on his team and his brand partners.In Russia, Argentina is once again one of the favorites to win the World Cup. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates and to see what impact Messi might have on Fox’s and Telemundo’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1840,KO,"An increasing number of Americans are becoming health conscious. This has resulted in steady growth in sales volume of bottled water, making it the number one preferred beverage in the United States in 2017, according to a recent release from International Bottled Water Association (""IBWA"") and Beverage Market Corporation (""BMC"").Understandably, Americans are refraining from carbonated and sugary drinks. According to analysts, the bottled water market is expected to grow further in the days to come. This has made carbonated soft drink (CSD) manufacturers shift focus toward bottled water and other healthier options.Bottled Water Becomes the Number One BeverageBottled water has become the highest selling beverage in the United States for two years in a row. According to IBWA and BMC, bottled water volumes escalated to 13.7 billion in 2017, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase. Bottled water sales came in at $18.5 billion, increasing 8.8% year over year.Per capita consumption of bottled water exceeded 42 gallons, increasing 6.2% over the same time period. It goes without saying that the gap between carbonated drinks and bottled water is fast widening.Bottled Water Market to GrowThe sparkling water category grew 70% between 2011 and 2016 and is expected to touch $3.1 billion by 2022, according to Euromonitor. Per BMC, per capita consumption of bottled water will cross 50 gallons in the next few years. Interestingly, all segments under the bottled water category witnessed robust growth in 2017. Domestic sparkling water surged 27.5%, while domestic non-sparkling and imported water jumped 5.5% and 9.2%, respectively.Moreover, according to IBWA, three out of five Americans prefer bottled water to any other beverage. Also, according to a recent Nielsen data, sales of bottled water, flavored water and energy drinks have jumped in the four weeks to May 19. During this period, PepsiCo’s share of sparkling water category grew 4.7%, up from 0.6% growth in January. Also, Dr Pepper Snapple’s shelf-stable juices and drinks witnessed sales growth of 13.1%.Industry Shifts Focus Toward Bottled Water, Healthier OptionsAccording to Nielsen’s latest data, sales growth of energy drinks, still flavored water, sparkling flavored water and bottled water grew 7%, 10.9% and 17.7% and 7.1%, respectively, in the four weeks to May 19, on a year-over-year basis.Given that more Americans prefer bottled water to other soft carbonated beverages, CSD manufacturers like the Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Nestle S.A. (NSRGY  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) too are redesigning their portfolio along these lines. Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coca-Cola recently introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. Moreover, the company has promised to reduce the sugar-level in most of its products. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017. In February, Pepsico launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. A few months ago, Nestle announced that it will be rebranding its Nestle Waters’ Regional Spring Water Sparkling portfolio. The new portfolio will comprise 10 new flavors, design changes in bottles and a new can format.Bottom LineUndoubtedly, Americans’ growing health-consciousness has led to a surge in sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages. Moreover, the bottled water market is poised to grow further in over the next few years. This has made beverage companies reorient their business strategy and redesign their portfolio with increased focus on bottled water.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1841,KO,"Welcome to the latest episode of the of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. With the 2018 FIFA World Cup underway, Ben Rains dives into why it is so important that the 2026 World Cup is coming to North America. Rains then discusses all of the latest happenings in the sports betting world, as more companies get in on the action.The U.S. didn’t make the World Cup for the first time since 1986, which will likely impact Fox’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) coverage this summer. However, the company also holds the rights to the 2022 and 2026 World Cups, along with Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The 2026 bid was a little shady and upset the likes of ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and others—helping FIFA live up to its somewhat poor reputation.But with the United States set to host 60 games in 2026—many of which are likely to be in primetime—in what will be the first 48-team World Cup, Fox and Telemundo look to be the clear winners. More matches, more teams, and primetime games will likely attract many more companies on top of the major players Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY, and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report).Moving onto sports betting, a small soccer related partnership between William Hill WIMHY and Las Vegas Lights FC, of the United Soccer League USL, will see the betting company become the soccer team’s official sports book. The deal will allow fans to make live in-game bets through William Hill’s mobile app—partnerships like this are sure to become more commonplace as legalized sports betting becomes more popular.Sports gambling is now up and running in Delaware and New Jersey. Daily fantasy giant DraftKings has already applied for a sports betting license in New Jersey, which could kick off a wave of established companies, including Wynn (WYNN  -  Free Report) and MGM (MGM  -  Free Report), rolling out sports betting locations and platforms throughout the country.Meanwhile, investors should pay attention to tech companies, like Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Sony (SNE  -  Free Report), and even Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), to see if they utilize their infrastructure to get in on the massive mobile sports betting scene. It will also be worth keeping an eye out for any sports betting acquisitions, as startups are sure to pop up. As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1842,KO,"Monday, July 2, 2018Pre-market futures are once again in the red this morning, in a holiday-shortened week that will be cleaved in half with Wednesday’s observance of Independence Day, when the U.S. shook off control of a hostile foreign power following passage of the most egalitarian governmental policy document in the history of the world, July 4, 1776 — a mere 242 years ago; a blink in the history of time.We “celebrate” the week of the 4th of July, not to mention the first trading day of the second half of the calendar year, re-stoking the fires of a global trade war, with President Trump over the weekend calling the European Union (EU) “worse than China” on trade with the U.S., and threatening a 20% tariff on imported foreign cars from Europe. This would effect companies like Daimler AG, which owns the Mercedes brand of vehicles. The EU, in return, has earmarked a total of $294 billion in U.S. goods imported to Europe if Trump goes after car imports.We’ve already seen how threats to EU imports have impacted companies like Harley-Davidson (HOG  -  Free Report) and Kentucky bourbon distributor Brown-Forman (BF.B  -  Free Report). This morning, Zacks Stock Strategist David Borun contemplates which corporate domino might be next to fall amid our current trade friction scenario: Harley-Davidson Reacts to EU Tariffs; Who’s Next?For Canada’s part, our neighbor to the north’s retaliatory measures are even more specific: while the country looks to charge 25% on imported U.S. steel and iron, a further 10% tax would be levied on consumer goods from tomato ketchup to coffee beans to dishwasher soap, totaling $12.6 billion in goods, total. This would have a negative effect on companies like Colgate-Palmolive (CL  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report).Mexico has just elected a new president, leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador (known as AMLO), so it remains to be seen how new leadership in the country will deal with Trump’s new trade tactics. Reportedly, the country has already targeted U.S. imports on items like Florida orange juice such as Minute Maid, owned by The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).June PMI ManufacturingWe see some key manufacturing data for the month of June this morning after the opening bell: Project Management Institute (PMI) and Institute for Supply Management (ISM) results. The Markit Manufacturing PMI's previous month reported 54.6. ISM reports new results around 10am ET, along with new Construction spending for May. ISM is expected to come in at 58.3% for June following the 58.7% previously, whereas construction looks for break-even results after a +1.8% headline read in the prior month.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1843,KO,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research where Associate Stock Strategist Ben Rains dives into the potential future of Gatorade rival BodyArmor, before he discusses why fast-fashion giant Uniqlo decided to spend $300 million to lure Roger Federer away from Nike (NKE  -  Free Report). The episode then ends with a fun and quick dive into the world of publicly traded soccer teams amid all the Cristiano Ronaldo transfer speculation.Sports drink upstart BodyArmor was launched in 2011 by Mike Repole, who sold Vitaminwater to Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for $4.1 billion back in 2007. Today the company has gathered a slew of young stars, including James Harden, to pitch BodyArmor’s “healthier” sports drink in an attempt to try to shake up a market dominated by Pepsico’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s Powerade.There is speculation that BodyArmor, which expects to see its sales hit $400 million next year, could get purchased. Dr. Pepper Snapple Group  currently holds a roughly 15% equity stake in the company and has carried BodyArmor as an allied brand since 2013. However, with Keurig's $18.7 billion deal to buy DPS set to close on Monday, July 9—the merged company is expected to trade under the ticker KDP starting on Tuesday, July 10—BodyArmor’s future is more uncertain.One Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) analyst suggested that there is a good chance that Keurig Dr. Pepper will move on from its current minority stakes. The thought is that the relatively stagnant Coca-Cola might jump in and scoop up BodyArmor amid the quickly changing beverage market.The episode then shifts to why Japanese fast-fashion brand Uniqlo—which is owned by Tokyo conglomerate Fast Retailing —signed Swiss tennis star Roger Federer to a 10-year, $300 million deal. Uniqlo wants to try to capitalize on the current sportswear and athleisure push, popularized by Nike, Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Lululemon (LULU  -  Free Report), and others. And although he might not be very famous in the U.S., ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) recently named Federer the 5th most famous athlete on the planet.Full-Court Finance closes with a look at the world of publicly traded soccer teams, after shares of Juventus JVTSF—a massively popular team based in Turin, Italy—skyrocketed in recent days on the back of speculation that Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo might be headed to the club almost a decade after he left another publicly traded soccer powerhouse, Manchester United plc (MANU  -  Free Report).As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

1844,KO,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). The month-long tournament is expected to attract billions of viewers from over 200 countries, making it a marketing dream. The likes of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report) will all be heavily featured, but Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) are the only companies competing against each other. So let’s take a look to see which sportswear company seems poised to come out on top at the 2018 World Cup.According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor. German giant Adidas has been a FIFA partner since 1970. The company also signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030.Therefore, right off the bat, Adidas might get more overall shine with their classic “three stripes” logo plastered on in-stadium signage, official game balls, and more. But this is just the start.JerseysNike has spent heavily to become a soccer powerhouse around the world since the U.S. hosted the World Cup in 1994. The Oregon-based company has successfully infiltrated every level and nearly every league in the world, including Europe’s top five leagues. Adidas, which has been a soccer giant for decades, has cultivated and maintained similar relationships and sponsorship deals.Adidas sponsors 12 of the 32 national teams competing at this year’s World Cup. This list includes some of the favorites: Germany, Spain, and Argentina.Nike, in a move that reshaped soccer sponsorships, spent millions of dollar in 1996 to outfit the Brazilian national team. Brazil, who has won the most ever World Cups, with five, is also the top favorite this year. Overall, Nike’s Swoosh logo will appear on 10 different jerseys, including France.Although it is nearly neck and neck, the slight edge has to go to Adidas. (Side Note: Puma sponsors four teams, with Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) notably left off this list)Stars Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Lionel Messi (Argentina), and Neymar (Brazil) are three of the most famous people on the planet. The three soccer stars ranked number one, three, and four, respectively, on ESPN’s (DIS  -  Free Report) World Fame 100 list. They also all landed in the top five of Forbes’ highest paid athletes rankings. Ronaldo boasts over 202 million followers on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report) and Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) combined, with the other two resting closely behind.Ronaldo has been with Nike since 2003, while Messi signed with Adidas in 2006—both players are currently on “lifetime” deals with their sportswear companies. Neymar tips the balance slightly in Nike’s favor, with the Brazilian superstar currently under a massive, incentive-laden contract with the American company.Cleats/BootsWith the team sponsorships and some of the biggest stars covered, let’s take a look at what a majority of the players will be wearing on their feet. ESPN ranked their top 50 players at the World Cup and also recently highlighted what boots they will wear when they take the field. The publication noted that 49 of their 50 best players in Russia will sport Nike, Adidas, or Puma—with New Balance as the one outlier.Nike takes the top spot here, with 26 of the 50 set to play in Nike cleats, while Adidas claims 20. However, Adidas noted that 60% of all the players will be wearing Adidas footwear at the World Cup. With that said, the slight edge still has to go to Nike.Stock Performance With the fight between Nike and Adidas still a little too close to call, let’s dive into their stock price performance to help determine a winner.Clearly, Adidas stock has crushed Nike since the end of the 2014 World Cup. Therefore, coupled with its slight edge in the jersey department, and its standing as an official FIFA partner, Adidas appears to be the winner in the 2018 sportswear World Cup.But, this could change depending on how individual players and teams perform on the world’s biggest stage. So make sure to come back to Zacks for more World Cup business updates.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

This week, Ben Rains dives into everything that investors and casual fans need to know about the world’s biggest sporting event before it kicks off in Russia on Thursday.The first game of the World Cup between Russia and Saudi Arabia starts at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday. The match begins a 64-game tournament that will likely be watched by billions of people in more than 200 countries over the next month, culminating with the final on July 15.American soccer fans will be able to watch every game of the World Cup live on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) or FS1, with streaming available through multiple Fox apps as well as on services such as YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report). Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report), won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the U.S. for roughly $1 billion combined.Fox’s coverage will feature more games on network television than were aired during the last four World Cups combined—most of which were on ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report). However, none of these games will feature the U.S., who failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986, possibly hurting Fox’s coverage.Meanwhile, fans will be able to create their own highlight packages dating back to 1958, through a Fox platform, powered by IBM’s (IBM  -  Free Report) Watson AI technology. The BBC is set to broadcast all their matches live in virtual reality as well as in 4K Ultra HD.With that said, some of the most well-known companies in the world also spend upwards of $50 million a year to sponsor FIFA and the World Cup. This list includes the likes of Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Qatar Airways, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), and many more.Aside from Fox and some of the major World Cup sponsors, sportswear giants Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report) and Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) will take center stage in Russia.

The three men are not just a few of the most well-known soccer players, they are also some of the richest and most famous entertainers in the world. All three landed in the top five of Forbes’ recent highest paid athletes list and rank among the most followed accounts in the world on Instagram (FB  -  Free Report).Listen to the full episode to hear everything you might need to know about the 2018 FIFA World Cup, while also giving yourself a leg up on the soccer-based conversations that are likely to take place over the next month—and for years to come.As a reminder, if you feel that we missed something, or if you have any topic suggestions, shoot us an email at podcast@zacks.com.

Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.First-Quarter 2018 ResultsEarnings BeatFirst-quarter 2018 comparable earnings of the company were 47 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Earnings also improved 8% from the year-ago profit level of 43 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales BeatRevenues of $7.63 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion. However, net revenues declined 16% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly fall. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had 26% negative impact on revenues. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Organic revenues grew 5% in the quarter, aided by concentrate sales improvement of 4% and price/mix growth of 1%. Currency also impacted revenues positively by 2%.Volume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume grew 3% in the quarter versus flat growth in the preceding quarter.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 4% (versus no growth in the prior quarter). Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages witnessed 3% decline (versus 2% growth in the preceding quarter). Water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 1% (versus 2% in Q4), and Tea and Coffee were up 5% (compared with 2% growth in Q4).Notably, Diet Coke’s North America volume grew in the quarter following a full brand revamp. The introduction of four bold, new flavors, along with contemporary, sleek packaging and innovative marketing, helped in the upside.Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues grew 11% at North America, 13% at Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and 8% at the Latin America segment. However, revenues at Asia Pacific segment increased modestly by 1%.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 1% in North America, 8% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 6% in Latin America, 3% in Asia Pacific and 13% in Bottling Investments.Geographic AnalysisThe company has five operating segments – Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments.EMEA division registered revenues of $1.84 billion, up 13% year over year.Price/mix had a 1% negative impact on revenues as positive pricing in the marketplace was offset by negative geographic mix due to growth in emerging and developing markets outpacing developed markets. That said, currency and concentrate sales had a 7% and 9% positive impact on revenues, respectively. Unit case volume grew 4%, driven by strong performance in Turkey and South Africa, partially offset by declines in Nigeria and Western Europe. Organic revenues grew 8%.The Latin America segment registered revenues of $998 million, up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Price/mix growth was 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Organic revenues grew 6%.Unit case volume increased 1% as low to mid-single-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico was offset by decline in both Peru and Chile.The North America segment revenues totaled $2.68 billion, increasing 11% year over year. Organic revenues grew 1% in the quarter. Price/mix declined 1% in the quarter, as low single-digit underlying pricing was offset by the cycling of certain product launches, incremental freight costs and timing of the Easter holiday.Unit case volume grew 2% in the quarter. Sparkling soft drinks volume growth was 3%, which includes double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, along with positive performance in Diet Coke.Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages declined 2%. The downside was due to the decline in juice (mainly due to deprioritizing lower-margin juice drink brands and packaging re-sizing across the juice portfolio) that was offset by the growth in dairy and plant-based beverages. Tea and coffee grew 5% while water, enhanced water and sports drinks accelerated to 1% growth.The Asia-Pacific segment registered revenues of $1.22 billion, up 1% from the year-ago quarter. Organic revenues were up 3% in the quarter and price/mix was down 2%. Unit case volume growth was 5% in the quarter. Volume of the brand Coca-Cola in China grew more than 20% in the quarter. However, total China business was slightly less as the company de-emphasized low-value water in favor of building its broader consumer franchise and value proposition. Meanwhile, Southeast Asia volume declined in low single digits.Bottling Investments segment revenues decreased 73% (up 13% on an organic basis) to $1.1 billion as volumes declined 32% and structural headwinds impacted revenues by 90%.Price/mix growth of 2% in the quarter was driven by the strong performance in India.During the three months ended Mar 30, 2018, intersegment revenues were $149 million for Europe, Middle East & Africa, $19 million for Latin America, $55 million for North America and $106 million for Asia Pacific.MarginsComparable gross margin expanded 270 bps year over year to 64%. The company’s comparable operating margin grew 600 bps to 30.7% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. The upside was partly offset by adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.2018 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic revenues are expected to rise 4%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 17%, while Fx is likely to have a positive impact of 1% on revenues. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1-2% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Comparable currency income before income taxes (structurally adjusted) is expected to increase 8-9%. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable income before taxes by 0-1%. Structural changes are likely to have a 2% negative impact on it.The company expects adjusted EPS to grow 8-10% from the prior-year’s comparable EPS of $1.91.The company expects to buy back shares worth $1 billion in 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 21%. Cash from operations is likely to be at least $8.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions lower for the current quarter.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and Consensus Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and Consensus | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, KO has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a D.

1847,KO,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia kicks off Thursday without team USA for the first time since 1986, which is a huge disappointment for first time broadcast partner Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). But American soccer fans woke up Wednesday to news that North America won the rights to host the 2026 World Cup, beating out Morocco. Here is everything you need to know about the bid, its economic impact, and what companies stand to benefit. Hint: Fox is already celebrating.North America FIFA announced, in a 134 to 65 vote, to award the 2026 World Cup to the U.S., Canada, and Mexico’s joint bid. The reasons here are pretty simple: money. North America is expected generate $14 billion in revenue and $11 billion in profits for FIFA, which is huge for an organization that makes 90% of its money from the World Cup—Morocco reportedly couldn’t offer half of that figure. Soccer’s largest governing body was also under pressure after awarding the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to more controversial hosts, Russia and Qatar.The North American bid included 23 host city candidates, including three from Canada, three from Mexico, with the rest spread out throughout the U.S. Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York/New Jersey are the three cities vying for the rights to host the final.Under the current plan, the U.S. is set to host 60 matches, with Canada and Mexico each set to hold 10. If that number seems a little off to some soccer fans, it’s because the 2026 World Cup will see the world’s biggest sporting event expand its field for the first time to 48 teams up from 32, for a total of 80 matches—up from 64 under the current format.The North American bid noted that it expects the top six games, which would mean the opening games in all three countries, along with the two semifinals, and the final, to compare favorably to Super Bowl ticket sales as well as overall hospitality figures. The committee projects the overall economic impact will be roughly $5 billion, with $5.8 billion worth of ticket sales expected.Companies The clear winner of the 2026 World Cup bid is Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two broadcast powers won the U.S. television rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments for roughly $1 billion combined back in 2011. Then, somewhat quietly in 2015, FIFA awarded Fox and Telemundo the rights to the 2026 World Cup without opening up the bidding. The move sparked outrage from ESPN (DIS  -  Free Report) and other networks..@FOXSports President and COO Eric Shanks on North America winning the bid for #WorldCup 2026: ""It's a tremendous day, a lot of hard has paid off."" https://t.co/nbcpI3ZFCB pic.twitter.com/ysVfKbOTrR— FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) June 13, 2018Fox reportedly only paid 10% more than in its current $425 million contract. On its face, this was a somewhat crazy move because Fox had not even broadcast its first World Cup game at the time, and no one knew what country would host the 2026 tournament. Diving a little deeper, the answer is somewhat clear. FIFA didn’t want any legal trouble from Fox, since, in a shocking move, the 2022 World Cup in Qatar will be hosted in the fall or winter due to heat concerns, which directly conflicts with the NFL season and other programming.Fox and Telemundo now own the rights to the world’s biggest sporting event on home soil. And this means live games in primetime, which is a trully amazing opportunity that likely has Fox, Telemundo, and FIFA’s marketing partners giddy. In a media landscape driven more and more by the Netflix’s (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) of the world, a month of adverting live in primetime is almost invaluable. Current FIFA and World Cup sponsors, which spend upwards of $50 million a year, include Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa V, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), Adidas ADDYY and more. With that said, major U.S.-based companies now have even more incentive to get in on the World Cup.Aside from big opportunities for staples like Nike NKE, it could be a chance for Under Armour UAA to break into the World Cup scene via a team-based sponsorship, while everyone from YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report) to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) and other tech companies could work their way in somehow. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and other giants are current official sponsors of U.S. Soccer. Bottom Line Soccer has been the supposed sport of the future in the U.S. since it hosted the 1994 World Cup. Today, the world’s most popular sport sits just behind baseball and basketball as Americans’ favorite sport, according to a Gallup poll (basketball was favored by 11%, with baseball at 9%).Meanwhile, soccer jumped up to 7%—its highest spot ever on the annual poll. And a lot can change in eight years, especially as money pours into the MLS and the NFL’s ratings decline.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1848,KO,"If you are an avid investor, you must also be a diehard fan of the Oracle of Omaha. Warren Buffet has consistently beaten the markets for decades by accumulating positions in some of the world’s sought-after companies. These companies have reliable business models that have stood the test of time, while they also generate plenty of cash and provide dividends, which are indicators of a strong and sustainable business.Thus, let us focus on Buffet’s favorite companies that are likely to make the most of the first-quarter earnings season. Such companies are positioned to report upbeat earnings results, which could eventually lead to an uptick in share price. But before we do so, let us look at his top stock holdings from his darling sectors:Financials Scoops Up Top SpotBuffett has huge stakes in several financial stocks. He has, particularly, liked American Express since the 1960s. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B  -  Free Report) holds around 151.6 million shares of the credit card giant, valued at $15 billion. When it comes to banks, Berkshire has a sizeable position in Bank of America, which is nearly $20.4 billion. Buffett’s second-largest holding is America’s second most profitable bank, Wells Fargo & Company (WFC  -  Free Report). Berkshire holds 452.8 million shares of Wells Fargo, which indicates that Buffett is quite optimistic about the current financial environment.A recent move by the Fed to raise rates bodes well for banks. Needless to say, ultra-low interest rates have weighed on their margins in the last decade. But, this time around, higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities (read more: Banks Set for Blockbuster Q1 Earnings: 5 Top Picks).Consumer Goods Comes SecondBuffett has a sizeable position in consumer stocks like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Kraft Heinz. Coca-Cola is much trusted as Buffet has assured that he will never sell shares in the renowned beverage company. Berkshire held around 400 million shares of Coca-Cola, making it the company’s fourth-largest holding. Kraft Heinz is another consumer staples firm where Buffett and his company has 325.6 million shares, worth $25.3 billion.Consumer staples seems to be the safest option at a time when markets are plagued with widespread uncertainty. Trump talk of Syria bombing, unabated trade tensions, high profile departures in the Trump administration and midterm election year spell a rough phase for stocks. Staples, on the other hand, is generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the state of the larger market.Tech Takes Third SpotThe Trump administration’s initiative to cut tax rates, in the meantime, has already provided the much-needed windfall to computer and software makers. Any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%, per the latest tax law.The lowering of the tax rate will encourage big tech companies to bring back funds held overseas. This in turn will let these companies carry out share buybacks, pay dividends, and engage in M&A activities. Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) will make the most of the positive tax overhaul initiative by repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars in cash. It is also the most valuable holding in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio.Industrials & Airlines in FocusBuffett has the fourth-largest stake in the Industrials sector. And why not? Improving global economies and firm business investment helped factories expand at a record pace. Manufacturers are also on a hiring spree and are paying more than other jobs, reflecting sustained strength in the sector.But, Buffet has started to show keen interest in airlines which he earlier used to steer clear of. He believes that planes being more efficient and relationships between unions being better will certainly help airlines fly high. Buffett holds several airlines, but, Southwest Airlines is the most valuable.3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Consider in Q1 EarningsAs mentioned above, American business magnate Warren Buffet’s preferred sectors are poised to gain in the near term. But, not all of his choices from the aforesaid sectors will report a significant uptick in Q1 earnings.We have, thus, figured out three of his top stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP. This is our proprietary methodology for determining stocks that have the best chance to surprise with their next earnings announcement. It provides the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Moody's Corporation (MCO  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett particularly likes Moody’s as the company continues to post strong numbers, so there’s some real money-making potential there. The company, in the most recent quarter, declared an operating income of $462.8 million.The company is expected to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on Apr 27. Moody's has an Earnings ESP of +0.85%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.9%, better than the industry’s estimated growth of 21.4%.Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of credit ratings, research, and analysis covering debt instruments and securities in the global capital markets.Buffett favors Mastercard as an increasing number of customers are switching to cashless payments, as it is preferred by most businessmen.The company is likely to report earnings results for the quarter ending in March on May 2. Mastercard has an Earnings ESP of +2.39%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 29.7%, well ahead of the industry’s projected growth of 15%.Visa Inc (V  -  Free Report) is a payments technology company that connects consumers, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, strategic partners and government entities to electronic payments.Buffett likes Visa as the company has the same competitive advantages and business qualities that Mastercard possesses.Visa is expected to report earnings results for the March quarter on Apr 25. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.25%. The company’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 26.2%, above the industry’s projected growth of 15%.

But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1849,KO,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup kicks off this week in Russia. As 32 teams fight it out for the coveted trophy over a period of one month, FIFA will be banking on its sponsors for the much-needed stimulus after a poor financial showing for two consecutive years.Goes without saying, FIFA World Cup will turn out to be biggest playground for both FIFA and the tournament’s sponsors for helping each other make the most of opportunity. And it’s not only the event’s sponsors but also a number of others brands that are set to gain from this global extravaganza.Sponsors Ready for the Flag Off The warmup to the finals is already underway with every sponsor designing ads around the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Barring a few, FIFA has managed to rope in most of its long-time partners for this year’s tournament. The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Adidas AG (ADDYY  -  Free Report), VISA Inc. (V  -  Free Report), Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) continue to be FIFA’s loyal sponsors.In 2016, FIFA incurred a loss of $368 million, followed by a loss of $192 million in 2017. This does not however take anything away from the spectacle and FIFA is hugely anticipating profits this year. According to marketing agency, Zenith, this edition of the world cup will add $2.4 billion to the global advertisement market.Expectedly, sponsors are not hesitating to shell out generously on making their brands visible over the next 30 days. Coca-Cola has spent more than two years in designing its Being Ready campaign. Visa is banking on the popularity of Swedish soccer star Zlatan Ibrahimovic to promote its contactless payment cards. Visa has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Beer favorite Budwiser will be unveiling its biggest and most-expensive campaign ever during this year’s tournament. Adidas too has roped in a start-studded cast comprising sporting heroes, musicians and a host of pop icons for its Crete the Answer campaign.Sponsors to Gain From Brand VisibilitySponsors will be focusing on brand visibility with the aim of reaching out to more buyers. Given that world cup football is a summer affair, Coca-Cola will try to cash in on this opportunity. Adidas too has its hopes high, being the jersey and kit sponsor of 12 of the participating teams. Budwiser and McDonald’s are typically the food and beverage associated with any sporting event.According to Morgan Stanley, beer sales volume get a 2-3% boost in host countries. Moreover, Anheuser-Busch recently said that it expects annual sales volumes to increase between 0.5-1% in the finalists Brazil and Argentina.Similarly, Adidas, which introduces new balls every year, will be flaunting its latest brand Telstar 18 this time. Visa, on the other hand, will be stressing more on enhancing the overall football-watching experience. Visa account holders will be getting benefits of exclusive access to tickets via Visa-sponsored pre-sale events.From the Galleries    It’s not only that the FIFA World Cup sponsors stand to gain from the tournament. Those on the side bench too will get a chance to make their presence felt on the field. Nike, Inc. (NKE  -  Free Report) is the kit and jersey sponsor of 10 of the 32 participating countries including big names like Brazil, France and England. This will certainly give the company enough brand visibility.Carlsberg A/S (CABGY  -  Free Report) is the market leader in beers in Russia and will try to take this opportunity to score high this time. Another big winner will be the broadcasters. Twenty-First Century Fox, Inc.’s (FOXA  -  Free Report) Fox Sports is the official broadcaster, while Telemundo, owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will be airing the matches in South America.Besides, streaming media players too will play an important role in this year’s world cup. Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Amazon Fire TV and Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) Apple TV 4K are expected to attract a large number of viewers this year.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1850,KO,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been trying to gain traction through product launches, fortifying developing/emerging market presence, aggressive marketing, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives. However, higher input costs and dismal performance by its North America Beverages (""NAB"") division have been pressing problems.Efforts to Boost Sales Bode WellSales for beverage giant PepsiCo have remained subdued in the recent quarters, due to growing health and wellness consciousness. Consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. . Shares of PepsiCo have decreased 17% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Soft Beverages industry that has declined 12.3% over the same period.Nonetheless, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier options. Currently, a major portion of PepsiCo’s total net revenues comes from “Guilt-Free” products, more than half of which comes from the “Everyday Nutrition” category. This percentage is likely to increase, given the company’s stepped-up innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences. The better-for-you and good-for-you products have increased the percentage of the company’s total portfolio from 38% in 2006 to 50% in 2017. Retail sales of KeVita, PepsiCo’s line of premium organic probiotic beverages, grew 50% in the first quarter.PepsiCo is one of the top global positions in the non-alcoholic beverage and snack food industries, anchored by cherished brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, Tropicana, Lays, Doritos, and Quaker, among others. PepsiCo has broadened its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to decrease the dependence on colas; keeping in mind the slowdown in CSD volumes. PepsiCo’s non-carbonated beverage volume mix increased 7 percentage points since 2010.The company has been growing its value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water.Emerging/Developing Market Presence Drives GrowthLast month, the beverage giant reported first quarter of 2018 results, wherein core earnings increased 3% year over year on 4.3% revenue growth. The improvement was mainly attributable to the strong performances by its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in the developing and emerging markets.In the first quarter of 2018, the company registered 8% organic revenue growth in its developing and emerging markets as a group, reflecting acceleration from 6.5% improvement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017. Within Latin America, organic revenues grew 10% in Mexico, high teens in Brazil and 20% in Argentina in the quarter. Notably, in Asia, Middle East and North Africa or AMENA division, PepsiCo witnessed strong double-digit organic revenue growth in China, India, Egypt and Pakistan.The company has almost tripled its global footprint from 28 markets at the beginning of 2015 to 77 markets at present.Weak NAB Results are Cause of ConcernIn first-quarter 2018, the NAB division reported dismal results with revenues and operating profit decreasing 1% and 22%, respectively. Volumes declined 2.5%, owing to 4% decline in CSDs and 1% decrease in Non CSDs.The non-carbonated beverage volume decreased mainly due to low-single-digit declines in Gatorade sports drinks, and juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a low-single-digit increase in the overall water portfolio. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance.Operating profit was affected by operating cost inflation as well as higher raw material costs, and a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act.Higher Input Costs a WoeThe company has stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs. PepsiCo’s productivity program aims to deliver $1 billion in annual productivity savings.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s adjusted gross margin fell 75 basis points (bps) year over year in the last reported quarter. The downside was mainly due to higher input costs. PepsiCo’s arch rival, Coca-Cola also faced a significant rise in freight costs in its North America segment in the first quarter of 2018. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Meanwhile, PepsiCo expects its gross margin to remain under pressure in fiscal 2018 due to the higher input costs. The company has been undertaking various productivity initiatives to improve its margins. However, the favorable impact of productivity measures is expected to be offset by investments in PepsiCo’s growth initiatives.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1851,KO,"The U.S. beverage market grew in 2017 on robust sales of bottled water and carbonated soft drinks. According to a recent report by Beverage Digest, retail beverage sales surged $135.7 billion last year. However, an increasing number of consumers are refraining from sugary sodas and other carbonated beverages in favor of the healthier water, tea and other drinks.Keeping in mind the changing tastes and preferences of health-conscious consumers, beverage companies are redesigning their product portfolio and reorienting their business strategy.Beverage Sales Grow on Bottled Water, Carbonated Drinks U.S. beverage sales grew by $2.1 billion in 2017. Retail beverage sales grew around 3% last year, while volume jumped 2%, according to data and consulting firm Beverage Market Corporation. The growth was prompted primarily by strong sales of carbonated drinks and bottled water. Additionally, an increase in soda prices gave a boost to revenues in that category. Revenues from carbonated beverages came in at $81.6 billion, accounting for more than 50% of the year’s total revenues.However, an increasing number of Americans are opting for healthier variants, which saw a rise in sales of bottled water. Bottled water overtook carbonated soft drinks as the most-preferred beverage by volume in 2016, and continued its growth in 2017. Last year, bottled water accounted for $24.1 billion in sales.Industry Swings Toward Bottled WaterShifting preference for healthier drinks has seen the carbonated soft drink market shrinking for 13 consecutive years now. Carbonated soft drinks volume fell 1.6% in 2017 and is projected to decline between 0.8% and 1.3% this year.Almost all beverage companies like The Coca Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report), Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. , Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V (FMX  -  Free Report) and Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) are redesigning their portfolio along these lines.Coca Cola, PepsiCo, Dr Pepper Snapple and Fomento Economico Mexicano, each carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coke, Pepsi Trying to Look Healthier A number of prominent names are getting into acquisitions and partnerships as well as reorienting their strategies with the aim of building a healthier portfolio, which now holds the key to their survival.After an eight-year run of flat sales, Coca Cola’s Diet Coke finally bounced back. The company has introduced a range of flavors in smaller packages to its diet coke brand to attract new-generation drinkers. It has also introduced Coke Zero Sugar, revamping its Coke Zero, which now tastes more like the original Coke. The company also acquired the U.S. rights of Topo Chico, a premium sparkling mineral water brand in October 2017. This definitely seems to have worked wonders for Coca Cola, with the company reporting first-quarter revenues of $7.6 billion, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion (read more: Coca-Cola Tops Q1 Earnings & Revenue Estimates).PepsiCo’s focus too has been on bottled water and the healthier variants of its carbonated drinks. In February, the company launched its new sparkling water line Bubly. Also, the company’s existing bottoled water brand Acquafina’s sales increased 2.6% in 2017. PepsiCo too seems to be benefiting from redesigning its portfolio. The company reported net revenues of $12.56 billion, increasing 4.3% from the year-ago level. Dr Pepper Snapple, Monster Beverages Follow SuitOther companies like Dr Pepper Snapple and Fomento Economico Mexicano too have been increasingly focusing on creating a portfolio that will cater to health-conscious consumers. In fact, Fomento Economico Mexicano has long been focusing on naturally healthy beverages and was the leading player in 2016 with a 42% retail value share.  Monster Beverages too has been riding high on the success of a healthy portfolio. The company’s net sales in the Monster Energy Drink segment, which includes Monster Energy, Monster Hydro Energy and Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 16.7% to $780.5 million in the first quarter.Summing UpWhile health-consciousness has led to a decline in sales growth of carbonated drinks, sales volume of bottled water and other healthier beverages has expanded.

1852,KO,"The 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia is less than a week away, with the first game between the host country and Saudi Arabia scheduled to kick off at 11 a.m. ET on Thursday, June 14 on Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report). Now that World Cup fever has started to truly set in, let’s take a look at how some of the biggest FIFA and World Cup sponsors have performed.FIFA, which stands for the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, currently offers companies the chance to become official partners, World Cup sponsors, or regional sponsors. It is unclear exactly how much these official FIFA partners pay, but the federation reportedly grabbed $1.58 billion in marketing dollars alone for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. According to The Telegraph, it costs between $25 million and $50 million annually to be a FIFA partner and $10 million to $25 million to be a major World Cup sponsor.There are currently seven FIFA partners for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup cycle. This list includes Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Visa (V  -  Free Report), Hyundai/ Kia, Chinese conglomerate Wanda, Russian giant Gazprom, and Qatar Airways. Meanwhile, Budweiser (BUD  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), along with a few others, are official 2018 World Cup sponsors.FIFA’s pitch is simple: “The World Cup is the most effective international marketing platform, reaching millions of people in over 200 countries throughout the world.” So, with all that said, let’s take a look at how some of FIFA’s biggest publicly traded marketing and advertising sponsors are doing.Coca-ColaCoca-Cola has been associated with FIFA since 1974. The company signed a 16-year extension with FIFA in 2005, which takes it through the 2022 World Cup—a deal the beverage giant made before it even knew where the 2018 and 2022 tournaments would be held. Investors will note that Coca-Cola has underperformed the S&P 500 since it signed its latest extension. More recently, KO stock has done dramatically worse than the index, up just 5.5% over the last five years against the index’s nearly 73% climb. Over the last year, Coca-Cola stock is down 3.7% as consumers’ drinking habits shift.VisaMoving on, Visa landed a deal with FIFA in 2007 that gave it the rights to become an official sponsor starting in 2010, replacing Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). The credit card giant is now a partner and has signed on through 2022.Unlike Coca-Cola, Visa stock has soared since it became a FIFA sponsor. Clearly, there are many other factors involved, but it is interesting all the same, and also highlights why many question the real value of sports sponsorships.Adidas The German sportswear powerhouse has been a FIFA partner since 1970. In November 2013, Adidas signed an extension to become the official partner, supplier, and licensee for the FIFA World Cup and all FIFA events until 2030. Adidas stock has performed rather well since the 2014 World Cup. It is also worth noting that the company’s surge outpaces rival Nike’s (NKE  -  Free Report) roughly 95% climb. Fox & TelemundoLastly, let’s look at two of the integral parts of the tournament, Fox and Spanish-language network Telemundo, which is owned by NBCUniversal (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The two giants won the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cups in the United States, paying roughly $1 billion combined. Fox reportedly agreed to pay more than $400 million, with Telemundo dropping $600 million. Clearly, both Fox and Telemundo’s parent company Comcast have performed rather well since the two companies signed their massive World Cup deals back in 2011. It will also certainly be fun to see how Fox’s World Cup coverage performs, especially since the U.S. men’s team didn’t qualify for the first time since 1986.Make sure to come back to Zacks for more 2018 World Cup business updates. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1855,KO,"Leading pharmaceutical and healthcare company GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK  -  Free Report) has started a strategic review of Horlicks — a famous malted milk hot drink in India — along with other smaller nutrition products like Boost. The company is also planning to offload its 72.5% stake in India-listed GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare. Although it is still unclear which company GlaxoSmithKline would prefer selling Horlicks to, market speculations point at Nestle, Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report) and Unilever.Other potential bidders include Mondelez International (MDLZ  -  Free Report), Indian company ITC Ltd., PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and JAB holdings.Why is Horlicks Up for Sale?Glaxo recently inked a deal with Novartis (NVS  -  Free Report) to take over the latter’s 36.5% stake in its Consumer Healthcare joint venture for $13 billion (£9.2 billion). In order to fund the deal, Glaxo is looking to vend Horlicks and other nutrition products. Moreover, Glaxo wants to shift focus toward over-the-counter and oral health categories.But why sell GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare? The Indian arm of the pharmaceutical giant has been grappling with sluggish sales for quite some time now. Revenues decreased 3.1% in 2017 and 0.5% in the first nine months of 2017. This clearly indicates that Horlicks, which accounts for about 90% GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare sales, has also not been performing well.Moreover, malt-based drinks are losing sheen in India of late. Major players in the health food drinks category have been facing the brunt of increased popularity of breakfast cereals and intense competition. Nevertheless, focusing on providing actual nutritional benefits and not just on enhancing taste can change the scenario. According to a study by Research and Markets, India's malted drink market is expected to see a CAGR of 17.4% during 2017–2021.Who All Will Show Interest?It goes without saying that adding Horlicks will drive market share for the buyer as it currently dominates the malt-based drink market in India. According to GlaxoSmithKline, its nutrition products portfolio, including Horlicks, had raked in total sales of $550 million in 2017.According to market sources, the stake is worth $3.1 billion as per current market prices but Glaxo wanted a premium in any sale. They also estimate valuation of the consumer health nutrition business at around $4 billion.Apart from the companies mentioned earlier, other potential bidders include Mondelez International, India’s ITC Ltd., PepsiCo, Associated British Foods, Coca-Cola and JAB holdings.Nestle had previously expressed interest in Horlicks. The company already has a minor presence in the health nutrition space in India with Milo.  Beverage giants PepsiCo and Coca-Cola could also consider buying Horlicks as recently they have been keen on diversifying product offerings given the slump in carbonated beverage drink sales.Mondelez, which operates thorough Cadbury Ltd., has a commanding presence in India. The company generates about 40% revenues from emerging markets, which include India and is keen on expanding in developing countries to gain scale in its categories or distribution capabilities.Meanwhile, Kraft Heinz acquired malt-based health food drink brand Complan from Glaxo in 1994. The company is currently facing a decline in sales primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. Thus, expanding business in emerging markets can prove beneficial.European investment firm, JAB Holdings, backed by Austria’s billionaire Reimann family is also a key contender. The company has been actively taking over companies in the consumer and food sectors over the past few years.Associated British Foods might also show interest in order to expand in India although the size of Glaxo’s business could be a drag, according to a market source.GlaxoSmithKline expects the outcome of the strategic review to be out by the end of 2018. So for now, it’s a wait-and-see story.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1856,KO,"Warren Buffett is one of the world’s most respected investors. He and Berkshire Hathaway  have long favored companies that offer reasonable valuations, mixed with growth opportunities, which sounds simple enough. Here’s a look at some of Berkshire’s top holdings to see if they currently present investors solid value.The last time Berkshire disclosed its holdings it boasted a massive $170 billion stock portfolio. The top five holdings represented roughly 68% of the aggregate fair value. The list featured Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) at $40.7 billion, Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report) at $25.2 billion, Bank of America (BAC) at $21.0 billion, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) at $17.4 billion, and American Express (AXP  -  Free Report) at $14.1 billion. The conglomerate’s other holdings included Kraft Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report), and dozens of other stocks, which they owned much smaller amounts of.So now that we have covered some of Berkshire’s top holdings, let’s take a look at what kind of value Buffett’s top three holdings currently present.Apple Price - Performance/ Valuation Apple is Berkshire’s biggest holding, a spot that is recently took over. In fact, at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017 the company owned $28.2 billion worth of Apple stock. Therefore, Berkshire bought roughly $12.5 billion worth of shares in a very short amount of time.Shares of Apple have skyrocketed nearly 95% over the last two years, outpacing the S&P 500’s roughly 30% surge. Apple stock has also climbed over 14% since the start of the year, which helped it hit a brand new all-time high on Tuesday.Coming into Wednesday, Apple stock was trading at 15.7X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates. Over the last year, Apple has traded as high as 17.2X, with a one-year median of 14.9X. Apple stock has also traded as low as 13.2X during this time period, yet investors should note that Apple stock is trading at a discount to the S&P 500’s 16.9X. Over the last decade, Apple stock has traded as high as 30.8X. Therefore, it is not much of a stretch to say that Apple’s valuation is far from stretched at this time and remains attractive compared to the S&P while remaining relatively in line with its year-long median.Wells Fargo - Price Performance/ Valuation Shares of the embattled banking giant are up just 35% over the last five years, which is far worse the S&P 500’s 71% surge. WFC stock is up 6.6% over the last year but has sunk 8.4% since the start of the year. With that said, Wells Fargo stock currently presents solid value.WFC is trading at 11.3X, marking the slightest of discounts compared to its industry’s 11.4X average—which includes Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), and other banking powers.Investors should note that Wells Fargo has traded as high as 15.6X over the last year, with a one-year median of 12.4X. Therefore, WFC’s current valuation appears more than fair at the moment.Bank of America - Price Performance/ ValuationBank of America has seen its stock price climb nearly 124% over the last five years, which tops the S&P 500’s 71% surge while also beating its industry’s 67% charge. Narrowing the focus a bit more, BAC stock is up over 32% during the last year, nearly doubling its industry’s gains.One might think that these gains would make BAC’s valuation look a little stretch at the moment, but that hardly seems to be the case. Bank of America stock is currently trading at 10.9X, which is just a hair above its year-long low and also represents a discount compared to its year-long median of 12.4X.Investors will note that Bank of America stock is presenting its best value since the fall of 2016. It is also worth pointing out that AAPL, WFC, and BAC are all currently Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1857,KO,"The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.Hershey’s latest cost-savings program, Margin for Growth, is expected to boost profits, which will be reflected in the to-be-reported quarter. As part of this multi-year program, the company will reduce global workforce outside the United States by 15%. The program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses. Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated in the range of $55-$65 million in 2018.Also, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity and improved the sales mix significantly. The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building as well as to support growth and gain marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.Let us delve into other factors that are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings.Product Innovation to Support Top-Line GrowthThe company’s revenues are expected to rise 3.3% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as against a decline of 1.6% in the prior quarter. The consensus estimate for North America segment revenues, comprising 89% of total revenues, is pegged at $1.7 billion, reflecting an increase of 3.5% year over year. International and Other segment is likely to witness 4.4% increase in sales, per the consensus estimate.Products like Cookie Layer Crunch, Popped Snack Mix and Chocolate Dipped Pretzels have significantly contributed to the company’s growth in 2017. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The launch of Hershey's Gold in an instant consumable pack type is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the first quarter.Meanwhile, the implementation of Margin for Growth program in China is driving majority of the improvement. However, China SKU analysis and optimization efforts have dented gross sales volume in 2017 and will persist in 2018.Packaging, Freight & Logistics Costs to Hurt MarginsThe introduction of innovative products is not enough to offset sluggish sales performance. Packaging and marketing initiatives are also required to ensure strong customer outreach. The company is transitioning from lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on core chocolate candy products. These ensure that products get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improve shopping experience. These packaging initiatives along with higher freight and logistics cost hurt margins adversely and affect gross margin.Nevertheless, Hershey’s productivity and cost-saving initiatives is likely to offset higher costs. Overall, Hershey’s bottom line is likely to increase 7.6% to $1.06 in the first quarter of 2018.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required for an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Hershey is +0.65%.

1859,KO,"We are in the thick of the Q1 earnings season, with results seemingly on solid ground given impressive top and bottom-line growth rates. Notably, the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises is quite palpable.According to our latest Earnings Preview, results of 87 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 20, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members are up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of these, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 67.8% beat revenue expectations.A Look at the Soft Drink IndustrySluggish CSD (carbonated soft drinks) volumes are the pressing concerns for the soft drinks giants, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) as well as other non-alcoholic beverage companies. Sales for both the beverage giants have remained subdued in the recent quarters.PepsiCo’s shares have dipped approximately 10.5% in the past year while that of Coca-Cola’s gained 0.9%, against the industry’s 1% decline.However, the two behemoths have vowed to find ways of diversifying their portfolio beyond carbonated soft drinks and revamping existing product lines.Let’s have a sneak peek at the two major soft drink stocks scheduled to report earnings this week, to find out how things are shaping up before the announcement.Coca-Cola is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, 2018 before the opening bell.The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 11 quarters, primarily due to structural changes and weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category.Last quarter, Coca-Cola’s revenues declined 20% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Organically, revenues increased 6%. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 26% impact on revenues. This time again, the company expects the same degree of adverse impact on net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. Moreover, the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 2%. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Precisely, revenues of the company’s North America segment, comprising about 30% of its top line, are expected to witness growth in the first quarter. Last quarter, the North America segmental revenues totaled $2.62 billion last quarter, increasing 6% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 3% in the quarter while unit case volume grew 1%. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy, as well as positive business and category mix.Though Coca-Cola has increased its marketing investments, and is driving package and product innovations to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the first quarter as well.The Zacks Consensus Estimate called for Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues of $2.49 billion, reflecting an increase from $2.39 billion a year ago but a decline from $2.62 billion in the prior quarter.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $7.43 billion, implying an 18.6% year-over-year decline.That said, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of the company to some extent. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 7% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model hints at an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as Coca-Cola has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages (NAB) business.Notably, results of NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the last reported quarter. Results were negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.That said, the company is speeding up its innovation and investments toward e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design to enhance its top line. PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. The company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3% last quarter, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Apart from revenues, commodity inflation is expected to create pressure on PepsiCo’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. That said, its productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion to some extent.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of 92 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 2.1%. The same for revenues is pegged at $12.41 billion, 3% higher than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show that PepsiCo is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components.

1860,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) North America segment’s revenues, comprising about 30% of its top line, are expected to witness growth in the first quarter of 2018, when it reports on Tuesday, Apr 24.A Look at Coca-Cola’s North America Performance in Q4The North America segmental revenues totaled $2.62 billion last quarter, up 6% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 3% in the quarter while unit case volume grew 1%. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy, as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter with 1% decline in juice, dairy and plant-based beverages, as mid-single digit growth in Minute Maid and Simply was offset by a decline in Hi-C. The company registered an 8% rise in tea and coffee, while water, enhanced water and sports drinks accelerated to 3% growth.Precisely, the company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume remained flat in the respective fourth, third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company’s 2017 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to headwinds in the carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category. Cross-category competition, and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Q1 ExpectationThough Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments, and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the first quarter as well.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate called for Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues of $2.49 billion, reflecting an increase from $2.39 billion a year ago but a decline from $2.62 billion in the prior quarter.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola’s Latin American segment is likely to register revenues of $1.01 billion versus $1.12 billion in the prior quarter and $926 million in the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment’s revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a marginal decrease from $1.75 billion sequentially but an increase from $1.63 billion in the prior-year quarter. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.1 billion from $1.27 billion in the third quarter and $3.87 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase to $1.2 billion from $1 billion in the prior quarter. However, on a year-over-year basis, revenues are likely to remain almost flat.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. Meanwhile, the company had earlier stated that the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to impart a 26-point headwind and 6-point headwind on net revenues and profit before tax, respectively, in the first quarter.That said, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to some extent. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Again, currencies are likely to have a one point tailwind on its first-quarter operating income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents for first-quarter earnings reflects 7% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 43 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $7.43 billion represents a 18.6% decrease on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Cost Cut, Innovations Drive Coca-Cola Q1 Earnings?)Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1861,KO,"Consumer staple companies came under pressure on Jun 5, after Mexico announced retaliatory tariffs on goods imported from the United States. The heat was primarily felt by packaged foods companies, as fears of a trade war fail to subside. Consumer staples have been suffering for a long time now with changing tastes and preferences of consumers and increased competition from online retail giants like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report).In fact, the consumer staples sector fell for the fourth consecutive month in May, registering its worst performance since 1990. Trade war fears have added to the sector’s woes, as consumer staples continue to take a beating with retaliatory tariffs being imposed by the United States’ trade allies. That said, it needs to be seen how consumer staple companies fight back in the days to come.Mexico Tariffs Hit Consumer Staple Stocks The United States’ decision to impose 25% and 10% tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum followed by tariffs of another $60 billion saw China come up with retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of U.S. products that primarily hit the consumer staples sector.Moreover, the United States last week imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the European Union (EU), Mexico and Canada. On Jun 5, Mexico announced that it will impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products including pork, bourbon and some types of cheeses.This saw consumer staples stocks, in particular packaged food companies, taking a hit. Shares of Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) and General Mills, Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) slid 2% and 1.8%, respectively. Also, shares of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  declined 0.1% each.Understandably, packaged food companies have reasons to worry with Mexico, one of United States’ biggest trade allies, now imposing retaliatory tariffs.Consumer Staples Suffer Longest DeclineConsumer staples stocks have been suffering for quite some time now, with the sector entering the longest monthly losing streak since November 2016. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples index declined 1.7% in May, registering its straight monthly fall. On a year-to-date basis, the S&P 500 Consumer Staples index has declined 13.3%.Moreover, of the 11 major S&P 500 sectors, the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR (XLP) was the second-worst performer in first-quarter 2018. The consumer staples sector didn’t have a good start to 2018, after having registered gains of more than 130% over a period of nine years. The sector has been under pressure owing to rising competition from online retailers and at the same time has been affected by rising commodity prices and transportation costs, and declining brand value.Packaged Food, Beverage, Tobacco Companies SufferChanging customer preference and inclination toward healthier options have seen a number of beverage, packaged foods and tobacco companies suffer. Year to date, shares of PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) have declined 15.1% and 5.3%, respectively. Similarly, shares of B&G Foods, Inc. (BGS  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) have declined 20.3% and 18.4%, respectively, over the same time period.Tobacco companies too have been suffering with slower-than-expected adoption of alternate tobacco products in some markets and at the same time health-conscious people looking for healthier options. Shares of tobacco giants like Turning Point Brands, Inc. (TPB  -  Free Report) and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) have declined 0.6% and 25.8%, respectively. Turning Point Brands carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Bottom LineConsumer staples stocks have been considered a defensive bet, mainly because of its predictable growth rate and high dividends. However, a number of factors including changing consumer preference, declining brand value and stiff competition from online retailers are acting as tailwinds. Moreover, trade war fears have added to the woes, with countries like Mexico and China imposing tariffs on imported goods from the United States.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest Strategies It's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%. And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

1862,KO,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 numbers on May 8, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings missed analysts’ expectation. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only one of the last four quarters, the average being a negative 1.2%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to drive the company’s first-quarter 2018 results.Product InnovationProduct innovation plays a major role in boosting revenues. The company’s net sales grew 10.5% in 2017 on the back of a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The company also introduced a number of products in the quarter under review, which is expected to contribute to the upcoming quarterly results.In the quarter to be reported, Monster Beverage launched Caffé Monster in three flavors, Monster Energy Ultraviolet, Monster Hydro in three flavors and relaunched Muscle Monster in two flavors.It launched Monster Hydro in Sweden and Germany, Monster Energy Ultraviolet in the Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom along with Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Australia and New Zealand in the first quarter of 2018.Strong Energy Drinks MomentumSales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for 90% of total sales, improved 10.4% in 2017. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company’s top line.Notably, strategic deals with notable brands bolstered the company’s portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company, improved more than 10% in 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Increased Costs to Hurt MarginHigher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners), unfavorable product mix that included more Java products coming online (lower-margin product) as well as inventory destocking in China dented gross margin by 390 basis points (bps) in the preceding quarter. The company expects gross margin to be similar to the fourth-quarter level going forward, as the headwinds are expected to persist at least through the first half of 2018, barring inventory reserves in China. Along with this, higher distribution costs from higher freight expenses are expected to create pressure on operating margin in 2018.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter 2018 revenues is pegged at $859.8 million, reflecting an increase of 15.9% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 39 cents, implying 18.2% year-over-year growth.Quantitative Model PredictionMonster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +0.64%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1863,KO,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 financial numbers on May 8, after the closing bell.This large independent bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an encouraging strategy to grow both organically and through the acquisition of additional manufacturing and distribution territory.A Look at Its Sales PerformanceThe company’s fourth quarter was one of the busiest quarters, in which System Transformation acquisition transactions with the Coca-Cola Company came to an end. With the company’s expanded footprint, net sales increased 33.8% in the last reported quarter. The upside can be attributed to acquisitions and higher comparable net sales.Comparable net sales improved 6.7%, driven by 1.5% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. Sparkling product comparable volumes were down 0.7%, while that of still products increased 8.3%.In 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales growth of 37% year over year, primarily on acquisitions and a 3.1% hike in comparable net sales owing to 1.6% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. The trend is expected to continue in the first quarter as well.The sparkling product portfolio and higher margin still product range drove comparable net sales of the company. Sparkling product comparable volumes grew 0.2% year over year and that of still products increased 4.9% in 2017. This trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Higher Expenses a WoeHigher expenses (such as expansion transaction and amortization expenses) might dent the company’s bottom line. Notably, the stock witnessed dismal trading in the past six months, with the stock plunging 20.1% compared with the industry’s 7% decline.In the fourth quarter, the company’s income from operations declined 104.2% year over year and in 2017, the same decreased 24.8%.

1864,KO,"The markets have been extremely volatile lately owing to a multitude of factors including rate hikes fears and risks of a potential trade war. One particular segment of the market, which has been attracting investor attention over the last few years, is the socially responsible investing segment. These ETFs allow you to invest in line with your principles and contribute to making the world a better place in your own small way (read: ETFs to be Impacted by Potential Trade War With China).Investing in separate stocks that you feel are commensurate with your principles can be difficult, while also maintaining a diversified portfolio. Here, ETFs come to the rescue, as they offer a diversified portfolio of stocks focusing on particular screens for environmental, social or governance (ESG) related issues.Gender equality has been the top trend in 2017 and 2018 so far. With increased focus on disparities in the pay of men and women, investing in companies that have a better standing with regards to gender equity has been gaining popularity. For instance, HSBC revealed a 59% gender pay gap, even though HSBC’s UK workforce comprises 54% women. Moreover, a mere 23% occupy senior roles at the bank.Another area attracting investor attention is clean energy. After President Donald Trump decided to leave the Paris Climate Accord last year, multiple critics have argued the need to shift toward cleaner energy and reduce fossil fuel consumption. There are multiple ways to gain exposure to this principle, either by investing directly in funds having a portfolio of stocks involved in clean energy, or by investing in funds having a portfolio of stocks trying to save energy and reduce carbon emissions in their day-to- day operations.The latest trend among sustainable investing enthusiasts is the need to steer clear of weapons companies. After the school shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in February and the incident in Las Vegas music festival in 2017, arguments for gun laws and imposing stricter rules regarding gun sales have panned up. Therefore, funds that refrain from investing in companies involved in weapons have caught investor attention.   In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that focus on providing exposure to sustainable investing themes.  iShares MSCI KLD 400 Social ETF (DSI  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to stocks that exhibit positive ESG characteristics, refraining from investing in companies involved in weapons, tobacco or alcohol. This fund has AUM of $1.0 billion and charges a fee of 50 basis points a year.

The fund has 6.0% exposure to Microsoft Corp (MSFT  -  Free Report), 3.6% to Facebook Inc (FB  -  Free Report) and 3.0% to Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL  -  Free Report).

This fund has AUM of $317.3 million and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year.

1865,KO,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to buy an integration software maker, which will mark the company’s third acquisition this year and the biggest ever in its history. Recently, the company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MuleSoft, Inc.  for an enterprise value of approximately $6.5 billion.Founded in 2006, MuleSoft designs platforms for connecting applications, data, and devices across any cloud, as well as on-premise, thereby helping clients “to change and innovate faster, deliver differentiated customer experiences, and increase operational efficiency.” The company claims to have more than 1,200 customers, which includes biggies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Mc Donald’s and Barclays.The acquisition will add value to Salesforce's existing Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) portfolio. Upon successful completion of the transaction, the world’s leading customer-relationship management solution provider plans to create “Salesforce Integration Cloud” service. By availing this service, clients will have more and easy access to corporate data irrespective of the storage locations.Financial Terms of the TransactionThe transaction will be of cash-stock type, wherein Salesforce will pay $36 for each of the target company shares, and 0.0711 shares of its own per MuleSoft Class A and Class B common shares. Based on Salesforce’s Mar 19 closing price, the cash-stock transaction amounts to $44.89 per share, reflecting a 36% premium to MuleSoft’s closing share on Monday.Salesforce intends to fund the acquisition with available cash in hand and a $3-billion borrowing through term loans or issuance of debt securities. The deal, subject to customary conditions and expiration of waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, is expected to close by this July.In addition, this is the largest-ever acquisition made by the company. Prior to this, the purchase of software-as-a-service e-commerce solutions provider — Demandware, Inc. — for roughly $2.8 billion was its biggest buyout move.Rationale Behind the DealWe believe the acquisition will not only enhance its process efficiency but will also make Salesforce’s platform more efficient in handling sales, marketing and service functions. The deal will also help Salesforce expand its corporate software offerings and compete effectively with its arch rivals in the space — Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Oracle Corporation.Furthermore, MuleSoft is growing rapidly and registered a 58% year-over-year surge in 2017 revenues. This implies the buyout will be immediately accretive to Salesforce’s top-line results.This apart, Salesforce will gain a huge client base of more than 1,200 to whom it can sell its complementary products, thereby generating additional revenues.Salesforce.com Inc Price Salesforce.com Inc Price | Salesforce.com Inc QuoteBottom LineThe MuleSoft buyout deal highlights Salesforce’s aggressive approach to attain its target of reaching $20 billion in revenues by 2022. Cloud computing is a flourishing part in the technology space and has been gaining momentum in recent years.  Therefore, Salesforce has been acquiring assets across the globe to achieve its long-term goals.It should be noted that acquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although the company remained almost silent throughout 2017 on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), this year it might repeat the likes of 2016, when Salesforce bought 12 companies, to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets.We believe Salesforce’s continued focus on expanding business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Salesforce currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1866,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26, after the closing bell.The company’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters. However, it delivered an average positive surprise of 45.9%. Notably, the company has been losing its position, lately, due to a dismal surprise trend for both top and bottom lines.  It has delivered negative earnings surprise in five of the preceding six quarters. Moreover, revenues lagged estimates in three of the last four quarters.The question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether or not FEMSA will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 55 cents, which moved up 2 cents in the last seven days. Further, the estimate for the quarter reflects 12.2% growth year over year.

QuoteFactors Likely to Impact the QuarterWe remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures, including expanding store base, diversifying business portfolio and focus on core business activities. Evidently, the company has been taking prudent steps to diversify its product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bode well for future operating performance.Moreover, its focus on achieving growth via acquisitions looks good. The company’s exposure in various industries, including beverage, beer and retail, gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. In fact, the company’s strong cash flow generation capacity enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion.These attributes have helped the stock gain 8.1% in the past month, outperforming 0.3% growth recorded by the industry. This reflects a positive sentiment on the stock ahead of earnings. However, we cannot ignore the near-term headwinds that may bother the stock’s growth. These mainly include the dismal top- and bottom-line trends, as well as the continued decline in margins.So, let’s see if FEMSA’s upcoming quarterly performance can help it break the dismal earnings surprise trend backed by its strategic endeavors.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that FEMSA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.While FEMSA has a Zacks Rank #3, an Earnings ESP of 0.00% lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.24% and a Zacks Rank #2.

(SAM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +35.65% and a Zacks Rank #3.Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.69% and a Zacks Rank #3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1867,KO,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Colgate has been popular with investors for its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, it delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. Moreover, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 0.38% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 73 cents, which reflects growth of nearly 9% from the year-ago period. However, the earnings estimate has declined by a penny in the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.01 billion, up 6.6% from the year-ago quarter.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Colgate-Palmolive Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteFactors Driving This Quarter’s ResultsColgate is encouraged by the smooth progress on its savings plan. Further, it is progressing well with its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. It remains confident of the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives, which are likely to boost results in 2018.Consequently, the company expects net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth in low- to mid-single digit this year. The company anticipates strong volumes and pricing growth in 2018. Further, it projects gross margin to expand, driven by robust pricing and productivity gains from the funding-the-growth initiatives. These factors, along with benefits from the tax reform, are expected to boost GAAP earnings in double-digits, while adjusted earnings are anticipated to increase nearly 10%.However, Colgate has been witnessing strained margins, of late, due to higher raw material and packaging costs, as well as advertising expenses. Though the company expects improved adjusted gross margin in 2018, it anticipates advertising costs to remain high, which might hurt the operating margin. Moreover, it expects the backdrop to remain challenging in 2018.Given the mixed sentiment, the company’s shares have declined 10.5%, year to date. However, this compares favorably to the industry’s decline of 12.4%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +0.69%. This, along with the company’s Zacks Rank #3, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.

1868,KO,"The Fearless Girl facing the Manhattan financial district's famous Charging Bull near Wall Street will get a new permanent home by the end of this year in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Despite several criticism, the statue has become a tourist destination and a global symbol of female business prowess since its installation more than a year ago.About The Fearless GirlShe is a ponytailed, young, four-foot-tall bronze monument with fists on hips and chin held high as a symbol of empowerment. State Street Global Advisors at Bowling Green Park on Broadway Street originally installed the sculpture on the eve of International Women’s Day 2017. The Fearless Girl is a growing symbol for gender equality and the power of women in leadership. It spreads a message to encourage companies to recruit women to their board. The plaque at the statue’s feet reads “Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference.”The ‘Fearless Girl’ is part of a campaign by State Street to encourage companies to add more women to their boards and to advertise SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report), which comprises gender-diverse companies that have a relatively high percentage of women among their senior leadership.Inside SHEThis ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 168 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.8% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.2%, followed by healthcare (16.4%), consumer staples (13.1%) and consumer discretionary (12.0%). SHE has returned 10.2% over the past year versus the gain of 15.45% for the broad market fund (SPY  -  Free Report).Impact On Women-LeadershipOut of 700 companies in the United States, Britain and Australia that had no women serving on their boards, more than 150 companies have added a female director to their boards since the placement of the bronze girl statue, with another 34 pledging to do so. Currently, women make up 5% of CEOs in the Fortune 500 companies and 17% of the corporate board members among Fortune 500 companies.Today, a record number of women are in power this year. In the United States, 32 Fortune 500 CEOs are women, three women are in the Supreme Court, and three of the last eight U.S. Secretaries of State were women. Last year, 15 of 146 world leaders were women, eight of whom served as their country’s first female leaders. Some of the famous women leaders include Angela Merkel and Dilma Rousseff.In the corporate world, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report); Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook (FB  -  Free Report); Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors (GM  -  Free Report); Angela Ahrendts, Senior Vice-President of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report); Denise Morrison, CEO of Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report); and Michele Buck, CEO of Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report) are leaders in their own right. Per several researches, companies led by women have a long history of outperformance.Bottom LinePlacing the Fearless Girl right next to the NYSE is the perfect metaphor to promote more companies to hire women to their boards, according to the State Street Global Advisors. With the move, the Fearless Girl will be more powerful standing alone outside NYSE than the her current home turf, which she shares with the Charging Bull. Hopefully, she will continue to stimulate the power of having women in leadership.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1869,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.63%.In fact, this beverage giant delivered a positive earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 1.48%.A Look at Coca-Cola’s Revenue PerformanceCoca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets, and shifting consumer preferences. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 11 quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Last quarter, Coca-Cola’s revenues declined 20% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 26% impact on revenues. This time again, the company expects the same degree of adverse impact on net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. Moreover, the first quarter will have one less day than the same period last year. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 2%. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.That said, the company’s organic revenues grew across the board in the last reported quarter. Coca-Cola has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its efforts to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model. Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.Coca-Cola witnessed solid growth in the preceding quarter in its developed markets, mainly in Europe and North America, buoyed by improving execution in recently refranchised territories, higher pricing, improved product innovations and packaging strategies. Although other emerging markets were more challenging in the first half of 2017, the company saw an improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil as it moved into the second half.Overall, for the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s total revenues stands at $7.43 billion, implying 18.6% year-over-year decline.Segment DiscussionNorth America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to witness solid growth in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $2.49 billion reflects growth of 96.5% from the preceding quarter and 4.1% sequentially.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.3% decline sequentially but 9.4% growth year over year. On the other hand, the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.73 billion indicates a decrease from $1.75 billion in the last quarter but an increase from $1.63 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to $1.1 billion from $3.9 billion a year ago and $1.1 billion last quarter. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 0.1% on a year-over-year basis and 17.3% sequentially.Cost Savings to Drive GrowthThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing efficiency and improving its margins amid tough business conditions. To that end, Coca-Cola’s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. Refranchising efforts, though likely to hurt sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola’s adjusted EPS got a 5.4% and 2% boost in Q4 and Q3, respectively, from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) despite weak revenues. The company’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in 13 of the past 14 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 480 basis points or bps in Q4. Comparable operating margin also grew 540 bps. The company’s plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business is helping to improve its margins. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Again, the company is on track to deliver annualized savings of about $3.8 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs. These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s first-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes. Nonetheless, pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line to some extent.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 46 cents, reflecting a 7% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Coca-Cola does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which are required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1870,KO,"Shares of integration software maker MuleSoft  soared more than 20% in early afternoon trading Tuesday after news reports suggested that it was in advanced talks to be acquired by cloud computing giant Salesforce (CRM  -  Free Report).Citing people familiar with the matter, Reuters said Tuesday that Salesforce is interested in buying MuleSoft in order to bolster its offerings beyond customer relations software. The deal could be worth up to $6 billion and would represent Salesforce’s largest acquisition ever, the report said.Reuters also mentioned that the move would underscore Chief Executive March Benioff’s desire to supplement his company’s cloud-based solutions with new technology. The publication’s sources said that the deal could be announced as soon as this week, although an agreement is not yet certain.What Is MuleSoft?MuleSoft designs platforms for connecting applications, data, and devices. The company’s “Anypoint” technology was described as a “disruptive” force within the enterprise software market in a recent note from analysts at Nomura.“With a large potential TAM and product capabilities well ahead of the competition, MULE is poised to continue to gain share against the legacy incumbents in the integration software market,” the analysts said.Based in San Francisco, MuleSoft has already attracted interest from Salesforce in the past. Salesforce Ventures, the cloud firm’s venture capital wing, led a $128 million funding round for the software company back in 2015.MuleSoft claims more than 1,000 customers, including major clients like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report), and Spotify. MuleSoft’s solutions help companies’ own networks run faster, making them ideal for businesses that are not yet prepared for a full transition to the cloud.Why Does It Matter?Salesforce currently claims about 18% of the global CRM software market, but the company likely senses that its strongest growth potential lies outside of its current area of expertise. As companies of all shapes and sizes prepare for the next generation of technology, firms like MuleSoft—which promise to make this evolution more painless—should be extremely beneficial.Want more market analysis from this author?

1871,KO,"The first-quarter earnings season is past the halfway mark, with more than 900 companies including 142 S&P 500 members due to report results this week.According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 267 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 27, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25.1% year over year on more than 10% higher revenues. Of these, 76.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 73.8% beat revenue expectations.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are likely to increase 22.6% from the same period last year on 8.4% higher revenues. Total earnings for consumer staples companies are expected to grow 6.8% while revenues are likely to increase 3.1% in the first quarter of 2018.Some of the key players in the sector — Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) — have already released their quarterly numbers. Procter & Gamble, popularly known as P&G, reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 financial results, wherein both earnings and revenues surpassed expectations, benefiting from higher demand for skincare products, along with fabric and home care products. The company has also lifted its core earnings per share guidance.PepsiCo reported first-quarter 2018 results, with earnings and revenues both beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Notably, this is the eighth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise for the company. The improvement was mainly attributable to strong performances in its international divisions, propelled by higher revenue growth in developing and emerging markets.Coca-Cola started 2018 on a strong note, beating the consensus mark on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following stocks within the consumer staples sector that are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 1.Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.79% last quarter. The Oreo-maker surpassed estimates in all the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 4.43%.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Mondelez is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Mondelez has an Earnings ESP of +0.34% and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The food industry within the consumer staples sector has been witnessing sluggish growth and slowdown in consumption for the past few quarters. The industry is experiencing changes in consumer preference (for example, a shift toward products with less artificial sweeteners, sodium and saturated fat) and consumer dynamics (such as increased need for portable and on-the-go products), demographic shifts and also a shift in demand for low-priced products.Mondelez, like other legacy brands including General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report), The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) and The Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report), has been facing challenges to boost its volume since 2014.Nonetheless, in order to counter the tepid sales trend, Mondelez has been focusing on innovation and brand building. The company has also undertaken some major steps to improve margins, cash flow and return on invested capital. Mondelez’s to-be-reported quarter’s results are likely to gain from its Power Brands, favorable trends in emerging markets, higher pricing, productivity and cost saving initiatives, partly offset by higher input costs.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 61 cents, indicating a 15.1% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $6.66 billion, implying 3.8% growth.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Aid Mondelez's Q1 Earnings?) Mondelez International, Inc.

The company has a mixed record of earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 1.7%.Our proven model does not show that Archer Daniels is likely to beat earnings estimates in the to-be-reported quarter. Archer Daniels sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Archer Daniels has a dismal surprise history. In fact, the company has been lagging sales estimates for more than three years now. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect first-quarter revenues to be $14.52 billion, down 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Though the company delivered earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017, it recorded negative surprise in eight of the preceding 10 quarters. This drab performance can be attributed to fluctuating commodity prices, oversupply in the industry and unfavorable margins.However, Archer Daniels’ focus on cost savings to strengthen its business has been offsetting the sales headwind to some extent. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 50 cents for the quarter under review reflects a decline of 16.7% year over year.

1872,KO,"The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) will report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, after market close.Top-line weakness in the past several quarters has been marring Kraft Heinz’s prospects. In 2017, net sales declined 1.1% year over year primarily due to soft consumer demand in the United States and Canada. The dismal scenario is not expected to see a turnaround in the to-be-reported quarter. Kraft Heinz’s sales are expected to witness negligible growth (0.1%) in the first quarter of 2018, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Increased retail competition in developed markets, distribution losses for Planters in the club channel leading to lower volumes in United States, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions and trade spend timing will inhibit top-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter.Its flagship United States segment, accounting for more than 70% of its total net sales, requires sustained improvement in sales for the company to regain its position. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s revenues of $4.4 billion reflects 2.9% decline on a year-over-year basis.Again, lower retail inventory and lower promotion activity in Canada will hold back organic growth potential in the quarter to be reported. Segment’s revenues of $462 million reflect 4.3% fall for the first quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Meanwhile, Rest of World (Asia Pacific, Latin America and India, the Middle East and Africa) segment revenues of $837 million are likely to witness 1.3% growth. Meanwhile, consensus estimate for Europe segment revenues of $650 million indicates an increase from $543 million a year ago.Increased Investments to Hurt MarginsIn order to boost demand, the company is consistently investing in building go-to-market capabilities, e-commerce and digital investments in selected markets, leveraging distribution and whitespace gains in developing markets, launching a strong pipeline of “Big Bet” products innovation. These initiatives are likely to pressurize margins in the to-be-reported quarter.Earnings to DeclineDismal revenue growth and increased costs owing to various investments undertaken will likely translate into lower earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall. The expected decline in earnings indicates the fact that cost-savings and productivity-improvement initiatives will not be able to provide impetus to earnings in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, our quantitative model predicts earnings miss for Kraft Heinz in the first quarter.Kraft Heinz does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.

1873,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V’s (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, top and bottom lines lagged estimates in first-quarter 2018. With this, the company reported a negative earnings surprise in six of the trailing seven quarters. Revenues surpassed estimates in four of the last five quarters.However, the company’s top line improved year over year. Additionally, the reported quarter marked an improvement in the operating income at FEMSA Comercio’s Retail and Health divisions. It also reflected a recovery in operating margin at FEMSA Comercio’s Fuel division.Consequently, shares of FEMSA rose 3.2% on Apr 26. Moreover, FEMSA outperformed the broader industry in the past month, reflecting a positive momentum on the stock. The stock has returned 4.7% against the industry's decline of 3.6%.Q1 InsightNet majority income per ADS was nearly at a break even (Ps. 0.0006 per FEMSA unit or US$0.0003 per ADS) in the first quarter, significantly below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents.Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V.

QuoteNet consolidated income of the largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) was Ps. 1,478 million (net loss of US$78.8 million), reflecting a decline of 77.6% from the year-ago quarter. The unfavorable result can be attributed to the negative foreign exchange as the higher U.S. dollar-denominated cash position at FEMSA was impacted by rise in Mexican peso. This was partly offset by lower interest expense and higher operating income.Total revenues increased 4% year over year to Ps. 115,337 million (US$6,148 million), mainly fueled by solid growth at FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division. On an organic basis, total revenues increased 5.2% year over year. However, the company’s total revenues, in dollar terms, lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,263 million.FEMSA’s gross profit grew 5.1% to Ps. 41,364 million (US$2,204.9 million).

(KOF  -  Free Report) declined 3.2% year over year to Ps. 49,713 million (US$2,649.9 million). On a comparable basis, revenues improved 7.2% on the back of rise in the average price-per-unit case in Mexico and Argentina along with higher volumes in Brazil, Central America and Colombia. This was partly negated by volume declines in the company’s remaining operations.Coca-Cola FEMSA’s operating income dropped 3.4% to Ps. 5,883 million (US$313.6 million) while comparable operating income declined 1.1%, attributed to cost pressures in Central America, Mexico and the Philippines, offset by raw material tailwinds in South America.

1877,KO,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we take a look at the multibillion-dollar business that drives NCAA March Madness after a wild opening weekend for the college basketball tournament.A No. 1 seed lost to a No. 16 seed for the first time ever, big brand name schools busted brackets early, and ratings jumped accordingly. But what might be more fascinating than the craziness on the court is the mind-boggling money that is generated during the event.CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner bet big on the long-term viability of March Madness, committing billions of dollars to broadcast the tournament through 2032. The two media companies broadcast and stream all of the games across an array of networks, and the deal will see them retain the broadcasting rights no matter how fans consume games in the future.On top of these broadcast fees, the NCAA makes millions from tickets and marketing deals. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report), AT&T (T  -  Free Report), and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) remain the tournament’s biggest sponsors this year. Meanwhile, companies like Pizza Hut (YUM  -  Free Report) and Lowe’s (LOW  -  Free Report) will be ever present over the next few weeks, while Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report) debuted the first advertising campaign for its cloud computing products as part of a new multiyear NCAA partnership.The players themselves will also act as walking, talking, and dunking billboards for Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report). And that is just the start of the major money that fuels March Madness.

1878,KO,"The iShares Edge MSCI USA Size Factor ETF (SIZE  -  Free Report) made its debut on 04/16/2013, and is a smart beta exchange traded fund that provides broad exposure to the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs category of the U.S. equity market.What Are Smart Beta ETFs?The ETF industry has traditionally been dominated by products based on market capitalization weighted indexes that are designed to represent the market or a particular segment of the market.Investors who believe in market efficiency should consider market cap indexes, as they replicate market returns in a low-cost, convenient, and transparent way.If you're the kind of investor who would rather try and beat the market through good stock selection, then smart beta funds are your best choice; this fund class is known for tracking non-cap weighted strategies.By attempting to pick stocks that have a better chance of risk-return performance, non-cap weighted indexes are based on certain fundamental characteristics, or a combination of such.Methodologies like equal-weighting, one of the simplest options out there, fundamental weighting, and volatility/momentum based weighting are all choices offered to investors in this space, but not all of them can deliver superior returns.Fund Sponsor & IndexManaged by Blackrock, SIZE has amassed assets over $313.20 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs in the Total Market (U.S.) ETFs. Before fees and expenses, SIZE seeks to match the performance of the MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index.The MSCI USA Risk Weighted Index comprises of U.S. large and mid-capitalization stocks with relatively smaller average market capitalization.Cost & Other ExpensesSince cheaper funds tend to produce better results than more expensive funds, assuming all other factors remain equal, it is important for investors to pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio.Annual operating expenses for SIZE are 0.15%, which makes it one of the cheaper products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.65%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.For SIZE, it has heaviest allocation in the Financials sector --about 17.70% of the portfolio --while Industrials and Information Technology round out the top three.When you look at individual holdings, Republic Services Inc (RSG  -  Free Report) accounts for about 0.46% of the fund's total assets, followed by Pepsico Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 4.07% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe fund's year-to-date return has lost about -1.36%, and is up about 9.43% in the last one year (as of 04/26/2018). SIZE has traded between $75.33 and $88.18 in the past 52-week period.The fund has a beta of 0.90 and standard deviation of 12.41% for the trailing three-year period, which makes SIZE a high choice in this particular space. With about 637 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.

1879,KO,"Coca-Cola European Partners plc (CCE  -  Free Report) or CCEP is set to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the opening bell on Apr 26.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.45%. The company surpassed/met the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.88%.Factors at PlayIn 2017, CCEP modestly exceeded its initial guidance for revenue, operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, solid revenue per unit case growth (up 200% year over year) in sugar-free portfolio, stronger execution and customer service, and improving operating efficiency helped drive growth.This has encouraged CCEP to step up investments in brand portfolio, field sales teams, route to market and most importantly, digital capabilities.In the last reported quarter, the company’s net sales increased 12.7% year over year in dollar terms. Comparable revenues in the quarter grew 3.5%. From a brand and volume perspective, CCEP’s sparkling portfolio increased 1%, with a 0.5% drop in Coca-Cola trademark brands. Notably, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continued to perform well, growing more than 15%. Again, energy drinks performed well and were up 15% as the company continued to execute its multi-brand strategy.Apart from solid revenues, the company’s cost-saving plans are helping boost the bottom line. In the fourth quarter, operating expenses contracted 11.5% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. This reflects synergy benefits, volume-related costs, expense timing and continued focus on managing operating expenses. These factors contributed to operating profit growth of 50% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Comparable earnings jumped 26.1% year over year in the quarter.We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.

1880,KO,"PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been trying out product variations to drive carbonated soft drink sales as the product has been seeing declining demand owing to high calorie content. Recently, Mountain Dew, a product of PepsiCo, introduced MTN DEW ICE — a carbonated soft drink or CSD with a splash of real juice.The latest lemon-lime flavored carbonated soda with caffeine, with 100 calories per 12 ounces, is a marquee addition to the PepsiCo portfolio.PepsiCo’s Endeavor to Diversify PortfolioSales of PepsiCo’s carbonated beverages continue to be weak due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Among CSDs, the cola segment has been particularly facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), PepsiCo, Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.PepsiCo’s carbonated beverage drink volumes declined 4% in the first nine months of 2017 in North America. Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing through innovation and diversification.The company regularly creates new flavors of existing products alongside maintaining a robust pipeline of products. The company has generated $5 billion in annual sales from new products since 2013. PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier products which contain nutrients such as grains, fruits, vegetables, or protein.  The company now generates a significant portion of its revenues from such products and also from beverages with less sugar and sodium content.In 2016, PepsiCo acquired a sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company KeVita, diversify its soft drinks portfolio amid slowing soda sales. The addition of KeVita will expand PepsiCo’s health and wellness offerings in the premium chilled beverage space. The latest juice-based soft drink is expected to boost PepsiCo’s portfolio, enabling it to increase the number of nutritious and delicious products it offers.Stock Price MovementPepsiCo’s shares have gained 5.9% in the last three months, as compared with a 3.1% gain of its industry. Also, earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company rose 0.5% for 2018 over the last 30 days. This signifies analyst optimism on the stock’s near-term performance. We expect the company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue woes. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1881,KO,"In line with its strategy to invest in newer revenue generating platforms, The Coca-Cola Co.’s (KO  -  Free Report) affiliate in Chile and local bottlers of the brand entered into an agreement to buy Comercializadora Novaverde SA. The company specializes in juices, canned fruits and vegetables, mainly under the brand Guallarauco.Details of the DealEmbotelladora Andina, Embonor, Coca-Cola del Valle New Ventures, and Coca-Cola de Chile entered into a stock purchase agreement under which 100% ownership of Comercializadora Novaverde shares will be transferred.On completion of the deal, while Coca-Cola del Valle New Ventures will own 2,999,994 shares, Coca-Cola de Chile and Embotelladora Andina will own three and two shares, respectively. Embonor will gain the ownership of one share. Embotelladora Andina’s direct and indirect ownership in Novaverde will be approximately 35%, as it is already a shareholder of Coca-Cola del Valle New Ventures.The deal is valued at $80 million, according to a Reuters report.Can Diversification Counter Weak Sales?Sales of Coca-Cola’s carbonated beverages continue to remain weak due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. The cola segment has been particularly facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, fresh taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting carbonated soft drinks or CSD sales.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Although Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost carbonated beverage business, the efforts are yet to result in any meaningful improvement. Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 1% in the first quarter of 2017. The same remained flat both in the second and the third quarter.Coca-Cola therefore is investing in newer revenue generating platforms to boost long-term sales and profits. The beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States in the third quarter of 2017. Also, in March 2017, Coca-Cola and its largest Latin American bottler Coca-Cola Femsa SAB closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business from consumer products giant Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report).The Novaverde takeover is expected to boost Coca-Cola’s portfolio in Chile enabling it to increase the number of nutritious and delicious products it offers.We believe the company’s efforts to offer diversified products to cash in on the shifting consumer preference toward healthier products will bode well in the years to come.Shares of the company have gained 11.5% over a year, compared with the industry’s growth of 16.4%. However, the earnings estimates for 2018 have moved north over the last 30 days, reflecting analysts’ optimism. Earnings estimates for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock inched up 0.5% for 2018.

1882,KO,"Jubilant Republicans delivered a tax bill to President Trump before Christmas, as promised. The Republican tax plan got the final approval by the House that gave Corporate America a massive permanent tax break. This in turn will encourage corporations to invest more in the United States, resulting in a rise in wages, jobs and a stronger economy.While miners, energy, retailers, tech, banks and pharma are expected to enjoy the biggest gains from the tax package, health insurers and hospitals are poised to lose. Needless to say, moneyed Americans like Trump will also make the most of the tax overhaul.House Gives Final Approval to Tax BillThe House of Representatives approved the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 30 years, sending a $1.5-trillion tax bill to the President for signature. The House was compelled to vote again, after it was discovered that the bill they had earlier passed violated some of the necessary rules for Senate Republicans to pass it with simple majority. The House, nevertheless, passed the tax reform bill by 224-201 majority, while the Republican-led Senate had earlier passed it by a vote of 51 to 48.Republicans successfully countered opposition from Democrats to pass the bill that will slash corporate taxes and provide temporary tax relief to both wealthy and middle-class Americans. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented next year, instead of being delayed until 2019.Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35%. Immediate offset of spending on short lived capital equipment is expected to further save U.S. companies around $32.5 billion in 2018, as per Congress’s joint committee on taxation.Winners & Losers From the Republican Tax BillAmong the largest beneficiaries of the tax bill include mining, accommodation and food services that can make use of the allowance for short lived equipment. Levies for repatriating overseas profits will boost major automakers like General Motors Company (GM  -  Free Report) and Ford Motor, according to UBS. Meanwhile, the reduction in effective rate will be a shot in the arm for energy players as they pay the second-highest tax rate at 37%, per Bloomberg Intelligence.For retailers, the bill will be beneficial on multiple fronts. A tax relief among the wealthy and middle-class will increase discretionary income that may boost demand for consumer goods, while big consumer product makers such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and Pepsico have large cash holdings offshore that can be used for innovation and deal making, noted Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Ken Shea.One-time low tax rate on foreign profits will also help multinationals including large tech majors to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. Bringing back massive overseas cash pile will help tech companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, pay dividends and M&A activities.Let us not forget that tech behemoths like Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Microsoft, Cisco Systems and Oracle hold 88% of their money overseas to avoid paying the 35% corporate tax rate on earnings. Thus, they are positioned to gain immensely under Trump’s tax reduction plan.Banks also face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20% (read more: Wall Street Hits Record Highs on Tax-Cut Optimism: 5 Gainers).American biopharma companies, in the meanwhile, make up one-third of the top 30 U.S. firms with the most cash abroad. A slashed tax rate for repatriated offshore cash, thus, will benefit big drug makers like Amgen Inc. (AMGN  -  Free Report) ($39 billion offshore), Gilead Sciences ($32 billion), Pfizer (about $22 billion) and Merck & Co. (about $20 billion), according to a recent Credit Suisse report.The report further added that lowering of corporate tax rates will b enefit certain drug makers that pay high effective tax rate and have lower foreign income. The main companies among them are Bioverative (36% effective tax rate), United Therapeutics (37%) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (33%).However, the bill is a mixed bag for health care. Repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate won’t help health insurers and hospitals. The provision required every American to have health insurance coverage or less pay a fine. Ending of such a provision will reduce the number of people who buy insurance coverage. And for hospitals, a lesser number of insured people mean fewer paying customers.But, for individual UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report), a drop in the effective tax rate will boost profits by as much as 15%, according Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners. The health insurer had payed about 32.5% income tax in the third quarter.Wind Up: Big Victory for TrumpThere is no doubt that passing of the bill is a great victory for Trump, both politically and personally. He had pledged to provide such business-friendly policies since his election years.  Such promises have also helped the broader equity markets gain traction and the major bourses hit a series of record highs this year. Further, these measures are likely to help the markets sustain the current bull run heading into 2018.In addition, a legislative win is beneficial for Trump and his family. Remember, the tax bill trims the ultra-rich individual tax bracket from 39.6% to 37%, while the “pass-through” provision will provide a major windfall to wealthy investors like Trump.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018?

1883,KO,"Shares of Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) surged nearly 2% to inch closer to their all-time high on Monday following an array of news regarding the iPhone giant, including a significant iCloud announcement and further investment from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B  -  Free Report).iCloud UpdateApple’s iCloud service has become widely popular with customers, especially on iPhone and iPad devices. The company’s storage service allows Apple users to store a massive amount of data—often photos and videos—in the cloud to prevent their devices from filling up.The platform is widely used, but some investors might not know that the company uses other cloud computing technology to house Apple user data. Apple noted in a recent iOS Security update that it now uses Alphabet (GOOGL) cloud services.“The keys and the file’s metadata are stored by Apple in the user’s iCloud account,” Apple noted in the report. “The encrypted chunks of the file are stored, without any user-identifying information, using third-party storage services, such as S3 and Google Cloud Platform.”Media outlets had previously reported—as early as 2016—that Apple uses Google’s cloud services for iCloud storage, but Apple did not confirm this until recently.Apple has worked heavily with Microsoft’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Azure cloud services, as well as Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) AWS, in the past. Microsoft was notably left out of the language in the most recent report, while Amazon’s S3 cloud-based data storage service is still mentioned.China According to a new Reuters report, Apple will begin to store its iCloud data for Chinese customers in China. Until now, the company stored its Chinese data in the U.S. This move has raised some security concerns, as many experts worry that the Chinese government will be able to access user data too easily.A new set of Chinese laws require cloud services offered to Chinese citizens be operated by Chinese companies, with the data stored in China.The Chinese government previously had to go through the U.S. legal system in order to obtain any information it might want. Now it will not. “While we advocated against iCloud being subject to these laws, we were ultimately unsuccessful,” Apple said in a statement.Apple users outside of China won’t have their iCould storage changed in any way.Warren BuffettWarren Buffett seems more bullish on Apple than ever before. The Oracle of Omaha noted in a recent interview with CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" that his company has purchased more Apple stock than anything else over the last year.Buffett placed much of his faith in Apple on the company’s ability to keep customers.""Apple has an extraordinary consumer franchise,"" Buffett told CNBC. ""I see how strong that ecosystem is, to an extraordinary degree. … You are very, very, very locked in, at least psychologically and mentally, to the product you are using. [IPhone] is a very sticky product.""Berkshire Hathaway’s other large positions include Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and other industry powers.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

1884,KO,"The Q1 reporting cycle is gathering steam, with more than 35% S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week. According to the latest Earnings Preview, results of 87 S&P 500 members are already out. As of Apr 20, 2018, total earnings for these S&P 500 members were up 25% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues. Of these, 82.8% surpassed earnings estimates, while 67.8% beat revenue expectations.Now, soft drinks stocks, which are broadly grouped in the Consumer Staples sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors), are expected to see modest growth in the quarter. The sector is expected to report 6.2% earnings and 2.8% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2018.The Beverages-Soft Drinks industry within the consumer staples sector has been coming up with sluggish results due to carbonated soft drinks or CSD category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has come under fire as consumers are opting for alternative beverage offerings.Nonetheless, the companies remained focused on reviving their tepid sales growth. They are pursuing investments in product innovations as well as newer revenue platforms while taking care of health benefits (like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks) to boost long-term sales and profits.One of the key players in the beverage industry, Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), has already released its first-quarter numbers. Coca-Cola kicked off 2018 on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Let’s take a look at what’s in store for the following soft drink stocks within the consumer staples sector, which are scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results around Apr 26.PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 numbers before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.77%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average being 4.05%.The company’s CSD volumes declined 5% in 2017 in the North America Beverages (NAB) business. Notably, results of the NAB segment — comprising beverage businesses in the United States and Canada — remained soft in the last reported quarter. Results were negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.That said, the company is speeding up its innovation and investments in e-commerce, R&D and social/digital marketing/design to enhance its top line. PepsiCo has delivered organic revenue growth in the past four quarters, banking on significant innovation and revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. The company’s total organic revenue growth was modest at 2.3% last quarter, driven by 2% pricing on 2% volume growth in food/snacks, offset by a 2% volume decline in beverages. However, its total revenues remained unchanged from the year-ago level.Apart from revenues, commodity inflation is expected to create pressure on PepsiCo’s gross margin in the to-be-reported quarter. That said, its productivity programs will likely support its core operating margin expansion to some extent.Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of 92 cents implies a year-over-year decline of 2.1%. The same for revenues is pegged at $12.41 billion, 3% higher than the prior-year quarter figure.Meanwhile, our proven model does not hint at an earnings beat for the company this quarter, as PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read More: Will Cost-Saving Plans Boost PepsiCo's Q1 Earnings?)Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteCoca-Cola European Partners plc (CCE  -  Free Report), also known as CCEP, is a consumer packaged goods company, engaged in producing, distributing and marketing nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages. It is slated to report quarterly numbers before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the consensus mark. It beat earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 6.88%.In 2017, CCEP has modestly exceeded its initial guidance for revenues, operating profit, earnings per share and most notably free cash flow. The company’s continued focus on brand and packaging innovation, solid revenue per unit case growth (up 200% year over year) in the sugar-free portfolio, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Meanwhile, for CCEP, our proven model does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients, which increases the odds of an earnings beat. Currently, the company has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

1885,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) kicked off 2018 on a strong note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. Apart from a significant rise in soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations, helped it to come up with better numbers.Coca-Cola’s shares have rallied 1.6% in the pre-trading session following the earnings release.Earnings BeatFirst-quarter 2018 comparable earnings of the company were 47 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents.Earnings also improved 8% from the year-ago profit level of 43 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales BeatRevenues of $7.63 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.43 billion. However, net revenues declined 16% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly fall. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had 26% negative impact on revenues. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Organic revenues grew 5% in the quarter, aided by concentrate sales improvement of 4% and price/mix growth of 1%. Currency also impacted revenues positively by 2%.Volume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume grew 3% in the quarter versus flat growth in the preceding quarter.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume increased 4% (versus no growth in the prior quarter). Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages witnessed 3% decline (versus 2% growth in the preceding quarter). Water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 1% (versus 2% in Q4), and Tea and Coffee were up 5% (compared with 2% growth in Q4).Notably, Diet Coke’s North America volume grew in the quarter following a full brand revamp. The introduction of four bold, new flavors, along with contemporary, sleek packaging and innovative marketing, helped in the upside.Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues grew 11% at North America, 13% at Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and 8% at Latin America segment. However, revenues at Asia Pacific segment increased modestly by 1%.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 1% in North America, 8% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 6% in Latin America, 3% in Asia Pacific and 13% in Bottling Investments.MarginsComparable gross margin expanded 270 basis points (bps) year over year to 64%. The company’s comparable operating margin grew 600 bps to 30.7% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts. The upside was partly offset by the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.2018 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic revenues are expected to rise 4%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 17%, while Fx is likely to have a positive impact of 1% on revenues. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1-2% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Comparable currency income before income taxes (structurally adjusted) is expected to increase 8-9%. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable income before taxes by 0-1%. Structural changes are likely to have a 2% negative impact on it.The company expects adjusted EPS to grow 8-10% from the prior -year’s comparable EPS of $1.91.The company expects to buy back shares worth $1 billion in 2018. The adjusted effective tax rate is likely to be 21%. Cash from operations is likely to be at least $8.5 billion.Zacks RankCoca-Cola has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1887,KO,"Welcome to the latest episode of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into BodyArmor as the sports drink newcomer looks to take on Gatorade. Next, we discuss the NBA’s latest deal with Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) Twitch, before we close with a look at a deal that could impact Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) brand new ESPN+ streaming service.BodyArmor—which has no relation to Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report)—is ready to take on PepsiCo’s (PEP  -  Free Report) Gatorade and Coca-Cola’s (KO  -  Free Report) Powerade in the multibillion-dollar sports drink market. Those unfamiliar with BodyArmor might soon see the company a lot more after it launched its latest national television campaign, which features some big stars, including James Harden.The company could also get a real boost from one of its largest investors, Kobe Bryant, who also happens to play a big role in BodyArmor’s creative vision. BodyArmor has a long way to go to try to catch up to Powerade and Gatorade, but the drink market is going through a massive shake-up recently. And with Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as another major investor, BodyArmor could be poised to become a legitimate long-term player in the sports drink market.Full-Court Finance then transitions into the NBA’s latest streaming rights deal with Twitch for its brand new esports league, which the NBA created in partnership with Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report). The NBA has been on the cutting edge of a lot of media trends, and its growing relationship with Amazon could end up playing a much bigger role as streaming TV providers, from Hulu to YouTube TV (GOOGL  -  Free Report), slowly look to enter the live sports business.We then close with a look at a possible partnership between ESPN and Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report).

1888,KO,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Utilities and Industrials with 20.9%, 19.7% and 19.2% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens. It has AUM of $2.0 billion and charges a fee of 28 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Industrials and Health Care with 20.2%, 18.7% and 17.5% allocation, respectively.The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil XOM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 5.0%, 4.6% and 4.1% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 22.0% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date. XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell), with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report)XLU is one of the most popular funds in the utility space. The fund has AUM of $7.3 billion and is a relatively cheaper bet as it charges a fee of 13 basis points a year.

1889,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 16, before the opening bell.A Look at Coca-Cola’s Revenue PerformanceCoca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets, and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last 10 quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter revenues declined 15% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 18% impact on revenues. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 27% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. However, the company expects currency to have a positive impact on quarterly net revenues by 0-1%.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s total revenues stands at $7.36 billion, implying a 21.7% year-over-year decrease.Efforts to Boost MarginsThe cola giant has been focusing on increasing their efficiency and improving their margins amid tough business conditions. For that, Coca-Cola’s strategy to refranchise its bottling operations facilitated improved margins by reducing its exposure to the capital-intensive bottling business. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Coca-Cola’s adjusted EPS increased 2% from the year-ago level (after falling for nine consecutive quarters) in the prior quarter despite weak revenues. The company’s earnings have topped the consensus mark in 12 of the past 13 quarters.The improvement was attributable to its ongoing productivity initiatives. Its adjusted gross margin expanded 170 basis points or bps in Q3. Comparable operating margin also grew 404 bps. The company’s plan to refranchise its low-margin bottling operations and transform into a capital-light business are helping to improve its margins. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Again, the company is on track to deliver annualized savings of about $3 billion by 2019 through its productivity programs. These include restructuring of its global supply chain, zero-based budgeting and streamlining its operating model.Segment DiscussionNorth America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.4 billion reflect growth of 1.7% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.7 billion indicates a decrease from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Coca-Cola’s earnings is pegged at 38 cents, reflecting a 2.7% year-over-year increase.Here is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Coca-Cola does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is -1.16%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1890,KO,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) strong product portfolio, deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and innovation raise hopes. However, higher costs pertaining to product innovation are hurting margins.Recently, this marketer and distributor of energy drinks and alternative beverages announced third-quarter fiscal 2017 results.The company reported adjusted earnings of 40 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales of $909.5 million beat the consensus mark of $901.1 million by 0.9%.Meanwhile, shares of Monster Beverage have gained 42.9% year to date, outpacing the industry’s gain of 14.8%. Estimates for the current quarter and year have also inched up 2.8% and 0.7%, respectively, over the past two months, reflecting analysts’ optimism over the stock’s prospects. Key Growth DriversMonster Beverage has a wide range of brands such as Monster Energy, Java Monster, X- Presso Monster, Worx Energy and Vidration. Further, the addition of Coca-Cola’s energy drink brands has strengthened Monster Beverage’s position.The Coca-Cola deal, also denoted as TCCC deal, provides Monster Beverage full access to Coca-Cola’s world-class global distribution network. Under the agreement, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners act as Monster Beverage’s preferred distribution partner globally, thereby ensuring greater exposure for the company’s products. TCCC subsidiaries accounted for approximately 21% of the company’s net sales in the first nine months of 2017. Notably, Monster Beverage’s cash position received a major boost from the deal, which has encouraged it to consider a return of capital to its shareholders through share repurchases. Moreover, the brands acquired from TCCC, which produce concentrates or beverage bases, are high-margin products that make significant contribution to sales and gross margins.In addition to the deal, product innovation acts as a major growth driver. The company regularly introduces new flavors to existing products.Moreover, due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content and are moving toward alternatives such as energy drinks. This has been denting sales for most beverage companies like PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. . Monster Beverage in addition to carbonated soft drinks has a portfolio based on energy drinks, which should drive the company’s top line in the near term. In fact, net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 11.4% in the first nine months of 2017.ConcernsDespite the company introducing the new Mutant along with increased distribution, total Mutant sales have not been promising so far. Again, delays in Hydro, production capacity shortages related to Java Monster and Muscle Monster raise concerns. Moreover, although the company is trying to recover from operational limitations, Java Monster production issues have negatively impacted sales so far in 2017.Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s increased marketing spend to boost top-line growth and attract customers is likely to build pressure on margins. Operating expenses increased 15.1% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. Monster Beverage’s operating margin fell 10 basis points (bps) in the same time frame owing to higher general and administrative as well as marketing expenses on international expansion.Nevertheless, various innovative sales-boosting efforts are expected to drive the top line for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

1891,KO,"Coca-Cola European Partners Plc or CCEP (CCE  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Feb 15.Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.19%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 5.52%.A Few Other Factors That Might Affect Q4 Results:CCEP is gaining significant synergies from the merger and is expected to continue driving growth in the foreseeable future. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth.Last quarter, although the company registered weak revenues, its cost saving plans are helping to boost its bottom line. In the third quarter, operating expenses decreased 3% on a comparable and currency neutral basis. This reflects the synergy benefits, volume-related costs, expense timing and a continued focus on managing operating expenses. These factors contributed to operating profit growth of 3.5%, on a comparable and currency neutral basis.In the first nine months of 2017, revenues were up 3% and operating profit was up 11.5%, both on a comparable and currency neutral basis. Excluding synergies, operating profit grew about 3%, broadly in line with revenues growth in the said period. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Importantly, CCEP remains on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315-€340 million by mid-2019.Overall, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents, reflecting a 19.6% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3.1 billion, implying a 10.1% increase.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:CCEP has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is 2.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CCEP carries a Zacks Rank #3, which further increases the odds of an earnings beat.We caution against stocks with Zacks Ranks #4 and 5 (Sell-rated stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola European Partners PLC QuotePeer ReleasePepsiCo, Inc.

1892,KO,"The 2018 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Men's Basketball Tournament kicked off last week and “March Madness” is spreading among Americans. Millions  are seeking to capitalize on the opportunity by enthusiastically filling in the brackets.Though the championship has diverted a large number of Americans from the stock market and dried up trading volumes, it usually leads to a buying frenzy and strong stock gains. The year 2018 seems no different as the bull market turned nine on Mar 9 and is extending its rally driven by strong corporate earnings, massive tax cut policies and solid economic growth at home and abroad (read: 9 ETFs Winners From 9-Year Bull Run).Being the biggest modern sporting event in the United States, the championship is a money-spinner for media networks (TV, digital and social media) and advertisers, attracting billions of revenues in three weeks.What’s on A Roll?The two TV media conglomerates – CBS Corporation (CBS  -  Free Report) and Turner Sports – continued to score the highest revenues from the event by broadcasting through four networks, CBS, TNT, TBS, and truTV. In fact, CBS turned out to be the winner in the first round of the tournament with 4.98 million viewers, up 11% from last year, according to Nielsen final live-plus-same day numbers. Total viewership for the tournament across all linear and digital platforms increased  to 8.6 million, up from 8.2 million last year.Per Kantar Media, the NCAA championship generated about $1.285 billion in total advertising revenues in 2017, up 3.3% from 2016. As such, the event only trails $1.547 revenues generated from the NFL playoffs.All the games will also stream on the NCAA’s March Madness site and via “The NCAA March Madness Live App,” which is available for many devices, including iOS, Android, Roku and Apple TV. Further, social media sites like Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Instagram, and Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report) are attracting fans to their respective platforms via media deals with NCAA or Turner Sports (read: Log In to Social Media ETFs on Twitter's Strength).Apart from media, the contest is a boon to the casino industry. According to the American Gaming Association – a national trade group that represents the casino industry – March Madness could  attract $10 billion to the industry. Only 3% will be wagered legally through Nevada sports books while the remaining will be placed with offshore sportsbooks and local bookmakers.Sponsors invest millions in advertising and marketing for March Madness. Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) is one of the biggest sponsors again this year. AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) are the two other corporate champion sponsors.

1893,KO,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 3% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is KO due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Fourth-Quarter 2017 ResultsThe Coca-Cola Company reported better-than-expected results in the fourth quarter of 2017, ending the year on an impressive note. Despite reporting flat soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and re-structuring efforts. Cost-cutting initiatives led by the refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations helped it to come up with better numbers.Earnings BeatFourth-quarter 2017 comparable earnings of the company were 39 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents.Earnings also improved from the year-ago profit level of 37 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales BeatRevenues of $7.51 billion in the quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.36 billion. However, net revenues declined 20% year over year due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 11th consecutive quarterly decline. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 26% negative impact on revenues, partly offset by a 4% positive contribution of price/mix and concentrate sales growth of 1%. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Volume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume remained unchanged (similar to the preceding quarter). Emerging and developing markets saw some improvements in unit case volume. However, volumes showed no growth during the quarter in developed markets. Meanwhile, North America volume grew 1%.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume remained unchanged. Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages witnessed 2% decline (versus 1% growth in the preceding quarter). Water, enhanced water and sports drinks were up 2% (versus down 1% in the third quarter), and Tea and Coffee was up 2% (compared with 1% growth in the prior quarter).Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues grew 6% at North America, 6% at Europe, the Middle East & Africa, and 14% at Latin America segment. However, revenues declined 1% in the Asia Pacific segment.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 3% in North America, 8% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 13% in Latin America, 1% in Asia Pacific and 12% in Bottling Investments.Geographic AnalysisThe company has five operating segments – Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Latin America, North America, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments.EMEA division registered revenues of $1.75 billion, up 6.1% year over year driven by solid marketing and innovation along with improved alignment with its bottling partners.Price/mix growth of 6% for the quarter was driven by strong price/pack initiatives across Europe and Southern Africa. Organic revenues grew 8%.Unit case volume remained flat year over year as solid volume growth across the Central & Eastern Europe business unit and Turkey were offset by declines across Africa and the Middle East.The Latin America segment registered revenues of $1.12 billion, up 14% year over year. Price/mix was 11% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Organic revenues grew 13%.Unit case volume was flat as volume growth in Brazil and the South Latin business unit was offset by 1% decline in both Mexico and the Latin Center business unit.The North America segment revenues totaled $2.62 billion, increasing 6% year over year. Organic revenues grew 3% in the quarter. Price/mix growth of 2% for the quarter, including sparkling price/mix growth of 3%, reflected the continued execution of the company's disciplined occasion, brand, price, package and channel strategy, as well as strong performance in the foodservice business.Unit case volume grew 1% in the quarter. Sparkling soft drinks volume growth was even. Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages declined 1% as mid single-digit growth in Minute Maid and Simply was offset by a decline in Hi-C. Tea and coffee grew 8% while water, enhanced water and sports drinks accelerated to 3% growth.The Asia-Pacific segment registered revenues of $1.03 billion, down 1% from the year ago quarter, on account of negative currency impact. Organic revenues were up 1% in the quarter and price/mix was down 2%. Unit case volume growth of 2% in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in the ASEAN business unit, partially offset by 1% decline in both the Greater China & Korea business unit, and Japan. The decline in China was largely due to timing of the Chinese New Year.Bottling Investments segment revenues decreased 69% (up 12% on an organic basis) to $1.27 billion as volumes declined 32% and structural headwinds impacted revenues by 83%.During the three months ended Dec 31, 2017, intersegment revenues were $42 million for Europe, Middle East & Africa, $19 million for Latin America, $187 million for North America, $69 million for Asia Pacific and $12 million for Bottling Investments.Price/mix growth of 15% in the quarter was largely driven by the timing of various bottler funding settlements and positive price/mix within the India bottling operations.MarginsAdjusted consolidated gross margin expanded 480 basis points (bps) year over year to 64.2%. The company’s comparable operating margin grew 540 bps to 26.5% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower-margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts.Other DevelopmentsThe company remains on track to pursue Revenue Growth Management (""RGM"") initiatives across its key markets that include the South Latin and Central & Eastern Europe business units.Coca-Cola has been focusing more on creating a consumer-centric brand portfolio. The beverage giant expanded its Venturing & Emerging Brands model to Central & Eastern Europe, partnering with Coca-Cola HBC AG in September 2017.Meanwhile, throughout the year, the company also made major decisions related to profitable growth by deprioritizing low-margin water in major markets including China, Japan and Mexico.Coca-Cola now has fully refranchised after the closing of two important territories during the quarter in the United States.2017 HighlightsFull-year comparable earnings came in at $1.91, same as the year-ago adjusted profit level.Net revenues were $35.41 billion, down 15% from $41.86 billion in 2016. Organically, revenues grew 3% for the full year.2018 GuidanceOrganic revenues are expected to rise 4%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 17%, while Fx is likely to have a positive effect of 1% on revenues. Again, revenues will be positively impacted by 1% to 2% from Accounting Standards Update 2014-09.Comparable currency income before income taxes (structurally adjusted) is expected to increase 8-9%. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable income before taxes by 0-1%. Structural changes are likely to have a 2% negative impact on it. The company expects adjusted EPS to grow 8-10% from the prior year’s comparable EPS of $1.91. The company expects to buy back shares worth $1 billion in 2018.

1894,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, has been losing its position lately due to a dismal surprise trend for both top and bottom lines. Notably, the company posted lower-than-expected earnings and sales for fourth-quarter 2017, which marked its fifth negative earnings surprise in the trailing six quarters. Moreover, revenues lagged estimates in three of the last four quarters.Looking on the surface, probably this was the reason for the slump of FEMSA shares in the past few months. To be precise, the FEMSA stock declined 6% in the last six months, wider than the industry’s 2.7% downside. Though it is easy to believe that softer-than-expected results are hurting the stock, let’s find out more.The unfavorable fourth-quarter 2017 results can be attributed to the change in the accounting method for Coca-Cola FEMSA’s Venezuelan operation. Further, the bottom line was impacted by soft operating margins due to higher operating expenses at Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF  -  Free Report) and FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division.Notably, operating margin for Coca-Cola FEMSA – the world’s largest franchise bottler for Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), contracted 80 basis points (bps) mainly due to higher freight expenses, labor costs as well as diesel and gasoline prices. Moreover, operating margin for FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division declined 30 bps due to higher operating expenses.Taking a long view, FEMSA has been grappling with soft margins for more than a year now, attributed to margin pressures at Coca-Cola FEMSA and the growth of lower-margin businesses at FEMSA Comercio. We note that operating margin declined 60 bps, 90 bps and 110 bps in the first, second and third quarters of 2017, respectively. While the company’s flat operating margin in the fourth quarter reflects an improved trend, the company has still not returned to posting positive margins.While the downside story looks convincing, we remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures, which include increasing store count, diversifying its business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. FEMSA has been taking prudent steps to diversify its product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bodes well for future operating performance.Moreover, the company’s focus on achieving growth via acquisitions bode well. Furthermore, its exposure to various industries including beverage, beer and retail, gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. The company gets its exposure to the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA, while the exposure to the beer industry relates to its 14.76% stake in Heineken (HEINY  -  Free Report). Rightly, FEMSA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

Reported revenues also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.44 billion.Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 2.3% on an organic basis, primarily driven by higher demand for food/snacks in the Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), Latin America and Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) segments. Notably, overall organic sales growth was better than the 1.7% rise recorded in the previous quarter.Total volumes remained unchanged during the quarter against 1% growth in the previous quarter.

However, revenues improved 6% in Latin America and 11% in ESSA segments. Meanwhile, revenues at AMENA remained unchanged.Notably, the company’s NAB segment was negatively impacted by higher input costs, operating cost inflation and restructuring charges that substantially offset productivity gains. Moreover, the 53rd reporting week in the prior year and hurricane-related costs also added to the woes. Organic sales and beverage volumes were down 3% and 2%, respectively, in the quarter.Operating profits (on a reported basis) increased 20% in Latin America and 173% in AMENA.

1896,KO,"Welcome to a Winter Olympics edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we explore the companies driving the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.The next two weeks are massively important for NBC Universal and its parent company Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), as the media conglomerate has spent billions of dollars to broadcast the Olympics for years to come.NBC outbid Fox (FOXA  -  Free Report) and Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) ABC and ESPN to earn its domestic broadcast rights. The company has since sought to innovate its coverage through a recent streaming push and future-looking partnerships with firms such as Snap Inc. (SNAP).One of the main reasons NBC can justify spending this money is because advertisers are willing to shell out the cash to promote their brands during the global athletic showcase. This year, Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Famers Insurance, Hershey (HSY  -  Free Report), and many others are official NBC partners.But there are also 13 top dogs: the firms that spend over $100 million to become official International Olympic Committee sponsors. This list includes Visa V, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), along with recently added tech giants Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) and Intel INTC—which will give fans a taste of its virtual reality capabilities from Pyeongchang.The Olympics are also a time for companies and apparel brands to attach themselves to athletes. Ralph Lauren (RL  -  Free Report) outfitted Team USA with gear for the opening ceremonies, while medal winners will sport Nike (NKE  -  Free Report) on the podiums. Even Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) got back in the action after some athletes panned its gear in 2014.And this year’s games were awarded to South Korea, due in large part to a push from the former head of one of the world’s most well-known technology companies.

1897,KO,"NBC Universal’s coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea kicked off last week. Now, throughout the duration of the Games, NBC and its parent company, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report), will showcase Olympic athletes, its own networks and streaming services, as well as major Olympic sponsors.The Olympics are a time for NBC to shine—and prove to investors why it committed to pay billions of dollars for the domestic broadcast rights for the Games through 2032. This two-week stretch is also a time for NBC to cash in from big-time advertisers that see the games as a vital marketing opportunity.During the current four-year Olympic cycle there are 13 official International Olympic Committee sponsors, including Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report), and GE (GE  -  Free Report). These companies pay millions of dollars to advertise during the Olympics and promote specific products and services.With that said, let’s take a look at three IOC sponsors that are using Pyeongchang and the packed two-week Olympic broadcast and streaming schedule to tout business innovations.1.       Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report)Intel is one of the newest official IOC sponsors, signing on after the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio. The company is set to show off its VR tech over the two weeks. Pyeongchang will be Intel’s “largest-scale virtual reality event to date” and the first time it has offered fans VR at the Winter Olympics. The company is set to shoot and distribute 30 events—half live and half on-demand—allowing users to choose from 6 different camera angles.Fans can access this coverage via the NBC Sports VR app, powered by Intel True VR. On top of that, Intel also partnered with South Korean communications firm KT Corporation in order to give fans in South Korea a taste of a broad-scale 5G network.Intel is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an overall “A” VGM score. Analysts have also recently upped their earnings estimates in a unanimous fashion for the company’s current fiscal year.2.       Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report)This financial services powerhouse is committed to the Olympics and has used the event as a powerful promotional and marketing tool for years. In fact, Visa has been an official Olympic sponsor since 1986. As part of its current IOC deal, Visa will be the “exclusive payment technology partner and the only card accepted at the Olympic Games through 2020.”In Pyeongchang, Visa is set to show off its contactless-payment technology. The company will enable both fans and athletes to pay for everything with Olympic-inspired contactless payment-enabled gloves, stickers, and collectable Olympic pins. Visa noted that it will have over 1,000 different contactless-enabled terminals throughout the area.Looking ahead to Visa’s upcoming quarter, the company is expected to see its earnings surge 17% year-over-year, based current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Investors might also be happy to note that Visa has earned a massive amount of upward earnings revisions for its current quarter, as well as the full year and the following year. Visa is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).3.      Panasonic Corp. (PCRFY  -  Free Report) This Japanese technology firm has been a worldwide Olympic partner since 1987. Panasonic is set to showcase the full range of its products in Pyeongchang over the next few weeks. The company will provide its large screen, LED display systems—along with its security camera system—at an array of events in South Korea.Panasonic is already looking ahead to the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where it will play an even larger role than it is in South Korea. The tech poweris projected to expand its EPS figure at an annualized rate of nearly 25% over the next three to five years, which is rather impressive for a company of its size.Panasonic is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts “A” grades for both Value and Momentum in our Styles Score system, helping it earn an overall “A” VGM score.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1898,KO,"NCAA March Madness begins Thursday morning, and when the games tip off it marks the start of one of the richest months in sports. But while people around the U.S. begin to stare at scores, check their brackets, and make initial payments on their office pools, let’s take a look at where the real money is made.TV Money Two years ago, at the end of the 2016 men’s college basketball tournament, CBS (CBS  -  Free Report) and Time Warner’s  Turner extended their already-massive March Madness rights deal. The previous 14-year, $10.8 billion deal was set to end after the 2024 tournament. The new contract tacked on eight years and $8.8 billion, and now runs through 2032.The new deal pays an average of $1.1 billion per season, up from $770 million on the current contract, for the roughly three week basketball extravaganza. This is clearly a lot of money to pay for the rights to broadcast and stream just 63 games—not including the play-in games.Yet both CBS and Tuner understand that this continued investment is a well-calculated risk at a time when advertisers flee linear television in favor of Facebook (FB), Google (GOOGL  -  Free Report), and other online outlets. Their bet is that live sports will remain a viable money-making business for the foreseeable future.The most recent deal also includes language that will see CBS and Turner own the exclusive rights no matter how people actually consume March Madness content in 2030.“Whatever new platforms develop, we have all of those rights,” CBS Sports Chairman Sean McManus told the Wall Street Journal in 2016. “If people are watching on a skinny bundle, a phone or Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) TV, we have the ability to exploit all of those rights going forward.”CBS and Turner share these rights across an array of channels, alternating which network broadcasts the Final Four and championship game. TBS will broadcast the climax of the college basketball season this year, while fans will be able to watch almost all of the games live on streaming services and March Madness Live—though login information is required for TBS, TNT, and truTV games.NCAAThe NCAA pulled in a record $1.06 billion in fiscal 2017, which includes tournament broadcast rights, as well as tickets sales—$129.4 million, including the NIT—and roughly $60 million in marketing rights deals.This money is then used to fund scholarships, stipends, medical insurance, travel, and a slew of other programs for most non-revenue generating sports across the country.Marketing The NCAA Tournament is played at a nearly perfect time in order to generate the most viewership and buzz. The NFL season is over, MLB is just staring to gear up, and the NBA playoffs are still about a month away. Therefore companies pour millions of advertising and marketing dollars into March Madness.Capital One (COF  -  Free Report) is one of the biggest sponsors again this year, with hundreds of commercials scheduled to appear while its name remains splattered all over the official NCAA tournament website—including “The Capital One March Madness Bracket Challenge.”AT&T (T  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) are the two other “presented by” sponsors this year.Sportswear Giants Aside from TV coverage, marketing, and advertising, the players themselves are also walking billboards for three companies.Nike (NKE  -  Free Report), Adidas (ADDYY  -  Free Report), and Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) will be on display over the next three weeks on the chests, legs, ankles, and feet of nearly every athlete. These companies often provide schools and teams monetary benefits for winning or making it past a certain round of the tournament.Check back later for a complete breakdown of which sportswear company dominates March Madness and how the other two stack up.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

1899,KO,"Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM  -  Free Report) is set to buy a B2B eCommerce software provider, which will mark the company’s second acquisition this year. Though the world’s leading customer-relationship management-solution provider has not made any announcement regarding this, the to-be-acquired company — CloudCraze — has revealed this news on its website. However, financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Founded in 2009, this Chicago-based start-up provides eCommerce platform to enterprises. The company’s B2B commerce software is built on Salesforce’s platform. Till its formation, CloudCraze had raised more than $30 million through venture funding, according to Crunchbase. Notably, Salesforce’s investment arm — Salesforce Ventures — had backed the company’s $20-million funding round in 2017.Rationale Behind the AcquisitionThe transaction is believed to be beneficial for Salesforce as the acquisition will enhance its capabilities and thereby help capture the growing opportunity in the B2B commerce industry. President and chief customer officer of CloudCraze, Ray Grady, in his blog yesterday, noted that the industry is anticipated to reach a value of $1.2 trillion by 2021 from the $889 billion at present.Furthermore, CloudCraze has a strong customer base with some big names like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Adidas, General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report), Ecolab, Land O’ Lakes, and WABCO. Therefore, with this acquisition, Salesforce will be able to pitch its existing B2B clients to use CloudCraze’s software.Bottom LineAcquisitions have always been one of Salesforce’s key growth strategies. Although the company remained almost silent throughout 2017 on the acquisition front (just one — Sequence), this year it might repeat the likes of 2016, when Salesforce bought 12 companies, to boost its capabilities, and grab newer and larger markets.We believe Salesforce’s continued focus on expanding its business through strategic acquisitions and investments will drive growth over the long run.Notably, the stock has appreciated 51.6% over the past year, significantly outperforming 40.2% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, Salesforce carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1900,KO,"Increasing revenues have been a big challenge for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) for the last few quarters amid lower demand for carbonated soft drinks or CSD.The beverage giant is leaving no stone unturned to boost revenues. The company is working on strategic initiatives in order to make its portfolio a total beverage company. This is mostly via improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins. However, the top line needs to show sustained improvement.Meanwhile, the company’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to on a year-to-date basis. The stock has returned 9.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 13.3%.Innovations, Productivity Improvements and Cost-Saving Efforts Bode WellCoca-Cola’s total sales decreased 14% in the first nine months of 2017. In fact, the company’s total sales decreased 15% year over year in the third quarter, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Sales of the company’s carbonated beverages are suffering due to increasing health consciousness among consumers. Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category by providing increased marketing support through innovations and strong integrated campaigns. Coca-Cola is also pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.The recent approach in this field by Coca-Cola has been the launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, replacing Coke Zero, in the United States in Aug 2017. Coke Zero Sugar globally grew high single digit in the third quarter.Again, Coca-Cola made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States in the third quarter of 2017.Apart from these sales building strategies, Coca-Cola has been doing well to boost its profit level on the back of improved productivity and better market execution. Despite generating lower profits, the company’s earnings of 50 cents per share in the third quarter improved 2% year over year, helped by ongoing productivity efforts. Lower SG&A expense (down 20%), higher gross margin (up 170 basis points or bps), and higher operating margin (up 404 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Moreover, the company is on track to achieve total annualized productivity saving target of approximately $3.8 billion by 2019 from the initiatives takes under this program since its beginning.Additionally, Coca-Cola had a nice dividend yield of 3.23% (as of Nov 29) that grew regularly. The company has increased its dividend for 55 consecutive years, including the 8%, 6% and 6% dividend hikes in 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively. Share buybacks continue to be significant, as it helps companies increase earnings per share with a reduced share base.Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Other Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the Consumer Staples sector are Pilgrim's Pride Corporation (PPC  -  Free Report) and Tyson Foods, Inc.

1901,KO,"Recently, major investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) raised its oil price projection for 2018, giving a rosy picture for the commodity. The investment bank expects the global benchmark Brent crude to cross $80 per barrel this year on growing oil demand and the extension of the agreement between OPEC countries and Russia to limit production.In January, JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) analysts raised their price forecasts for oil for the current year. The banking major believes that Brent crude will touch $70 a barrel while U.S. crude will average $65.63 a barrel in 2018. This increase in projections is based on the assumption that global demand for energy will rise substantially over the current year. Additionally, for Q4 as a whole, earnings improvement is expected to be positive for the energy sector with double-digit growth. Earnings growth for energy is the highest among all sectors, with total earnings expected to be up 150.1% from the same period last year on 23.1% higher revenues. (Read More: Standout Features of the Q4 Earnings Season)With TransCanada Corporation (TRP  -  Free Report) and Enbridge Inc. (ENB  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Feb 15 and Feb 16, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both the energy infrastructure companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from Feb 12 to Feb 16 include Cisco Systems, Inc. (CSCO  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceWhen considering price performance over the last three months, TransCanada has lost 13.6%, a lot worse than the broader industry’s 2.3% decrease. On the other hand, Enbridge has lost only 6.3% over this period.Current RatioThis metric measures the ability of a company to meet its short-term debt obligations efficiently. In other words, it is the ratio of the current level of total assets and versus the current level of liabilities. Here, Enbridge is a clear winner with a current ratio of 0.64, which is superior to TransCanada’s reading of 0.51.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt-servicing capacity. In the context of the oil and gas pipeline industry, which bears a high level of debt, it is an indicator of the company’s long-term sustainability. TransCanada has a debt-to-equity ratio of 158.4, while the industry has debt-to-equity ratio of 108.5. In contrast, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 101.03 Enbridge wins this round.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, the industry had an average dividend yield of 4.86%, higher than 4.84% for TransCanada. However, Enbridge has an average dividend yield of 5.6%, better than both the industry and its peer TransCanada. So Enbridgeshareholders have more reasons to cheer.ValuationEV/EBITDA ratio is one of the best multiples for valuing oil and gas production and pipeline companies because these firms have a large amount of debt and EV (Enterprise Value). Compared with the S&P 500, the broader industry is undervalued. This implies that the industry has upside potential with an average trailing 12-month EV/EBITDA ratio of 16.27.Enbridgethat has an EV/EBITDA ratioof 22.77 is overvalued than the industry. With an EV/EBITDA ratioof only 13.5 TransCanada is clearly less pricey than both Enbridge and the industry.Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsWhen considering the earnings history, TransCanada and Enbridgehave delivered negative average earnings surprises of -1.7% and -7%, respectively.Both TransCanada and Enbridge missed their earnings estimate in the fourth quarter of 2016 and the first quarter of 2017. However, the earnings performance for both the companies has been similar over the second and third quarters of 2017. While TransCanada beat its earnings estimate in the second quarter of 2017, it managed to only meet the same in the third quarter of 2017. On the other hand, Enbridge beat its earnings estimate in the third quarter of 2017, even though it missed in the second.Both Enbridge and TransCanada have a positive Earnings ESP. While this is a leading indicator of a positive surprise for the two, Enbridge’s ESP of +4.98% is more impressive than TransCanada’s +1.33%.ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that TransCanada has an edge over Enbridge when considering EV/EBITDA ratios. However, when considering price performance, current ratio and debt-to-equity ratio Enbridge is a better stock than TransCanada. Additionally, Enbridge sports a better dividend yield than TransCanada and a more comprehensive look at the four-quarter earnings performance, places the former better too.What clinches the case in favor of Enbridge at this point of time is that it has a better ESP than TransCanada. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Enbridge over TransCanada as both prepare to report earnings over the next few days.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

Management from both firms hope that Keurig Dr Pepper, with its portfolio of brands including 7UP, A&W root beer, and the widely-popular single-serve coffee systems, will be able to offer “unrivaled distribution capability to reach virtually every point-of-sale in North America.”“Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs, versus traditional manufacturer-defined segments, unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high-growth formats,” Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort said in a statement.The companies noted that they expect to create $600 million of annual savings by 2021. This merger comes as soda companies face more pressure to offer healthier options. Before this deal, Dr Pepper had been one of the slowest soda companies to begin to diversify its offerings. Soft drinks still accounted for about 80% of its annual revenue in 2016.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

1903,KO,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 2. We note that this cosmetics giant has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise for 13 and three consecutive quarters, respectively. The company has been gaining from focus on strategic acquisitions, sturdy foothold in the beauty space and robust online and travel retail network. Let’s see if Estee Lauder can keep its spectacular surprise streak alive this time too.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Factors at PlayEstee Lauder has been witnessing year-over year top-line growth for more than two years now, while its bottom line depicted growth in the past three quarters. The cosmetics big-wig’s splendid past record and investors’ confidence in its prospects is well reflected by the 69.1% surge in its shares over a year. This also crushed the industry’s rally of 38%. Focus on Buyouts, Online & Travel Retail to Drive Q2 ResultsWe expect Estee Lauder to continue gaining from its robust brand portfolio across most categories, benefits from acquisitions and solid presence in emerging markets. Notably, the buyouts of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) have strengthened Estee Lauder’s fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed significantly to sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 3 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in the second quarter. Also, the investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is likely to aid beauty sales.Estee Lauder also has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years. Thanks to technological advancement and the growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic in the last quarter and remains a major growth driver. Estee Lauder is also growing its sales in China through T-mall, the largest digital platform run by Chinese e-commerce giant, Alibaba. Estee Lauder remains focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Prospects from China Bode WellWhile Estee Lauder has a solid presence in emerging markets, solid prospects from China appear bright, as sales in this region soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in all brands, with MAC, Tom Ford and Lab Series businesses nearly doubling year over year. Also, management stated that its makeup business doubled for the second straight quarter, whereas performance of its skin care and luxury fragrance business also remained favorable in the quarter. The company’s operations in China have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management thus envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from Asia/Pacific region is pegged at $763 million, depicting year-over-year growth of 15.8%.Skin Care & Makeup Categories Remain Major DriversAll these factors, along with growth in travel retail have been spurring growth at Estee Lauder and are most likely to sustain this trend in the quarter to be reported. Among all categories, Estee Lauder’s skin care and makeup categories have been performing particularly well for nearly a year. In the last quarter, skin care and makeup sales advanced 16% and 18% year over year, respectively. We expect these categories to remain major drivers in the second quarter as well.Turning to estimates for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for skincare and makeup sales is currently pegged at $1,434 million and $1,515 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 15% and 16%, respectively. Further, the consensus mark for fragrance and hair care sales is $553 million and $147 million, compared with the year-ago period sales of $497 million and $137 million, respectively.Q2 Expectations as a WholeClearly, Estee Lauder is expected to continue with its top and bottom-line growth trend in the second quarter. Incidentally, management forecasts net sales growth of 13-15% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 10-11%. Currency is expected to positively impact second-quarter sales by 3-4%.Further, the company envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $1.38-$1.41 per share for the second quarter. The earnings range marks an increase of 13% to 15% over the prior-year earnings. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 8-10%.Encouragingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings witnessed an uptrend in the past 30 days, and is now pegged at $1.43, which represents more than 17% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,673 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago reported figure.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Estee Lauder is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

1904,KO,"In a bid to enhance shareholders' value, Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) announced a new $500-million share buyback plan. Also, the new program does not have any expiry date and is expected to be made in the open market or via privately negotiated transactions. Following the news, the company’s shares moved up 5.4% on Wednesday’s trading session.Share repurchase is an important tool, which enables a company to boost the value of shares. Since the repurchase reduces the number of shares outstanding, it thereby increases earnings per share and boosts the market value of the remaining shares.Monster Beverage has been very active on the share repurchase front. In February 2017, the company’s board authorized a share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $500 million of the company’s outstanding common stock.During the three months ended Mar 31, 2018, Monster Beverage purchased 4.3 million shares of common stock at an average purchase price of $57.74 per share, for a total amount of $249.9 million (excluding broker commissions), which exhausted the availability under the February 2017 Repurchase Plan.Again in February 2018, the company’s board authorized a new share repurchase program for the purchase of up to $250.0 million of the company’s outstanding common stock. Notably, there is no availability remaining under this program.Will Share Repurchase Revive the Stock?This Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 17.9% so far this year, which indicates investors’ low confidence in the company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 also fell 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, over the past 30 days, reflecting analysts’ concern.Of late, Monster Beverage has been grappling with multiple headwinds. Health-conscious consumers are opting for healthier alternatives. This shift in consumer preference is impacting sales of companies like Monster Beverage and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Again, a decline in gross margin raises concern. Higher raw material costs (mainly aluminum and sweeteners) and unfavorable product mix hurt margin. First-quarter 2018 gross margin contracted 420 basis points (bps) to 60.6% due to higher promotional allowances, geographical and domestic product sales mix. Operating expenses increased 8.6% from the prior-year quarter to $235.3 million.The new share repurchase is expected to boost Monster Beverage’s earnings and raise shareholders’ value.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

1905,KO,"Welcome to a Super Bowl LII edition of the Full-Court Finance podcast from Zacks Investment Research. On this week’s episode, we dive into the business behind the big game, looking specifically at which companies took advantage of the Super Bowl’s massive television reach.Last night, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the New England Patriots 41-33 in an epic game that wasn’t decided until the final whistle. But while the teams battled it out on the field, some of the biggest companies in the world spent millions of dollars on advertisements designed to become the talk of offices, bars, and living rooms around the country over the next few weeks.NBC’s (CMCSA  -  Free Report) coverage of Super Bowl 52 was officially brought to us by Pizza Hut YUM, Kraft KHC, U.S. Bank (USB  -  Free Report), Sprint (S  -  Free Report), Disney’s (DIS  -  Free Report) new Solo: A Star Wars Story movie, and a few others.On top of ads from these companies, Toyota (TM  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) showed off multiple campaigns and sponsored halftime, where Justin Timberlake helped Nike NKE subtly sell exclusive new Jordan Brand sneakers.Some of the biggest Super Bowl ad spenders over the last 20 years, such as Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU  -  Free Report) and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), all poured money into ads once again.Familiar names also presented some unfamiliar messages. Peyton and Eli Manning stole a little Super Bowl spotlight, while Procter and Gamble’s PG Tide ads, featuring Stranger Things star David Harbour, might just have stolen the show.Tech giants were also some of last night’s big winners. Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) star-packed Alexa spot—which featured CEO Jeff Bezos—is sure to be seen all over the internet, social media, and television for months to come. Alphabet’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube TV sponsored NBC’s pre-game show—and might have just inspired some to cut their cords following the game.Another linear-television competitor, Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report), spent millions on a Super Bowl LII commercial for its Cloverfield Paradox movie, which users could watch on-demand right after the game.If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1906,KO,"Shares of Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  soared more than 22% on Jan 29 after news came out that the beverage company will be acquired by coffee-maker Keurig Green Mountain, Inc.Terms of the DealPer the terms of the transaction, which has been approved by Dr Pepper Snapple’s board of directors, the company’s shareholders will receive a special cash dividend of $130.75 per share, making the deal worth $18.7 billion. Dr Pepper Snapple’s shareholders will retain 13% ownership of the combined entity, while Keurig shareholders will own the remaining 87%.European investment fund JAB Holding, which helped take Keurig private for $13.9 billion in 2016, will make a $9 billion equity investment as a part of the transaction financing, and will be the controlling shareholder when the transaction closes in the second quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, snack giant Mondelez International Inc. (MDLZ  -  Free Report) — JAB Holding's partner in Keurig — is slated to have about 13-14% stake in the merged entity.Both Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple will continue to operate from their respective headquarters, and their leadership will run their businesses.Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Quote Keurig Dr Pepper’s Impact on the IndustryThe new company, known as Keurig Dr Pepper, will have $11 billion in combined pro forma revenues and will realize $600 million in synergies on an annualized basis by 2021, per the companies. The merger creates a portfolio that contains a number of iconic beverage companies that includes Dr Pepper, 7UP, Snapple, A&W root beer, Mott’s apple juice, Sunkist and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, which includes the Keurig single-serve coffee business.The combined company's new CEO, Keurig's Bob Gamgort, says that Dr Pepper Snapple's distribution network will help market drinks such as Peet's Coffee and Forto coffee shops, while Keurig's online presence will boost sales of Dr Pepper Snapple’s products through digital platforms like Amazon.com Inc. As such, the Keurig-Dr Pepper deal would mark the largest soft-drink deal in history.Overall, the deal is likely to push JAB Holdings into escalating competition with beverage giants like of Coca-Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).The deal primarily validates the ongoing trouble in the food and beverage industry. Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for beverage industry giants to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company.Continuing decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are creating headaches for many established players like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dr Pepper Snapple, leading to lower volumes and weak sales. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has been facing challenges, as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales. This shift in consumer preferences resulted in Dr Pepper Snapple’s soda sales declining for the12th consecutive year in 2016.In order to combat this weakness, the company added Bai Brands in January 2017 to its priority portfolio, one of the fastest growing beverage brands that offer a family of premium better-for-you beverages. However, despite its efforts, Dr Pepper Snapple has about 8.5% of the U.S. non-alcoholic beverage market and has been the slowest to diversify its offerings alongside market leaders Coca Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc., according to the consultancy Euromonitor International.In the words of Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort, “Our view of the industry through the lens of consumer needs, versus traditional manufacturer-defined segments, unlocks the opportunity to combine hot and cold beverages and create a platform to increase exposure to high-growth formats.”Dr Pepper Snapple holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1907,KO,"The Consumer Staples sector has been garnering a lot of investor attention lately. The recent increase in volatility and uncertainty in the markets has increased the appeal of defensive sector investments like Consumer Staples.Cause for AppealOn Oct 19, the Senate passed a budget of $4 trillion in a 51-49 vote, which will allow the Republicans to move ahead with the tax cuts with a simple majority instead of the 60-vote supermajority that is generally required. However, uncertainty is mounting on the timely passing of the U.S. tax reform. Per Washington Post reports, Senate Republican leaders are weighing the impact of a one-year delay in reforms.The primary concern weighing on the timely passing of the tax reform is that the House and Senate’s respective versions vary significantly. This might then pose some challenges in the passing of the reform without a few key changes.Moreover, the Republicans have a slim majority in the Senate. If Roy Moore is defeated in the Dec 12 elections, the majority will be further reduced. This increased uncertainty has led to the relative appeal of staples.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and tracks the Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $7.9 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 34 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as over 68.5% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Beverages, Household Products and Food & Staples Retailing, with 24.6%, 20.9% and 20.0% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 12.7%, 10.0% and 9.1% allocation, respectively (as of Nov 13, 2017).  The fund has returned 8.0% in a year and 5.6% year to date (as of Nov 13, 2017). XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a Medium risk outlook.Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index. It has AUM of $3.7 billion and charges a fee of 10 basis points a year. It has 102 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as almost 62% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Household Products, Soft Drinks and Fertilizers & Packaged Foods & Meats, with 19.6%, 19.1% and 17.1% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola Co and Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) with 11.6%, 9.0% and 8.5% allocation, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund has returned 7.1% in a year and 4.2% year to date (as of Nov 13, 2017). VDC has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a High risk outlook (read: ETFs in Focus After Phillip Morris's Downbeat Results).Bottom LineXLP is more popular than VDC, as is evident from its higher AUM. However, VDC may be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  Moreover, VDC also has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings.At the same time, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. XLP returned 1.4% more than VDC so far this year, whereas in a year, XLP outperformed VDC by 0.9%. With growing uncertainty in the markets, these ETFs are poised to offer better growth potential. However, the sector has had relatively poor performance so far this year, owing to investors’ risk appetite. Moreover, if the tax reforms are enacted, the appeal of such defensive investments will be lost as investors will seek riskier investments.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1908,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has plans to boost its investment in Argentina. The beverage giant intends to invest $1.2 billion in the country within the time period of 2019-2021, as stated by the company in a statement on May 29. Earlier, Coca-Cola had plans to invest $1 billion in the 2016-2018 time frame.Coca-Cola was one of the companies to initiate a major investment in Argentina after Macri took charge in late 2015, promising business-friendly reforms.Notably, the company’s performance in Latin America clearly improved in the last reported quarter, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, where modest volume growth was witnessed. In fact, improvement in the key markets like India, Argentina and Brazil was noticed in the second half of 2017 and in first-quarter 2018.The Latin America segment registered revenues of $998 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 8% from the prior-year quarter. Price/mix growth was 6% in the quarter, primarily driven by strong price/mix in Mexico and the South Latin business unit. Organic revenues grew 6%.Unit case volume increased 1%, as low to mid-single-digit growth in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico was offset by a decline in both Peru and Chile.Coca-Cola has a commanding presence in the developing and emerging markets of Latin America, India, Russia and China, courtesy of the growth opportunities that these countries provide. More than half of the company’s revenues are generated outside the United States.First-Quarter 2018 At a GlanceCoca-Cola started 2018 on a solid note, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts in the first quarter. In addition to a notable increase in soda volumes, it also gained from its growing beverage portfolio and restructuring efforts. Organic sales grew 5%, led by price/mix improvement of 1% and concentrate sales growth of 4%. Currency also had a 2% positive impact on revenues. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 24.2%), along with higher gross margin (up 270 basis points or bps) and operating margin (up 600 bps) helped it come up with better earnings (up 8%).However, total sales decreased 16% year over year, marking the 12th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Although the top line is yet to show sustained improvement, we are encouraged by its strategic efforts to transform its portfolio into a total beverage company, with improved marketing and innovation, focus on driving revenues by improved price/mix, digital focus, and productivity initiatives toward driving margins.Share Price PerformanceCoca-Cola’s shares have lost 7% year to date, comparing favorably with the industry’s 11.3% decline. Earnings estimates for 2018 have moved 0.5% north in the past 60 days, while the same remained stable for 2019. This reflects analysts’ optimism on the stock’s earnings potential.Making the most of the growth opportunities in the emerging countries, along with improved marketing and innovation will drive its revenues.Changing demographics and purchasing behavior make it essential for Coca-Cola, and other food as well as beverage giants like PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on the primary consumer insights that identify growing trends.The company currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1909,KO,"In line with its strategy to shift toward healthier options, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) will acquire Bare Foods, a U.S.-based maker of baked fruit and vegetable snacks.  No terms of the deal were disclosed.Buyout BenefitsThe addition of Bare Foods’ fruit and vegetable chips will expand Frito-Lay’s better-for-you snack offerings. Also, Bare Foods’ baked crunchy fruit and vegetable assortments resonate well with current consumer preference. Bare Foods products are Non-GMO Project verified and come with clean labels.Performance with PurposeThe decision to add this organic food maker is well in line with PepsiCo’s Performance with Purpose initiative, which aims to increase healthier food options in PepsiCo’s portfolio.""For nearly a dozen years, PepsiCo has been committed to Performance with Purpose, our vision of making more nutritious products, while also reducing added sugars, salt and saturated fat. Bare Snacks fits perfectly within that vision,"" states Indra Nooyi, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo.Notably, PepsiCo’s recent efforts toward innovation in snacks focus on higher-margin healthy and premium offerings, since there is a definitive market for such products now. Nutritional products have increased the percentage of the company’s total portfolio from 38% in 2006 to 50% in 2017. This percentage is likely to increase considering the company’s rapid innovation and focus on adapting to changing consumer preferences.Moreover, PepsiCo has augmented its beverage portfolio to include more non-carbonated beverages to reduce dependence on colas. As of Mar 24, 2018, PepsiCo increased the volume mix of non-carbonated beverages by 7 percentage points since 2010. The company has been growing its value share in a number of its fastest-growing categories including tea, enhanced water and sparkling water. Meanwhile, tea portfolio under Lipton and Pure Leaf has driven retail sales in the range of mid-single digits to as high as 21% over the past 17 quarters.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it essential for PepsiCo and other food as well as beverage giants like Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been a prime concern for consumers in recent times. Capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any food and beverage company.Price PerformancePepsiCo’s shares have lost around 16% year to date, compared with the Zacks Soft Beverages industry's decline of 11.2%. Also, earnings estimates have moved downward by 1 cent for 2018 and 2 cents for 2019 in the last 30 days.Nevertheless, we believe that the company’s new product lineup consisting of healthier options, productivity improvement and cost-saving initiatives should boost profits and the stock’s performance in the upcoming quarters. Zacks RankPepsiCo carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1910,KO,"Consumers’ tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are a concern for beverage giants like The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report). Despite these challenges, the two cola behemoths are major players of the food and beverage industry.In this context, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, which are scheduled to report earnings on Apr 24 and Apr 26, respectively, assume greater significance. Both soft drink giants carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other major stocks reporting earnings from Apr 23 to Apr 27 include Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report).Price PerformancePepsiCo has lost 6.9% in the past year, in contrast to the broader industry’s gain of 2.4% during the same period.In comparison, Coca-Cola has outperformed the broader industry as well as its rival, gaining 2.9% over the same time frame.ValuationThe price to sales (P/S) ratio is particularly relevant in a consumer focused industry whose fortunes are dictated by the ebb and flow of sales. This ratio indicates that market value of each of the company’s sales dollars in the industry. The industry has an average trailing 12-month P/S ratio of 4.79.While coming to the two stocks under consideration, with a P/S ratio of 2.22 PepsiCo is undervalued than the broader industry. Meanwhile, Coca-Colawith a P/S ratio of 5.73 is obviously pricier.Net MarginProfitability ratios acquire greater importance in an industry characterized by high margins. Net margin is a good metric to compare the profitability of companies within the same industry, since they are bound by the same business constraints.With a net margin value of 11.84%, PepsiCois well behind the industry average of 18.47%. With respect to profitability, Coca-Cola, with net margin of 23.37%, is clearly better placed than both PepsiCo and the industry.Debt-to-Equity RatioThe debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a good indicator of the financial well-being of a company and is a good proxy for its debt servicing capacity. In the context of the soft drinks industry, it is an indicator of the company’s long-term sustainability.PepsiCo’s debt-to-equity ratio of 307.77 is alarmingly high, compared to the industry’s D/E ratio of 187.73.  With a D/E ratio of 181.69, Coca-Cola evidently has a better leverage position.Dividend YieldCoca-Cola’s and PepsiCo’s dividend yields over the last year is 3.52% and 3.05%, respectively. Although, both cola giants offer better dividend than the broader industry’s figure of 2.77%, it is clear that Coca-Cola holds a clear edge over its immediate competitor.Earnings History and ESPConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Coca-Cola has delivered positive surprises in three of the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 1.5%. On the other hand, PepsiCo has delivered positive surprises in all the prior four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 4.1%.However, a more detailed analysis of the both the soft drinks companies’ performance in the last four quarters shows a different story. In 2017, after missing the earnings estimate in the first quarter, Coca-Cola continued to beat the earnings estimate in the remaining three quarters significantly. While, PepsiCo after posting steady earnings beat in the first three quarters of 2017, managed to surpass the earnings estimate marginally after the company’s CSD volumes fell 5% last year.When considering Earnings ESP, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have ESP values of -0.34% and -0.97%, respectively. Moreover, Coca-Cola’s earnings estimates for the current year have increased by 2% over the last 60 days, while the same metric for PepsiCo has advanced by only 0.4%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis showed that Coca-Cola is overvalued compared with PepsiCo. However, Coca-Cola undoubtedly holds an edge over PepsiCo, when considering price performance and dividend yield. Additionally, when we take a more comprehensive look at the companies’ previous earnings performance and estimate revisions, Coca-Cola is the better stock.Moreover, despite the fact that both the soft drinks giants have a negative ESP, Coca-Cola is better off given that it is expected to incur a lower level of loss. Additionally, when considering net margin and debt-to-equity ratio, Coca-Cola holds an edge over PepsiCo. This is why it may be a good idea to bet on Coca-Cola over PepsiCo as both prepare to report earnings next week.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

1911,KO,"Hillenbrand, Inc. (HI  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this diversified industrial company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well, the company has been delivering positive earnings surprise for six straight quarters now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hillenbrand Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Hillenbrand Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Hillenbrand Inc Quote What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 47 cents, which represents nearly 12% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $405 million, which is in line with the year-ago period figure.Factors at PlayHillenbrand hasn’t witnessed a single year-over-year decline in top and bottom lines for more than a year now. Well, the company has mainly been gaining from strength at its Process Equipment segment, which has also helped the company’s shares rally 20.8% in a year, surpassing the industry’s 15.5% growth. Robust demand has been favoring the performance of this segment, wherein revenues jumped 7% to $304 million in the last quarter. Incidentally, results were fueled by solid demand for systems and equipment that are used for food and pharma projects and engineered plastics. Also, increased demand for screening and separating equipment fueled segment revenues.Given these trends, the company has been focusing on capitalizing the opportunities provided by the process equipment market. In this regard, the acquisition of Coperion has also aided Hillenbrand’s pricing and productivity initiatives. Driven by such upsides, management expects Process Equipment unit to witness continued organic growth in fiscal 2018, supported by a robust backlog level.However, persistent softness at the Batesville business segment remains a hurdle. This unit has long been struggling with lower burial volumes in North America, as consumers depict a radical shift toward cremation. In the last quarter, segment revenues declined 4% to $139 million due to reduced demand for burial caskets which stems from families rising preference for cremation. Moreover, the performance of this segment remains challenged with higher commodity and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger and hurt revenues and margins in fiscal 2018, which remains a concern for the upcoming quarter.Nevertheless, we expect the flourishing process equipment business to tide over the aforementioned weakness and drive Hillenbrand this time around.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Though Hillenbrand carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, the Most Accurate estimate falls in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 47 cents.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Campbell Soup Company (CPB  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.82% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1912,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has been aggressively diversifying its business to shift from traditional added-sugar fizzy drinks. It is well known that cola giants like Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) are seeing declining volumes in established markets such as the United States amid growing health consciousness. This is denting demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs), hurting other soft drink makers like Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  as well.Among CSDs, the cola segment has been facing the brunt of consumer shift toward alternative beverage offerings. The diet drinks are also under pressure, thanks to increasing consumer awareness regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.Though Coca-Cola has bumped up marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts have not brought about any meaningful improvement yet. Sparkling beverage unit case volume was down 1% in 2017, which compares with flat volume in 2016. Sparkling beverage accounted for 69% of the company’s 2017 worldwide unit case volumes.Resultantly, the company’s total sales fell 20% in the last reported quarter, marking the 11th consecutive quarterly decline. Coca-Cola’s shares have also lost 4.3% in the past six months, comparing unfavorably with its industry’s decline of 2.3%. Efforts to Focus Solely on BeverageThe company has been firing on all cylinders to rejuvenate its portfolio. It has ramped up its effort to transform into a total beverage company with a broad, consumer-centric brand portfolio and an asset-light business model.Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.  In 2017, the beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States. Also, it entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category last year and closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business.Importantly, the beverage giant has launched Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in 20 markets, with a reformulated product, evolved marketing, new packaging and upgraded execution. This product has been contributing to revenues in the United States since its launch in the third quarter of 2017.Recently, Coca-Cola ventured into the liquor space with the plan to introduce an alcoholic drink in Japan. The company launched its first-ever alcoholic drink — Chu-Hi — made with a distilled Japanese beverage (shocho), sparkling water and flavoring.Massive Refranchising for Higher ReturnsCoca-Cola is in transition, moving away from being a capital-intensive organization. In 2017, the company achieved major milestones by fully refranchising bottling system in the United States. Its refranchising plans will help it focus on building its core brands and reduce its exposure to the low-margin, capital-intensive bottling operations.Though this effort has been impacting sales/profits adversely, it will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital over the long term.Cost Saving to Boost Bottom LineThe company has initiated a productivity and reinvestment program to boost profits. These initiatives include restructuring the global supply chain including optimization of the manufacturing footprint in North America, investing in technology to streamline operations, implementing a zero-based budgeting program, headcount reduction and driving increased efficiency in direct marketing investments. Currently, the company plans to save $3.8 billion by 2019.These initiatives are helping the company to come up with better numbers. In the fourth quarter of 2017, despite reporting flat soda volumes, the cola giant gained from its growing beverage portfolio and re-structuring efforts. Organic revenues grew 6% on growth across the board, driven by price/mix growth of 4% and concentrate sales growth of 1%. Again, lower SG&A expenses (down 21%), higher gross margin (up 480 basis points or bps) and higher operating margin (up 540 bps) helped it come up with better numbers.Constant endeavors to foray into the other alternative beverage space, restructuring and productivity efforts are expected to lift revenues as well as profits for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 have moved up 3.5% and 4.1%, respectively, over the last 30 days, indicating analysts’ optimism on the stock.

Consolidated , one of the largest independent bottlers of The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) products, reported adjusted earnings of $1.85 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Earnings increased 25.1% year over year. Notably, shares of the company have lost 0.1% in after-hours trading on Nov 7.Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales of $1.16 billion, up 36.9% year over year primarily on acquisitions and higher comparable net sales.Comparable net sales increased 1.4% driven by a 1% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. Sparkling product comparable volumes were down 0.6%, while that of still products increased 4.3%.Comparable income from operations decreased 15% to $38.3 million on a year-over-year basis owing to a challenging retail sales environment, storm-related negative impacts and shifts in product mix.FinancialsCash and cash equivalents were $11.9 million as of Oct 1, 2017, compared with $21.9 million at the end of 2016.Cash flow from operating activities was $202.4 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, reflecting an increase of $74.3 million from the prior-year period.Plant and equipment acquired during the first nine months of 2017 were worth $115 million, excluding $161.2 million in property, plant and equipment acquired during the first half of 2017.Peer ReleasesCoca-Cola reported better-than-expected results in third-quarter 2017.

1915,KO,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.50%. However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 1.42%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayMonster Beverage has been doing well on the back of product innovation that plays a major role in the company’s success. The company’s net sales grew 9.4% year over year in the first half of 2017, banking on wide-ranging portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in both the domestic and international markets.The company’s sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment, accounting for almost 90% of total net sales, increased 8.7%. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are now particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and obesity-related concerns. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks should drive the company’s top line in the near term.Again, the Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), grew more than 13% in the period. The company's strategic deal expanded its portfolio with notable brands, with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company’s sales and the trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Meanwhile, the company is experiencing solid growth in margins. The company’s first as well as second quarters’ gross margin benefitted from the raw material cost savings related to the American Fruits & Flavors acquisition. The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company’s bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 40 cents a share, reflecting an increase of 20.8% year over year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $901.1 million, implying 14.4% year-over-year growth.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Monster Beverage does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of -1.32%.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1917,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) ventures into the liquor space with the plan to introduce an alcoholic drink in Japan. The cola giant launched its first ever alcoholic drink — Chu-Hi — made with a distilled Japanese beverage (shocho), sparkling water and flavoring.The company chose Japan to experiment its first ever alcoholic drink as the market is ‘incredibly dynamic, fiercely competitive and rooted in innovation.’ Consumers here are always open to product variations.  Coca-Cola on an average launches 100 new products per year in Japan. In 2017, the company brought in a number of initiatives and programs comprising the launch of new bottle designs, testing new products and flavors.“Experimentation is almost like a day-to-day ritual here. You can’t fall behind the rapid product cycle in Japan, so we’re always seeking innovation opportunities to deliver fun surprises for consumers,” said Jorge Garduno, president of Coca-Cola's Japan business unit.Considering the sluggish performance of the carbonated beverage business, it is appropriate for the company to foray into other beverage categories. Cross-category competition and growing health consciousness are hurting demand for carbonated soft drinks (CSDs). Among CSDs, the cola segment has come under fire as consumers are opting for alternative beverage offerings. The diet drinks are reeling under pressure, thanks to increasing consumer concern regarding the use of artificial sweeteners.To cope with tepid cola sales, Coca-Cola is pursuing investments in newer revenue platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.  In 2017, the beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the acquisition of Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States. Also, it entered the fast-growing U.S. ready-to-drink coffee category last year and closed the proposed acquisition of AdeS soy-based beverage business.The foray into the alcohol space can be considered a new source of revenues for the company.

1918,KO,"Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), UnitedHealth (UNH  -  Free Report), and Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) helped lift the Dow Jones Industrial Average above 26,000 on Tuesday, marking the fastest climb between 1,000-point barriers in the index’s 121-year history.Gains from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) also helped the Dow surge to 26,086 on Tuesday morning. The index ended up closing below the 26,000 threshold after early gains uncharacteristically sunk into the red in the afternoon. The Dow closed at 25,792.86, down 0.04% on the day.Still, despite the small downturn on Tuesday, 2018 has already been a strong year for both the index and the broader markets. It took the Dow only seven days of trading to soar from 25,000 to 26,000. Year-to-date, the Dow has climbed 4.34%.In fact, the Dow gained 507.3 points last week, marking the second week in a row that it gained more than 500 points. The last time the Dow experienced a run like this was March 2000.Over the last 52 weeks, the Dow has skyrocketed more than 30%. Now, questions have started to fly about when this massive bull market might end. Some point to the length of the current bull market as sign enough that bear days are on the horizon.On the other side of things, people point to the strength of technology firms such as Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (APPL) and their ability to make more profits as reasons to be optimistic the run will continue.Coupled with the recent GOP tax overhaul, which will see the corporate tax rate fall from 35% to 21%, investors hope the bull market still has legs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1919,KO,"The splendid run of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since Trump’s win in the presidential election is known to all. In its northbound march, the blue-chip index crossed 25,000 for the first time in its 120-year history on Jan 4 and was just 200 points away from hitting 26,000 as of Jan 12, 2018. The index breached the 20,000-mark on Jan 6, 2017 and the rest is history.Dow Jones Industrial Average has surged 60.3% in the last two years and gained about 30.1% in the last year (as of Jan 12, 2018). Trump’s tax reform and promises of deregulation acted as the wind beneath the wings. While almost all stocks staged solid performances lately on the passing of the tax reform, a few are likely to soar higher in the days to come.Below we highlight those stocks and the related ETFs that are set to gain ahead.Boeing As per an article published on MarketWatch, Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) indicated that it would shell out $300 million on workforce-related and charitable investments. The tax reform enables Boeing “to better compete on the world stage and give us a stronger foundation for the investment in innovation, facilities and skills that will support our long-term growth.”The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has about 11% weight in iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report)), 7% focus on PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA), and another 7% on Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report) (read: 8 Power-Packed ETFs for 2018).Wal-Mart Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT announced recently that it plans to use its tax savings by hiking the starting pay for hourly workers to $11, effective during the Feb 17, 2018 pay cycle and paying up to $1,000 in a one-time cash bonus to suitable associates based on seniority.Wal-Mart indicated that it paid high effective tax rates for years. So, the reduction in the corporate tax rate will make the United States more competitive on the global stage, and boost investment at the domestic level.The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock puts about 9.9% weight in iShares Edge MSCI Multifactor Consumer Staples ETF (CNSF  -  Free Report) and 7.9% in Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) (read: Staples ETFs: What Investors Need to Know).Caterpillar Caterpillar Inc. CAT expects the bill to be “positive” for the company and American manufacturers. Caterpillar also agrees about a more competitive environment in the United States and around the world.

1920,KO,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 23. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this consumer products company will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. Well the company has outperformed earnings estimates in three of the past four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation Quote What to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.55, which represents nearly 7% growth from the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4,591 million, up about 1% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayKimberly-Clark witnessed year-over-year growth in both top and bottom line in the last quarter, driven by higher sales at Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional (KCP) and Other segments, along with robust cost savings from its Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) program. Sales at the aforementioned segments gained from higher volumes backed by the company’s effective merchandising strategy. This also helped the company to witness marginal growth in organic sales at its overall consumer business, after a 3% drop in the first half of 2017. Region wise, organic sales remained flat in North America, grew 3% in emerging markets, while it dropped by the same rate in developed markets. Softness in the developed markets mainly stemmed from weak diaper sales in South Korea due to a considerably fall in birth rate.Moving to the company’s Personal Care Products segment, which constituted about 50% of Kimberly-Clark’s total sales, we note that sales remained soft owing to lower volumes as well as net selling prices. Well, lower net selling price remains a concern for the overall company, owing to intense competition and heightened promotional activities. In fact, North America remains particularly challenged due to these factors.Nevertheless, management expects Personal Care Products to deliver a better performance in the fourth quarter, backed by its brand initiatives and effective promotional strategy. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales at this segment is pegged at $2,261 million, reflecting a 0.6% rise from the year-ago figure. The consensus marks for sales at Consumer Tissue and KCP and Other units are $1,547 million and $791 million, depicting 2.8% and 1.5% year-over-year growth, respectively.Cost Savings Vs Input Cost InflationApart from these factors, Kimberly-Clark is also likely to gain from the successful implementation of its FORCE program, which generated cost savings of $125 million in the third quarter. However, input cost inflation remains a challenge, which the company has been battling for over a year now. For 2017, the company anticipates commodity costs inflation to be marginally higher than its previous estimate of $200-$300 million, primarily due to higher prices for several raw materials, including pulp and polymer resin.Nonetheless, management remains focused on curtailing discretionary spending during the year. Moreover, currency and lower effective tax rate are expected to favorably impact the bottom line. All said, we expect benefits from these factors and the FORCE program to more than offset rising input costs, and help the company witness earnings growth in the fourth quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with ourEarnings ESP Filter.Though Kimberly-Clark carries a Zacks Rank #2, its Earnings ESP of -0.84% makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, the Most Accurate estimate of $1.54 is pegged a notch lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.87% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1922,KO,"Cost-saving initiatives and productivity improvement have been favoring PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) amid subdued sales in the recent quarters, courtesy of growing health consciousness. PepsiCo’s shares have sunk approximately 3.8% in the past year, against the industry’s rise of 2%. Nonetheless, the company is striving to retain investors’ optimism and regain its footing.The company stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs. In February 2014, the company announced a new five-year restructuring plan to generate annual productivity savings of $1 billion each from 2015 to 2019, through productivity measures. The savings come from improved efficiency through increased manufacturing automation, closure of manufacturing facilities and increasing capacity utilization, re-structuring go-to-market systems in developed markets, expanding shared services as well as simplifying organization structures.In the past two years, the company has been using automated high-speed packaging lines across the globe, which increased packaging line speed by up to 50%. Savings from these investments and technology and operational changes are being re-invested in the business to drive the top line.Apart from cost savings, PepsiCo’s product innovation and aggressive marketing techniques are boosting growth.The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products and maintains a robust pipeline of new products. Most of the company’s latest line-up of products offer health benefits like reduced calorie beverages, non-carbonated beverages and healthier snacks. It is working to offer products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat to reap benefits from shifting consumers’ preference toward healthier products.Moreover, the company has significantly stepped up its advertising & marketing (A&M) and R&D investments to strengthen its brands and accelerate product innovation. It has significantly increased investments in social and digital marketing campaigns. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.1 billion in 2017, up from $3.9 billion in 2015.HurdlesConsumers’ tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are a concern for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no significant improvement has yet been witnessed.

1923,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, regained momentum in the past month driven by strategic actions, including expanding store base, diversifying business portfolio and focus on core business activities. This makes FEMSA a good investment choice as the stock continues the uptick.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock surged 10.6% in the past month, outperforming the industry’s growth of 1.6%. This indicates a positive sentiment on the stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.  However, we cannot ignore the near-term headwinds that may bother the stock’s growth. These mainly include the dismal top- and bottom-line trends as well as the continued decline in margins. Let’s analyze why we should retain the stock at this time.Strategic Actions – Business DiversificationFEMSA has been taking prudent steps to diversify the product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bodes well for future operating performance. In an attempt to strengthen its retail portfolio, the company acquired Santiago-based grocer Big John, which is likely to enhance FEMSA Comercio’s convenience store operations in Chile.FEMSA has been focusing on achieving growth via acquisitions for a while now. Earlier, it spread footprint in South America through the Grupo Socofar buyout, which not only widened its exposure in the drugstore business but also brought beauty operations under ambit. Additionally, the company has been diversifying retail-chain format operations by acquiring businesses across Latin America. FEMSA Comercio considerably extended footprint in the small-format retail chains in Mexico, Chile and Colombia.Health Unit to Back growthFEMSA has been focusing on expanding drugstore operations as it sees significant potential in that space. The company has been aggressively seeking to capitalize on the growing drugstore business. As of Dec 31, 2017, it had total 2,225 point of sales across all regions, of which, 47 net new stores were added during the fourth quarter. Further, FEMSA is on track to build infrastructure and integrate its four legacy drugstore operations, including Farmacias YZA, Farmacias FM Moderna and Farmacias Farmacón as well as Grupo Socofar, into a single operating platform. We believe, FEMSA’s venture into the drugstore business strategically fits its chain-store business and will be accretive to both top and bottom lines in the long term.Healthy FinancialsMoreover, FEMSA's strong cash flow generation capacity and a healthy balance sheet enable it to make incremental investments in business expansion. The company is effectively utilizing available funds to grow core bottling and convenience store operations while expanding organic and inorganic businesses.Solid Business PortfolioFEMSA is a leading company with exposure in various industries, including beverage, beer and retail, which give it an edge over competitors. The company mainly gains exposure in the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF  -  Free Report), which operates as world’s largest franchise bottler for Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) products. In the beer industry, it enjoys a notable position by owning 14.76% in Heineken (HEINY  -  Free Report), a leading brewer with operations in 70 countries.Moreover, FEMSA’s share in the retail space relate to the operation of various small-format store chains, including OXXO, through FEMSA Comercio subsidiary. Apart from these, through FEMSA Strategic Businesses subsidiary, FEMSA provides logistics, point-of-sale refrigeration solutions and plastics solutions to its business units and third-party clients.Near-Term HurdlesThough the company’s long-term growth prospects remain intact, its negative surprise history remains a hurdle. It posted lower-than-expected earnings and sales for fourth-quarter 2017, which marked fifth negative earnings surprise in the trailing six quarters. Moreover, revenues lagged estimates in three of the last four quarters. Results were hurt by the change in the accounting method for Coca-Cola FEMSA’s Venezuelan operation. Further, the company has been witnessing strained margins due to higher operating expenses at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division. We believe that persistence of these headwinds can be troublesome for the stock. Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V.

1924,KO,"Gender diversity is en vogue with the number of female corporate leaders going up. More female employees are taking the top positions in a number of companies. After dropping to 21 in 2016, the number of women CEOs on Fortune 500 increased more than 50% to a record 32 at the start of 2017.However, the number declined to 27 as of Jan 2018 and will drop further down to 24 by April. Despite this, women hold 21% of board seats at S&P 500 companies per Catalyst, a group researching women and work.Several researches show that the companies led by women have constantly outperformed the market. According to the analysis by the bank Nordea, companies with a woman in the chief executive or chairman role have performed far better than a major global index over the past eight years. The annualized returns for female-led firms, based on an equal weighting, was 25% since 2009, compared with just 11% for the broader market — the MSCI World Index (read: Top-Ranked Sector ETFs & Stocks From Top Industries).Given the long history of outperformance, many investors are seeking to add female-centric companies to their portfolio although the list is still small. While betting on an individual company is certainly a good option, investors can also play this space with lower risk and higher diversification benefits in a basket form.Currently, there are a couple of products offering broad exposure to women-led companies. We have highlighted them in detail below.SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity Index ETF (SHE  -  Free Report)This ETF offers exposure to U.S. companies that demonstrate greater gender diversity within senior leadership than other firms in their sector by tracking the SSGA Gender Diversity Index. Holding 169 stocks, it is moderately concentrated on the top firms as each account for less than 5.7% of assets. Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Mastercard Inc. (MA  -  Free Report) are top three holdings. From a sector look, information technology takes the largest share at 22.6%, followed by healthcare (16.9%), consumer staples (13.3%) and consumer discretionary (12.1%). The product has amassed $318.8 million in its asset base while trades in light volume of about 11,000 shares. It charges 20 bps in annual fees and has gained 10.3% over the past year (read: Tech ETFs & Stocks Surviving the Market Rout in February).Barclays Women in Leadership ETN (WIL  -  Free Report)This product is linked to the performance of the Barclays Women in Leadership Total Return USD Index, which provides exposure to U.S.-based companies that satisfy one or both of the gender diversity criteria of having a female chief executive officer or having at least 25% female members on the board of directors. The ETN has amassed $36.7 million in its asset base and trades in a paltry volume of around 200 shares. Expense ratio comes in at 0.45%. The note is up 7.2% over the past year (see: all the Large Cap ETFs here).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1925,KO,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated  is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Nov 7.This large independent bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an encouraging strategy to grow both organically and through the acquisition of additional manufacturing and distribution territory.In the first half of 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales of $2.03 billion, up 38.8% year over year primarily on acquisitions and a 2.3% hike in comparable net sales on 1.9% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. The trend is expected to continue in the third quarter as the company usually experiences higher sales in the second and third quarters of the year.The sparkling product portfolio and the higher margin still product range drove comparable net sales. Sparkling product comparable volumes grew 1% year over year while that of still products increased 4.1% in the first six months of 2017. This is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, higher expenses (such as expansion transaction and amortization expenses) might dent the company’s bottom line. Notably, the stock saw dismal trading in the third quarter, with the stock losing 5.8%, compared to the industry’s 0.6% decline.Peer ReleasesCoca-Cola reported better-than-expected results in third-quarter 2017. Lower SG&A expenses (down 20%), higher gross margin (up 170 basis points or bps) and higher operating margin (up 404 bps) helped the company come up with better numbers. However, Coca-Cola's total sales dropped 15%, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline.PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported mixed third-quarter 2017 (ending Sep 9) results, with earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same. Nonetheless, this is the sixth consecutive quarter of a positive earnings surprise.Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.’s  third-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of $1.10 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.3%. Earnings were down 6% on a year-over-year basis owing to the recent hurricanes in the United States, earthquakes in Mexico and a previously disclosed write-off of prepaid resin inventory.

1926,KO,"Coca-Cola European Partners Plc or CCEP (CCE  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Nov 7.Last quarter, it delivered a positive earnings surprise of 15.63%. The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 6.22%. The chart below depicts the price and earnings surprise history:Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola European Partners PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola European Partners PLC QuoteCCEP is gaining significant synergies from the merger and is expected to continue driving growth in the foreseeable future. The company’s continuous focus on brand and packaging innovation, strengthening execution and customer service, and further improving operating effectiveness will help in driving growth.It is quite evident in the last reported quarter when sales and marketing plans as well as favorable weather drove results. Its revenues increased 40.5% year over year driven by the inclusion of Germany, Iberia, and Iceland. Comparable FX-neutral sales were up 7.5%, including better price/case (up 3%) and volumes (up 4.5%). Strong results were driven by 9% growth in Northern European territories (Belgium/Luxembourg/Netherlands) and 7% growth in Germany. However, Norway and Great Britain weighed on its results. We expect the growth momentum to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Importantly, CCEP remains on track to achieve pre-tax synergy savings of €315 million to €340 million by mid- 2019. Again, it expects to achieve half of its total target by end of 2017 that is likely to help CCEP boost its bottom line considerably.Given the solid performance, CCEP even raised its 2017 guidance, though FX is expected to hurt earnings by 2%..Overall, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 80 cents, reflecting a 7.4% year-over-year increase. The consensus estimate for revenues is $3.5 billion, implying a 5.9% increase.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.CCEP does not have the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for CCEP is +1.89%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks Rank: CCEP carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

1927,KO,"The Dow endured a volatile week during which the index hit a fresh record high. A fall in bank shares led to losses for the index on Monday. The index slipped on Tuesday following positive news from a major component. Surging treasury yields led to losses for the index on Wednesday. Ultimately, the index surged to a record high on Thursday following investor optimism over economic growth.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow gained 0.9% last Friday due to optimism built around the implementation of the GOP Tax Bill. Such broad-based gains ensured an improvement for three major benchmarks, negating the effects of dismal economic data.Nonfarm payrolls for the month of December came in at 148,000, lower than the consensus estimate of 190,000 job additions. Further, the U.S. trade deficit increased 3.2% in November to settle at $50.5 billion. This is its highest deficit since January 2012. The ISM Services Index for December declined 1.5 points to 55.7%.The index added an impressive 220.7 points on Friday to finish the session above the 25,000 milestone for the second straight day. This marked its third-straight record close in last four trading sessions — its best opening week since 2006. Gains for the blue-chip index were rather broad based.Over last week, the index gained 2.3%. This marked the Dow’s best weekly run since Dec 1, 2017. During this period the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time. This was the index’s fastest 1,000-point rise since its inception in May 1896.Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains. Favorable economic data, including an upbeat manufacturing report and record construction spending boosted markets.The Dow This WeekThe index lost almost 0.1% or nearly 13 points on Monday due to a fall in bank shares that snapped its winning run. This marked an end to its four-day streak of gains. The blue-chip index hit an intraday record of 25,311.99 earlier in the session but suffered broad based losses to finish in the negative territory.Shares of major banks such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) declined by 1.5% and about 0.4% respectively and weighed on the Dow. Bank shares declined after analysts estimated that there would be one-time charges to the fourth quarter earnings that the banks would suffer due to the implementation of tax reforms.The index increased 0.4% on Tuesday following reports that The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow.The index lost 0.1% on Wednesday after yields on the 10-year benchmark note surged following reports that China was considering halting purchase of U.S. Treasuries. Markets also suffered losses after reports from Canada surfaced that its government expects Trump to pull out of NAFTA soon. Meanwhile, cost of imported goods in the United States surged to a six year high.The index gained 0.8% or 205 points on Thursday hitting another all-time high following investor optimism over economic growth. Shares of Boeing gained 2.4%, emerging as the largest contributor for the Dow. The aircraft manufacturer will likely be one of the major beneficiaries of higher economic growth. Meanwhile, the PPI index declined by 0.1%, moving lower for the first time in more than a year.  Components Moving the IndexBoeing’s 2017 deliveries show a 2% rise in commercial shipments and 5.9% decline in defense shipments, on a year-over-year basis.

1928,KO,"President Trump wants to slap tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum to protect domestic producers. But it hasn’t gone down well with the investing community. The tariffs will increase the cost of companies that rely heavily on steel and aluminum, affecting their bottom lines. Further, these have raised anxieties that other countries will retaliate, increasing the odds of a trade war and harm to the global economy.  The tariff declaration incited a steep stock market selloff and a rebuke from world leaders. The Dow plunged for four straight trading sessions on Mar 2, while the industrials sector of the S&P 500 was hit the hardest. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge came in at 19.59, way higher than a reading near 11 for most of 2017.With the markets receiving a drubbing on Trump tariffs, investing in stocks that provide excellent risk-adjusted returns won’t be a bad proposition.Trump Tariffs to Hurt U.S. IndustrialsTrump surprised the global market by announcing steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The President said that the United States will impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum.But, tariffs on steel and aluminum have stoked concerns among manufacturers of cars, planes and machinery that rely heavily on such products. After all, steel and aluminum are major expenses for these industries, so an uptick in cost will hurt their profits. Needless to say, the tariff announcement has propelled steel prices to a six-year high of $840 per ton, while aluminum prices exploded to a two-year high at 17 cents per pound.Higher prices on steel and aluminum, furthermore, will compel these companies that rely on such products to pass on some of the costs to consumers. Increased consumer prices may in the long run hamper sales growth and affect companies, leading to job losses. Trump’s tariffs are estimated to hurt nearly 6.5 million U.S. workers at steel and aluminum consuming manufacturers.Retaliation Heats UpThe affected companies further cautioned that they may face retaliatory tariffs from foreign players against the goods they export, eventually denting their profit margins. Trump’s tariff announcement has already evoked anger among global leaders, with the European Union saying that it will impose tariffs on $3.5 billion worth of U.S. imports, as per Reuters.China cautioned America to abide by multilateral trade rules and not to harm the delicate global economy. We shouldn’t forget that China is the world’s dominant steel producer and Trump’s tariff moves could easily start a trade war between them.Tariffs also raise threats of a trade war with America’s closest ally, Canada. After all, Canada is the top exporter of both steel and aluminum from the United States. Canada is solely responsible for manufacturing 17% of all the U.S. steel imports and 43% of all aluminum imports. Other major suppliers to the United States, including Brazil, South Korea, Mexico and Russia will also be negatively impacted.Tariffs news hit not only heavy users of steel and aluminum, but also cyclical-sensitive sectors like technology and consumer cyclicals to name a few. Investors remained worried that threats of retaliation by trade partners could harm global economic growth that was widely seen as the major driving force of the stock market’s rally last year.Dow Companies Strongly Disagree With Trump TariffsHere is how some of the blue-chip companies responded to Trump tariffs:The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) agreed with Can Manufacturers Institute (CMI) President Robert Budway, who said that tariff restrictions will have a severe impact on the can manufacturing industry, its employees and consumers of such aluminum cans. Tariffs will increase price, lead to supply inefficiency and affect product availability.Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) supported American Petroleum Institute (API) stance that they “support free trade” largely in the oil and natural gas industries, but in other industries as well.JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) shares its view with Joshua Bolten, chief executive of the Business Roundtable, who said that the industry group urges Trump to persuade “other approaches” to address issues related to overcapacity of steel and aluminum that won’t place the economy at high risk.Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report) stood by Retail Industry Leaders Association that said “Trump administration’s intention to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports could have severely negative consequences for the American economy. If broadly applied, these tariffs will have a downstream impact on every sector.”The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report) responded by saying that Trump’s tariff plan “is likely to escalate trade tensions, particularly as it looks likely to apply to a broad group of countries including to some allies of the U.S.”5 Ultra-Safe BetsGiven such heightened tariff concerns, investors should build a strategy around low-risk assets and a combination of parameters that lead to better returns.

The unfavorable result can be attributed to the change in the accounting method for Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V’s (KOF  -  Free Report) Venezuelan operation. This resulted in the reclassification of a foreign currency translation charge in equity.However, results gained from foreign exchange benefit associated with higher U.S. dollar-denominated cash position at FEMSA due to the sale of its partial stake in Heineken (HEINY  -  Free Report) in September, as well as softness in Mexican peso during the quarter.Total revenues increased 11.5% year over year to Ps. 122,502 million (US$6,471.3 million), fueled by solid performance across all segments, taking into account the consolidation of the Philippines and Vonpar’s integration at Coca-Cola FEMSA.

The segment’s reported operating margin contracted 80 bps to 13.7% mainly due to higher freight expenses, labor costs as well as diesel and gasoline prices.FEMSA Comercio – Retail Division: Total revenues at this segment grew 10.1% year over year to Ps. 40,182 million (US$2,122.7 million).

FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division had a total of 16,526 OXXO stores as of Dec 31, 2017. Same-store sales at OXXO increased 4.7% driven by strong consumer trends.

1932,KO,"Sluggish sales of carbonated soft drinks or CSD has prompted innovations and re-branding in the beverage industry to regain sales momentum. Keeping that in mind, Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) recently announced that it will re-launch Diet Coke in North America with a ""full brand restage"" featuring new slim bottles and flavors. The four new flavors, which will hit the stores in mid-January, are Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Twisted Mango, and Zesty Blood Orange.The company is “re-energizing and modernizing Diet Coke for a new generation of drinkers – and offering its millions of current fans a new look and more flavors.”Coca-Cola’s Endeavor to Diversify PortfolioCoca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to CSD category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness — consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concern — are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third quarter and second quarter, and declined 1% in the first quarter of 2017. Sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company’s 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers — Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group  — leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Accordingly, Coca-Cola is trying to reinvigorate the category with significant innovations and re-branding. The cola giant is investing in newer revenue-generating platforms to boost long-term sales and profits.The latest move in this regard by Coca-Cola is the launch of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, replacing Coke Zero, in the United States in August 2017. Based on its success in Europe and Latin America, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar offering will address two key issues: help in giving a boost to the zero calorie portion of its portfolio, addressing potential sugar taxes; and the “diet downturn” that continues to weigh on traditional Diet CSDs. Coca-Cola also has plans of using Zero Sugar as an alternative to diet sodas.The company remains on track with its plans of broadening its portfolio to meet evolving consumer preferences by introducing more than 500 new products and also ""lifting and shifting"" existing brands into new markets.Shares of the company have gained 12.6% in the past one year, compared with the industry’s growth of 16.4%. Nonetheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives to help fight revenue woes.

1933,KO,"Although the ‘Dogs of the Dow’ strategy has a history of outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average over the long term, it lagged in 2017, returning just 19% compared with 25% gains for the blue-chip index. Before 2017, the Dogs had generated outsized returns in six of the seven previous years, missing only in 2012.The ‘Dogs of the Dow’ represents the 10 highest-yielding blue chip companies of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that are out of favor with the markets and thus have higher dividend yields (due to depressed stock prices). High dividend yields suggest that these stocks are in the oversold territory and will rebound faster than any other stock when the fundamentals changes. As such, the strategy combines both the elements of dividend and value investing.Given this, honing in on stocks that are cheaper than their peers and unlikely to cut dividends could generate above-market returns and lead to juicy yields. In fact, the new tax legislation will act as the biggest catalyst to these stocks, as it would lead to dividend hikes, thereby resulting in higher shareholder returns (read: 4 Sector ETFs & Stocks Set to Explode Higher on Tax Cuts).Let’s meet this year’s Dogs of the Dow.Dogs of the DowWhile eight of the 2017 Dogs of the Dow — Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report), International Business Machines (IBM  -  Free Report), Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report), Exxon Mobil XOM, Chevron CVX, Merck (MRK  -  Free Report), Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report) — are on the list, the astounding performance of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Caterpillar CAT led to their departure. These two have been replaced by Procter & Gamble PG and General Electric (GE  -  Free Report). Investors should note that GE is an unusual inclusion in the Dogs given that it cuts its dividend in late 2017 (read: Steer Clear of GE, Bet on These Industrial ETFs Instead).The Dogs of the Dow could lead this year given that a recovery in oil and natural gas prices could spur outperformance in the two integrated oil giants. Both XOM and CVX are up 3.7% and 2.1%, respectively, to start the year. Additionally, General Electric – the biggest laggard last year – has turned into one of the hottest stock to start the year. The stock logged in the biggest weekly percentage gain since Nov 2016 in the first week of the New Year.However, the performance of the Dow Dogs differs from bull to bear markets and great caution needs to be exercised while investing in these companies. Still, those looking to invest in these stocks could do so in the basket form via ETFs with lower risk. Below, we have highlighted five ETFs with heavy exposure to the Dogs of the Dow that look exciting for 2018.ETF BetsELEMENTS DJ High Yield Select 10 ETN (DOD  -  Free Report)This is an ETN option and provides investors pure play to the 10 highest dividend-yielding securities in Dow Jones Industrial Average in equal proportions. It tracks the Dow Jones High Yield Select 10 Total Return Index and charges 75 bps in annual fees. The note has only $38.2 million in AUM while trades in a light volume of around 10,000 shares on an average daily basis. DOD shed 7.2% to start the New Year.ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (SDOG  -  Free Report)This fund applies the ‘Dogs of the Dow Theory’ on a sector-by-sector basis using the S&P 500. This could be easily done by selecting the five highest yielding securities in each of the 10 GICS sectors and equally weighing them. These higher yielding stocks will appreciate in order to bring their yields in line with the market, potentially leading to outsized gains. The approach results in a portfolio of 50 stocks with each security accounting for no more than 2.35% of total assets. The fund has accumulated $2.4 billion in its asset base and trades in a good volume of more than 146,000 shares. It charges 40 bps in annual fees and has gained 2.6% in the first few trading sessions of 2018.Guggenheim Dow Jones Industrial Average Dividend ETF DJDThe fund offers an alternative, strategic beta approach to the Dow Jones Industrial Average by weighting each security by dividend yield, rather than price. It follows the Dow Jones Industrial Average Yield Weighted index, holding all the 30 Dow stocks in its basket. The 10 Dogs account for 44.2% of the portfolio. The product charges 30 bps in annual fees from investors and has amassed $13.9 million in its asset base. It trades in a paltry volume of 5,000 shares a day on average and has added 2% so far this year (read: DOW ETFs: More Upside Ahead?).   iShares Core High Dividend ETF (HDV  -  Free Report)This product provides exposure to 74 dividend stocks by tracking the Morningstar Dividend Yield Focus Index. The nine Dogs of the Dow account for 46.4% of the portfolio, suggesting that the Dogs dominate the returns of the fund. HDV is among the largest and most popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of about $6.8 billion and average trading volume of around 262,000 shares. It charges 8 bps in fees per year and has added 0.6% in the first few trading sessions of 2018.First Trust Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index Fund (FDL  -  Free Report)With AUM of $1.7 billion, the fund follows the Morningstar Dividend Leaders Index. In total, it holds 97 stocks that have shown dividend consistency and sustainability with nine Dogs of the Dow collectively accounting for 48.8% of assets. Volume is good as it exchanges nearly 173,000 shares a day on average while the expense ratio comes in at 0.45%. The fund is up 1% so far this year (read: 6 Dividend ETFs of 2017 With At Least 3% Yield & 17% Gains).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

1935,KO,"We expect food/beverage giant PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Oct 4, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 7.91%. The company also surpassed expectations in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 5.18%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Pepsico, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pepsico, Inc. QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that PepsiCo is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key components. Zacks ESP: PepsiCo has an Earnings ESP of +0.27%. The Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.43 per share for PEP compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.42 per share. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our  Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: PepsiCo currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.The combination of PepsiCo’s favorable Zacks Rank and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat. What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?PepsiCo has delivered revenue growth in the past three quarters banking on significant innovation, continued momentum in Frito-Lay business, revenue management strategies, along with better market execution. Moreover, it has been witnessing higher volumes and profits in the North American segments due to an improving economy, better industry pricing dynamics and a consistency in positive innovation.Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017. Keeping this in mind, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier Everyday Nutrition Products and the company believes that such products will play an important role in the long-term growth.That said, consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies.Again, adverse currency movements continued to negatively impact the company’s revenues. In fiscal second quarter, foreign currency headwinds had a 1.5% impact on the company’s revenue growth. PepsiCo expects currency headwinds to adversely impact revenues by approximately 2%. The company expects the 53rd week in fiscal 2016 to negatively impact reported net revenues in fiscal 2017 by 1%.Coming to the company’s margins, PepsiCo had indicated that as the commodity inflation is expected to continue in 2017, the company’s gross margin might face some pressure in the to-be-reported quarter.Notwithstanding the above-mentioned concerns, the company beat expectation in the last six quarters. PepsiCo delivered revenue growth in the last three quarters after successive declines in revenues in the previous nine quarters. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.For the fiscal third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $1.42, reflecting a 1.5% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $16.42 billion, implying a 2.4% growth. Stocks to ConsiderHere are some consumer staples stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.68% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.44% and a Zacks Rank #2. The company is expected to report earnings results on Oct 24.Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.50% and a Zacks Rank #3.

1936,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, is benefiting from solid portfolio and robust strategic measures including increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focus on core business activities to drive growth. Further, the stock is supported by a long-term earnings growth rate of 15%. Let’s find out more.Robust Business PortfolioFEMSA has a formidable portfolio with exposure in various industries including beverage, beer and retail. This provides it an edge over competitors. The company primarily gets exposure to the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF  -  Free Report), which operates as the world’s largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) products. It enjoys a notable position in the beer industry as it owns 14.76% stake in Heineken Group, parent company of Heineken NV (HEINY  -  Free Report), a leading brewer with operations in 70 countries.Moreover, its share in the retail space relates to the operation of various small-format store chains including OXXO, through its FEMSA Comercio subsidiary. Apart from these, FEMSA provides logistics, point-of-sale refrigeration solutions and plastics solutions to business units and third-party clients through its FEMSA Strategic Businesses subsidiary.FEMSA’s Health Division Holds PotentialFEMSA has been focused on expanding drugstore operations as it sees significant potential in that space. The company has been aggressively seeking to capitalize on the rapidly growing drugstore business. Further, it is on track with efforts to build infrastructure and integrate its four legacy drugstore operations into a single operating platform. These include its previously acquired Mexican drugstore business — Farmacias YZA, Farmacias FM Moderna and Farmacias Farmacón — as well as South America’s leading drugstore operator, Grupo Socofar. We believe FEMSA’s foray in to the drugstore business strategically fits its chain store business, and will be accretive to both its top and bottom line in the long term.Diversifying Business a Key StrategyFEMSA has been increasingly focused on diversifying products portfolio, while expanding in the small-box retail segment. To do this, FEMSA has been concentrating on achieving growth via acquisitions for a while now. A recent addition to its retail portfolio is the buyout of grocery store chain — Big John in Santiago, Chile. This business is likely to enhance FEMSA Comercio’s convenience store operations in Chile.Previously, the company gained presence in South America through the Grupo Socofar buyout, which not only widened exposure in the drugstore business but also brought beauty operations under its ambit. Additionally, the company has been diversifying retail chain format operations by acquiring businesses across Latin America. FEMSA Comercio has considerably extended presence in the small-format retail chains in Mexico, Chile and Colombia.Healthy FinancialsMoreover, FEMSA's strong cash flow generation capacity and a healthy balance sheet enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion. The company is effectively utilizing available funds to grow core bottling and convenience store operations as well as expand its organic and inorganic businesses.HurdlesThough FEMSA is backed by strong fundamentals, the company has been displaying a negative surprise trend of late. Notably, the company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters now, posting an average negative surprise of 19.4%. Further, sales lagged estimates for the second straight quarter in second-quarter 2017.FEMSA has been facing difficult times, primarily due to currency headwinds, which has been weighing on Coca-Cola FEMSA for a while now. Further, the company has been witnessing strained margins due to growth of lower-margin businesses. We believe that persistence of these headwinds and regulatory pressure may impact future results.Bottom LineWhile the near-term hurdles cannot be ignored, the company’s strategic initiatives and solid portfolio bode well for future growth. That said, we believe the company will tide over these issues and gain momentum.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

1937,KO,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Clorox have soared over the last decade and have gained 9.40% since the start of the year.Nathan's Famous, Inc. The host of the famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest has been churning out cased-meats since 1916. Nathan’s Famous is a small cap company with a market cap of around $310 million, and it has seen its stock price do a 360-degree turn in just the last two years. Nathan’s stock sat at an all-time high of over $81 per share in 2015 before it sank to $30 a share. Shares then climbed back slowly and now rest at around $74.The company owns a line of grocery store dogs, burgers, fries, and pickles, as well as a chain of restaurants, yet it has not been scarfed up by big chains such as Yum! Brands.Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report)This iconic maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos, and others screams Americana. It is hard to believe that Hostess Brands has not been bought by a big CPG company, but, it in fact, just recently went public.Hostess Brands was almost bankrupt less than a decade ago, then two investment firms bought the company out of liquidation in 2013. The company then went public in 2016. With a market cap of $1.78 billion, the newly public snack maker’s stock price has fared well. Shares of the company that has been around since before the Great Depression gained a modest 6.15% since the start of the year, but Hostess Brands is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

1938,KO,"Sales for beverage giant PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) have remained subdued in recent quarters due to growing health and wellness consciousness as well as currency headwinds. PepsiCo’s shares have evidently sunk approximately 4% in the last three months. Nonetheless, the company is leaving no stone unturned to reinvigorate investors’ confidence and regain its footing by innovations and diversifications.Key Growth DriversPepsiCo’s distinctiveness in the soft drinks space lies in the fact that it holds a balanced portfolio of both snacks and beverages, which are complementary food categories. Salty snacks and liquid refreshment beverages have extremely high co-purchase incidence more than any other commonly purchased items. The complementary portfolio results in cost leverage, capability sharing, cross-category promotions and other commercial benefits.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for any beverage giant to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017.For this, PepsiCo is gradually reshuffling its portfolio toward healthier “Everyday Nutrition Products.” These products contain nutrients such as grains, fruits, vegetables, or protein, and the portfolio falls under a broader category of “Guilt Free Products."" The company now generates 45% of its revenues from this category, which also comprises beverages with less sugar and sodium content.Now, good-for-you products and bottled water are gradually gaining traction amid the shift in consumers’ preferences. Coconut water has become a prime alternative to coolers across North America and Europe. Consequently, in North America, the company launched LIFEWTR in Jan 2017, a premium bottled water, PH balanced, with electrolytes for added taste. Again, in 2016, PepsiCo acquired a sparkling probiotic U.S. drinks company, KeVita, thereby diversifying its soft drinks portfolio amid slowing soda sales. The addition of KeVita will expand PepsiCo’s health and wellness offerings in the premium chilled beverage space.Furthermore, the company has stepped up productivity and cost-saving initiatives to boost profitability by reducing overall costs.Importantly, to preserve investors’ confidence in the stock, PepsiCo has increased dividend for 45 consecutive years that includes a dividend hike of 7% in 2017.ChallengesIt goes without saying that consumer tastes are rapidly shifting from carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) to non-carbonated beverages. Hence, sluggish CSD volumes are pressing concerns for this beverage giant as well as for other nonalcoholic beverage companies such as The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. .Though PepsiCo has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost the carbonated beverage business, no meaningful improvement has been seen yet. The company’s CSD volumes were down 2.5% in the second quarter of 2017.Meanwhile, foreign exchange (Fx) is a major headwind for PepsiCo with around 39% of its revenues coming from outside the United States. Though the company now anticipates Fx to have less negative impact on core earnings than previously expected, it is expected to hurt 2017 revenues and earnings per share by 2%.Bottom LineGoing forward, we expect the company's efforts toward offering more products with less sodium, sugar and saturated fat, along with productivity and cost-cutting initiatives will help fight revenue woes.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1939,KO,"Monster Beverage Corporation’s (MNST  -  Free Report) strong product portfolio, strategic deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) and focus on innovation are encouraging.Monster Beverage offers a wide range of products under the energy drinks category. Energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Net sales at the segment, comprising Monster Energy drinks as well as Mutant Super Soda drinks, increased 9.6% in 2016 and 8.7% in the first half of 2017. Thus, a portfolio based on energy drinks should continue to drive the company’s top line.Product innovation plays a huge role in the company’s success. There is consistent demand for new products that are appetizing as well as healthy. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products, while removing non-performing ones.Monster Beverage launched a number of products in the first half of 2017 and has several new products lined up for launch in the remaining of 2017. In April, the company launched a Lewis Hamilton signature Monster Energy drink in Great Britain, followed by launches in 21 European markets in the second quarter of 2017 and South Africa in July 2017. Notably, these new products will benefit from the broader distribution network from the deal.Also, Monster Beverage’s products enjoy greater exposure, courtesy of the strategic deal with Coca-Cola. Under the strategic deal, Coca-Cola and its bottling partners will act as Monster Beverage's preferred distribution partner globally. The company’s cash balance also received a major boost from the deal. The deal provides Monster Beverage full access to Coca-Cola’s world-class global distribution network. Monster Beverage generated 26% of its net sales outside the United States in the first half of 2017.ChallengesSoftness in the beverage industry and unfavorable currency translations raise concerns. The soft drink industry has been facing the brunt of shift in consumer preference toward healthier options. This changing preference is impacting the volumes of beverage companies like Monster Beverage, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc .Moreover, though the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales at the Monster Energy Drinks segment by $12.9 million in the first half of 2017.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1940,KO,"Fast food giant Dunkin' Donuts, belonging to Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report), had announced a partnership with Amtrak Corporation in the first quarter of 2017. Per the agreement, Dunkin’ Donuts’ hot coffee was offered to 3.4 million annual customers on Amtrak’s high-speed train – Acela Express.The partnership has now been expanded to offer Dunkin' Donuts Original Blend and Dunkin' Decaf hot coffee on Amtrak Northeast Regional trains as well. This will make Dunkin’ Donuts' signature beverage line available to a combined 12 million customers travelling on the trains each year. Dunkin’ Brands enjoys significant customer trust and brand loyalty which makes it easier for Dunkin’ Donuts to launch various innovative product lines.Notably, growing sales of the company’s Cold Brew coffee has opened up substantial opportunity for Dunkin' Brands in the beverage space. In fact, owing to its relentless focus on strengthening its beverage portfolio, the company launched ready-to-drink bottled iced coffee in February 2017 which was manufactured, distributed, marketed and sold by The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) nationwide.In addition to these sales initiatives, Dunkin' Brands is trying to drive revenues through a focused expansion strategy, both domestically and internationally.However, Dunkin' Brands’ international comps growth has been suffering over the last few years at both the Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin Robbins divisions. Further, a soft consumer spending environment in the domestic restaurants space along with intense competition from food and beverage companies like Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s Corporation (MCD  -  Free Report) might impede revenue growth for the company.Meanwhile, Dunkin' Brands’ shares have underperformed its industry year-to-date. While the stock has gained 1.1%, the industry witnessed a rally of 7.9%.Nonetheless, the company is expected to sustain its momentum on a solid product pipeline and diligent expansion efforts.Dunkin' Brands currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Notably, it reported a positive surprise after four consecutive bottom-line misses. Further, revenues topped estimates after two consecutive misses.Shares of FEMSA have jumped 2.5% since reporting earnings on Oct 26. Moreover, FEMSA outperformed the broader industry year to date.

1946,KO,"Ahead of today’s opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading up another 100 points as the market expects Congress’ massive tax bill to pass both houses and wind up on President Trump’s desk today. This “pricing in” of the tax cut passage seems to haver no end in sight: the Dow has risen nearly 5000 points in the past year, roughly 7000 points since Trump was elected.The question for 2018 is: How high can market indexes like the Dow be expected to rise? After all, the effects of the massive corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% have yet to be implemented — all this “pricing in” remains speculative until action is taken.Clearly, this major legislation will boost growth, and whether it does so because companies put their tax cut windfalls to work to grow their businesses or merely turn them over to shareholders via buybacks and dividend payments, either way it’s good for the stock market. But how much will growth be boosted, and for how long? That’s the issue analysts are grappling with here at the end of calendar 2017.A company like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) — trading up in today’s pre-market following yesterday afternoon’s Q2 earnings and sales beat — has already indicated it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant. This, in turn, could bolster fortunes for goods and services companies who supply FedEx. Longer-term, this would point toward growth not only on FedEx’s bottom line, but in GDP overall.Other companies, like Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for instance, have already indicated it will simply reward shareholders with what it reaps from the coming tax cuts. At first glance this makes Congress’ efforts on this bill look fairly inessential — after all, corporate profits have been enjoying record earnings quarters for a while now; there was no real need to prime the pump like this.But, whether or not you believe in supply-side economics, the “wealth effect” investors will feel from these increased dividends and share-price backstops will likely increase consumption, drive up retail prices and generate GDP growth all by itself. It may not be a “rising tide lifts all boats” scenario, but stock market participants necessarily see this tax bill as a win-win.

1948,KO,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 numbers on Feb 28, after the closing bell.Last quarter, the company’s earnings met analysts’ expectation. The company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 4.33%.Let’s discuss the factors that are likely to drive Monster Beverage’s fourth-quarter 2017 results.Factors at PlayProduct innovation plays a major role in driving revenues. The company’s net sales grew 11.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2017. The upside can be attributed to a wide portfolio of energy drink brands that has been experiencing solid demand in domestic and international markets. The trend is expected to continue in the upcoming quarter.Sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment improved 11.6% in the first nine months of 2017. The segment accounts for 90% of total sales. Due to growing health awareness, consumers are particularly cautious about the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content products. As a result, the broader carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category has been suffering for the last few years. However, energy drinks constitute one of the few sub-categories that continue to gain momentum. Therefore, a portfolio based on energy drinks will drive the company’s top line.Notably, the company's strategic deal with notable brands bolstered its portfolio and strengthened presence in the international energy drinks market. The Strategic Brands segment, which includes the various energy drink brands acquired from The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), improved more than 10% in the first nine months 2017. The trend is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Net changes in foreign currency exchange rates affected net sales in the Monster Energy Drinks segment by approximately $13.4 million in the first nine months of 2017.Distributor termination expenses are likely to dampen the company’s profits to some extent. It has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following a strategic deal.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $841.5 million, reflecting an increase of 11.6% year over year. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for earnings is 37 cents, implying 5.7% year-over-year growth.Quantitative Model PredictionMonster Beverage has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which increases the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage has an Earnings ESP of +3.40%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuotePeer ReleasesThe Coca-Cola Company’s comparable earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 39 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents.

1949,KO,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated  is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Feb 27, 2018, after the closing bell.This large independent bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has an encouraging strategy to grow both organically and through the acquisition of additional manufacturing and distribution territory.A Look at its Sales PerformanceThe company’s third quarter was one of the most challenging quarters with softer-than-expected sales performance in certain channels of trade. The quarter was impacted by hurricanes, which resulted in negative product sourcing impacts and a noticeable shift in product mix during September to lower margin case pack water. Despite these challenges, the company continued to grow with total sales increasing almost 37%, comparable net sales up 1.4% and comparable equivalent unit case volume growth of 1.0%.In the first nine months of 2017, Coca-Cola Bottling reported net sales growth of 38.1% year over year primarily on acquisitions and a 2% hike in comparable net sales on a 1.6% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. The trend is expected to continue in the fourth quarter as well.The sparkling product portfolio and higher margin still product range drove comparable net sales. Sparkling product comparable volumes grew 0.5% year over year while that of still products increased 4.1% in the first nine months of 2017. This is expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Higher Expenses a WoeHigher expenses (such as expansion transaction and amortization expenses) might dent the company’s bottom line. Notably, the stock saw dismal trading in the last six months, with the stock losing 11.5%, compared with the industry’s 2.3% decline.In the third quarter, the company’s net income plunged 25.2% year over year and in the first nine months of 2017, and net income declined more than 35%.Peer ReleasesThe Coca-Cola Company’s comparable earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 were 39 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents. Earnings also improved from the year-ago profit level of 37 cents, helped by ongoing productivity efforts.PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) recently reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.31, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 and increasing 9% year over year.Upcoming Peer ReleaseMonster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28, 2018, after the closing bell.PepsiCo and Coca-Cola carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Monster Beverage carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1950,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2017 results. Despite reporting flat soda volumes, the coal giant gained from higher demand for Sprite, tea and coffee. Again, cost-cutting initiatives led by the refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations helped it to come up with better numbers.Earnings BeatThird-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of the company were 50 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 49 cents by 2%.Earnings also improved from the year-ago profit level of 49 cents helped by ongoing productivity efforts.Sales DiscussionNet revenues, however, declined 15% year over year to $9.1 billion due to the negative impact of structural items, marking the 10th consecutive quarterly decline in revenues. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 18% impact on revenues, partly offset by 3% positive contribution of price/mix. The structural changes primarily include the impact of bottler refranchising efforts.Revenues, however, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.8 billion.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteVolume and PricingCoca-Cola’s total unit case volume remained unchanged with no growth in the quarter (similar to the preceding quarter). Unit case volume continued to be impacted by macroeconomic headwinds in some Latin American markets. That said, emerging and developing markets saw some improvements with minor positive unit case volume growth. However, developed markets were negatively impacted by the weather and the cycling of strong results from the prior year.Category Cluster Performance: Sparkling beverage unit case volume remained unchanged. Juice, dairy, and plant-based beverages witnessed 1% growth. Water, enhanced water, and sports drinks were down 1% and Tea and Coffee was up 1%.Quarterly Segment DetailsRevenues grew 3% at the North America segment, 6% at Europe, Middle East & Africa, and 7% at Latin America. However, revenues declined 2% in the Asia Pacific segment.Organic revenues grew across the board, increasing 2% in North America, 5% in Europe, Middle East & Africa, 6% in Latin America, 3% in Asia Pacific and 2% in Bottling Investments.MarginsAdjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 170 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.8%.The company’s comparable operating margin grew 404 bps to 27.4% in the quarter, given the divestitures of lower margin bottling businesses and ongoing productivity efforts.Comparable income before income tax was up 2.8% to $ 2.9 billion.Other DevelopmentsThe company remains on track to find ways of reducing the amount of added sugar in many beverages around the world and reformulate more than 500 products this year. The performance of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar was solid in the quarter, growing unit case volume by high single digits. By the first quarter of 2018, Coca-Cola intends to introduce the new recipe in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar in all key markets across the world.Coca-Cola has been focusing more on creating a consumer-centric brand portfolio. The beverage giant made an important addition to its portfolio beyond sparkling soft drinks with the recent acquisition of the Topo Chico premium sparkling mineral water brand in the United States.Coca-Cola also completed a key ownership transition of bottling assets in Africa in early October. However, the company will temporarily hold these businesses until it finds a suitable refranchising partner.2017 Guidance ReaffirmedOrganic revenues are expected to rise 3%. Acquisitions/divestitures (mainly the bottler re-franchising efforts) are expected to hurt revenues by 18%, while Fx is likely to have a negative impact of 1% on revenues.Comparable currency income before income taxes (structurally adjusted) is expected to increase 7-8%. Foreign exchange is expected to hurt comparable income before taxes by 1%. Structural changes are likely to have a 6-7% negative impact on it.The company expects adjusted EPS to range from even to 2% decline from the prior year’s comparable EPS of $1.91.The company expects to buy back shares worth $2.0 billion in 2017.

1951,KO,"Wednesday, October 25, 2017Before we tick down the list of new Q3 earnings reports released before the opening bell this morning, another metric pointing to a strengthening economy: a positive read on September (preliminary) Durable Goods Orders. Results came out way ahead of expectations at +2.2%; analysts had been looking for +0.8%. Removing the more-volatile transportation goods totals, we still see +0.7%, which is again a healthy number. Ex-capital goods, non-Defense, ex-aircraft came in at +1.3%.These numbers indicate that factories look to be busier manufacturing hard products, which spells sunny days ahead for industrial and commercial companies, their workforces and their shareholders. Whatever doubt remains about a new Fed hike coming round the bend is even further quashed. The domestic economy is finally living up to its potential, after years of sluggish growth.Q3 Earnings BonanzaThe Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), speaking of durable goods, topped expectations on both top and bottom lines this morning: $2.72 per share beat the $2.65 Zacks consensus estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. Revenues reached $24.31 billion versus the $24.06 billion expected. The premier aircraft manufacturer also upped full-year guidance by a dime to $9.90 - 10.10 per share. Lower backlog quarter over quarter — an important metric for a company that makes such huge and expensive items — helped its Q3 results. Shares are up modestly at this hour; bear in mind BA stock has skyrocketed 70% since 2017 began.Fiscal Q4 2017 results from Visa (V  -  Free Report) also beat earnings and sales estimates, with 90 cents per share up 5 cents over the Zacks consensus and +15.4% from a year ago. Net operational revenues rose 14% year over year to $4.9 billion, higher than the $4.62 billion we were looking for. Visa continues its pristine earnings performance, having averaged an 8.4% positive surprise in its trailing four quarters. Visa shares are up another 1% in the early session, and are up nearly 40% year to date.Defense major Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) posted a huge earnings beat: $3.68 per share was far ahead of the expected $2.92, whereas quarterly sales of $6.53 billion came in higher than the $6.32 billion anticipated. Northrop also cranked up its full-year earnings guidance notably — from $12.10 - 12.40 per share previously to $12.90 - 13.10 this morning. NOC shares are trading up nearly 2.5% in the current pre-market.Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) also beat on top and bottom lines, albeit less impressively by comparison. Earnings of 50 cents per share topped estimates by a penny, whereas revenues for the quarter $9.1 billion from the expected $8.84 billion. Organic growth of 4% and improved results from its Sprite brand were the notable takeaways. Coke has now beaten earnings estimates 4 times in the last 5 quarters.Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA  -  Free Report) — the parent company of pharma retailer Walgreen’s — posted an impressive earnings beat of $1.31 per share, compared to the $1.22 expected, up 22.4% year over year. Sales of $30.15 billion outpaced the $30.05 in the Zacks estimate, up 5.3% year over year. Strong retail pharma sales in the U.S. was somewhat offset by weaker International sales. But WBA shares are up markedly in today’s early session, nearly +4%.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1953,KO,"The soft drinks industry has been facing the brunt of changing consumer preferences for quite some time now. Consumers are particularly vigilant about the use of artificial sweeteners, high sugar content and related obesity concerns. Also, possible new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are affecting Carbonated Soft Drink (CSD) sales. The challenges in the CSD category have been felt by all major soft drink makers, leading to lower volumes and weak sales.Changing demographics and purchasing behavior make it imperative for the beverage industry giants to reshape their product portfolio. Also, capitalizing on the growing health awareness among consumers can prove beneficial for beverage companies.In line with this, PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) has been broadening its beverage portfolio to include non-carbonated beverages to reduce the dependence on colas. Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.  and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) are also trying to reinvigorate its CSD category by coming up with healthier yet tastier alternatives.Recently, PepsiCo reported third-quarter core earnings per share of $1.48, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%. Core earnings grew 6% year over year, mainly on improved operating efficiency. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 7%. Total sales improved 1.3% year over year to $16.24 billion. Although foreign exchange hurt revenue growth by 1%, pricing had a positive impact of 3%.Currently, the Zacks Soft Drinks Industry (part of the broader Consumer Staples sector) ranks among the top 41% signifying that stocks in this space is likely to benefit from favorable broader factors in the immediate future. Notably, total earnings for the broader Consumer Staples sector( are expected to increase 1.8% in Q3 compared with 5.2% in the preceding quarter. Revenues are also expected to improve 1.8% (1.2% growth in Q2).Let us take a look at how the following soft drinks companies are placed ahead of their third-quarter release on Oct 25.Coca-Cola’s third-quarter revenues/profits will likely decrease owing to structural changes and currency headwinds. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to drive the bottom line. The refranchising efforts, which are hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending and improved return on invested capital over the long term by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.The company expects third-quarter revenues to decline 19-20% owing to acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying a 16.9% decline.Nevertheless, our proven model hints at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP (+0.17) and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.(Read more: Weak Sales Likely to Dampen Coca-Cola's (KO  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings).Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteDr Pepper expects the default by a resin supplier to its operations in Mexico to affect its 2017 operating income by approximately $7-$9 million or 3 cents per share, the impact of which will be felt more in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a decline of 1.8% year over year.Apart from the default, the hurricanes in the United States and the earthquake in Mexico impacted Dr Pepper’s operations.Also, sluggish carbonated beverages (comprise around 82% of its business) volume trends are hurting carbonated beverages (CSD) category growth for quite some time now. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CSD volume growth is projected at a meager 0.02% for the third quarter, less than 3% growth reported last quarter and 2% in the prior-year quarter.Our proven model does not conclusively hint at an earnings beat for this company this quarter, as Dr Pepper does not have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 or higher. The Earnings ESP for Dr Pepper is -0.10% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 which further lowers the possibility of an earnings surprise.(Read more: Will Resin Supply Default Hurt Dr Pepper’s  Q3 Earnings?).Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc QuoteToday's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

1954,KO,"Wednesday, December 20, 2017Ahead of today’s opening bell, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is trading up another 100 points as the market expects Congress’ massive tax bill to pass both houses and wind up on President Trump’s desk today. This “pricing in” of the tax cut passage seems to haver no end in sight: the Dow has risen nearly 5000 points in the past year, roughly 7000 points since Trump was elected.The question for 2018 is: How high can market indexes like the Dow be expected to rise? After all, the effects of the massive corporate tax cut from 35% to 21% have yet to be implemented — all this “pricing in” remains speculative until action is taken.Clearly, this major legislation will boost growth, and whether it does so because companies put their tax cut windfalls to work to grow their businesses or merely turn them over to shareholders via buybacks and dividend payments, either way it’s good for the stock market. But how much will growth be boosted, and for how long? That’s the issue analysts are grappling with here at the end of calendar 2017.A company like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) — trading up in today’s pre-market following yesterday afternoon’s Q2 earnings and sales beat — has already indicated it will increase spending on its various logistics and delivery businesses with the windfall payout the tax cut will grant. This, in turn, could bolster fortunes for goods and services companies who supply FedEx. Longer-term, this would point toward growth not only on FedEx’s bottom line, but in GDP overall.Other companies, like Coca Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for instance, have already indicated it will simply reward shareholders with what it reaps from the coming tax cuts. At first glance this makes Congress’ efforts on this bill look fairly inessential — after all, corporate profits have been enjoying record earnings quarters for a while now; there was no real need to prime the pump like this.But, whether or not you believe in supply-side economics, the “wealth effect” investors will feel from these increased dividends and share-price backstops will likely increase consumption, drive up retail prices and generate GDP growth all by itself. It may not be a “rising tide lifts all boats” scenario, but stock market participants necessarily see this tax bill as a win-win.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

1955,KO,"The Dow experienced a volatile holiday shortened week, suffering losses during two trading sessions. Investors continued to remain concerned about rising inflation and surging bond yields. Disappointing results from a key component also weighed on the index. At the same time, encouraging jobs data helped the index notch up gains.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow increased about 0.1% to post its sixth straight session of gains. However, gains were curbed after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a group of Russian nationals and a few entities from the country regarding their involvement in the U.S. Presidential Elections of 2016. Meanwhile, housing starts surged to its highest levels since the financial crisis of 2008. Also, building permits rose to a 66-month high.The index gained 4.3% over last week, marking its biggest weekly gain since November 2016. President Trump signed into law a bipartisan budget deal that will provide a massive spending boost to the Pentagon and U.S. infrastructure. This in turn had a positive impact on key indexes.Markets managed to rebound after declining initially following a better-than-expected consumer prices report, a key inflation metric. Strong earnings season and steady economy led all the three key indexes to shrug off their yearly declines to close in positive territory.The Dow This WeekMarkets remained closed on Monday due to the observance of President's Day. The index decreased 1% on Tuesday following a decline in the shares of Walmart Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report). Shares of Walmart declined 10.2% after posting fourth-quarter results.Walmart snapped its nine-quarter long trend of posting positive earnings surprises. Also, rate of e-commerce sales growth declined sequentially in the quarter. This was Walmart’s biggest percentage decline in a single day since January 1988.After hitting its highest levels since 2014 last week, the yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note surged to 2.9% on Monday. Further, the short-term two-year yield lingered around a nine-year high. Such a spike in interest rates also weighed on equities and led to broad based losses for markets.The index lost 0.7% or 167 points to finish in the red on Wednesday following the release of minutes from Fed’s latest policy meeting. Bond rates surged to a 4-year high following the release of the minutes and weighed heavily on equities. Earlier in the session, major benchmarks had rallied after the minutes expressed concerns about the lack of broad-based wage gains.At the end of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, Fed officials stated that most members had revised their economic growth projections upward from the last meeting in December. Moreover, the minutes also stated that gradually increasing the interest rates would help in sustaining economic growth.The index gained 0.7% on Thursday following encouraging jobs data which helped to detract attention from ongoing concerns surrounding rising inflation and the spike in bond yields. Initial claims for the week ended Feb 17 declined by 7,000 to 222,000, the second lowest level recorded since the end of the Great Recession.The metric also came in well below the estimated level of 230,000. Ultimately, however, stocks slipped from their session highs after healthcare and financials entered the negative zone during the afternoon session. Components Moving the Index Walmart’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of $1.33 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36. Nonetheless, adjusted earnings grew 2.3% from $1.30 reported in the year-ago period.

U.S. comparable-store sales (comps), excluding fuel, jumped 2.6%, compared with 1.8% growth in the prior-year quarter.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) Walmart’s earnings for fiscal 2018 came in at $4.42 per share, up 2.3% year over year. However, this came below the consensus mark of $4.44. Net revenues for fiscal 2018 advanced 3% to $500.3 billion, cruising ahead of the consensus estimate of $498.1 billion.Notably, U.S. comps for fiscal 2018 climbed 2.1%, whereas Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales soared 44%. For fiscal 2019, the company expects consolidated net sales (on a constant-currency basis) to increase in a range of 1.5- 2%. Walmart U.S. e-commerce sales is projected to jump nearly 40%.

1957,KO,"Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA divested 5.24% of its total stake in the Heineken Group for roughly 2.5 billion euros. The equity offering, which is likely to be concluded on Sep 21, includes shares of Heineken N.V. (HEINY  -  Free Report) and its holding company, Heineken Holding N.V.Incidentally, in January 2010, FEMSA had exchanged its FEMSA Cerveza beer business for about 20% interest in the Heineken Group. Since then, the company has been gaining from its exposure in the beer space through its stake in the second largest brewer.That said, let’s delve deeper into yesterday’s announcement and see where FEMSA is headed.Transaction in DetailManagement at FEMSA stated that the equity sale will reduce its interest in Heineken N.V. from 12.53% to 8.63%. In Heineken Holding N.V., the company’s stake will go down to 12.26% from 14.94%. Consequently, FEMSA’s combined economic interest in the Heineken Group will be reduced to 14.76%.Notably, the equity offering include 22,485,000 and 7,700,000 shares of Heineken N.V. and Heineken Holding N.V., respectively, representing a 3.9% and 2.7% of the issued share capital. Further, the respective gross proceeds from these businesses amounted to 1.9 billion euros and 600 million euros.Meanwhile, L'Arche Green N.V. will buy back 2,564,102 shares of Heineken Holding N.V. in the offering, with the price of each share being decided by FEMSA. In fact, L'Arche Green is a firm through which the Heineken Family controls over Heineken Holding N.V. Therefore, this buyback highlights Heineken family’s commitment toward the company.Where’s FEMSA Headed?FEMSA has been optimistic about its prospects from investment in Heineken for a long time. Though this Mexico based company is lowering its stake in the world’s second largest brewer, it still remains a considerable stakeholder in Heineken. Additionally, FEMSA will continue being entitled to its current governance rights, which include a seat in the Heineken Holding N.V.’s board of directors and two seats in its supervisory board. Thus, this transaction will enhance FEMSA’s monetary position while retaining its governance rights in Heineken. Also, it will help the company to continue leveraging the favorable taxation issued by Mexico’s government, which can be afforded by the Repatriation Decree.Going forward, FEMSA intends to utilize the proceeds from this offering to fund its growth endeavors in Mexico. To this end, the company has been undertaking several strategic endeavors to fuel long-term growth.While stake in Heineken exposes FEMSA to the beer industry, the company gets its exposure to the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA. Notably, Coca-Cola FEMSA operates as the world’s largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) products.Moreover, the company’s share in the retail space relates to the operation of various small-format store chains including OXXO, through its FEMSA Comercio subsidiary. Apart from these, FEMSA provides logistics, point-of-sale refrigeration solutions and plastics solutions to its business units and third-party clients through its FEMSA Strategic Businesses subsidiary. These growth drivers, in turn, have helped the company’s shares surge 30.6% so far this year, surpassing the industry’s 16.2% growth.Hence, it seems that this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is most likely to carry this momentum forward, even after reducing its second largest stake in Heineken Group.Meanwhile, investors can count on alcohol-beverage big-wig, Constellation Brands, Inc. (STZ  -  Free Report). The company with a robust earnings surprise history, holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1959,KO,"The 2017 National Football League (NFL) championship kicked off yesterday and soccer lovers are bubbling with excitement. Wait, the soccer mania does not end here. The buzz is also felt in markets as sponsors make a beeline for profits while the ball rolls. It is here that beverages give their best shot.This year, global viewership is expected to increase manifold, with broad proliferation of digital and social media channels. As such, sponsors are likely to pull off every possible trick in the game to gain maximum brand exposure and top-of-the-mind recall, thus persuading football lovers to spend more on their brands.Importantly, the league too is trying to capitalize on changing demographics and consumers’ shift in preferences. This season, the NFL will allow its television partners to accept commercials for distilled spirits throughout the season, according to a memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Amid falling beer consumption, this marks a major change in NFL’s advertising policy. The NFL confirmed the policy change and described it as one-season test that is expected to become permanent, per a NFL executive.According to Fortune, beer lost 10% of its market share to wine and spirits between 2006 and 2016. Spirits made up 35.9% of the industry in 2016, while wine took 17.1%.This move by the NFL in all likelihood will hit football staples like Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD  -  Free Report) and Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report), but could be a boon to distilled-spirits companies such as Brown-Forman Corporation (BF.B  -  Free Report) and London-based Diageo plc (DEO  -  Free Report).Positive Metrics Set to Cheer InvestorsBeverage companies are set to gain the most from this NFL craze. Let’s first take a look at the fundamentals of the industry.The global beverage market (comprising both non-alcoholic and alcoholic) is likely to reach $1.9 trillion by 2021 and witness a CAGR of 3% from 2016 to 2021, according to ReportLinker quoted on PRNewswire. Growing urbanization and disposable income are its main drivers.The Zacks Beverage Industry has grown 17.6% so far this year, faring a lot better than the broader S&P 500 market’s 10.3% gain. The Zacks Soft Drink Industry has returned almost 15%, while the Alcohol Industry has climbed 30.5%.The Zacks Beverage Industry is expected to witness a solid 17.6% growth this year, higher than the broader market’s expected earnings growth rate of 9%. ROE of the industry stands at 25.5% compared with 15.9% of the S&P 500.The positive momentum is evident from the robust Zacks Industry Rank of these two beverage industries, occupying top 7% out of 256 industries for Alcohol and top 20% for Soft Drinks.6 Prominent PicksInvestors can bank on these beverage stocks, which are making the most of consumer dynamism amid a shift in preferences.

1961,KO,"Shares of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway BRKA recently hit $300,000 per share, a major milestone in the company’s storied history. Buffett and the firm have come a long way, and many now point to ‘the Oracle of Omaha’ as the gold standard of long-term investing.Buffett’s company holds a massive amount shares in some of the biggest and most historic companies in the U.S., including Wells Fargo (WFC  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) and IBM (IBM  -  Free Report). The holding company’s long-term success is also underscored by its Class B shares BRKB, which also rest near their all-time highs.Attempting to mimic Berkshire Hathaway’s success would be tough, but what investors can do in order to try to invest like Buffett is to look at the company’s holdings and find stocks that fit their own strategies.Now, let’s take a look at three stocks with high Zacks Ranks that could help investors act more like Buffett:1.      Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report)Shares of the credit card giant have surged 45.54% in 2017, which more than doubles the S&P 500’s movement. Visa is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has received 16 upward earnings estimate revisions for its current full fiscal year against no downgrades—all within the last 60 days.Based on our Zacks Consensus Estimates, Visa’s EPS is expected to jump 12.95% in its current quarter. Looking further ahead, Visa’s full-year fiscal 2018 earnings are projected to pop by 16.45%. On top of this bottom line growth, the credit card firm’s fiscal 2018 sales are expected to hit $20.09 billion, marking a 9.45% climb—which would be strong for a company of its size and age.Visa also boasts a cash flow growth rate of 20.74%, which doubles the “Financial Transaction Services” average and looks even better compared to rival Mastercard (MA  -  Free Report). This growing cash position should help the company invest more in up-and-coming payment methods, including the quickly growing mobile payment sector where Visa already operates.2.       Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (WMT  -  Free Report)Walmart is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an overall “B” VGM score. Shares of the retail powerhouse have climbed 41% in 2017 and 23.69% in the last 12-weeks. Walmart has also recently proved that it is prepared to take on Amazon  after posting strong e-commerce and grocery sales.Walmart’s P/S ratio is currently 0.59, helping demonstrate that the retail powerhouse presents investors with a solid bang for their respective buck. On top of that, the company is trading at 22.11x earnings, which is comparable to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry average.Within the last 60 days, Walmart has experienced nine upward earnings estimate revisions for its current quarter and 14 for its full-year. These earnings revisions are highly important and often prove to be a strong indicator of future performance. Walmart has beat or matched earnings estimates in 13 of the last 14 quarters, including each of the trailing nine periods.3.       American Express Company (AXP  -  Free Report)Shares of American Express currently sit close to their 52-week high, after climbing 13% in the last 12 weeks to help the company’s current year gains reach 34.56%. But American Express could easily break into a new range if the company matches its bottom line growth projections.American Express is projected to see its fourth quarter 2017 earnings skyrocketed by 69.56% to hit $1.54 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. The company’s sales are also expected to gain nearly 9% to hit $8.73 billion in Q4.American Express is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) that is trading at 17.02 earnings, which marks a discount against its industry’s average. The credit card company has also matched or topped earnings estimates in each of the trailing three quarters, as well as seven of the last eight.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other. He believes in its short-term profit potential and also in its prospects to more than double by 2019. Today he reveals and explains his surprising move in a new Special Report.Download it free >>

1962,KO,"Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated , the largest independent bottler of The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) in the U.S., is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 8, after the closing bell.Shares of Coke Consolidated have been rising in recent months, returning 33.5% year to date, faring a lot better than the 13.9% growth of its industry.The following chart below depicts the share price performance so far this year:The upside is primarily attributable to the company’s continuous focus on expanding its distribution territory, while growing its organic businesses.In fact, in the last reported quarter, Coca-Cola Bottling’s net sales of $865.7 million increased 38.4% year over year primarily on acquisitions and higher comparable net sales. Comparable net sales grew 1.8% driven by a 2.6% rise in comparable equivalent unit case volumes. Sparkling product volume grew 1.3% and that of still products increased 6%. This growth trend is also expected to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.The company also expects to continue growing both organically and through acquisition of additional manufacturing and distribution territory.The company’s first-quarter adjusted earnings remained flat at 45 cents per share year over year. Notably, the company’s comparable income from operations were adversely impacted by an increase in selling, delivery and administrative expenses required to improve the corporate support service functions of the company both during its current stage of growth and in preparation for the conclusion of all territory acquisition and exchange transactions.Higher expenses might also negatively impact the company’s bottom line as well.Peer ReleasesThe Coca-Cola Company reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. Second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of the company were 59 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 3.5%.PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results in second-quarter 2017 (ending Jun 17), with both earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. PepsiCo’s second-quarter core earnings per share of $1.50 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 by 7.1%.Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc.’s  adjusted second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of $1.25 missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.28 by 2.3%.5 Trades Could Profit """"Big-League"""" from Trump PoliciesIf the stocks above spark your interest, wait until you look into companies primed to make substantial gains from Washington's changing course.Today Zacks reveals 5 tickers that could benefit from new trends like streamlined drug approvals, tariffs, lower taxes, higher interest rates, and spending surges in defense and infrastructure.See these buy recommendations now >>

1963,KO,"Monster Beverage Corporation (MNST  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 financial numbers on Aug 8, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.13%. However, the company managed to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 0.82%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Monster Beverage Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Monster Beverage Corporation QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayA look at estimate revisions gives us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share remained stable over the past 30 days at 40 cents. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 20.2%.This double-digit expected earnings growth is likely to be driven by higher sales banking on innovations, solid demand for the company’s energy drink brands and expansion into new markets.Product innovation plays a major role in the company’s success. The company regularly introduces new flavors of existing products, while removing non-performing products. Again, the company's strategic deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) expanded its portfolio with notable brands with increased presence in the international energy drinks market. This addition has been boosting the company’s sales and such a trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter as well.However, Monster Beverage’s sales and profits have been dented significantly by unfavorable currency translations. Although the U.S. dollar has recently softened against other currencies, the impact is still significant. Expenses associated with expansion, such as higher payroll expenses, are also likely to impact the company’s profitability.Distributor termination expenses too might affect the company’s bottom line. The company has been transitioning from third-party distributors to Coca-Cola’s distribution network following the strategic deal with Coca-Cola.Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $906.6 million for the said quarter, reflecting an increase of 9.6% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Monster Beverage is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Monster Beverage’s Earnings ESP is 0.00% as the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 40 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Monster Beverage’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident of a positive earnings surprise.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are two consumer staples stocks that you may want to consider, as our model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Energizer Holdings, Inc. (EPC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.27% and a Zacks Rank #3. The company is scheduled to report its quarterly numbers on Aug 8.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (CCE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +4.69% and a Zacks Rank #2.

1964,KO,"Rising health consciousness has been a drag on cola giants. The low-carb diet may be in the best interest of people, but it is terrifying for the many in the beverage industry. Still, two cola and food behemoths – Coca Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report) and PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report) – have made decent progress this year on the back of healthy variations in their offerings and a subdued greenback. KO and PEP are up over 10% and 12%, respectively, so far this year (as of July 26, 2017).Let’s delve a little deeper into their Q2 earnings results and see if the stocks could add more gains ahead (read: 4 ETFs to Ride on 16-Year High Consumer Confidence). Results in Detail On July 26, Coca-Cola reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. Organic revenue growth in sparkling soft drinks, led by innovation in and marketing support for its low and no-sugar options like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar led to the success. Second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.57. However, earnings decreased 1.7% year over year due to currency headwinds as well as higher costs associated with refranchising efforts.Net revenue declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion, marking the ninth successive quarterly decline in revenues. Currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%. Revenues marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.71 billion. The stock gained about 1.1% in the key trading session, post earnings release.PepsiCo’s second-quarter 2017 earnings released two weeks ago. Core earnings per share of $1.50 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.40 by 7.1%. Core earnings grew 10% year over year. In constant currency terms, adjusted earnings grew 13%. The upside was primarily driven by higher pricing, partly offset by weak demand.Total sales improved 2% year over year to $15.71 billion. Reported revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.64 billion by 0.4%. Excluding the impact of Fx, revenues increased 3.1% on an organic basis. While volumes for organic snacks/food increased 2% (higher than 1% growth witnessed in the first quarter), beverage volumes dropped 2%.PepsiCo lifted its core EPS forecast for 2017 to $5.13 from $5.09 expected earlier. The company now anticipates foreign exchange to have less negative impact on core earnings than previously expected.Since the release of earnings, PepsiCo traded in the green (up about 3%) (as of July 26, 2017), mainly to reflect the enhanced outlook.ETF Impact The Zacks Industry and Sector Ranks of KO and PEP are in the top 9% and top 19%. The consumer staples ETFs having notable exposure to Coca Cola and PepsiCo also seemed to have benefited, as the duo and the related ETFs beat the broader market index in the last 10 sessions (see all Consumer Staples ETFs here).Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report) The most popular consumer ETF on the market, XLP, follows the S&P Consumer Staples Select Sector Index. Of its 38 holdings, the in-focus Coca-Cola takes the third spot, making up roughly 9.50% of the assets while PepsiCo accounts for about 5.21% of XLP, taking up the sixth position (read: Amazon's Foray Into Grocery to Hurt/Help These Stocks & ETFs).In terms of sector exposure, the fund is skewed toward food & staples retailing which makes up for one-fourth share, closely followed by beverages (21.59%) and household products (20.4%).Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (VDC  -  Free Report) This fund provides exposure to a basket of 103 consumer stocks by tracking the MSCI US Investable Market Consumer Staples 25/50 Index.

1965,KO,"The Dow enjoyed a strong week of gains, riding on stellar earnings results. The index declined on Monday due to a spike in bond yields, which dimmed the attraction of such safe haven stocks as telecom and utilities. But the index closed in the green on each successive day, closing Thursday at a record level. The Fed’s decision to refrain from raising rates at the end of its two-day policy meeting also lifted investor sentiment.Last Week’s PerformanceThe Dow lost 0.2% last Friday after General Electric Company GE posted a decline in second-quarter earnings and revenues. Furthermore, decline in oil prices adversely affected energy shares, which in turn weighed on the broader markets. As per Petro-Logistics, OPEC is expected to increase crude production by 145,000 barrels per day (bpd) this month. Such expectations of an increase in production level amid oversupply concerns dragged oil prices lower.The index declined 0.3% over last week. Dismal performance by IBM (IBM  -  Free Report) and Goldman Sachs GS weighed on the Dow. Again, the Amazon-Sears deal adversely affected Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report), which in turn weighed on the Dow. Other benchmarks ended the week with gains.The Dow This WeekThe Dow declined 0.3% on Monday, largely due to the fact that bond yields increased, leading investors to exit in utilities and telecom stocks. Also, shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) fell 1.5%, dragging down the blue-chip index. This was largely due to the fact that Merck and Co. (MRK  -  Free Report) together with its South Korean partner Samsung Bioepis Co Ltd has started selling Renflexis, a less expensive alternative version of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade in the United States.The index gained 0.5% on Tuesday following stellar earning results from McDonald's Corp. MCD and Caterpillar Inc. CAT. Oil prices rose following Saudi’s decision to curb oil exports to the US. There were broad gains for technology stocks as the tech rally continued.The index increased 0.5% on Wednesday, boosted by strong earnings results and the Fed’s decision not to raise rates at the end of its two-day meeting. Splendid second quarter earnings from The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) helped close the Dow at a record high.The Dow outperformed the two other benchmarks to close at a record high on Thursday, riding on a rally in shares of Boeing Company and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report). The blue-chip index gained 0.4%. However, technology stocks took a battering as shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) swooned due to now familiar speculations about overvaluation of tech stocks.Components Moving the Index 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported strong second-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in earnings and revenues.

The index’s big move was spurred in part by Boeing’s (BA  -  Free Report) massive climb after it reported its second-quarter financial results, which have helped it jump 8.35% through early afternoon trading.The airplane manufacturer added more than 100 points on Wednesday to move past Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) as the most expensive stock in the Blue-Chip index.Solid early Wednesday gains from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), General Electric (GE  -  Free Report), and Verizon (VZ  -  Free Report) also helped the 30-stock index reach an intraday high of 21,742.70. The Dow is up 9.86% year-to-date.S&P 500 & NasdaqThe S&P 500 also reached new heights today, just one day after closing—yet again—at an all-time high of 2,477.13, on the back of big movement from Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and McDonald’s (MCD  -  Free Report).

1968,KO,"Coca-Cola Co. (KO  -  Free Report) is replacing its Coke Zero beverage in the U.S. with another diet-soda brand, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, as the company tries to hold onto customers pulling back on sugary drinks.The iconic beverage company said that Zero Sugar is already a strong seller in Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. Coca-Cola spent more than five years on research, recipe mixing and testing of Zero Sugar before its debut.“It is a reinvention of Coke Zero,” CEO James Quincey said in a call with investors. Zero Sugar features a new recipe and design, making it appear and taste closer to the standard Coca-Cola. Like Coke Zero, Zero Sugar contains the artificial sweetener aspartame.Zero Sugar is aimed to appeal to customers looking for lower-sugar options. The beverage’s name is also made to better communicate its no sugar content to customers as new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages are being introduced across the country.“It may surprise you to learn, but it’s true that customers have not always been clear that either Diet Cokes or Coke Zeroes are absolutely zero sugar. That’s just a fact of consumer research, Quincy said.Coca-Cola also plans to use Zero Sugar as an alternative to diet sodas. Consumers have not been buying artificially sweetened diet sodas as low and no-calorie cola sales fell 5% by volume in North America last year. Diet Coke was the third-biggest brand in 2016, but has experienced a 2% loss in sales.Coke Zero, on the other hand, has gained popularity. Last year, it was the number 10 soda brand in the U.S. and had a sales growth of 3.5%.Coca-Cola Zero Sugar will become available in the U.S. in August. Coke Zero will then be phased out.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1969,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected second-quarter 2017 results. Innocent juice and smoothie business in Europe, organic revenue growth in sparkling soft drinks, led by innovation in and marketing support for its low and no-sugar options like Coca-Cola Zero Sugar have helped it in coming up with better numbers.Earnings BeatSecond-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of the company were 59 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 57 cents by 3.5%.Earnings, however, decreased 1.7% year over year due to currency headwinds as well as higher costs associated with refranchising efforts.Sales DiscussionNet revenue declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.

1970,KO,"U.S. equities have had a stellar run on strong growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump’s tax reform. However, latest developments in the political landscape in the United States spell trouble for the Republicans.Positives for TrumpGDP growth for the United States was revised up to 3.3% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the previous quarter. The third quarter reading was revised from an initial reading of 3%. This was the strongest quarterly growth reading in three years. Non-farm payrolls increased 228,000 in November, per the Labor Department.Moreover, unemployment rate came in at 4.1%, a 17-year low. This comes as a positive for Trump, who seeks to brand himself as a leader of the masses.Risks InvolvedHowever, all’s not well for the Trump administration. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy S. Moore in the Senate election in Alabama, a deep red state which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the November 2016 Presidential election. Moore had been accused of sexual abuse and child molestation, which might have been a factor for the relatively low support he received.“We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,” Jones said. “This entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law,” he added.The GOP Senate majority has slimmed to 51-49 after Moore’s defeat. This might create difficulties for the Trump administration to pass its key legislations.Although the Senate passed the Republican tax reform, there are increased concerns around the differences in the versions of the House and Senate. Moreover, geopolitical risks weigh on the markets. Last month, North Korea launched a Hwasong-15 missile with improved technology that flew over Japan in a latest show of force.Owing to the high uncertainty in the markets, we believe it is best to opt for low volatility. Hence, we will now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the low volatility space of the U.S. equity markets.iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF that provides exposure to U.S. companies with low risk.It has AUM of $15.1 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

1971,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, has regained its position in investors’ books after a solid third-quarter 2017, which marked a turnaround in the company’s dismal surprise trend. Further, the company remains poised for growth driven by solid portfolio and robust strategic measures including increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. These factors make FEMSA a favorable pick at the moment with a promising future.Further, the stock is supported by a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a VGM Score of A, which justifies growth prospects. These factors have helped the company retain a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of FEMSA jumped 8.4% in the past month, outperforming the broader industry’s 3.2% upside. That said, let’s find out the reasons behind the upsurge in the stock price.Return to Positive Surprise TrendAs mentioned earlier, FEMSA returned to earnings beat trend in third-quarter 2017, with both earnings sales topping estimates. Notably, it reported a positive earnings surprise after four consecutive bottom-line misses, while revenues topped estimates after two consecutive misses. Sales gains in the quarter were fueled by solid performance across all segments, taking into account the consolidation of the Philippines and Vonpar’s integration at Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF  -  Free Report).Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteMeanwhile, earnings gained from the sale of 5.24% interest in Heineken Group, the parent of Heineken NV (HEINY  -  Free Report) and financial gains at Coca-Cola FEMSA.Positive Estimate RevisionsAnalysts seem to have become increasingly positive on the stock, following the impressive third quarter. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and full-year 2017 has been trending up lately. The estimate for fourth-quarter has moved up 2.8% to $1.09 per share in the last seven days. Similarly, the full-year estimate witnessed a 22.5% growth to $7.24 per share.FEMSA Formidable Portfolio – A Key StrengthFEMSA has a formidable portfolio with exposure in various industries including beverage, beer and retail. This provides it an edge over competitors. The company mainly gets its exposure to the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA, which operates as the world’s largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report). In the beer industry, it enjoys a notable position as it owns 14.76% in Heineken, a leading brewer with operations in 70 countries.Moreover, its share in the retail space relates to the operation of various small-format store chains including OXXO, through its FEMSA Comercio subsidiary. Apart from these, FEMSA provides logistics, point-of-sale refrigeration solutions and plastics solutions to its business units and third-party clients through FEMSA Strategic Businesses subsidiary.Other Growth DriversFEMSA has been taking prudent steps to diversify product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bodes well for future operating performance. In an attempt to strengthen retail portfolio, the company acquired Big John, a grocery store, in Santiago, Chile. Given its renowned status and solid growth prospects, Big John is likely to enhance FEMSA Comercio’s convenience store operations in Chile.The company has been focused on achieving growth via acquisitions for a while now. Earlier, the company gained presence in South America through the Grupo Socofar buyout, which not only widened its exposure in the drugstore business but also brought beauty operations under its ambit. Additionally, the company has been diversifying retail chain format operations by acquiring businesses across Latin America. FEMSA Comercio has considerably extended its footprint in the small-format retail chains in Mexico, Chile and Colombia.Additionally, FEMSA has been focused on expanding its drugstore operations as it sees significant potential in that space. The company has been aggressively seeking to capitalize on growing drugstore business. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had a total of 2,178 point of sales across all regions, of which 24 net new stores were added in the third quarter.Further, it is on track with efforts to build infrastructure and integrate four legacy drugstore operations into a single operating platform. These include its previously acquired Mexican drugstore business — Farmacias YZA, Farmacias FM Moderna and Farmacias Farmacón — as well as South America’s leading drugstore operator, Grupo Socofar. We believe FEMSA’s venture into the drugstore business strategically fits its chain-store business, and will be accretive to both its top and bottom-lines in the long term.Possible DeterrentsWhile FEMSA displays overall strength in operations, its margins remained under pressure. Gross margin was hurt by growth of lower-margin businesses at FEMSA Comercio, while operating margin contracted due to soft Coca-Cola FEMSA margins. Further, margins at FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division are likely to remain soft going forward. The company also provided a cautious sales outlook for fourth-quarter 2017 and 2018 backed by high inflation rates, upcoming presidential elections in Mexico and ongoing discussions to modernize trade.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

Sales volume represents concentrates and finished beverages sold to bottlers, retailers and distributors. BCS includes the sale of finished packaged beverages by the company and its bottlers to retailers and independent distributors.In 2017, BCS volumes increased 1% year over year.

Branded CSD volume was up 1%, while NCB volume increased 4% from the prior-year quarter.Segment DetailBeverage Concentrates segment revenues were up 3.7% year over year on higher pricing, a 2% increase in concentrate case sales and lower discounts.Packaged Beverage segment sales increased 3.7% from the prior year on favorable product and package mix.Latin America Beverage segment revenues also increased 5.9% year over year owing to increased sales volume and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable package and product mix, and unfavorable foreign currency translation.FinancialsCash and cash equivalents were $158 million as of Dec 31, 2017, compared with $1,787 million at 2016-end.

1974,KO,"Revenues of The Coca-Cola Company’s (KO  -  Free Report) North America segment, comprising about 30% of its topline, are expected to decline in the fourth quarter of 2017, when it reports on Friday, Feb 16.A Look at Coca-Cola’s North America Performance in Q3The North America segmental revenues totaled $2.75 billion last quarter, increasing 3% year over year on 2% growth in price/mix. Organically, revenues rose 2% in the period while volumes remained unchanged during the same. Price/mix increased on the company’s disciplined approach to occasion, brand, price and package strategy as well as positive business and category mix.Notably, sparkling beverage volumes have shown no growth during the quarter that includes mid-single digit growth in Sprite, offset by a mid-single digit decline in Diet Coke. The company registered low single-digit rise in tea and coffee, offset by a low single-digit fall in water, enhanced water and sports drinks.Precisely, the company’s sparkling beverage unit case volume was flat in the third and second quarters with a 1% decline witnessed in the first quarter of 2017. Notably, the sparkling beverage accounted for 72% of the company’s 2016 worldwide unit case volume. Hence, such vast exposure puts Coca-Cola in a weak spot.Coca-Cola’s North American sparkling beverage business has been delivering sluggish results due to carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds. Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness are hurting demand for CSDs. Consumer tastes are swiftly shifting from CSDs to healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters.The challenges in the CSD category have been affecting all major soft drink makers namely Coca-Cola, PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Monster Beverage (MNST  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group , leading to lower volumes and soft sales.Q4 ProjectionThough Coca-Cola has increased marketing investments and is driving package and product innovation to boost its carbonated beverage business, these efforts are yet to show meaningful results with the trend unlikely to change in the fourth quarter as well.Overall, Coca-Cola’s North American segmental revenues are expected to witness a 1.7% decline year over year and an 11.6%, sequentially, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Apart from the North American segment, Coca-Cola’s Latin America revenues are likely to witness 9.9% growth. While the consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment’s revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase from $1.6 billion a year ago. Bottling Investments revenues are anticipated to decrease to $1.3 billion from $4.1 billion a year ago. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to increase 3.2% on a year-over-year basis.Overall Earnings & Revenue ExpectationsOverall, the beverage behemoth’s fourth-quarter revenues are likely to decline on structural changes. However, the company had earlier stated that its fourth quarter might benefit from an extra day compared with the prior-year period, which equates with roughly one additional point of top-line growth for the soon-to-be-quarter.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola expects the net impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural items to be a 27-point headwind on net revenues and an 11-12 point headwind on profit before tax in the fourth quarter.The company had earlier stated that the hurricane strikes in North America during the third quarter caused disruption to its supply chain, registering an estimated $50 million rise in costs, majority of which is forecast to affect the fourth quarter.Nonetheless, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support the bottom line of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to some extent. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents for fourth-quarter earnings reflects 2.7% growth from the prior-year period’s profit of 37 cents per share. Also, the consensus mark for revenues of $7.4 billion represents a 21.7% decrease on a year-over-year basis.(Read More: Will Cost Saving Plans Support Coca-Cola's Q4 Earnings?)Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Coca-Cola Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteThe Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

1975,KO,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Information Technology, Health Care and Consumer Staples with 19.6%, 16.6% and 13.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).

1976,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference. The company has been witnessing a decline in revenues for the last nine quarters, primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category, and structural changes.Coca-Cola’s second-quarter revenues declined 16% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 17% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 2%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 19-20% in net revenues from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt quarterly net revenues by 1-2%.Segment Discussion: North America, comprising about 30% of the total revenues, is expected to see tepid growth in third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment revenues of $2.6 billion reflect growth of 1% from the year-ago quarter.Latin America revenues are likely to witness 4.8% growth. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Europe, Middle East and Africa segment revenues of $1.9 billion indicates a decrease of 7.1% from the prior quarter and Bottling Investments revenues are likely to decrease 54% year over year. Again, Asia Pacific revenues are expected to decrease 0.4% on a year-over-year basis.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, the cola giant has surpassed analysts’ expectations for earnings in 12 of the past 13 quarters. However, the company’s adjusted EPS, excluding one-time items, have fallen for the past nine consecutive quarters.As mentioned earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 9-10% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 2-3% on quarterly profits before taxes.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 210 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.6% in the second quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Overall, the beverage behemoth’s third-quarter revenues/profits are likely to decline owing to structural changes and currency headwind. We feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent. The refranchising efforts, though hurting sales/profits in the near term, will result in higher operating margins, lower capital spending, and improved return on invested capital in the long run by reducing exposure to the low-margin bottling operations.For the third quarter, Coca-Cola’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 49 cents, reflecting a 0.7% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $8.84 billion, implying 16.9% decline.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Coca-Cola has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.  Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Coca-Cola is +0.17%.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuoteStocks Worth a LookHere are a few consumer staples stocks you may consider, as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.13% and a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1977,KO,"McDonald's Corp. (MCD  -  Free Report) is leaving no stone unturned to revitalize its McCafe brand. In this regard, the company is focusing on new cafe-quality espresso beverages, extended retail offerings and a branding overhaul to gain ground in the battle for the nation's coffee drinkers.Inside the HeadlinesIn addition to recrafted lattes and mochas, the company has added a new set of espresso-based beverages to the McCafe lineup that are made with freshly-ground espresso and US-sourced whole or nonfat milk. The three new beverages include caramel macchiato, cappuccino and americano.Notably, these new offerings along with all McCafe specialty beverages will be available for $2 for a limited time at the participating restaurants.  Also, the company recently inked a deal with The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) to bring a line of ready-to-drink McCafe Frappe beverges to groceries across the United States in early 2018. The bottled drinks will come in three flavors that include caramel, vanilla and mocha.Currently, the fast food chain maintains a line of whole bean, ground and single-serve coffee in retail stores. Therefore, this will be McDonalds’ first foray into the nearly $2 billion ready-to-drink coffee category.Apart from the coffee upgrades, McDonald's also announced a McCafe brand revamp with the introduction of a new brand logo and packaging that will change with the seasons. In fact, as part of its evolving Experience of the Future initiative, the company also plans to transform its in-restaurant McCafe presence with a sleek and contemporary look in 2018.Furthermore, the company has brought in new coffee makers into its stores so that the new espresso-based beverages are handcrafted with a steady, appetizing flavor. The rollout to nearly all of McDonald's 14,000 restaurants is accompanied by new training for crew members.Rationale BehindWith its refined new beverages and updated branding, the company aims to capitalize on the growing coffee culture among customers and meet their demand in terms of taste, convenience and value. In October 2016, the company had stated that it would be buying all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. Elevating its coffee business has thus become an essential part of its growth strategy amid escalating demand for the same and continual pressure on the food sales.Markedly, McDonald's launched the coffee brand McCafe in the United States in 2009. Though McCafe generates nearly $4 billion in sales annually in the country, it has the scope to fare much better. In fact, this is just the start to its McCafe commitment with more transformations in store.Moreover, by bringing bottled McCafe drinks to store shelves, the company aims to keep up with rival Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s (DNKN  -  Free Report) Dunkin’ Donuts that signed similar deal with Coca Cola last year, and coffee giant Starbucks Corporation (SBUX  -  Free Report), which sells its bottled Frappuccinos in partnership with Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and has for long dominated the ready-to-drink coffee space.Bottom LineMcDonald’s shares have gained 23.5% over the past six months, outpacing 9% growth of the industry it belongs to.In fact, growing guest count remains McDonald’s top priority and it is undertaking various sales and digital initiatives to this end. The company has thus been simplifying menus, offering value meals, rolling out all-day breakfast in the United States, focusing on delivery to provide increased convenience and taking steps to meet consumer preference for quality food.By elevating and leveraging the McCafe coffee brand, the company aims to further raise the bar for guests and convert casual diners to loyal customers.Additionally, we note that ever since jumping into the coffee fray, McDonald's has gained from pricing its beverages far lower than its direct coffee competitors. Thus, the new drinks and expansion into retail is likely to add to McDonald’s top line and may perhaps prove to be challenging for its close competitors.McDonald's currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

1978,KO,"Stock futures are up slightly in today’s pre-market, following a precipitous sell-off yesterday, especially in the Dow. Myriad concerns — from North Korea nuclear testing to Hurricane Irma heading for another major American flood plain (this time Florida) — seemed to finally cause a downturn in equities trading on Tuesday.Perhaps it was that so many concerns, which on their own never seemed to register much resistance to the overall bull market of the last 10 months, all coming at the same time — and following a holiday weekend — created a “wall of worry” in aggregate. Or maybe it has more to do with the same bell being rung over and over — such as Kim Jon-un’s 6th nuke test, or the U.S.’s 2nd major hurricane to approach our shores — that finally sets traders into generating a headwind against the long-term bulls.Hurricane IrmaConsidering the coming storm for a moment, although Hurricane Harvey off the Southeast coast of Texas is already projected to be the most expensive storm in U.S. history, Irma is much bigger and faster — 400 miles in diameter with winds 185+ miles per hour — and, in fact, is now one of the biggest storms ever recorded!So we’re seeing huge runs on supplies at Home Depot (HD  -  Free Report) and bottled water from companies like Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) for those likely to try and ride the storm out. Hopefully this will result in unnecessary stockpiles if Irma suddenly turns back out to sea, but for now preparations are for another catastrophic storm to hit later this week. Irma is already bearing down on Puerto Rico this morning.Multitudes BuildingEither way, this theory would suggest that the more we see getting in the way of a prosperous market, complete with robust U.S. labor and lower-than-expected inflation, the more we see the likelihood of pushback and thus more red closings on the main indices. For today, we’re seeing a bit of a rebound ahead of the bell, perhaps the result of no new negative reports coming from North Korea or Hurricane Irma not yet making landfall in the continental U.S. to further drag stocks down.Even President Trump and Attorney General Sessions’ rollback of the “Dreamers” act — which would set about deporting 800K people currently living in the U.S. because they arrived as children undocumented — must pass through Congress before it has a material impact on our economy. Executives from Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report) and elsewhere sent an open letter to Trump to reconsider his position on repealing DACA, to no avail. (Then again, it’s not like the president has a very good relationship with top executives these days, anyway.)July Trade DeficitWe see better-than-expected results in July’s trade balance: what was expected to ratchet up near -$45 billion has instead registered -$43.7 billion. True, we’re still deep in negative territory and slightly worse than last month’s -$43.5 billion, but the June read was the smallest deficit we’ve seen all year. Compare this with the nearly -$49 billion we saw in the first month of the year. Of course, we’re still a long way from being solvent on this measure — and likely will never be, actually — but we are in better stead than we had been earlier in the year.HPE BeatsFollowing a giant sell-off of more than 20% in the last 5 trading days at Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE  -  Free Report), shares are trading up in today’s pre-market following its positive surprise in earnings and especially revenues for its fiscal Q3 2017 after the bell yesterday: earnings of 30 cents per share beat the Zacks consensus by a penny, whereas quarterly sales of $8.21 billion easily topped the $7.79 billion we had anticipated. Higher sales in its networking equipment contributed to the beat. Shares originally rose 4% on the news, and are now roughly +2.6% a half-hours before Wednesday’s bell.

1980,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, seems to be a favorable pick at the moment with a promising future. The company has been riding on solid portfolio and robust strategic measures including increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focusing on core business activities to drive growth.Further, the stock is supported by a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% and a VGM Score of B, which justifies its growth prospects. These factors have aided the company to attain a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, shares of FEMSA have climbed 27.2% year to date, outperforming the industry’s 14.6% growth. That said, let’s delve deeper and find what’s driving the performance lately.FEMSA Portfolio is an Eye-CatcherFEMSA has a formidable portfolio with exposure in various industries including beverage, beer and retail. This provides it an edge over competitors. The company mainly gets its exposure to the beverage industry through Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF  -  Free Report), which operates as the world’s largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report). In the beer industry, it enjoys a notable position as it owns the second largest stake in Heineken NV (HEINY  -  Free Report), a leading brewer with operations in 70 countries.Moreover, its share in the retail space relates to the operation of various small-format store chains including OXXO, through its FEMSA Comercio subsidiary. Apart from these, FEMSA provides logistics, point-of-sale refrigeration solutions and plastics solutions to its business units and third-party clients through FEMSA Strategic Businesses subsidiary.FEMSA’s Health Division Holds PotentialFEMSA has been focused on expanding drugstore operations as it sees significant potential in that space. The company has been aggressively seeking to capitalize on the rapidly growing drugstore business. Further, it is on track with efforts to build infrastructure and integrate its four legacy drugstore operations into a single operating platform. These include its previously acquired Mexican drugstore business — Farmacias YZA, Farmacias FM Moderna and Farmacias Farmacón — as well as South America’s leading drugstore operator, Grupo Socofar. We believe FEMSA’s foray in to the drugstore business strategically fits its chain store business, and will be accretive to both its top and bottom line in the long term.Diversifying Business a Key StrategyFEMSA has been increasingly focused on diversifying products portfolio, while expanding in the small-box retail segment. To do this, FEMSA has been concentrating on achieving growth via acquisitions for a while now. A recent addition to its retail portfolio is the acquisition of grocery store chain — Big John in Santiago, Chile. This business is likely to enhance FEMSA Comercio’s convenience store operations in Chile.Previously, the company gained presence in South America through the Grupo Socofar buyout, which not only widened exposure in the drugstore business but also brought beauty operations under its ambit. Additionally, the company has been diversifying retail chain format operations by acquiring businesses across Latin America. To date, FEMSA Comercio has considerably extended footprint in the small-format retail chains in Mexico, Chile and Colombia.Healthy FinancialsMoreover, FEMSA's strong cash flow generation capacity and a healthy balance sheet enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion. The company is effectively utilizing available funds to grow core bottling and convenience store operations as well as expand organic and inorganic businesses.Possible DeterrentsWhile all is well with FEMSA’s fundamentals, the company has been displaying a negative surprise trend of late. Notably, the company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters now, delivering an average negative surprise of 19.4%. Further, sales lagged estimates for the second straight quarter in second-quarter 2017.Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteThough the company posted sales gain across all segments, bottom-line results were impacted by strained margins and higher operating expenses at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio’s Health division. Further, FEMSA has been facing difficult times due to currency headwinds, which has been weighing on Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results for a while now.Nevertheless, we believe these issues are short-lived and the company will tide over these.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough. There’s a simple way to invest in the success of the entire sector. Zacks has just released a Special Report revealing one thing tech companies literally cannot function without. More importantly, it reveals 4 top stocks set to skyrocket on increasing demand for these devices.

1981,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) has a possibility to take over the renowned energy drink maker Monster Beverage Corp. (MNST  -  Free Report), according to founder of The Street, Jim Cramer. Meanwhile, Monster Beverage’s shares scaled a new 52-week high of $56.44 on Aug 31, finally ending the day’s trading a tad lower at $55.82.Coca-Cola had already acquired a 16.7% stake in Monster Beverage on Jun 12, 2015. Hence, according to Cramer, Monster Beverage is a possible buyout choice for Coca-Cola as the company has also been focusing on portfolio expansion in order to gain a competitive edge in the U.S. beverage space.Furthermore, Coca-Cola’s new CEO, James Quincey is known for his motivation in expanding the company’s brand through acquisitions.In the U.S. beverage space, Coca-Cola along with other major soft drink makers like Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc.  have been facing carbonated soft drinks (CSD) category headwinds for some time now.Cross-category competition and growing health and wellness consciousness have resulted in a drastic shift in consumer demand toward healthier beverages like energy drinks, tea juices and flavored waters. Consumer’s watchfulness over the use of artificial sweeteners and high sugar content has dented sales for companies belonging to the beverage industry.In fact, Coca-Cola’s second-quarter 2017 revenues declined 16% year over year to $9.7 billion, marking the ninth consecutive quarterly decline in revenues.Year to date, shares of Coca-Cola have underperformed the industry. The company’s shares have rallied 9.8% as compared with the industry’s 14.1% gain.Notably, new taxes levied on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressure are affecting CSD sales for Coca-Cola. In order to navigate such challenges, it is necessary for the company to diversify its portfolio by tacking on other healthier energy drink makers like Monster Beverage.Monster Beverage drinks are healthier options and keeps up with changing consumer preferences. New innovative mutant soft drink, known as “super soda,” has considerably drove revenues and profits in the last quarter from the year-ago quarter for Monster Beverage.However, Coca-Cola’s strategic efforts in enhancing its portfolio as a total beverage company are encouraging. Takeover of Monster Beverage can therefore prove beneficial in terms of revenue growth for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company.

1982,KO,"Welcome to the second episode of Full-Court Finance, a new podcast from Zacks Investment Research focused on the intersection of sports, business, and the stock market. This week, we explore the rapid rise of esports.Esports is essentially professional video gaming. The all-encompassing term covers different video games, leagues, tournaments, companies, countries, and much more. Industry revenues are projected to skyrocket 41% this year to hit $696 million while reaching 385.5 million fans,according to a report by gaming-focused market research firm Newzoo.By 2020, advertising, sponsorship, media rights, consumer spending, and video game maker investment will help make esports a $1.5 billion industry.The U.S. government has granted work visas for professional video gamers, the Olympic Council of Asia recently voted to include esports in the 2018 Asian Games after a push from Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) subsidiary Alisports, and the Paris Olympic committee has even considered testing video game competitions at the summer games in 2024.Television and news giants including ESPN, NBC, and TBS have already committed to broadcasting and covering esports, which includes a focus on multiplayer online battle arena games Defense of the Ancients and League of Legends, as well as the first person shooter games Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and Overwatch.Esports are a massive draw for marketers and advertisers because their average audience is made up of mostly employed men between 18 to 35 years old—a demographic that has become harder to reach than ever.On top of this, gaming giants—Electronic Arts (EA  -  Free Report), Tencent Holdings (TCEHY  -  Free Report), Activision Blizzard (ATVI  -  Free Report), and Take-Two Interactive (TTWO  -  Free Report)—are all invested in esports’ long-term viability and success.And major sponsors of more traditional sports are already trying to cash in on professional video gaming. Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report) sponsored last year's League of Legends World Finals. American Express (AXP  -  Free Report), Geico, Bud Light, Audi, Buffalo Wild Wings , and others are all esports sponsors.Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) got ahead of the esports curve when it purchased esports streaming giant Twitch for about $1billion dollars in 2014. Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) YouTube has its own “gaming” section that streams esports. And esports events have sold out the Staples Center in Los Angeles and Madison Square Garden in New York City.Activision Blizzard’s new Overwatch league, which will kick off its inaugural season in January, is set up much like many more common sports with city-based teams, regularly scheduled games, playoffs, and minimum salaries for team members. Investors, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Los Angeles Rams owner Stan Kroenke, and others paid $20 million to purchase one of 12 teams in the league’s first season.Other major players in the sports world, such as Magic Johnson, Shaquille O’Neal, and the Golden State Warriors ownership group are all also heavily invested in esports. And the NBA is set to launch its first ever video game league where NBA team-associated clubs will do battle on virtual NBA 2K courts starting in 2018.But you will have to listen to the whole episode to find out more about this sport of the future!If you have any questions about this episode of Full-Court Finance please feel free to shoot us an email over at podcast@zacks.com.

1983,KO,"After the closing bell this afternoon, we look forward to Q2 earnings results from social media giant Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is expected to bring in $1.13 per share on revenues of $9.17 billion, both of which represent more that 42% growth year over year. Facebook has gained more than $50 per share year to date, up nearly 44%.People picking through its Q2 report, we’ll check user numbers and engagement, and perhaps figure out whether/how Facebook-owned Instagram is eating the lunch of competitors like Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). Facebook is also today’s Bull of the Day.On the econ data side, we expect new reads on New Home Sales (June), which analysts expect will be up 1.5% for the month. In a related matter, mortgage applications are up on the latest findings, although they have been completely driven by refinancing activity, not new real estate purchases, which were down.Also, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) comes out with its latest statement today, following its June meeting and the subsequent interest rate hike of another quarter percent. There will be no testimony from Fed Chair Janet Yellen this time around; we will merely see a compiled issuance of the most recent understanding of the FOMC. Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank says to look out for “market-moving comments about weak inflation data.”Ahead of the BellThis morning, we see more Q2 earnings reports from some of the most well-known companies in the stock market. All three reported mixed Q2 results early today, though none could put a damper on the bull run continuing in the Dow these days.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) posted earnings of $2.55 per share compared to $2.32 in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues, however, missed expectations of $23 billion to $22.74 billion in the quarter.

1984,KO,"Wednesday, July 26th, 2017After the closing bell this afternoon, we look forward to Q2 earnings results from social media giant Facebook (FB  -  Free Report), the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock is expected to bring in $1.13 per share on revenues of $9.17 billion, both of which represent more that 42% growth year over year. Facebook has gained more than $50 per share year to date, up nearly 44%. People picking through its Q2 report, we’ll check user numbers and engagement, and perhaps figure out whether/how Facebook-owned Instagram is eating the lunch of competitors like Snapchat (SNAP  -  Free Report). Facebook is also today’s Bull of the Day.On the econ data side, we expect new reads on New Home Sales (June), which analysts expect will be up 1.5% for the month. In a related matter, mortgage applications are up on the latest findings, although they have been completely driven by refinancing activity, not new real estate purchases, which were down.Also, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) comes out with its latest statement today, following its June meeting and the subsequent interest rate hike of another quarter percent. There will be no testimony from Fed Chair Janet Yellen this time around; we will merely see a compiled issuance of the most recent understanding of the FOMC. Zacks Chief Strategist John Blank says to look out for “market-moving comments about weak inflation data.”Ahead of the BellThis morning, we see more Q2 earnings reports from some of the most well-known companies in the stock market. All three reported mixed Q2 results early today, though none could put a damper on the bull run continuing in the Dow these days.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) posted earnings of $2.55 per share compared to $2.32 in the Zacks consensus estimate. Revenues, however, missed expectations of $23 billion to $22.74 billion in the quarter.

1987,KO,"Soft drinks giants PepsiCo, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) are no strangers to the vagaries of the war on sugar. Sales for both beverage giants have remained subdued in recent quarters and the two have vowed to find ways of diversifying their portfolio beyond carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and revamping existing product lines.Changing demographics and purchasing behaviors make it important for beverage giants to understand and capitalize on main consumer insights that identify growing trends. Health awareness has been prime concern for consumers in recent times and capitalizing on this trend can prove to be beneficial for any beverage company in 2017.Continuing decline in CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are creating headaches for many established players like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. , leading to lower volumes and weak sales. Among CSDs, the cola segment particularly has been facing challenges as consumers are opting for alternatives. Also, potential new taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages and growing regulatory pressures are affecting CSD sales.Despite these challenges, the two cola behemoths are at the top of the food and beverage industry. The bullish Zacks Industry Rank of 34 carried by the Zacks Soft Drinks industry testifies that the industry is in fine fettle. An impressive rank places the industry in the top 13% of the 250+ groups enlisted.Now, within the industry, despite both companies boasting strong business lines and solid growth prospects, PepsiCo with its Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) looks comparatively better as an investment option than the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Coca-Cola. Below we will substantiate our reasoning. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Head-to-HeadAs we jump into our head-to-head comparison of PepsiCo and Coca-Cola, let’s check out a few key stats from both the companies.Price PerformancePepsiCo has gained 11.1% so far this year, while Coca-Cola’s shares have increased 9.6%. While both stocks have outperformed the broader market (S&P 500) over the same period, PepsiCo clearly scores over Coca-Cola.Valuation MetricsGoing by the trailing 12-month Price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, both stocks are a tad overvalued, as is evident from their P/E ratios compared with the industry. P/E ratios for PepsiCo and Coca-Cola are 23.06 and 24.15, respectively, while the industry’s is 24.78. PepsiCo’s shares look a shade cheaper compared with Coca-Cola.Return on Equity (ROE)ROE is a measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholder’s funds. ROE for the trailing 12 months for PepsiCo and Coca-Cola is 59.7% and 34.5%, respectively. While both stocks have scored above the industry’s level of 2.7%, PepsiCo has an edge here.Estimate Revisions & Growth ExpectationsOver the past 60 days, PepsiCo’s estimates for the current year has edged up 0.4% to $5.15 per share. On the other hand, Coca-Cola’s estimates for the current year have increased 1.1% over the same period to $1.90.The expected earnings per share growth rate for PepsiCo for the current year stands at 6.3% compared with 0.7% expected decline for Coca-Cola. Also, PepsiCo has an expected long-term earnings growth of 7.4%, higher than Coca-Cola’s 6.2%.Propelling the earnings forward is the companies’ revenue growth story. Clearly, PepsiCo’s projected sales growth for the current year is 1.4% better than Coca-Cola’s average of 16.2% decline. As such, PepsiCo is a clear winner in terms of earnings as well as revenue growth expectations.Dividend YieldCoca-Cola has a slight advantage over PepsiCo in terms of dividend payouts. Dividends are usually, but not always, an indication of solid financial health. Coca-Cola has a current dividend yield of 3.23%, better than PepsiCo's 2.72%.Final ThoughtsGoing by the statistics, PepsiCo certainly has an edge over Coca-Cola in terms of ROE, earnings and revenue growth expectations, price performance and valuation.PepsiCo surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates by a higher percentage compared with Coca-Cola in the trailing four quarters. Again, both the companies boast strong brand recognition, focus on product innovation and a huge international presence, which is likely to drive growth, going forward.Other Key PickApart from PepsiCo, investors interested in the beverage industry may also consider Coca-Cola European Partners Plc (CCE  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Coca-Cola European Partners has an expected earnings growth of 17.9% for the current year.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye OnTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1988,KO,"The recent health campaign to prevent diabetes in Singapore gained strength when seven major beverage companies including The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report), Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report) and Nestle pledged to bring down the amount of sugar in their products to 12% or lower by 2020.To mitigate health risks such as diabetes, obesity and so on, many western nations have taken measures like raising taxes on sugar-rich products. Singapore, one of the first such countries in Asia, has adopted similar measures to target sweetened drinks and raise health awareness.Increasing awareness promoted by the governments of different Asian countries along with a global shift in preference toward healthier consumption has been proving to be a challenge for the beverage industry of late. Moreover, the trend in the global beverage business has been sluggish due to lower demand for carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and artificial sweeteners. To counter these challenges, beverage firms have been reworking on their recipes with the aim of coming up with healthier products with lower sugar content.Singapore-based Yeo Hiap Seng and F&N Foods, Malaysia Dairy Industries and Japan’s Pokka have also decided on pledging to the same. According to the health ministry of Singapore, these seven companies manufacture 70% of pre-packaged sweetened drinks in the country and can bring about a reduction in sugar consumption of approximately 330 US tons (or 300,000 kilograms) a year.In an attempt to meet the changing needs of consumers, 80% of PepsiCo’s drinks in Singapore already contain 12%or lesser of added sugar. The company last year planned to cut sugar in its products globally so that two-thirds of its products would have less than 100 calories per 12 ounce by 2025.Coca-Cola also pledged to cut sugar in more than 500 of its drinks this year. According to the company, 30%of its 3,900 beverages contain negligible amount of sugar and 97% of its products sold in Singapore, including the eponymous soda, have less than 12% sugar.However, the impact of the pledge is yet to be seen as most beverage companies have argued that their products already have low sugar levels. Nevertheless, the active measures being taken by the beverage industry might help address sugar-related health issues.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCoca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), while Pepsico carries Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other stocks to consider in the same industry are Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (CCE  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy),and New Age Beverage Corporation (NBEV  -  Free Report) carryingwith a Zacks Rank #2.You can see  the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coca-Cola European Partners’ current year earnings are expected to increase 17.9%.The current year earnings of New Age Beverage are expected to increase 205.0%.4 Surprising Tech Stocks to Keep an Eye onTech stocks have been a major force behind the market’s record highs, but picking the best ones to buy can be tough.

1989,KO,"Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report), alias FEMSA, posted second-quarter 2017 net majority income of 72 cents per ADS (Ps. 1.30 cents per FEMSA unit), substantially below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents. This marked the company’s fourth consecutive bottom-line miss.Nonetheless, quarterly net consolidated income of the largest franchise bottler for The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) jumped 4.3% to Ps. 6,418 million (US$345.1 million) from Ps. 6,156 million (US$341.1 million) in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher operating income as well as increased Heineken NV (HEINY  -  Free Report) results, in which it has 20% participation interest. This was partly offset by adverse foreign exchange translations related to FEMSA’s US dollar-denominated cash position and higher non-operating expenses at Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF  -  Free Report).Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Fomento Economico Mexicano S.A.B. de C.V. QuoteShares of FEMSA dipped 2.2% following the earnings announcement. However, FEMSA outperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The stock jumped 13.6%, surpassing the industry's gain of 6%.  Quarter in DetailTotal revenue advanced 21.4% year over year to Ps. 114,801 million (US$6,172 million), fueled by solid performance across all segments, taking into account the inclusion of Philippines and Vonpar’s incorporation at Coca-Cola FEMSA. On an organic basis, total revenue increased 10.7% year over year. However, the company’s total revenue in dollar terms fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,491 million, marking its second consecutive miss.FEMSA’s gross profit grew 19.5% to Ps. 42,204 million (US$2,269 million). Gross margin contracted 60 basis points (bps) to 36.8% owing to decline in Coca-Cola FEMSA’s gross margins (primarily due to higher sugar prices in Mexico) and lower-margin businesses growth at FEMSA Comercio.FEMSA’s operating income ascended 10.8% to Ps. 10,425 million (US$560.5 million). On an organic basis, operating income improved 1.1% year over year. However, consolidated operating margin contracted 90 bps to 9.1%, on account of lower margins at Coca???Cola FEMSA (due to higher freight and labor costs) as well as FEMSA Comercio’s Health and Fuel Divisions. Additionally, margins were hurt by the consolidation of Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results in the Philippines.Segmental DiscussionTotal revenue at Coca-Cola FEMSA was up 25.5% year over year to Ps. 50,108 million (US$2,694 million). On a comparable basis, revenues improved 1.9% on the back of a rise in average price per unit case in majority of the company’s operations along with higher volumes in Mexico, partly negated by volume declines in the company’s remaining operations.Coca-Cola FEMSA’s operating income climbed 8.1% to Ps. 6,491 million (US$349 million) in the quarter, while comparable operating income remained flat. The segment’s reported operating margin contracted 200 bps to 13% mainly due to higher freight expenses, labor costs as well as diesel and gasoline prices.FEMSA Comercio – Retail Division: Total revenue at this segment grew 16% year over year to Ps. 39,660 million (US$2,132.3 million). The rise can be mainly attributed to the opening of 373 net new OXXO stores in the quarter, which took the total net new store count in the past 12 months to 1,313. FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division had a total of 15,774 OXXO stores as of Jun 30, 2017. Same-store sales at OXXO increased 10.3% driven by a strong consumer environment and gains from the calendar shift of the Holy week. Same-store sales also benefited from a 5.6% increase in average customer ticket and 4.4% rise in store traffic.Operating income rose 18.2% year over year to Ps. 3,268 million (US$175.7 million), with operating margin expanding 10 bps to 8.2%.FEMSA Comercio – Health Division: This segment reported total revenue of Ps. 11,431 million (US$614.6 million), up 9.8% year over year. The increase was backed by strong growth in South American business. The segment had a total of 2,154 point of sales across all regions, of which about 18 net new stores were added in the second quarter. Same-store sales for the drug stores rose 6.3% driven by sturdy growth trends in South America that nullified the impact of soft trends in Mexico.Operating income amounted to Ps. 328 million (US$17.6 million), inching up 0.3% year over year. Operating margin contracted 20 bps to 2.9% owing to higher operating expenses in Mexico, increased services at Mexican stores and the rise in incentives for in-store personnel in Chile.FEMSA Comercio – Fuel Division: Total revenue was up 36.6% to Ps. 9,473 million (US$509.3 million) on the back of impressive comparable sales and the improved national prices established at the start of the year. Same-station sales rose 22.6% year over year, driven by a 23.3% rise in average revenue per liter, offset by a 0.5% decline in average volumes. The company had 390 OXXO GAS service stations as of Jun 30.Operating income declined 96.6% to Ps. 2 million (US$0.1 million), while operating margin contracted 90 bps driven by gross margin contraction at the segment partly neutralized by cost-control efforts and enhanced operating efficiency at its service stations.Financial PositionFEMSA had cash balance of Ps. 51,249 million (US$2,863.1 million) as of Jun 30, 2017. Long-term debt was Ps. 121,217 million (US$6,771.9 million). Moreover, the company incurred capital expenditure of Ps. 5,232 million (US$281.3 million) in the second quarter due to increased investments in FEMSA Comercio’s Retail Division.Currently, FEMSA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

1990,KO,"The Q2 earnings season has picked up pace, with 97 companies in the S&P 500 cohort having released their quarterly numbers. According to the latest Earnings Preview, total earnings for these companies are up 8.4% from the same period last year on 5.1% higher revenues, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue estimates.Total Q2 earnings are expected to be up +8.6% from the same period last year on a 4.7% revenue improvement. Coming to the Consumer Staples sector, earnings are expected to increase 3.1% in Q2 compared with 4.7% in the previous quarter. Revenues are expected to rise 1.2%, lower than 3% recorded in the last quarter.The Food industry, within the Consumer Staples sector, has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Major U.S. food companies are striving to retain market share as easy-to-prepare and ready-to-eat convenience food items are gradually losing ground. A shift in consumer preference toward healthier options and a higher level of price consciousness is hurting the industry, making it hard for legacy brands like General Mills Inc. (GIS  -  Free Report) to boost sales. Nonetheless, effective promotional strategies, introduction of nutritious products, cost-saving and restructuring initiatives might prove beneficial for the food industry at large.Coming to the Beverage (soft drinks) industry within the Consumer Staples sector, persistent decline in carbonated soft drinks or CSDs and impressive growth in noncarbonated beverages are raising concerns for established players like PepsiCo Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report).  Cola companies are gradually reshuffling their portfolio toward healthier options to counter the tepid sales and volumes environment.Given this backdrop, let’s try to determine how these players – The Hershey Company (HSY  -  Free Report) and The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) – are placed ahead of their second-quarter earnings releases before the opening bell on Jul 26.Hershey, the largest North American manufacturer of quality chocolate and confectionery products, reported a positive 3.97% earnings surprise in the last quarter. Also, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 7.65%.Currently, the company has an Earnings ESP of -3.30% as the Most Accurate estimate is 88 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 91 cents.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Notably, Hershey has been delivering weak performance in international markets since 2015, primarily due to soft results in China. In fact, China chocolate category sales in the first quarter was flat and also below the market level. The company had earlier expressed that considering the timing of Easter and the projected decline in China sales, second-quarter net sales growth is expected to lag the full-year growth rate (read more: Hershey Q2 Earnings: Disappointment in the Cards?)For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 91 cents, reflecting an increase of 6.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is at $1.65 billion, implying 0.9% year-over-year growth.Soft drink giant, Coca-Cola posted a negative earnings surprise of 2.27% in the last quarter. However, the company managed to surpass earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%.

1991,KO,"The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the cola giant delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.27%.However, Coca-Cola surpassed earnings estimates in three of the last four quarters, with an average surprise of 1.51%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayCoca-Cola’s first-quarter revenues declined 11% year over year due to currency headwinds and negative impact of structural items. Acquisitions/divestitures and structural items had a 10% impact on revenues, while currency headwinds hurt sales by 1%. The company’s soon-to-be reported quarter is also expected to be adversely impacted by 17–18% in net revenue from acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items. The company also expects currency headwinds to hurt the quarterly net revenues by 1–2%.The company’s revenues declined for the last eight consecutive quarters primarily due to weak volumes especially in the sparkling beverage category. Coca-Cola has been struggling to boost sales amid weak demand in certain emerging and developing markets and shift in consumer preference.That said, Coca-Cola is taking aggressive cost-cutting and strategic measures to mitigate the impact of lower sales and weak volumes. Adjusted consolidated gross margins expanded 120 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.3% in the first quarter of 2017, as currency headwinds were offset by positive pricing and productivity gains. We expect to witness similar trends in the to-be reported quarter as well.Coming to the company’s bottom line, i.e. EPS, Coca-Cola’s earnings decreased 4.4% in the first quarter 2017. The downside was primarily due to higher interest expenses, resulting from additional long-term debt issued in the quarter as well as in the second and third quarters of 2016. Coca-Cola’s first quarter of 2017 interest expenses were also higher due to interest rate swaps on the company’s fixed-rate debt.As revealed earlier, Coca-Cola expects net impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and other structural items to have a headwind of 3–4% on profits before taxes in the to-be-reported quarter. Currency fluctuations are anticipated to have an adverse impact of 3% on quarterly profits before taxes. However, we feel pricing gains, cost cuts and productivity savings should continue to support bottom line to some extent.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 58 cents, reflecting a 4.1% year-over-year decrease. Meanwhile, the projected sales growth for the current year is pegged at $9.75 billion, implying a 15.5% decrease.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Coca-Cola is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -1.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is 57 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 58 cents.Zacks Rank: Coca-Cola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. Although a Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, a negative ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Ranks #4 and 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Coca-Cola Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Coca-Cola Company (The) QuotePeer ReleasePepsiCo, Inc.

1992,KO,"On Friday, shares of fuel cell maker Plug Power (PLUG  -  Free Report) are soaring, up over 10% to $2.34 per share in morning trading after the company announced a new expanded deal with Walmart (WMT  -  Free Report). Shares of the brick-and-mortar retailer are down a slight 0.37% in same time frame.As part of the partnership, Plug Power will provide its GenKey hydrogen fuel station and fuel cells to up to 30 additional Walmart store locations in North America over the next three years. The company was operating 22 Walmart sites at the end of last year, and deployed a new site every six weeks since 2014.Another aspect of the deal expansion includes the issuing of warrants to Walmart for the purchase of up to 55.3 million common shares of PLUG, with the first 5.8 million bought after the transaction is completed. The shares’ total value is worth roughly $600 million, and Walmart plans on paying Plug Power in $50 million installments.Plug Power’s GenKey technology offers customers ""a complete range of turnkey services to streamline the entire hydrogen and fuel cell-adoption process,” including a GenDrive or GenSure hydrogen fuel-cell system; GenFuel hydrogen infrastructure and fuel; and GenCare aftermarket customer service and support.There aren’t many companies offering turnkey solutions like Plug Power, so its recognition throughout the industry is widespread. And, Walmart isn’t the only partnering with Plug Power; Kroger (KR  -  Free Report), Sysco (SYY  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), and Procter & Gamble (PG  -  Free Report) have all deployed GenDrive units throughout their business.Currently, PLUG is a #3 (Hold) on the Zacks Rank.

1993,KO,"Consumer confidence – a key determinant of the economy’s health – improved strongly in June, after a dismal show in May. Strong recovery in the housing market and an improving labor market played a crucial role in boosting buyers’ confidence. Encouraging manufacturing index readings issued by the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) also hints at a pickup in GDP, indicating that economy is in good shape currently.The recent hike of its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point by Federal Reserve reiterates the fact that the economy is looking up. Further, the Fed indicated that it anticipates the next hike in December, along with three more in the coming year, which signals rising consumer confidence as well as the economy’s growth.The Consumer Staples sector, which is at the top 31% of the Zacks Sector Rank (5 out of 16), indicates optimism. We note that in the last six months, the sector has registered an increase of 8.04%, higher than the S&P 500 that is up 6.86%.Surging consumer confidence and indications of a stronger economy in the second half of the year make the consumer staples sector attractive. Investing in consumer staples stocks is safer because of their defensive nature. However, risk-averse investors still remain skeptical. Therefore, targeting safer bets for now rather than going for stocks with only high earnings growth potential can prove to be a prudent move.The Winning Strategy: Investment in Dividend Stocks With the U.S. economy looking bright, investors should opt for dividend stocks. Not only do these stocks offer higher income in the current low-rate environment but also provide a cushion against equity market risks. Dividend stocks are historically less volatile and are a safe bet as dividends generally act as a hedge against economic uncertainty.Dividend yield assesses the amount of income received in proportion to the share price. Amid the current volatility, it could be a smart strategy to buy stocks that yield good dividends, thus ensuring a steady income.Thus, based on a solid Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy), and dividend yields of more than 3%, we have zeroed in on four stocks that have the potential to ride out the impending volatility.Key PicksPhilip Morris International, Inc. (PM  -  Free Report)Philip Morris, the leading international tobacco company, has been increasing its dividend every year since it began paying dividends in 2008.With a dividend yield of 3.55% and a beta value of 0.94, this Zacks Rank #2 stock is an attractive pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The stock has also rallied 30.8% in the last six months, higher than the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s gain of 17.9%.The Coca-Cola Company (KO  -  Free Report)The Coca-Cola Company, a Zacks Rank #2, is the world's largest beverage company and is the leading producer and marketer of soft drinks.With a dividend yield of 3.34% and a beta value of 0.69, this stock is likely to be an attractive pick.The stock has moved up 9.3% in the last six months, marginally higher than the broader sector’s gain of 8.0%.Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report)Kellogg Company is the world's leading producer of cereals and convenience foods.The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, and has a beta value of 0.50 and a dividend yield of 3.18%.However, the company’s shares have declined 7.5% in the last six months, wider than the Zacks categorized Food-Miscellaneous/Diversified industry's 6.2% decline.Tupperware Brands Corporation (TUP  -  Free Report)Tupperware Brands is a global direct seller of premium, innovative products across multiple brands and categories through an independent sales force.This Zacks Rank #2 company yields a dividend of 3.94%.The stock has significantly rallied 27.2% in the last six months, in comparison with the Zacks categorized Consumer Products-Miscellaneous Staples industry’s gain of 8.5%.More Stock News: 8 Companies Verge on Apple-Like RunDid you miss Apple's 9X stock explosion after they launched their iPhone in 2007?
