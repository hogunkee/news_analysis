1,AOS,"Investors looking for stocks in the Manufacturing - Electronics sector might want to consider either Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) or A.O. Smith (AOS  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Eaton and A.O. Smith have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ETN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.36, while AOS has a forward P/E of 22.75.

2,AOS,"We issued an updated research report on premium consumer electronics company, iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) on Jul 2. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the stock’s earnings remained changed for both 2018 and 2019 at $2.36 and $2.91 respectively, reflecting neutral brokers’ sentiments.Let’s dig into the fundamental aspects influencing the performance of the stock.Existing Growth DriversStronger demand for home-robotic products like Roomba, Scooba, Braava has been boosting iRobot’s revenues for the past few quarters. The company’s revenues improved 3.3% in 2016, while the same increased 10.9% in 2017. Notably, in first-quarter 2018, the company’s top line improved 28.8% year over year, backed by double-digit revenue growth secured from all end-markets.In order to increase household adoption rates of Roomba and Braava products, iRobot is investing in several marketing programs. Notably, the company is currently promoting Braava products to its U.S. Roomba customers via television advertisements. These commercials aided in bolstering the company’s U.S. Braava revenues by nearly 35% year over year in the first quarter.Also, the $141-million Robopolis acquisition (July 2017) will likely augment the market penetration rate of iRobot’s robotic vacuum cleaners in Europe.iRobot currently anticipates to report revenues of $1.05-$1.08 billion in 2018, estimating an annualized growth rate of 19-22%.iRobot’s year-over-year gross profit growth was 12% and 3.4% in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Notably, gross margin expanded 150 basis points in the first quarter this year. The company expects that higher revenues, greater operational efficacy and reduced corporate tax rates will boost its profitability, moving ahead. At present, iRobot projects 2018 earnings at $2.15-$2.40 per share, higher than the previous view of $2.10-$2.35 per share.Over the past three months, iRobot’s shares have rallied 15.7%, as against the 2.6% loss recorded by the industry.Causes of ConcernRising cost of sales has been a major cause of concern for iRobot for the past two years, as evident from the 32.1% and 4.1% year-over-year jump registered in 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the first quarter of 2018, the company’s cost of revenues flared up 24.8% year over year. Also, total operating expenses shot up 37.6% year over year. Increased marketing and overhead expenses, and higher legal fee associated with International Trade Commission (ITC) litigation have been escalating iRobot’s costs, of late. The company expects that these issues will continue to escalate its expenses in the near term.Additionally, excessive business rivalry in the U.S. robotic vacuum cleaning market might hurt iRobot’s revenues in the upcoming quarters. On a P/E (TTM) basis, the stock looks overvalued compared with the industry, with the respective tallies of 36.6x and 22.5x, for the past three-month period.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector are listed below:Acco Brands Corporation (ACCO  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

3,AOS,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 3.9% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is AOS due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.A.O. Smith Beats on Q1 Earnings, Raises ’18 GuidanceA. O. Smith reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 60 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The company continues its earnings beat streak of 25 straight quarters, which it broke once when it reported in-line earnings in second-quarter 2017.The figure improved 18% from the year-ago quarter’s tally. The upside mainly came on the back of robust sales growth. However, higher steel prices and inflationary pressure on freight and other costs dampened earnings growth to some extent.Inside the HeadlinesThe company generated record sales in the quarter which rose 6.5% year over year to $788 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $793 million by a whisker. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 3% year over year to $501.7 million. Higher volumes of commercial water heaters, strong sales of boilers and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Water treatment products contributed about $8 million to revenues and boosted the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings inched up 2% year over year to $106 million. The segment’s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel and other costs. Consequently, adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) to 22.5% on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 13% year over year to $293.8 million. The improvement came on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s gas tankless water-heating and water-treatment products. Also, favorable pricing actions added to the top line. However, a significant decline in air purification product sales in China dampened growth to some extent.Operating earnings at the segment climbed 11% year over year to $36.1 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in China, along with favorable pricing actions, was partially offset by escalating steel costs and selling and engineering expenses. Operating margin contracted 20 bps to 12.3% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter, A.O. Smith repurchased around 520,000 common shares for $33 million. At the end of the quarter, the company has approximately 1.9 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2018, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $241.9 million compared with $293.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Cash generated from operations during the year came in at $43.2 million, compared to cash used in operations of $11.5 million last year, as the quarter’s cash flow benefited from higher adjusted net earnings and smaller increases in working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $285.5 million compared with $402.9 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2017.Other DevelopmentsRecently, A. O. Smith announced that it was chosen as the primary supplier of water treatment products to all Lowe's home improvement stores in the United States. The company expects sales of roughly $15 million, along with start-up and transition costs, from the new business in 2018.The new relationship is likely to accelerate growth of the company’s North American water treatment product line.GuidanceConcurrent with the first-quarter results, the company raised guidance for 2018. A.O. Smith expects adjusted earnings between $2.55 and $2.61, up from the previous range of $2.50-$2.58. The mid-point of the range reflects impressive year-over-year growth of 19%.Additionally, the company expects to register revenue growth of 10-10.75% in 2018, supported by stable water heater replacement demand.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been seven revisions lower for the current quarter.A. O. Smith Corporation Price and Consensus A. O. Smith Corporation Price and Consensus | A. O. Smith Corporation QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, AOS has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Interestingly, AOS has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

4,AOS,"We issued an updated research report on Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) on May 17. Strong brand image and meaningful buyouts are key drivers for the company. On the flip side, costs and debts, as well as risks related to international operations, remain concerning for the company.This machinery company, with a market capitalization of approximately $3 billion, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Let’s delve deeper and discuss the company’s potential growth drivers and probable headwinds.Factors Favoring RexnordShare Price Performance, Earnings Estimates: Rexnord’s financial performance in the last four quarters was impressive. Average earnings surprise was +12.95%, including the impact of 7.69% earnings beat recorded for fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 (ended Mar 31, 2018). Also, as disclosed on May 14, the company’s revenues for the fourth quarter surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2%.In the last three months, Rexnord’s shares have yielded a return of 3%, outperforming roughly 3.7% decline recorded by the industry.In the last seven days, Rexnord’s earnings estimates for fiscal 2019 (ending March 2019) remained stable at $1.73 while grew 3.7% to $1.97 for fiscal 2020 (ending March 2020). While, in the last 60 days, earnings estimates for fiscal 2019 inched up 0.6% and grew 2.6% for fiscal 2020. On a year-over-year basis, the earnings estimates are predicted to increase 24.5% for fiscal 2019 and 13.8% for fiscal 2020.Near- and Long-Term Growth Potential Solid: We believe that Rexnord is poised to grow on near- and long-term tailwinds. The company’s solid product portfolio — including brands like Rexnord, Rex, Falk, Link-Belt, Zurn, Rodney Hunt and many more — as well as its efforts to innovate products and accentuate customer satisfaction will be a boon.For instance, DiRXN — a digital-enterprise strategy that integrates innovative Industrial Internet of Things and e-commerce technologies to help customers in improving productivity -- was launched in May 2017. Since then, it has been strengthening the company’s Process & Motion Control segment. Also, new products like Tollok TLK 136 and 390 Series MatTop Chain have been introduced in February 2018.For fiscal 2019, Rexnord anticipates core sales to increase in mid-single digit. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) are projected to be $420-$440 million.Over the long term, Rexnord anticipates achieving mid-single-digit core growth, 30% profit margin and free cash flow to exceed net income. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be 30-35% for the Process & Motion Control segment and 20-25% for the Water Management segment.Strategic Organic & Inorganic Initiatives: In fiscal 2018, Rexnord finished the first phase of its supply-chain optimization and footprint-repositioning programs. To further enhance productivity, reduce fixed costs and improve free cash flow, the company initiated the second phase in fiscal 2019. It anticipates realizing annual cost reductions of $15 million upon the completion of this phase in fiscal 2020.Also, over time, the company acquired meaningful businesses while disposed of non-core assets to improve its business portfolio. In fiscal 2018, the company acquired World Dryer Corporation and Centa Power Transmission. Water Management segment’s Zurn business will get a boost from the World Dryer’s hand dryers while the Centa Power Transmission assets will strengthen the Process and Motion Control segment, and create business opportunities in the couplings market.Recently, the company announced to divest its VAG operations from the Water Management segment. The divestment of this non-strategic business will free resources that can be utilized by the company for lowering its debt burden.Factors Working Against RexnordRising Costs & Expenses, Huge Debts Raise Concerns: Rexnord is dealing with adverse impacts of rising costs and expenses. In fiscal 2018, the company’s cost of sales increased 4.7% year over year while selling, general and administrative expenses rose 8.8%. Also, its long-term debt was approximately $1.4 billion while exiting the fiscal. We believe, if unchecked, rising costs and expenses, and huge debt levels can be detrimental to the company’s profitability in the quarters ahead.Threats from Diversity: Global expansion has exposed Rexnord to risks, arising from adverse movements in foreign currencies. Also, uncertainties in economic growth of the countries, where the company serves, can severely impact the company’s businesses. Moreover, the company operates in various end-markets — including construction, general industrial, mining, water infrastructure and aerospace industries. The downturn in one or more of these markets, where the company serves, will have an adverse impact on its financials.Industry Competition: Rexnord faces stiff competition from companies, offering similar products and services or those producing different items for same uses. Also, failure of new products in the market might hurt the company’s competitive edge.Some better-ranked stocks in the industry include Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (FELE  -  Free Report), A. O. Smith Corp. (AOS  -  Free Report) and Regal Beloit Corp. (RBC  -  Free Report). All these stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.In the last 60 days, earnings estimates for these three stocks increased for both the current year and the next year. Also, average earnings surprise for the last four quarters is +5.27% for Franklin Electric, +3.12% for A. O. Smith and +1.60% for Regal Beloit.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

5,AOS,"EnerSys (ENS  -  Free Report) recently announced preliminary numbers for fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, ahead of the final results (scheduled on May 31).For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the company expects adjusted earnings of $1.24 per share compared with $1.20-$1.24, projected earlier. Net sales came in at $683 million, an increase of 9% from the year-ago figure. This upside can be attributed to higher pricing of products and increase in organic volume.For fiscal 2018, EnerSys anticipates adjusted earnings of $4.65 per share. Net sales came in at $2,581.8 million, up 9% from fiscal 2017. The year-over-year improvement in net sales was owing to higher pricing of products, increase in organic volume foreign as well as favorable impact of foreign currency translation.Our TakePer EnerSys, its long-term growth drivers — higher demand for premium products, lean initiatives, robust prospects in Asia, cost reduction programs and strategic product launches — remain intact. These are likely to boost top-line performance moving ahead.In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has returned 10.5%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 3.5%.Enersys Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Enersys Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Enersys QuoteMoreover, EnerSys’ segments namely — Motive Power and Reserve Power — are witnessing good prospects of late. For Motive Power business, the company believes that China will provide the much-needed growth impetus as market therein thrives on the back of rise in middle-class population. Also, strong sales of thin plate pure lead, IRONCLAD, gel, high-frequency chargers and battery management systems in key-end markets are driving this segment. For Reserve Power Business, the company believes Indian market will act as the strongest catalyst.However, continuous increase in the price of lead and other raw materials, including steel, plastic and copper might inflate the cost of goods sold, thus eroding the company’s profitability. Also, EnerSys has been making multiple long-term investments to boost growth, which may adversely impact the company’s gross margins.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report), Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (FELE  -  Free Report) and A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report). All these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

O. Smith exceeded estimates thrice in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 3.1%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?

7,AOS,"On May 15, we issued an updated research report on Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report). The company is poised to gain from focus on the Execute to Win strategy, stable global crane markets, product development and backlog strength. Further, its disciplined capital-allocation strategy will reinforce investors’ value.Let’s illustrate these growth factors in detail.Terex to Gain From Execute to Win StrategyTerex’s Execute to Win strategy is focused on improving capabilities by investing in people, processes and tools in three priority areas, comprising commercial excellence, lifecycle solutions and strategic sourcing. For this, the company recently approved an investment in its Utilities business to build a new facility in Watertown. This state-of-the-art manufacturing center will enable to consolidate from 10 buildings to one, and meet the growing needs of utility customers. Terex has also implemented a new operational financial management system under the plan which will provide a continued view of internal financial information across its businesses.Crane Segment Well Poised for GrowthTerex’s Cranes segment will grow on fairly stable global cranes markets, with expected growth in the near future. The company reported increased sales and backlog in mobile cranes, tower cranes and utility equipment lately. It is working with customers to align machinery delivery dates and expect productivity to normalize in the second half of 2018.The company also continues to roll out new products. Terex delivered the first AC 300-6 production unit in first-quarter 2018, the latest addition to the Demag line of all-terrain cranes. The company also introduced a flat top tower crane, the CTT 472, which will increase productivity of customers on the job site.Backlog Strength a TailwindFor the fifth quarter in a row, Terex’s backlog grew year over year in every segment in the first quarter 2018.

The company repurchased 5 million shares for $205 million in the first quarter. Further buybacks will support the stock. Terex maintained its free cash flow guidance of $100 million for the year.

10,AOS,"With first-quarter earnings drawing to a close, industry peers are doing various analysis and comparisons to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar comparative analysis between two stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector — Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report) and IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) — to pick the better investment option.  Earnings ScoresheetRegal Beloit reported decent first-quarter 2018 results, supported by strong organic sales growth and favorable foreign currency translation impact. On a GAAP basis, the industrial goods manufacturer reported net income of $58.4 million or $1.31 per share compared with $46.3 million or $1.02 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily due to higher revenues across segments. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.34 per share compared with $1.07 in the year-ago quarter. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26. Net sales increased to $878.8 million from $813.5 million in the year-earlier quarter, driven by strong organic sales growth across all three operating segments. Moreover, quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $867 million.IDEX reported strong first-quarter results with all-time high revenues, operating income and earnings driven by healthy organic growth and diligent execution of operational plans. GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $99 million or $1.27 per share compared with $75.9 million or 99 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter. The year-over-year improvement was primarily attributable to top-line growth. Excluding restructuring and other non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.29 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24. Net sales came in at $612.3 million compared with $553.6 million in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $601 million. The top-line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 7%. Investments in product innovations, business development and reallocation of resources led to growth in revenues across all segments of the company, which helped drive total revenues.Based on first-quarter earnings, there appears to be no clear favorite as Regal Beloit has an edge over IDEX with respect to earnings surprise percentage, while it is just the opposite with respect to revenue surprise percentage.Price PerformanceOver the past month, Regal Beloit has outperformed IDEX with an average return of 8.7% against a loss of 3.1% for the latter while the sector declined 1.7%. Based on the price performance, Regal Beloit appears to be a clear winner. Zacks Rank & VGM ScoreWith a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Regal Beloit has a Value Growth Momentum score (VGM Score) of A. IDEX has a VGM Score of D and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Consequently, Regal Beloit appears to be better positioned than IDEX with regards to this metric.Estimate RevisionsPost earnings release, Regal Beloit’s current-quarter estimates increased from $1.49 to $1.52 per share (up 2%) while that for the current year increased from $5.57 to $5.66 (up 1.6%).IDEX’s current-quarter estimates increased to $1.31 from $1.29 post earnings release (up 1.6%) while current-year estimates increased to $5.18 per share from $5.07 (up 2.2%). With positive estimate revisions, investor sentiments appear to be more bullish on Regal Beloit than IDEX with respect to current-quarter estimates but just the opposite for current-year estimates.GuidanceFor 2018, Regal Beloit raised its adjusted earnings per share to $5.60-$6.00 from $5.35-$5.75 expected earlier. It expects the Nicotra Gebhardt acquisition to be 13-15 cents accretive to adjusted earnings in 2018. The company projects GAAP earnings per share between $5.29 and $5.69, up from prior expectations of $5.19-$5.59.IDEX is poised to gain from robust organic growth, disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment. With solid quarterly results and continued strength in order trajectory, management has raised its earlier guidance for 2018. Full-year adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $5.05-$5.20 per share range, up from $4.90-$5.10 expected earlier on organic growth of 5-6%.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although the two stocks seem to match each other on most counts, Regal Beloit appears to have trumped IDEX on few metrics and stands out as a better investment proposition.

11,AOS,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents by 7%.Favorable global market conditions and strong top-line growth boosted the company’s bottom line, which was offset by high cost of sales and administrative expenses.Inside the HeadlinesThe company continued with its growth momentum in the fiscal second quarter as both the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions platforms delivered a rise in net sales. The metric grew 18.9% year over year to $4,248 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,200 million.Emerson Electric Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Co. QuoteWhile underlying sales growth for the quarter was 8%, acquisitions and divestitures contributed 8% to growth, and currency translation favorably impacted the top line by 3%. Persistent improving conditions in the energy related, chemical, life sciences and discrete markets drove sales.In the fiscal second quarter, the company’s Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 30.9% year-over-year growth in net sales to $2,771 million. Underlying sales was up 10% driven by strong MRO demand as well as small and mid-sized projects focused on expansion and optimization of existing facilities.Underlying sales in North America recorded an increase of 16%, courtesy of energy related, chemical as well as life sciences markets. The metric was up 7% in Asia, while the same in China grew 20% on continued solid demand across process, hybrid as well as discrete markets. Also, underlying sales in Middle East/Africa were up an impressive 29%. However, the same in Europe and Latin America were down 1% and 10%, respectively.Margins expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 15.7%. Excluding the dilutive impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition, the same expanded 240 bps to 17.9% driven by leverage on higher sales and restructuring benefits.Net Sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions increased 1.6% to $1,483 million. Underlying sales for the segment recorded an increase of 4%. The same metric in North America rose 1% on account of solid demand for professional tools, which was partially offset by lower-than-expected demand for air conditioning.Asia witnessed strong growth once again as the underlying sales rose 17% year over year backed by solid demand for refrigeration and air conditioning in China. Underlying sales in Europe was up 5%, courtesy of strong demand in air conditioning and construction related markets.Under the platform, the Climate Technologies business grew 6.6% year over year to $1,128 million, while the Tools & Home Products unit declined 11.7% from the year-ago quarter to $355 million.Margins contracted 10 bps to 23.6% compared with the prior-year quarter.Other DevelopmentsDuring the reported quarter, the company signed an agreement to acquire the Tools and Test Equipment business of Textron for approximately $810 million. Tools & Test, when combined with Emerson’s Ridge Tool Company, will enable Emerson to extend its markets and add major capabilities to meet needs of its customers.Moreover, the company completed the acquisition of ProSys, a global supplier of software and services that facilitates increased production and safety for chemical, pulp & paper, oil & gas as well as refining industries. ProSys’ unique technologies and proficiency are expected to enable Emerson to aid customers in improving plant performance, safety and profitability by optimizing human as well as automation resources.Also, the company completed the buyout of Cooper-Atkins, a leading technology company in foodservice markets. This buyout is anticipated to improve Emerson’s ability to cater to the needs of its cold chain customers, offering safe control of food as well as other temperature-sensitive products.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the second quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and long-term debt of about $3.4 billion.GuidanceIn light of the strong global demand trends, Emerson raised its outlook for fiscal 2018. It now expects net sales for the year to grow about 13%, with underlying sales to be up about 7%. These figures compare favorably with the prior projections of an increase of 11-13% and underlying sales increase of 5-7%.Our Take Over the past few quarters, Emerson’s growth momentum is being driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets as well as strong demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets.Also, the company is well-positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth. This is because its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending.However, of late, Emerson’s operations have suffered as a result of slow spending in general industrial markets. This, in turn, has affected the company’s order rates across the related segments.Emerson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report). Each of these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

12,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 60 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The company continues its earnings beat streak of 25 straight quarters, which it broke once when it reported in-line earnings in second-quarter 2017.The figure improved 18% from the year-ago quarter’s tally. The upside mainly came on the back of robust sales growth. However, higher steel prices and inflationary pressure on freight and other costs dampened earnings growth to some extent.Inside the HeadlinesThe company generated record sales in the quarter which rose 6.5% year over year to $788 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $793 million by a whisker. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 3% year over year to $501.7 million. Higher volumes of commercial water heaters, strong sales of boilers and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Water treatment products contributed about $8 million to revenues and boosted the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings inched up 2% year over year to $106 million. The segment’s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel and other costs. Consequently, adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) to 22.5% on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 13% year over year to $293.8 million. The improvement came on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s gas tankless water-heating and water-treatment products. Also, favorable pricing actions added to the top line. However, a significant decline in air purification product sales in China dampened growth to some extent.Operating earnings at the segment climbed 11% year over year to $36.1 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in China, along with favorable pricing actions, was partially offset by escalating steel costs and selling and engineering expenses. Operating margin contracted 20 bps to 12.3% year over year.A. O. Smith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  A. O. Smith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | A. O. Smith Corporation QuoteShare RepurchasesDuring the quarter, A.O. Smith repurchased around 520,000 common shares for $33 million. At the end of the quarter, the company has approximately 1.9 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2018, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $241.9 million compared with $293.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Cash generated from operations during the year came in at $43.2 million, compared to cash used in operations of $11.5 million last year, as the quarter’s cash flow benefited from higher adjusted net earnings and smaller increases in working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $285.5 million compared with $402.9 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2017.Other DevelopmentsRecently, A. O. Smith announced that it was chosen as the primary supplier of water treatment products to all Lowe's home improvement stores in the United States. The company expects sales of roughly $15 million, along with start-up and transition costs, from the new business in 2018.The new relationship is likely to accelerate growth of the company’s North American water treatment product line.GuidanceConcurrent with the first-quarter results, the company raised guidance for 2018. A.O. Smith expects adjusted earnings between $2.55 and $2.61, up from the previous range of $2.50-$2.58. The mid-point of the range reflects impressive year-over-year growth of 19%.Additionally, the company expects to register revenue growth of 10-10.75% in 2018, supported by stable water heater replacement demand.Our TakeA.O. Smith started 2018 with good momentum, delivering strong sales growth driven by consistent demand for its consumer products in China and positive end markets for the company’s water heaters and boilers in North America. The company’s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight its underlying strength.We believe that stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water-heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets, is likely to stoke growth for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.However, over the past few quarters, A.O. Smith’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, which is creating pressure on the company’s operating margins.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the same space worth a look include Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report), II-VI Incorporated (IIVI  -  Free Report) and Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

14,AOS,"ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) posted operational earnings per share of 31 cents for first-quarter 2018, reflecting an increase of 10.7% year over year. Notably, the reported figure came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Strong growth in revenues helped maintain earnings, however, this was somewhat offset by increase in total cost of sales.Quarterly revenues came in at $8,627 million, up 9.8% year over year. The top-line improvement can be attributed to increase in revenues in each of the company’s four segments. Revenues also came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,272 million.Segmental Revenues in DetailsElectrification Products (up 9% year over year to $2,494 million):  Strong market demand in the United States, Europe, and Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) drove revenues. Orders were up 10% year over year to $2,786 million owing to strong demand across all regions.Robotics and Motion (up 15.1% to $2,209 million): Sales grew steadily on strong execution of the order backlog. Orders of this segment moved up 18% year over year to $2,579 million on a year-over-year basis backed by reported growth across all segments and regions.Industrial Automation (up 22.9% to $1,859 million): Orders recorded impressive growth of 26% year over year to $2,117 million. The uptick was owing to service and selective investment in mining and specialty marine vessel solutions.Power Grids (up 1.4% to $2,385 million): Higher orders contributed to the segment’s revenue growth. Orders increased 7% to $2,480 million, mainly owing to several large orders that include an order for an HVDC link between the UK and France.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABB Ltd QuoteTotal orders came in at $9,772 million, up 16.3% year over year. The metric also improved 6% on a comparable basis backed by strong base orders across all regions. While base orders grew 15% on a year-over-year basis, large orders amounted to 10% of the company’s total orders. The order backlog at the quarter-end totaled $23.7 billion (up 3% year over year).On a geographic basis, demand was high in the European countries with moderate overall growth and well-timed large capital investments. Also, orders displayed excellent growth in the Americas driven by increased demand from general industries as well as some improvement in process industries. Evidently, total orders were up 1% in the Americas, supported by rise in demand from general industries and some improvement in process industries. Meanwhile, the strong performance was witnessed in the AMEA region owing to order growth in China, India and the United Arab Emirates.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the first quarter was 1.13, up from 1.07 in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) in the quarter under review rose 12% year over year to $1,060 million.Next Level Strategy: Stage 3 In third-quarter 2016, ABB had launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy” that focuses on three areas namely — profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. The third stage calls for restructuring the company’s divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, accelerating momentum in operational excellence and enhancing the company’s brand.ABB also restructured its business into four segments — Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids — effective Jan 1, 2017.Furthermore, the company has taken a number of transformational actions to position itself for profitable growth. In 2017, it completed and announced several important acquisitions, divested certain businesses and executed business model changes. Additionally, ABB shifted its core operations to higher growth segments, thus boosting its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio. In order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB had also announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology.Meanwhile, ABB remains optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its inception. Last year, the company achieved its cost-reduction target under this $1.3 billion program.LiquidityABB’s cash and cash equivalents as of Mar 31, 2018 were $4,162 million compared with $5,562 million as of Mar 31, 2017. Total long-term debt declined to $5,285 million at the quarter-end, from $6,709 million as of Dec 31, 2017.Acquisitions and PartnershipsABB recently completed the acquisition of B&R — an independent provider dealing in product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation globally. This buyout is expected to bridge the gap between machine and factory automation and create an exclusive, comprehensive automation portfolio for clients across the world.Also, the acquisition of the data-transmission business of the KEYMILE Group should enable ABB to expand its communication networks business footprint in the industrial, transportation and infrastructure domains. It is anticipated to add reliable communications technology offerings to the company’s diverse portfolio, thus helping ABB fortify its foothold in digital electrical grids.ABB also announced its intention to acquire GE Industrial Solutions for $2.6 billion. This buyout would further strengthen the company’s position in Electrification by improving market access in North America.To ConcludeOver the long haul, ABB believes that all its three major markets namely, utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure, hold great potential. The company expects utility customers to invest further in transmission and distribution projects and renewable sources like solar and wind.Going ahead, the company expects to gain from high investments in ultra high voltage DC power transmission projects in mature and emerging markets and continuing investments in maintenance of aging electric infrastructures.However, ABB has been facing strong structural headwinds in its largest business — Power Grids — over the past few quarters. This trend is likely to continue in 2018.ABB carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) and Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report). Both the companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

15,AOS,"Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24 before the opening bell. Notably, the mining and construction equipment behemoth has outpaced earnings and revenue estimates in all the quarters of 2017 and delivered a 101% improvement in earnings for the year. After suffering a 36% drop in earnings in fiscal 2016 due to weak end-user demand in most of the industries it serves, this recovery was made possible by improvement in the construction sector, pickup in Resource Industries as well as its disciplined cost-control efforts. Consequently, investors are keen to know whether Caterpillar will be able to maintain the momentum in the first quarter of 2018 as well.  Given impressive results, the company’s share price has outperformed the industry in the past year. The shares gained 64.6%, ahead of the industry’s growth of 12.8%. An earnings beat will help the company sustain the price momentum. Looking at the upbeat estimates for the both earnings and revenues for the first quarter, it seems likely that the company will deliver improved year-over-year earnings on both metrics. This is also supported by strong fourth-quarter projections for its segments — Machinery, Energy & Transportation which generates a major chunk of revenues and earnings. Notably, performance will be driven by its positive end markets namely construction, mining and energy. Let’s delve deeper and take a look at factors that might influence first-quarter results. Caterpillar Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Caterpillar Inc. price-eps-surprise | Caterpillar Inc. QuoteImproved Markets will Drive Top-Line GrowthPer the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment, which contributed approximately 95% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, is expected to log year-over-year growth of 18% to $10.8 billion in the first quarter of 2018. We believe the company will witness growth in all its segments — Construction Industries, Resource Industries, Energy & Transportation. Also at fiscal 2017 end, Caterpillar’s backlog was at $15.8 billion, up from $15.4 billion at third-quarter 2017 end, primarily driven by higher backlog in Resource Industries. This bodes well for performance in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total sales of $11.6 billion for the first quarter indicates 18% growth from the prior-year quarter. Caterpillar’s Resource Industries’ performance will drive growth in the first-quarter 2018. Sales are being driven by continued strong demand for aftermarket parts. Global economic momentum and increasing commodity prices is restoring miners’ profitability and they are resuming capital spending. This bodes well for the segment. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, Resource Industries is anticipated to witness a 23% year-over-year growth to $2.1 billion. The Construction Industries is expected to remain strong in first-quarter 2018 as China and other APAC countries will continue to drive growth owing to investments in infrastructure. In North America, continued improvement in residential and non-residential construction as well as revival in infrastructure demand will drive revenues. For the Energy & Transportation segment, sales into Oil and Gas applications are likely to increase in the quarter, led by reciprocating engines for gas compression and well-servicing activity in North America. Sales to Transportation sector will benefit from recent acquisitions in rail services. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for the segment’s revenues is at $3.9 billion, projecting 17% year-over-year growth. Focus on Cost Control to Boost Profits In September 2015, Caterpillar set upon significant restructuring and cost reduction initiative, with actions expected through 2018. Once fully implemented, the plan would lower annual operating costs by about $1.5 billion. In first-quarter 2018, revenue growth along with cost reduction will lead to an improved bottom-line as well. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Profit before Taxes for the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment is pegged at $1.4 billion, a substantial improvement from the prior-year quarter’s profit of $0.1 billion. This will be driven by a 49% rise in the Construction segment’s operating profit to $946 million, as per the latest Zacks Consensus Estimates. Further, the Resource Industries segment is expected to report an operating profit of $264 million, an improvement of 67% over $158 million reported in the prior-year quarter. The Energy & Transportation segment is expected to report operating profit of $688 million, a rise of 25% from the prior-year quarter. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share of $1.77 for the quarter reflects an improvement of 65% on a year-over-year basis. Here is what our quantitative model predicts: Caterpillar has the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which shows that it is likely to beat earnings in the to-be-reported quarter. Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Caterpillar is +4.07%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $2.20 is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.77. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Caterpillar carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise. Other Stocks Worth a Look Here are a few other industrial products stocks worth considering as they too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +12.50% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Axon’s shares have surged 90% in the past year. The Earnings ESP for Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) is +2.69%. It sports a Zacks Rank #1. Shares of Deere have gone up 38% in a year’s time. A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.96% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gone up 31% in a year’s time. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

16,AOS,"Owens-Illinois, Inc. (OI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 23, after the market closes. In the last quarter, the company delivered earnings of 55 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.9% and also witnessed a year-over-year improvement of 10%. The uptick primarily reflected the benefits of the company’s global focus on reducing Total Systems Cost. The company continues to realize benefits from successful execution of its strategic initiatives in commercial programs and end-to-end supply chain management. Its focus on Total Systems Cost (“TSC”) contributed approximately $39 million during 2017. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, recording an average positive earnings surprise of 7.18%. Owens-Illinois, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Owens-Illinois, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Owens-Illinois, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to ConsiderOwens-Illinois expects adjusted earnings per share for first-quarter 2018 to be at 55-60 cents. The mid-point of the guidance range is in line with the prior-year quarter. Favorable currency impact, higher shipments, favorable price cost spread and impact from Total Systems Cost approach will be offset by impact of engineering activity, investments in strategic capital and capabilities as well as interest and taxes. Despite Owens-Illinois’ deleveraging and refinancing actions in the past 12 months, its debt-to-capitalization ratio remains high at 85%. This is a concerning factor. Further, the company expects no substantive impact of the tax reform currently on its adjusted earnings.Despite favorable market trends in Asia-Pacific, sales growth has not translated to the bottom line due to ongoing downtime from repair activity, changing customer needs and increasing the supply chain complexity. To meet the customers demand, Owens-Illinois has begun shipping it from where its readily available. This has in turn increased supply chain costs which are impacting the bottom line. To fundamentally address the situation, the company began substantial asset investments in the fourth quarter of 2017 to improve the supply chain scenario. These activities will continue in the first quarter as well and is expected to affect earnings in the region.Owen-Illinois’ acquisition of Vitro's food and beverage business has provided the company a competitive edge in the attractive and growing glass segment of the packaging market in Mexico, further solidifying its position as the world's leading glass container producer. The company anticipates realizing around $30 million in run-rate cost synergies by 2018 through both procurement savings and operating efficiencies. This will aid first-quarter results as well. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Owens-Illinois is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock must have the right combination of the two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you can see below. Zacks ESP: Owens-Illinois has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 58 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank: Owens-Illinois carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, an earnings ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Share Price Performance  The company’s price performance has been better than the industry over the past year. Its shares have gained 5.7%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 2.1%. Stocks Worth a Look Here are a few industrial products stocks worth considering as they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter. Axon Enterprise, Inc.

17,AOS,"Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before market opens.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 4.28% over the last four quarters. Notably, in the last reported quarter, Stanley Black & Decker’s adjusted earnings of $2.18 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.14 by 1.87%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayStanley Black & Decker noted that reduced onshore project activity in the pipeline market and dismal automotive system sales will dent its first-quarter 2018 revenues. Moreover, prevalent sluggishness in the self-piercing rivet system and engineered fastening electronics sales might dampen the company’s industrial business. Also, a lackluster security business in France is predicted to hit the company’s revenues in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for first-quarter revenues of Stanley Black & Decker’s Security, Industrial, and Tools & Storage segments are currently pegged at $479 million, $462 million and $2,126 million, respectively, lower than $510 million, $474 million and $2,430 million recorded in the prior quarter.Stanley Black & Decker has been expanding its distribution and manufacturing capacity on the back of several investments. However, these expenses are expected to drag down its margins in the near term. Profitability of the company’s Tools & Storage and Security segments were hurt in the last quarter due to these growth-oriented investments.Moreover, Stanley Black & Decker believes commodity inflation, especially in tools, will impede its profitability in the first quarter. The company expects to record net cost headwind of roughly $50 million in the first-quarter.The company expects that its earnings in 2018 will lie in the $8.30-$8.50 per share range and first-quarter earnings will be nearly 16% of the full-year performance, being roughly 130 basis points lower than the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for first-quarter operating profit of Stanley Black & Decker’s Security and Tools & Storage segments are currently pegged at $47.8 million and $306 million, respectively, lower than $56 million and $392 million recorded in the previous quarter.However, sturdier sales of iconic brands like Craftsman, Lenox and Irwin, greater innovation, cost synergies secured from acquisitions, and reduced corporate-tax rate might offset adversaries, and drive Stanley Black & Decker’s first-quarter bottom-line performance.Earnings WhispersOur proven model provides some idea on the stocks that are about to release their earnings results.

18,AOS,"Equity investors are on tiptoe with the U.S. markets speculating the consequences of the air strike on Syria by the United States, Britain and France. This joint attack has left the world pondering over the ill-effects of the possible escalation in tension if Russia steps in. Also, imposition of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium by the Trump government has soured trade relations with foreign nations, especially China. A trade war between the two economies will have adverse impacts as well.Other than these burning issues, financial results for the January-March quarter of 2018 (or the first quarter) will be a major determinant of the movements in the U.S. equity market. So far, few banking stocks have failed to impress with their results, while major earnings releases are anticipated the next week.Amid all these, it was the U.S. industrial production data that caught our attention.What’s With the Industrial Production Data?Industrial production measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. It is considered one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks.Data released yesterday shows that U.S. industrial production in March 2018 grew 0.5% over the previous month while registering 4.3% increase from the year-ago month. This improvement, though is welcomed wholeheartedly, is half of 1% month-over-month gain and 10 basis points (bps) below the year-over-year growth of 4.4% registered in February.The deceleration in growth is not only seen in the month’s data, but also in the quarterly numbers. In the first quarter of 2018, industrial production has grown at an annual rate of 4.5%, way below 8.2% recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017.The sector’s monthly data reveals that manufacturing production was weak in March. It inched up a mere 0.1% compared with a 1.5% month-over-month gain recorded in February. At an annual rate, manufacturing production grew 3% in March.Mining production too slowed in March, with month-over-month gain of just 1%. This improvement came in below 2.9% increase recorded in February. At an annual rate, mining production advanced 10.8% in March.Utilities data came in as a surprise, having recovered from 5% month-over-month decline in February to 3% growth in March. At an annual rate, utilities increased 5.3% in March.Capacity utilization in March jumped 30 bps to 78%.Is It Time to be Wary About the Industrial Sector?Apprehensions regarding weakness in industrial sector will be rife now. Many may interpret decelerating growth rates as the onset of a bad phase for the sector. We, however, are still optimistic.Per our in-house classifications, the U.S. equity universe is grouped under 16 sectors. Industrial Products is currently at the top of the list. We believe that the sector as well as the U.S. economy is fundamentally strong to ward-off any adverse impacts arising from the worries that have gripped the market lately.Earnings of the S&P 500 companies in the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 19.9% year over year in 2018 compared with 18.7% recorded in 2017. The projections, as published in Earnings Trend on Apr 11, calls for margin growth of 1.02% in 2018, higher than 0.46% in 2017. A little disappointment is seen on the top-line front, with revenues likely to grow 8.2% in 2018, below 12.9% increase in 2017.For the S&P 500 as a whole, earnings in 2018 are projected to increase 17.9% versus 9.7% in 2017. Margins will likely improve 1.26%, way higher than 0.2% last year. Revenue growth has gone down from 7.6% in 2017 to an expected 5.3% in 2018.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%. This estimate is way higher than 1.4% earnings growth recorded in the last five years (2013-2017). Likewise, the S&P 500’s earnings are projected to improve 9.7% in the next three to five years, above 5.8% recorded in the last five years.We see a lot of economic indicators pointing toward an expanding U.S. economy as well as growth prospects for industrial stocks. For instance, the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index data for March reflects an expanding manufacturing sector — as evident from growth in new orders, production activities, employment, new export orders and inventories. Also, the recent U.S. Census Bureau report shows that new orders for all manufacturing industries have grown 7.9% year to date. New orders of the machinery industry have increased 9.2% in the same timeframe.Other supporting factors are the government’s policies, including the Tax Cut and Jobs Act, and its intention of investing heavily in infrastructure development among others. Job markets have strengthened, being at a 17-year low unemployment rate of 4.1% in March. The housing market is also on growth track with housing starts in March increasing 1.9% from the previous month.On a broader note, the GDP of the United States grew 1.5% in 2016 and 2.3% in 2017. The International Monetary Fund (in its report issued in April) projects that the U.S. economy will advance 2.9% in 2018, reflecting a 20-bps hike over the previous estimates. Also, this premier institution expects the global economy to grow 3.9% in 2018 versus 3.8% in 2017. With growing interdependence among nations worldwide, overall growth in the global economy is considered favorable for a nation’s growth as well.Suitable Investment Picks in the Industrial SectorIn the current scenario, we have zeroed in on four Industrial stocks that can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the sector.

19,AOS,"“A well-diversified portfolio needs just four stocks,” believes billionaire investor Charlie Munger. Going by his words, we bring to you four stocks from top-ranked Zacks sectors to make the most of this earnings season.  But why choose stocks from four different sectors? In a volatile market, portfolio diversification is the key to mitigate risks of overexposure to one sector. Currently, markets are suffering from heavy bouts of volatility as investors apprehend a trade war from the bitter exchanges between the Unites States and China over tariffs and also from the recent chemical bomb attack on Syria. In the wake of this, diversification can be considered an ideal way to safeguard one’s portfolio from market upheavals.Sectors in SpotlightThe Industrial Products, Basic Materials, Construction and Aerospace sectors are ranked as the top four, out of 16, based on our in-house classifications.

21,AOS,"ABB Ltd (ABB  -  Free Report) recently secured a contract worth more than $90 million from Dubai Electricity and Water Authority — a major power utility in United Arab Emirates. Per the deal, ABB will be responsible for construction of the Shams 400 kV substation, which will integrate solar power from upcoming phases of the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park into the Dubai’s electrical grid.Under the contract, ABB has been assigned the task to design, supply, install and commission the Shams 400/ 132 kV substation, which will have a capacity of over 2,000 megavolt amperes. On completion of the Phase-3 of the project in 2020, the Solar Photovoltaic is expected to generate more than 1,000 MW of total solar power.As part of the project, the company will supply 400 and 132 kV gas-insulated switchgear, power transformers, protection, automation and control systems along with surveillance and communication systems. Notably, the substation will be IEC 61850 enabled, which is likely to support open as well as seamless communication with all intelligent devices. This marks the company’s second substation for the park that will ensure reliable delivery of power to utility and industry customers alongside serving building and infrastructure sector.Existing Business ScenarioABB has garnered a solid reputation for winning strategic awards and forging important partnerships. Moving ahead, broader market conditions represent selective opportunities that can supplement the company’s growth momentum. The company has also been successful in clinching major orders across all of its three segments, namely — utilities, energy and transport & infrastructure — which are expected to drive growth. Also, greater visibility in the timing of backlog growth adds to the company’s prospects.Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have lost 1% in the past week, marginally lower than the industry’s decline of 1.1%. Going forward, strength in matured end-markets, including Europe and the emerging countries like China and India, are expected to fuel ABB’s growth. The company expects utility customers to invest further in transmission and distribution projects and renewable sources like solar and wind. This apart, it anticipates gaining from investments in ultra high voltage DC power transmission projects in mature and emerging markets, and continued investments in maintenance of aging electric infrastructures.Despite these tailwinds, ABB has been facing strong structural headwinds in its largest business, Power Grids, in the past few quarters. Additionally, lower capital spending for the company’s key upstream energy end-markets is likely to hurt its financials.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are A. O.

24,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) recently announced its decision to discontinue operations at the company’s commercial water heater plant, based in Renton, WA. The Renton plant, a producer of commercial gas and electric specialty water heaters, electric boilers and hot water storage tanks currently employs about 55 people.The company intends to relocate the production of commercial electric water heaters, storage tanks and boilers to its plants at McBee, SC and Lebanon, TN, with effect from June 15. Transfer of the production to the larger McBee and Lebanon facilities should allow the company to leverage economies of scale as well as shift its production nearer to its commercial engineering resources. Additionally, it is likely to allow A.O. Smith to achieve cost synergies in terms of rental savings. This is because McBee and Lebanon facilities are owned by the company. Moreover, it plans to consolidate the customer service function of the Renton facility into its existing customer care facility at Ashland City, TN.Existing Business ScenarioA.O. Smith has been witnessing strong demand for its products in China, and boilers and commercial water heaters in the United States, which has accelerated its growth momentum. Also, the company’s defensive replacement market, which accounts for majority of the North American water heater and boiler volumes, has been on an uptrend in the recent quarters.Moreover, the company’s multiple capital expenditure initiatives like construction of new water treatment manufacturing facilities and capacity expansion are expected to pave the way for its higher brand recognition and top-line growth. Meanwhile, the company has been leveraging to capitalize on the long-term investment opportunity in India, which is one of the rapidly developing economies of the world. Further, the acquisition of Aquasana, the residential water treatment company, has been adding to the company’s strength.Notably, in the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 11.3%, significantly outperforming the industry’s gain of 4.2%.The company believes that the U.S. residential water heater volumes will shoot up in 2018, on the back of new construction and expansion of replacement demand. Further, U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes are also likely to go up this year, driven by strong demand for electric units as well as pre-buy of electric units in advance of regulatory change-driven price increase. These trends bode well for the company’s growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the same space include Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co.

Its Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded roughly 9.5% in these years, with a year-over-year expansion of 2.3% recorded for 2017.The future expansion projections issued by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also appear quite appealing.

The growth for earnings and margins are higher than 15.1% and 0.37% respectively recorded in 2017, while that for revenue is below 2017-figure of 10.6%.In the next three to five years, earnings of the Industrial Products sector are projected to grow 10.7%.What’s in Store for Growth Investors?Operating conditions for the Industrial Products sector seems to have improved over time. A strengthening U.S. housing market, job additions and plans for investment in infrastructural improvement by the government are some positives. In addition, any effort aimed to improve trade relations with other nations will be a boon.Key economic indicators like an 11.4% rise in new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery in January 2018, 4.4% year-over-year growth in industrial production in February and 2.9% month-over-month rise in the ISM Purchasing Managers’ Index or manufacturing index for February point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry.Also, lower taxes due to the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017 are expected to free resources for the corporates, enabling them to make further investment in growth projects. However, the recently approved tariff on import of steel and aluminum might have certain adverse impacts in the form of competitive threats from international players and hike in cost of production.Despite the near-term hurdles, we believe that Industrial Products sector’s solid long-term growth potential represents a win-win situation for growth investors. Also, the industries within the sector are capital intensive and have a large gestation period for yielding returns in any projects. Per the Zacks Style Score system, a growth investment strategy zeroes in on stocks after analysing the company’s income statement, cash flow statement and balance sheet. Instead of paying shareholders regularly, the majority of the annual earnings are reinvested in the business for funding growth programs. These stocks reward shareholders with solid capital gains.Companies with favorable Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) are anticipated to yield solid returns, clearly outperforming the market.Suitable Growth Investment OptionsWe have zeroed in on five Industrial Products stocks with solid growth potential over the next three to five years and are worth investing in.H&E Equipment Services, Inc.

27,AOS,"On Feb 13, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report).Regal Beloit reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 results on the back of modest organic growth and positive order trends. On a GAAP basis, the company reported net income of $51.5 million or $1.15 per share compared with $45.6 million or $1.01 per share in the year-earlier quarter. The significant year-over-year improvement was backed by higher revenues.Adjusted earnings were $1.14 per share compared with $1.04 in the year-ago quarter and came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Net sales increased to $820.7 million from $758.1 million, largely driven by organic growth across all segments. Moreover, quarterly revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $790 million.Over the years, Regal Beloit has consolidated its product lines and streamlined brands to evolve as a dynamic enterprise. In order to drive continuous improvement, the company has strictly followed ‘Compass Operating System’ that encompasses a common set of business processes, disciplines and lean Six Sigma tools. Backed by an “open-door” management style, this has helped Regal Beloit gain a competitive advantage and reach more people in diverse markets around the world.In addition, the company has continually focused on prudent investment decisions for a disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. We believe that such moves, along with a robust operating platform and an efficient management team will help in the execution of its strategic priorities and drive net asset value in the future. The company’s strong free cash generation is another positive, providing it an opportunity to pursue accretive acquisitions and unlock additional value.Furthermore, Regal Beloit continues to focus on simplification initiatives to lower operating costs and improve margins in the future. The company expects organic growth in 2018 to be in low single digits with modest demand trends. Its long-term strategy involves organic growth through innovative products, broadening customer base, exploitation of new opportunities and tactical investments in emerging markets. The company has also expanded technologically and geographically on the back of its aggressive acquisition policy. Management further indicated that it plans to continue seeking accretive acquisitions as part of its overall growth strategy. Regal Beloit remains confident of generating robust operating cash flow to fund its organic and inorganic growth as well as return significant capital to its shareholders.Despite core strengths, Regal Beloit has underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of of 0.7% compared with a 4.6% gain for the latter. The electric motor manufacturing space is a highly competitive and fragmented. With the rise in competition within the industry, the company is witnessing a decline in its product prices, which is detrimental to its overall margins. Also, it has to continually invest heavily in R&D to introduce newer value-added products that provide a hedge against competition.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock. Other stocks in the industry worth considering include ESCO Technologies Inc. (ESE  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.ESCO Technologies has topped estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.4%.Emerson Electric has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.3%. It topped estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.8%.A. O. Smith has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 13.3%. It surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.9%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

The figure also trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $633.1 million.

30,AOS,"ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) reported operational earnings per share of 33 cents for fourth-quarter 2017, flat year over year, as modest top-line growth was somewhat offset by elevated expenses. However, earnings trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents by an impressive 32%.For 2017, net income rose 17% year over year to $2,213 million, largely driven by lower transformation-related and restructuring-related expenses, and net gains realized from the business divestments. However, operational EPS came in 1% lower in constant currency at $1.25, compared to 2016.Quarterly revenues were up 3% year over year at $9,280 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9,398.3 million. Individually, revenues witnessed growth in just one of the four segments of the company, with growth in Robotics and Motion more than offsetting contraction in Power Grids. The Electrification Products and Industrial Automation segments remained mostly flat.For 2017, revenues inched up 1% to $34,312 million, as gains in Electrification Products and Robotics and Motion more than offset the declines in Industrial Automation and Power Grids.Quarterly Segment DetailsElectrification Products (down 1% year over year to $2,696 million): Orders were up 10% year over year to $2,556 million, driven by strong demand across all regions and end markets. Data center, food and beverage and electric vehicle fast-charging solutions displayed particular strength.Robotics and Motion (up 6% to $2,187 million): Sales grew steadily on solid demand trends in robotics and energy-efficient solutions, and strong execution of the order backlog.Orders of this segment moved up 6% year over year to $2,040 million on a year-over-year basis, backed by improved demand from process end markets, which was somewhat offset by a decline in large orders due to the timing of tender awards.Industrial Automation (flat at $2,012 million): Orders reverted to the negative trend, declining 1% year over year to $1,796 million, owing to selective capital expenditure investments in mining and specialty vessels.Power Grids (down 7% to $2,809 million): Lower order backlog, primarily in EPC, thwarted revenue growth. Orders continued the downward trend and declined 16% to $2,493 million, mainly due to the exceptionally large UHVDC order that was awarded in India in 2016.Total orders were up 2% year over year at $8,478 million, but declined 3% on a comparable basis,as strong base order development was more than offset by the impact of lower large orders in Power Grids and Industrial Automation. Base orders grew 9% on a year-over-year basis, while large orders amounted to just 7% of the company’s total orders, in line with ABB’s strategy. The order backlog at the quarter end amounted to $22.4 billion (down 4% year over year).On a geographic basis, demand was positive in the European countries, with moderate overall growth and good timing of large capital investments. Orders displayed sound growth in the Americas as well, fueledby elevated demand in construction and general industries, and improvement in process industries. The Americas grew 12% in total orders, driven by strong contribution from the United States, Canada and Brazil. The Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) region witnessed a mixed performance, with positive base order development in India, South Korea and Australia, which were slightly offset by order declines in China.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the reported quarter was 0.91, down from 0.92 recorded in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Operational EBITA”) in the quarter under review fell 7% year over year in comparable terms to $1,021 million. The figure benefited from the positive net savings effect, which was more than offset by commodity price escalation, negative impact from volume and investments in growth, and business transformation.Operational EBITA margin also contracted 150 basis points to 10.9%, hurt by charges related to the EPC businesses.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABB Ltd QuoteNext Level Strategy: Stage 3In third-quarter 2016, ABB had launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy” which focuses on three areas, namely profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. The third stage calls for restructuring the company’s divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, accelerating momentum in operational excellence and enhancing the company’s brand.ABB restructured its business into four segments: Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids, effective from Jan 1, 2017.ABB has also taken a number of transformational actions to position itself for profitable growth. In 2017, the company completed and announced several important acquisitions, divested certain businesses and executed business model changes. ABB shifted its core operations to higher growth segments, boosting its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio. Further, in order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB had announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market, by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology.Moreover, ABB is optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its inception. The company achieved its cost-reduction target under the program of $1.3 billion last year, which exceeds the original ambitions by more than $300 million. Also, the combined restructuring and implementation costs in the implementation came roughly $300 million lower than initially expected.Liquidity & Cash FlowsABB’s cash and cash equivalents as of Dec 31, 2017, were $4,526 million compared with $3,644 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Long-term debt rose to $6,709 million at the quarter end from $5,800 million as of Dec 31, 2016.ABB’s cash flow from operating activities came in at $1,869 million for the fourth quarter, up 31% compared with $1,428 million in the comparable quarter in 2016. The rise reflected stronger working capital management and improvements in collections from customers.Divestitures, Acquisitions and PartnershipsDuring the year, ABB closed its acquisition of B&R — an independent provider dealing in product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation globally. This buyout will bridge the gap in machine and factory automation which ABB has been facing, and create an exclusive, comprehensive automation portfolio for clients across the world.In addition to this, ABB acquired the data-transmission business of the KEYMILE Group. This acquisition will enable the company to expand its communication networks business footprint in the industrial, transportation and infrastructure domains. It will add reliable communications technology offerings to ABB’s diverse portfolio, helping it fortify its foothold in digital electrical grids.Furthermore, ABB announced its intention to acquire GE Industrial Solutions for $2.6 billion, which would further strengthen its position in Electrification by improving market access in North America. The buyout will establish a long-term strategic supply relationship for GE Industrial Solutions as well as ABB products that General Electric sources currently.These buyouts will help accelerate ABB’s operational momentum.Share RepurchaseAt the end of third-quarter 2016, ABB announced completion of the $4-billion share buyback program introduced in September 2014. Under the program, the company had repurchased approximately 171.3 million shares for about $3.5 billion. Consequently, ABB had announced a new share buyback program of up to $3 billion from 2017 through 2019, highlighting consistent strength in cash generation and financial position.As the GE Industrial Solutions transaction is in progress, ABB has decided to put its previously-announced planned share buyback program on hold.To ConcludeABB is facing a mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as the United States and Europe remain buoyant amid modest global growth and heightened uncertainties. The company is enjoying strong demand from the automotive and general industry sectors for robotic solutions. Nevertheless, lower capital spending for its key upstream energy end-markets and foreign exchange volatility might continue to dent financials.Despite the negatives, we believe the company’s long-term prospects are stable. The company’s three major customers in utilities, industry, and transport & infrastructure are likely to drive growth. Apart from this, encouraging development in electricity value chain, rapid progress of Internet of things, services and people, and a surge in energy-efficient transport and infrastructure bode well.Moreover, we look favourably upon ABB’s recent deal to acquire General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) global electrification solutions business. This acquisition will enable the integration of ABB’s Electrification Products division into GE Industrial Solutions, resulting in a unique global portfolio and a complete offering for North American as well as global customers. The deal has significant value creation potential and will expand the company’s installed base considerably.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderABB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A.O.

Also, strong contribution from acquisitions and organic growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.For the full year, the company reported adjusted earnings of $10.12 per share, up 10% from the previous year’s figure.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 9.5% year over year to $974.6 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $941.6 million comfortably. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency-translation effect, organic sales rose 4.3% year over year. Both the total sales increase and the organic growth for the quarter were the highest in 2017.For the full year, the company reported a 7.5% increase in sales to $3686.9 million compared to the previous-year tally, with organic sales growing 3.4%.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, the company’s U.S. franchise operations in the Tools Group remained subdued.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose a striking 19.4% to $341.7 million. Organic sales were up 10.1%. Higher sales to customers in critical industries, along with strong European-based hand tools business, drove the top line at this segment. Also, robust sales of power tools and growth in Asia/Pacific operations contributed to growth.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues continued to show weakness, descending 2% year over year to $409.2 million. Organic sales at the segment contracted 3%, which was somewhat offset by favorable foreign currency-translation impact of $4.3 million. Tepid sales in the company’s U.S. franchise operations continued to drag the segment’s growth.Repair Systems & Information continued to display impressive strength, as revenues climbed 11.6% year over year to $356.8 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 6.2%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, and OEM dealerships drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $79.9 million compared with $74.2 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services (excluding a legal charge) in the quarter came in at $188.6 million, up 7.1% from $176.1 million in the prior-year quarter.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteLiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $92 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $753.6 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million recorded at the end of 2016.AcquisitionsIn second-quarter 2017, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm — Car-O-Liner — to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair-shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker — Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement (RCI) program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair-shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets in the near future. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently-launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.Nevertheless, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used-car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Applied Industrial Technologies, Inc.

32,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported fourth-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 60 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents, thereby continuing its earnings beat streak of 24 straight quarters, which the company broke just once as it reported in-line earnings last quarter.The earnings figure improved 27.7% from the year-ago tally of 47 cents. The bottom-line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth.For 2017, the company generated adjusted net earnings of $378.3 million or $2.17 per share, up 16% from the prior-year figure.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 10.1% year over year to $768.6 million. The figure also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $767.1 million by a whisker. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers, and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.For the full year, the company posted record sales of $3 billion, up almost 12% from the 2016 tally.Coming back to the fourth quarter, A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 6% year over year to $460.8 million. Higher volumes of commercial water heaters, strong sales of boilers, and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Water treatment products contributed about $9 million to revenues, thus supplementing the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings rose an impressive 17% year over year to $104.9 million. The segment’s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel costs. Consequently, operating margin expanded 230 basis points (bps) to 22.8% on a year-over-year basis.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteQuarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 17% year over year to $313.8 million. The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s premium water-heating and water-treatment products, particularly in India (up 40%). Also, favorable pricing actions added to the top line.Operating earnings at the segment climbed a whopping 33% year over year to $50.8 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in India and China, along with favorable pricing actions, was partially offset by escalating steel and installation cost. Operating margin advanced 200 bps to 16.2% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring 2017, A.O. Smith repurchased around 2.5 million common shares for $139.1 million. At the end of the year, the company has approximately 2.4 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the year on Dec 31, 2017, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $346.6 million compared with $330.4 million a year back. Cash generated from operations during the year came in at $326.4 million, lower than $446.6 million recorded last year, as higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $402.9 million compared with $316.4 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2016.Also, earlier this month, A.O. Smith announced a 29% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of 18 cents per share will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31.This translates to a dividend of 72 cents per share on an annualized basis, and marks the 13th consecutive year in which the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend.GuidanceConcurrent with the fourth-quarter results, the company released optimistic guidance for 2018, and expects adjusted earnings to lie in the range of $2.50-2.58 per share. The mid-point of the range reflects impressive year-over-year growth of 17%. The buoyant guidance reflects the company’s robust growth momentum, backed by solid demand.Our TakeA.O. Smith wrapped up 2017 with solid momentum, with double-digit sales growth driven by continued strong demand for its consumer products in China, and positive end markets for the company’s water heaters and boilers in North America. A.O. Smith’s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company’s underlying strength.We believe stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water-heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets, is likely to stoke growth.However, over the past few quarters, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, which is creating pressure on the company’s operating margins. Furthermore, transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer-driven one might impact A.O. Smith’s sales in the region.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Illinois Tool Works Inc.

Smith’s sales of residential and commercial boilers are largely driven by innovation by Lochinvar.

This apart, the Aquasana buyout, which was completed last year, is expected to stoke inorganic growth of the company, going forward.AOS has had a decent earnings surprise history, having beaten earnings thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 2.6%.Smith (A.O.)

34,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) announced a whopping 29% hike in its quarterly cash dividend. The new dividend of 18 cents per share will be paid on Feb 15 to shareholders on record as of Jan 31.This translates to a dividend of 72 cents per share on an annualized basis. Based on the current 145.8 million shares outstanding, the new dividend will translate to a total payout of approximately $105 million.This marks the 13th consecutive year in which the company has increased its quarterly cash dividend, which underlines the strength and resilience of A.O. Smith’s balance sheet and cash generation. The dividend hike is consistent with the five-year compound annual growth rate of the company’s dividend, which exceeds 25%.Based on the closing price of $67.04 as of Jan 19, the increased dividend translates to a yield of 1.1%.With long-term value creation in mind, the company has taken consistent steps to enhance its balance-sheet strength. With a solid capital and liquidity position, the company is anticipated to continue enhancing shareholder value through efficient capital-deployment activities.Also, A.O. Smith displays strong financial leverage. Its debt/equity ratio of 0.27 compares favorably with the industry average of 0.29, indicating a lower debt burden relative to the industry. The company’s ROE of 22.4% is also much higher than the industry average of 9.7%. This reflects that it is more efficient in utilizing shareholder funds compared to its peers. Moreover, A.O. Smith has appreciated 39.8% in the last year against the 22.4% gain for its industry.Encouragingly, the company has a robust earnings surprise history, having posted an average surprise of 2.6% in the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, as well as solid consumer product demand in China has been driving the top-line growth of the company over the past few quarters.However, there are some risks associated with investing in the stock. A.O. Smith operates in a highly competitive market and competes with renowned global brands. Over the past few quarters, A.O. Smith’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, adding to the company’s overall operating expenses. Higher selling costs to support expansion in Tier 2 and 3 cities, and e-commerce platform in China, along with developmental costs associated with new products, including expansion of the air purification product portfolio, are escalating the company’s operating expenses in China.Furthermore, transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer driven one has resulted in a significant slowdown that might impact A.O. Smith’s sales in the region. For 2017, A.O. Smith projects to incur a $20-million sales headwind, due to the anticipated depreciation of the Chinese currency. Consequently, we expect margins for the company's rest of the world division — which includes China — to remain weak.A.O. Smith currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), as we believe its short-term risks outweigh the company’s strengths.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the same space include Barnes Group Inc.

Further, U.S. commercial water heater industry volumes are likely to go up by 10% this year, primarily backed by strong demand for electric units. Moreover, its Lochinvar-branded products have benefited from the transition from lower-efficiency to higher-efficiency boilers, new product introduction and market share gain.The company is also taking up multiple capital expenditure initiatives to fortify business. The acquisition of the residential water treatment company, Aquasana, last year has been adding to its strength. The buyout will help the company to bring Asia-based reverse osmosis water treatment platform into the United Staes. Aquasana's carbon-based products will also provide the company a chance to cross-sell water treatment products in China.

38,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 54 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 53 cents, thereby resuming its earnings beat streak of 23 straight quarters, which it broke just once as it reported in-line earnings last quarter.The earnings figure improved 15% from the year-ago tally of 47 cents. The bottom-line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 9.7% year over year to $749.9 million. It also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $742 million. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers, and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.Talking about segments, A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 7.8% year over year to $486 million. Higher volumes of residential water heaters, strong sales of boilers, and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Lochinvar-branded products charted 17% growth in the quarter. In addition, Hague products and Aquasana contributed $8 million to revenues, thus supplementing the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings rose 9.8% year over year to $110.3 million. The segment’s profit was favorably impacted by higher sales of residential water heaters and boilers. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel costs. Consequently, operating margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 22.7% on a year-over-year basis.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteQuarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) rose 12.4% year over year to $270.1 million. The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s premium water-heating and water-treatment products, particularly in China (up 13%, excluding impacts of the U.S. dollar).Operating earnings at the segment climbed 8.7% year over year to $33.8 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in China was partially offset by escalating steel and installation costs, as well as selling and administrative costs. Operating margin contracted 40 bps to 12.5% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring the first nine months of 2017, A.O. Smith repurchased around 1.9 million common shares for $103 million. At the end of the quarter, the company has approximately 3 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Sep 30, 2017, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents were $321.9 million compared with $269.3 million a year back. Cash generated from operations during this nine-month period came in at $150.2 million, way lower than $263.6 million recorded in the comparable period last year, as higher earnings were more than offset by higher outlays for working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $449.7 million compared with $316.4 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceConcurrent with the third-quarter results, the company raised its full-year earnings guidance for the third time. For full-year 2017, the company projects revenues to be up in the range of 11-12% now, as opposed to the earlier guided range of 10-11%.Further, A.O. Smith now anticipates 2017 earnings to lie in the range of $2.12-$2.14 per share compared to the earlier guided range of $2.07-$2.11. The upward guidance revision is primarily attributable to outstanding performance year to date, backed by solid demand and sales momentum.Our TakeA.O. Smith’s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company’s underlying strength. We believe stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth, going forward. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water-heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets are likely to stoke growth.This apart, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s sound financial health, strategic capital expenditures to fortify its market position and overall positive trends bode well for long-term growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the same space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), IDEX Corporation (IEX  -  Free Report) and Altra Industrial Motion Corp. (AIMC  -  Free Report).

39,AOS,"Premium consumer technology company iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017. Though quarterly earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues fell short of the same.  Earnings and RevenuesQuarterly adjusted earnings came in at 60 cents per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 44 cents. However, the bottom line came in lower than the year-ago tally of 70 cents per share.Quarterly revenues came in at nearly $205.4 million, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $207 million. Nevertheless, the top line came in much ahead of the year-ago tally of $168.6 million.Domestic Consumer business sales in the quarter came in at $87.6 million, up 33.8% year over year. Also, the International Consumer business generated revenues of $117.7 million in the reported quarter, up 14.9% year over year.Total units shipped in the quarter came in at 906,000, up from 779,000 shipped in third-quarter 2016.iRobot Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  iRobot Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | iRobot Corporation QuoteCosts and MarginsCost of sales in the reported quarter was $103 million, up 17.7% year over year.

Capital expenditure was $16.6 million on Sep 30, 2017, compared to $8.4 million recorded at the end of third-quarter 2016.OutlookiRobot believes business growth in the United States as well as the Europe, the Middle East and African end-markets would boost its results in the to-be-reported quarter. The company also anticipates that deeper market penetration of its premium home robotic products in the U.S. households will likely drive its top-line performance. Henceforth, the company raised its revenue guidance for full-year 2017 from $815-$825 million to $870-$880 million (estimating a year-over-year increment of 33-34%).  Nonetheless, the company trimmed the lower-end of its earnings guidance for 2017, considering the impact of the latest Robopolis acquisition (Oct 2, 2017). Earnings guidance for the current year has been revised to the $1.65-$2.00 per share range from the $1.80-$2.00 per share range, previously estimated.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same space are listed below:Altra Industrial Motion Corp.

43,AOS,"Milacron Holdings Corp. (MCRN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, Milacron surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.2%. The company beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters, witnessing an average positive earnings surprise of 10.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Milacron Holdings Corp. Price and EPS Surprise  Milacron Holdings Corp. Price and EPS Surprise | Milacron Holdings Corp. QuoteFactors to ConsiderMilacron recorded orders of $335 million in second-quarter 2017. About 40% of the orders were shipped within the second quarter and 35% were scheduled  in the third quarter. During the second-quarter conference call, the company stated that it has filled about 70% of backlog for Q3. Based on the current-order rates, Milacron remains confident for Q3’s performance.According to our latest consensus estimates, Milacron is expected to post net sales of $166 million for the third quarter in its Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies (APPT) segment, reflecting a year over year decline of 1.8%. Further, our consensus estimates indicate that net sales of Melt Delivery and Control Systems will reach $105 million in the quarter and the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fluid Technologies is pegged at $29.6 million.However, pricing pressure remains a headwind in the APPT segment due to the combination of the competition, low-growth environment in North America, as well as broader commodity deflationary headwinds. The environment remains somewhat sluggish for equipment spending, and consequently, a significant improvement is not expected anytime soon.In addition, the company is facing competition in its equipment business in North America, along with a choppy industrial environment. Milacron also witnessed $8-million foreign-currency headwind in the top line in the first half of 2017. The company believes foreign-currency impact will likely hurt its performance in the quarter to be reported.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Milacron will likely beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Milacron has an Earning ESP of +2.38%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 43 cents per share comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Milacron carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Share Price PerformanceMilacron has underperformed the industry over the past year. The company’s shares gained around 21.9% compared with 54.0% growth recorded by the industry. Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Barnes Group Inc.

44,AOS,"Avery Dennison Corporation (AVY  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25 before the market opens.Last quarter, the company posted a positive earnings surprise of 10.08%. It is worth noting that Avery Dennison has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 6.07%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Avery Dennison Corporation QuoteFactors at PlayAvery Dennison’s Label and Graphic Materials segment is the largest and highest-return business. The company expects the segment to exhibit strong profitability and solid sales growth in the near term. The segment benefited in the second quarter, driven by acquisitions, offset by timing issues and challenging comparison. The company remains confident to post roughly 4% organic growth for the segment in third-quarter 2017.Avery Dennison completed the acquisitions of Yongle -- an industrial tapes business in China that serves global markets -- in June 2017. Onetime transition costs related to this buyout will have a meaningful impact on margins in the Industrial and Healthcare Materials (IHM) segment in the third quarter.In the Retail Branding and Information Solutions segment (RBIS), Avery Dennison enhanced the segment’s competitiveness through strategic pricing initiatives. The segment’s operating margin improved in the second quarter, indicating the benefits of productivity initiatives and higher volume. Avery Dennison anticipates continued margin expansion in the segment in the back half of the year, led by business model transformation and benefit from the reduction in amortization.Moreover, the company anticipates sequentially stronger sales growth, both ex-currency and organically, with healthy profitability into the second half of the year. However, raw material inflation and negative impact of foreign currency translation will thwart Avery Dennison’s third-quarter performance.Further, Avery Dennison’s shares have underperformed the industry’s performance over the past year. The stock has gained 30.9% as against the industry's ascend of 31.2% during the same time frame.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Avery Dennison does not have the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Avery Dennison is -1.33%.

45,AOS,"iRobot Corporation (IRBT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results after the market closes on Oct 24.In the past year, iRobot’s shares yielded a return of 70%, outperforming 48.3% growth recorded by the industry.Over the trailing four quarters, the company recorded a remarkable average positive earnings surprise of 100.08%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Existing ScenarioiRobot believes sturdy demand for premium home robotic products (such as Roomba 800 and Roomba 900) as well as stronger sales of wet floor care robotic products (such as Braava jet) will likely bolster its top-line performance in the quarters ahead. Moreover, stronger market penetration of newly launched products (such as wi-fi enabled Roomba 890 and 690 robots) is anticipated to drive revenue growth. Notably, the company believes its ongoing marketing programs will continue to support the revenue growth trajectory in the to-be-reported quarter.The company also expects that wider margins, discrete tax benefit and higher revenues will likely drive its bottom-line performance in this quarter.However, we expect that the benefits generated by the aforementioned growth drivers might be offset by certain headwinds prevalent in the market.Almost all the contract manufacturers of iRobot’s home robotic products belong to China. The company might face severe supply-chain challenges if these dealers suddenly terminate their contract with the company or fail to offer good quality products on time.Furthermore, a stronger U.S. dollar, sudden input price inflation or extensive industry rivalry might dent the company’s revenues and profitability in the quarter to be reported.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that iRobot will likely beat on earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as we will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: iRobot currently has an Earnings ESP of -4.55%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 42 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 44 cents.iRobot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  iRobot Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | iRobot Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: iRobot carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a negative ESP, makes surprise prediction difficult.

46,AOS,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) maintained its impressive earnings beat streak, posting third-quarter 2017 net earnings of $2.45 per share, reflecting an increase of 10.4% from the year-ago figure. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43 by a couple of cents.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, strong contribution from acquisitions and organic growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 8.4% year over year to $903.8 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $890 million comfortably. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effect, organic sales rose 2.3% year over year.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, the company’s U.S. franchise operations in the Tools Group remained subdued.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose 8.7% to $314.6 million. Organic sales were up 0.2%. Higher sales to customers in critical industries, along with and strong European-based hand tools business, drove the top line at this segment. Weak sales of power tools and tepid growth in Asia/Pacific operations offset the growth to an extent.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues continued to show weakness, edging down 1.1% year over year to $392.7 million. Organic sales at the segment declined 1.6%, while favorable foreign currency translation impact of $2 million offset the same somewhat. Dismal sales in the company’s U.S. franchise operations continued to drag the segment’s growth.Repair Systems & Information continued to display impressive strength, as revenues climbed 16.6% year over year to $333.5 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 8.2%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, OEM dealerships and undercar equipments drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $79 million compared with $71.6 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services (excluding a legal charge) in the quarter came in at $168.1 million, up 6.7% from $157.6 million in the prior-year quarter.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteLiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $94.1 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $755 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million at the end of 2016.AcquisitionsIn second-quarter 2017, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm — Car-O-Liner — to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker — Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value-creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement (RCI) program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets, going forward. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently-launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.However, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds. The ongoing softness in industrial markets are impacting client spending, which, in turn, is adding to the company’s woes, primarily affecting its industrial business. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), A.O.

47,AOS,"Pentair plc (PNR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 24. The company’s revenues and earnings are anticipated to be up year over year in this quarter, driven by bright prospects for both Water and Electrical businesses.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company’s earnings have surpassed estimates in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 5.07%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for Q3 earnings.Pentair PLC. Price and EPS Surprise  Pentair PLC. Price and EPS Surprise | Pentair PLC. QuoteFactors at PlayPentair expects adjusted core sales to grow approximately 4% for the third quarter. According to our latest consensus estimates, Pentair is projected to post revenues of $1.23 billion in the third quarter, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 1.2%.Pentair’s Water segment, which generates around 60% of the company’s revenues, will grow on improving end-market demand in the municipal water market. Further, buoyancy in the Residential and Irrigation business will drive the segment’s growth in the quarter to be reported despite weakness prevalent in the Engineered Pump business. Our consensus estimates indicate that net sales of Pentair’s Water segment will reach $684 million in the quarter.Mid-single digit growth witnessed in the Industrial business for two straight quarters quarter drove sales growth in the Electrical segment in the second quarter. This momentum is expected to carry into the third quarter as well. The Commercial business will also grow led by its continued focus on reducing the infrastructure volatility. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the Electrical segment is pegged at $542 million for the third quarter.Moreover, Pentair’s pricing actions will help mitigate higher inflation. Investors will also want to keep an eye on Pentair’s plan to spin-off its Electrical business in order to create two industry-leading, pure-play companies — one in Water and the other in Electrical. The company will incur some incremental redundant corporate costs regarding the spin-off, which will hurt third-quarter earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has edged down 1.1% over the last 90 days and is currently pegged at 93 cents. Nevertheless, the earnings estimate reflects a 19% year-over-year growth and is at the higher end of the Pentair’s third-quarter guidance range of 91-93 cents. The mid-point of the company’s guided range reflects an 18% year-over-year growth.Also, the company’s price performance has not been impressive. Its shares have gained 18.4% in a year’s time, underperforming the 32.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Currently, Pentair carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks Worth a LookHere are a few stocks in the industrial products sector worth considering as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Altra Industrial Motion Corp.

48,AOS,"Dover Corporation (DOV  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter earnings results on Oct 19, before the market opens.We believe strong bookings trends, along with consistent rig count additions and higher-than-expected well completions, have set the company up for a strong third quarter. Moreover, solid outlook for Dover’s Engineered Systems segment will drive the quarter’s performance.Factors at PlayIn the Energy segment, significant drilling activity over the last few quarters has created a large backlog of drilled but incomplete wells. During the second-quarter conference call, Dover noted that many of these wells will get completed soon. The company’s forecast also assumed that the rig count will likely be up in the second half of the year.Thus, rise in well-completion activity will drive the segment’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. With respect to the third quarter, Dover expects revenues to be up nearly 1-2% sequentially in the Energy segment.In the Engineered Systems segment, Dover’s Printing & Identification platform will continue to deliver a solid performance, backed by focus on consumables and product innovation, marking and coding, as well as its unique position in the digital textile printing market. The outlook for this business is fairly strong for the third quarter.Dover achieved organic revenue and bookings growth at every segment during the second quarter. Its bookings increased 19.5% year over year in the second quarter. Backlog also improved to $1.33 billion in the last reported quarter from $1.09 billion recorded at the year-ago quarter end. The strong bookings will drive third quarter results.Dover Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Dover Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Dover Corporation QuoteNotably, Dover beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the last quarter. Further, shares of Dover have gained 26.1% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 23.9%.So what should investors expect from Dover’s Q3 earnings announcement?

50,AOS,"On Jul 9, we issued an updated research report on Enersys (ENS  -  Free Report).In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a return of 10.3% against the industry’s decline of 10.8%.Existing ScenarioEnerSys’ long-term growth drivers include higher demand for premium products, lean initiatives, robust prospects in Asia and strategic product launches. Currently, EnerSys is experiencing healthy demand for batteries from energy-storage products, commercial trucks, and aerospace, and defense applications. Also, the company has an interesting lineup of product launches, which it believes, will stoke growth in the upcoming quarters. In fact, rise in the sale of premium products have significantly boosted top-line performance in the recent quarters.Of late, both the company’s segments — Motive Power and Reserve Power — have been witnessing solid performance. For Motive Power business, the company believes that China will provide the much-needed growth impetus. Also, strong sales of thin plate pure lead, IRONCLAD, gel, high-frequency chargers and battery management systems in key end markets including Europe, Middle East and Africa are also adding to the strength of this segment. Further, the company’s Reserve Power business is also faring well. It believes that India’s market will act as the strongest catalyst for the Reserve Power Business.Further, the company’s business streamlining initiatives, aimed at transforming the organization into a leaner one, bode well. Presently, EnerSys is focusing on reducing costs of goods sold permanently by a minimum of 2% or $35 million by the end of fiscal 2019. These savings are expected to be driven by eliminating waste, increasing productivity and reducing costs.However, EnerSys is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, especially that of lead. The continuous increase in the price of lead and other raw materials including steel, plastic and copper is a formidable headwind. Rising cost of raw materials are expected to inflate the cost of goods sold, thus eroding profitability.This apart, a significant portion of EnerSys’ revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, which renders it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies may hurt the company’s revenues and operating margins. Going forward, EnerSys expects currency fluctuations to weigh on top-line growth and hamper its flexibility in adjusting costs, thereby putting pressure on margins. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are A.

51,AOS,"Machinery company Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) recently announced the acquisition of Illinois-based World Dryer Corporation. Financial terms of the buyout have not been disclosed.As revealed, World Dryer is a leading manufacturer of electric hand dryers and related products for the commercial end markets. The firm operates as a unit of Carrier Commercial Refrigeration, Inc., which is the business unit in United Technologies Coporation’s (UTX  -  Free Report) UTC Climate, Controls & Security business. World Dryer was founded in 1950 and currently has annual revenue generation capability of $20 million.Post completion of the buyout, World Dryer will be integrated with Rexnord’s Water Management business segment. World Dryer’s hand dryers will strongly complement the segment’s Zurn business, which provides water-efficient plumbing products. The combined businesses will offer superior products to commercial building owners.Acquiring meaningful businesses or disposing non-core assets have helped Rexnord improve its business portfolio and work toward profitability enhancement. Notably, the company acquired Cambridge International Holdings Corporation while divested its non-strategic RHF product line for the best interests of its shareholders in fiscal 2017. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s acquisitions and divestments had a combined positive impact of 1% on sales growth.Year to date, Rexnord’s shares have yielded 30.5% return, outperforming 14.8% gain of the industry. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderWith a market capitalization of nearly $2.7 billion, Rexnord currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

52,AOS,"Industrial battery manufacturer, EnerSys (ENS  -  Free Report) has been disappointing investors of late. The company continues to grapple with increasing costs and lead price fluctuations that, among other factors, will continue to hurt profits in the short run.Mirroring these headwinds, the stock has exhibiteda dismal performance on the bourse.  Inthe past three months, EnerSys’ shares have lost 4.7%, againstthe industry’s average gain of 1.9%.Moreover, earnings estimates have moved south in the past couple of months, indicating bearish analyst sentiment. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings moved down from $4.84 to $4.69, in the past 60 days, led by two downward revisions. Let us delve deeper and try to find out why it would be wise to dump the stock from your portfolioat the moment.Fluctuations in commodity prices, especially that of lead, has become a major concern for the Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company. In order to offset the price volatility, the company’s decision to increase price has most often led to massive fluctuations in its selling price. EnerSys estimates that 35% of its revenues are subject to adjustments based on a lead price index, which exposes the company to vulnerability in price changes.Continuous rise in the price of lead as well as other raw materials including steel, plastic and copper has become a major concern for the company. Increase in cost of raw materials are expected to inflate the cost of goods sold, consequentlyeroding profitability. In light of rapidlyrising lead costs, customers are placing more orders at old price levels, which is hurting profits.EnerSys’ gross profit percentage has been adversely affected by the company’s decision to take multiple long-term investments. Further, higher spending on Lean initiatives, Digital Core installation and new products development are weighing down on margins.A significant portion of EnerSys’ revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, rendering it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. The company’s statistics show that past fluctuations in Euro have contributed to major issues in production costs. Going forward, the company anticipatescurrency fluctuations to puttop-line growth under pressure and hamper its flexibility in adjusting costs, consequentlystrainingmargins.Additionally, the company faces stiff competition from international manufacturers and distributors, as well as a large number of smaller, regional competitors. Some of its major rivals include GS Yuasa Corporation, Exide, Johnson Controls and Yokohama Industries. In order to boost competency the company needs to have an interesting lineup of product launches, to stoke growth in the upcoming quarters.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include II-VI Incorporated (IIVI  -  Free Report), Smith (A.O.) Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) and Barnes Group, Inc. (B  -  Free Report). While II-VI Incorporated sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Smith (A.O.)

53,AOS,"Earnings growth enthralls almost everyone, right from the top brass to research analysts. But the question here is why? If the company doesn’t make money, it won’t stand the test of time. Take a company’s revenues over a given period of time, subtract the cost of production and you will have its earnings!This metric is also considered to be the most noteworthy variable in influencing the share price. Better-than-expected earnings performances normally lead to a rally in the share price. However, in addition to actual earnings, expectations of earnings play a significant role in influencing the price of a stock.Earnings Estimates Determine Share PricesWe have often seen a decline in the stock price despite earnings growth and a rally in the price following an earnings decline. This is largely a result of a company’s earnings failing to meet market expectations.Earnings estimates embody analysts’ opinions of factors such as sales growth, product demand, competitive industry environment, profit margins and cost control. Thus, earnings estimates serve as a valuable tool while making investment decisions. Earnings estimates also help analysts assess the cash flow to determine the fair value of a firm.Investors, thus, should be on the lookout for stocks that are ready to make a big move. Hence, it is important for investors to buy stocks that have historical earnings growth and are also seeing a rise in quarterly and annual earnings estimates.The Winning StrategyIn order to shortlist stocks that have striking earnings growth and positive estimate revisions, we have added the following parameters:Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2 (Only Zacks' 'Buys' and 'Strong Buys' are allowed. With the Zacks Rank proving itself to be one of the best rating systems out there, this is a great way to start things off.) You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.5-Year Historical EPS Growth (%) greater than X-Industry (Stocks that possess strong EPS growth history.)% Change EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than or equal to 5 (Companies that witnessed year-over-year earnings growth rate of 5% or more in the last reported fiscal.)% Change Q1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their current quarter earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 1 week greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 1 week.)% Change F1 Estimates over the last 4 weeks greater than zero (Stocks that have seen their annual earnings estimates revised higher in the last 4 weeks.)The above criteria narrowed down the universe of around 7,818 stocks to only 23. Among them, we have selected five large-cap stocks. Such stocks have long-term performance history and are more stable than what mid-caps or small caps offer.

54,AOS,"Investors have been encouraged by ABB Ltd’s (ABB  -  Free Report) recent winstreak, as ABB’s earnings have trumped estimates in the four trailing quarters. The company is anticipated to continue the momentum driven byaccretive acquisitions, diligent restructuring efforts and cost saving initiatives.ABB’s performance has reflected well on its share price as well, exhibiting investor optimism, The company’s shares have appreciated 17.5% year to date, significantly outperforming the industry’s average gain of 13%. We believe that the industry is seeing favorable broader trends, which should have a positive impact on the company, in the quarters to come. Read on to find out the key drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company right now.Existing Business ScenariosABB has been driving growth on the back of steady revenues from the Electrification Products and Robotics and Motion segments. Particularly, the Robotics and Motion segment is enjoying consistent strong demand patterns in robotics and light industry. Recently, the company also consolidated all electrification components and offerings into Electrification Products which would enable it to better manage costs and maximize growth.We are highly optimistic about ABB’s recent acquisition of GE Industrial Solutions, which will fortify global position in electrification, and will enable it to expand access to the North American market. Further, the company anticipates the B&R buyout, to bridge the gap in machine and factory automation, while also generating tremendous operational synergies. ABB anticipates these acquisitions to help shift its focus to higher growth segments, consequently becoming more competitive.The company is highly optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has garnered significant cost savings over the past few quarters and is expected to benefit coming quarter’s results as well. Moreover, positive investments made by all the three major markets of the company, namely, utilities, industry and transport & infrastructure, are expected to boost the financials going forward.Despite these positives, ABB’s exposure to oil and gas markets makes it susceptible to current price volatility in the market, posing a severe challenge. We believe lower capital spending for the upstream energy end-markets are predictedto hurt financials.Moreover, softness in industrial production and the projected slowdown, are weighing on the company’s financials. Currently, the industrial slowdown in China is posing a threat to the company’s profitability. Few other end markets also continue to bear the brunt of sluggish industrial spending. Moreover, the company remains quite vulnerable to currency translation risks, and even hedging activities might not be able to protect it against significant fluctuations.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include II-VI Incorporated (IIVI  -  Free Report), Smith (A.O.) Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) and Franklin Electric Co., Inc. (FELE  -  Free Report). While II-VI Incorporated sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Smith (A.O.)

Corporation has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.3%.Franklin Electric has outpaced estimates once in the preceding four quarters, with an average earnings surprise of 0.4%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

55,AOS,"Parker Aerospace, a business unit of Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report), has inked a long-term agreement with Lufthansa Technik for the maintenance, repair, and overhaul (“MRO”) services of Airbus A350 components. The deal includes the majority of repairable components for the A350 fuel, hydraulic and fuel tank inerting systems.The collaboration will help increase component and systems reliability and diminish related maintenance costs for airline customers globally. The partnership will help optimize services by focusing on repair development, instead of replacing components. This will help keep the aircraft in flight longer, in turn, reducing costs.In addition to being an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), Parker-Hannifin develops and integrates components across many aerospace technologies, while Lufthansa Technik is a leader in MRO with expansive knowledge of airline operations. The integration of OEM data with powerful MRO insight and repair capabilities will likely help drive efficiency, optimize reliability and reduce costs.Parker-Hannifin has been enjoying remarkable revenue expansion and improved margins on the back of the revamped Win Strategy, in recent times.The company is also seeing improving demand in key end markets and regions, with order growth being positive for four consecutive quarters.In addition, Parker-Hannifin continues to benefit from its extensive distribution network, which sells to the more lucrative MRO markets. Robust distribution sales helped it reach out to smaller OEMs. We believe the company’s strong aftermarket sales are likely to raise its bottom line and margins for fiscal 2018 and beyond.Buoyed by the competency of the revamped Win Strategy and strategic acquisitions, Parker-Hannifin is bullish about delivering its fundamental financial goals. Investors also seem to be optimistic on the company’s future prospects, as its shares have risen 41% over the past year, outperforming the industry’s average return of 28%.Furthermore, Parker-Hannifin’s strategic buyouts have constantly broadened its market presence and boosted its core revenue growth. For instance, the CLARCOR buyout has strengthened the company’s filtration product suite, thus driving recurring revenue growth. Also, other bolt-on acquisitions completed over the past two years, namely Jäger Automobil-Technik GmbH, Jäger Automotive Polska President Engineering Group Limited and Helac Corporation are anticipated to supplement top-line growth, going forward.Also, the company’s diligent global restructuring initiatives are proving conducive to profitability. These initiatives helped Parker-Hannifin offset weakness in some vital regions, thus strengthening its position in the end markets.The company has made impressive progress in key areas, including safety performance, customer experience, and profitable growth, and believes these initiatives will unlock further growth opportunities.However, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been affected by an escalation in prices for core materials like steel, aluminum, castings and nickel, among others, over the past few quarters. Such price hikes can significantly mar the company’s profits and margins. Also, Parker-Hannifin has been experiencing sluggishness in its key natural resources market, including oil and gas, agriculture, mining and construction equipment, which can exert a lot of pressure on the company’s distributors engaged in the oil and gas business.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc.

58,AOS,"Manufacturer of residential and commercial water heating equipment, A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), recently announced the buyout of William R. Hague, Inc. (Hague Quality Water International). The acquisition will enable A. O. Smith to further expand its global water treatment platform.The transaction, worth $44.5 million in cash, includes the potential earn out of up to $2 million based on revenue growth over the next couple of years.The Acquiree Based in Ohio, Hague is the manufacturer of a wide-range of water softener products. Featuring innovative multi-compartment and compact tank design, Hague’s water softener products are sold under Hague, WaterBoss, and WaterMax brands.Transaction Rationale The acquisition is likely to augment A. O. Smith’s residential and commercial water treatment capabilities and product offerings.The acquisition is in sync with the A. O. Smith’s strategy to expand its global water treatment platform. Hague's complementary capabilities and patented water softener products round up A. O. Smith's residential water treatment portfolio nicely. The company has already started offering Hague-manufactured water softeners in China through major retailers like Suning and Gome, apart from its own stores.Further, Hague’s strong water quality dealer network will enable A. O. Smith to expand its distribution channel in the United States and abroad.Our Take  In the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company returned 11.8%, outperforming the industry’s average decline of 0.1%. Going forward, A.O. Smith remains bullish about its prospects in key markets, and has several robust growth drivers in place. It expects the U.S. residential water heater volumes to shoot up by approximately 300,000 units on the back of sturdy demand. Impressive demand for U.S. commercial heaters is also expected to support growth.The company has been selectively acquiring assets to boost its water treatment capabilities. During third-quarter 2016, the company acquired residential water treatment company Aquasana, which has been adding to the company’s strength. The Aquasana buyout has helped A.O. Smith bring its Asia-based reverse osmosis water treatment platform into the United States.Aquasana's carbon-based products have also provided the company a chance to cross-sell water treatment products in China. Such diligent expansion strategies will help the company pave the way for higher brand recognition and top-line growth.However, over the past few quarters, A.O. Smith’s administrative expenses in China have been quite high, adding to its overall operating expenses. Furthermore, transition of the Chinese economy to a consumer driven one has resulted in a significant slowdown that might impact A.O. Smith’s sales in the region.Furthermore, although A.O. Smith’s expansion initiatives hold good for long-term growth, the high capital expenditure incurred negatively impacts its short-term earnings. These actions are expected to put pressure on the company’s profitability in the near term.Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks from the same space are AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report), Altra Industrial Motion Corp.

For fiscal 2017, Tetra Tech remains bullish about its growth across all four client sectors, namely, the U.S. federal, the U.S. state and local, the U.S. commercial work and international.The company’s U.S. state and local clients – in both the municipal water and smart water services domains – are anticipated to be its strongest growth drivers for the upcoming quarters. The broad-based bipartisan support for infrastructure investment in the U.S., which can range from $500 billion to $1 trillion, can prove to be extremely beneficial for the company. Steady growth in local budgets and local capital spending has been adding to this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s strength.However, the company is concerned about its oil and gas operations, which have become increasingly challenged, particularly in Canada.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the broader space include Barnes Group Inc.

The results were affected by the year-over-year impact of non-operational and non-cash currency on the quarter.

62,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 53 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thereby breaking its earnings beat streak which lasted for 22 straight quarters.The earnings figure improved 8.2% from the year-ago tally of 49 cents. The bottom-line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 10.7% year over year to $738.2 million. It also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $728 million. A thriving water heater industry in the U.S., as well as robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.Talking about segments, A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 8.8% year over year to $470.7 million. Higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. In addition, the previously completed acquisition of residential water treatment company – Aquasana – contributed $13 million to revenues, thus supplementing the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings rose 4.8% year over year to $109.2 million. The segment’s profit was favorably impacted by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers, and the Aug 2016 pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by elevated steel costs. However, operating margin contracted 90 bps to 23.2% on a year-over-year basis, due to higher steel prices. Lower operating margin of the acquired Aquasana business also contributed to the decline.Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (China, India and Europe) rose 13.8% year over year to $272.8 million. The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s premium water heating and water treatment products, particularly in China (up 20%, excluding impacts of the U.S. dollar). While water treatment sales in China grew over 40%, air purification sales quadrupled year over year.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteOperating earnings at the segment edged down 1.5% year over year to $32.5 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in China was more than offset by multiple headwinds, including higher steel costs, higher selling and advertising costs, less profitable sales mix in China and currency headwinds. Operating margin contracted 190 bps to 11.9% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring the first half of 2017, A.O. Smith repurchased around 1.3 million common shares for $66.2 million. At the end of the quarter, the company has approximately 3.6 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Jun 30, 2017, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents were $306.6 million compared with $330.4 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016.At the end of the quarter, long-term debt was $367.7 million compared with $316.4 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceConcurrent with the second-quarter results, the company raised its full-year earnings guidance once again. For full-year 2017, the company expects revenues to grow in the range of 10—11% now, as opposed to the earlier guided range of 9–10%.Further, A.O. Smith now anticipates 2017 earnings to lie in the range of $2.07–$2.11 per share compared to the earlier guided range of $2.03–$2.09. The upward guidance revision is primarily attributable to outstanding top- and bottom-line performances in the reported quarter.Our TakeA.O. Smith’s consistent sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company’s underlying strength. We believe stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth, going forward. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets are likely to stoke growth.This apart, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s solid financial health, strategic capital expenditures to fortify its market position and overall positive trends bode well for long-term growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other similarly-ranked stocks in the same space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report) and Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average of 8.9%.Eaton also has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 3.3% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.Regal Beloit generated two beats over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 1.5%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Smith’s thriving residential and commercial boiler businesses have consistently stoked top- and bottom-line growth over the past several quarters Factors including growth of households, thriving replacement market, geographic expansion and improved product mix are likely to act as tailwinds for China.A.O. Smith’s sales of residential and commercial boilers are largely driven by innovation by Lochinvar. Products of this brand have benefited from the transition from lower-efficiency to higher-efficiency boilers, product introduction and market share gain.

64,AOS,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26.With a string of earnings beats over the past 22 quarters, the company’s surprise history is quite spectacular. Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. The stock boasts an average positive surprise of 4.9% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether A. O. Smith is set to add yet another earnings beat to its winning streak.Factors to ConsiderA.O. Smith’s thriving residential and commercial boiler businesses have consistently raised the top and bottom line over the past several quarters. We believe the stellar demand for its products in China and boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. will prove conducive to its sales performance. Factors, including an increasing number of households, thriving replacement market, geographic expansion and improved product mix are likely to act as tailwinds for China.A.O. Smith’s sales of residential and commercial boilers are largely driven by innovation by Lochinvar. Lochinvar-branded products have benefited from the transition from lower-efficiency to higher-efficiency boilers, new product introduction and market share gain. During first-quarter 2017, Lochinvar-branded products grew 5%, led by strong demand for water heater and modest growth in boilers. This trend is likely to continue for the second quarter as well.This apart, we believe the Aquasana buyout, which was completed last year, has helped A.O. Smith to cross-sell water treatment products in China. As a matter of fact, for full-year 2017, the company anticipates Aquasana sales to lie within the band of $55–60 million, proving accretive to earnings growth.Despite these positives, the company has been witnessing a rise in overall operating expenses over the past few quarters. High selling and administrative expenses to support the development of innovative products and quality improvement are expected to hurt second-quarter margins.Moreover, escalating capital expenditures, in relation to capacity expansion in China and ERP implementation initiatives, are likely to remain an overhang. Also, currency headwinds that have been eroding A.O. Smith’s sales of late, are a concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that A. O. Smith will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 53 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteZacks Rank: A. O. Smith has a Zacks Rank #2. Though Zacks Rank #1, 2 and 3 increase the predictive power of the ESP, the company’s ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.89% and a Zacks Rank #1.

65,AOS,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) maintained its impressive earnings beat streak, posting second-quarter 2017 net earnings of $2.60 per share. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 by 1.6%. The bottom line also reflected an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago figure of $2.36.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, organic top-line growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 5.6% year over year to $921.4 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $922 million by a whisker. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effect, organic sales rose 2.7% year over year.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, unfavorable foreign currency translation restricted revenue growth to some extent.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose 8.5% to $310 million. Organic sales were up 4.7% primarily owing to strong performance in the European-based hand tools business. Also, higher sales to customers in critical industries, including military, drove the top line at this segment. Unfavorable foreign currency translation had a $4.9-million impact on sales, thereby offsetting organic growth to an extent.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues edged down 0.7% year over year to $413.8 million. Organic sales at the segment recorded a minor improvement of 0.5%, but unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $5 million more than offset the same.Repair Systems & Information continued to display strength, as revenues climbed 14.5% year over year to $338.1 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 8.3%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, OEM dealerships and undercar equipments drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $77.7 million compared with $69.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services in the quarter came in at $183.7 million, up 10.4% from $166.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteLiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $89 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $755.6 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million at the end of 2016.Other ActivitiesDuring the reported quarter, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it to cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm – Car-O-Liner – to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker – Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes that this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value-creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Moving ahead, Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.However, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds for the company. The ongoing softness in industrial markets are impacting client spending, which, in turn, is adding to the company’s woes, primarily affecting its industrial business. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader sector include A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report). All three stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).
