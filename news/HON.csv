0,HON,"Berkshire Hathaway's (BRKB) supposed interest in taking a stake in General Electric (GE) would fit well with Warren Buffett's investment track record, an RBC analyst said.The remarks came after Bloomberg reported on speculation that Buffett might be interested in buying a stake in the beleaguered industrial conglomerate. The billionaire investor dumped his stake in GE in August.""In many ways, GE's current situation fits the profile of an ideal Warren Buffett investment,"" RBC's Deane Dray wrote in a research note late Tuesday.""One of his guiding principles is to 'be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.' GE is a 125-year-old iconic industrial brand with strong assets, market leadership in many industries, and a business model that Mr. Buffett understands, but is operating at a steep valuation discount today.""He also noted that Buffett told CNBC in January that he would consider buying stock in GE ""at the right price."" Buffett has also swooped in to rescue other legacy businesses whose struggles tanked their stock prices — namely Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and General Electric during the financial crisis, Dray said.Buffett could reportedly take a $14 billion stake in General Electric, Dray said, indicating he could be jockeying for more than 11% of the company. That would make Berkshire GE's largest shareholder.Shares of General Electric rose 1.8% to 13.68 in the stock market today, after popping 4.3% Tuesday following reports on the speculation about Buffett. Among other diversified industrial stocks, 3M (MMM) rose 0.3%, Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.75%, and United Technologies (UTX) lost 0.7%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Given GE's breadth in the industrial sector — from locomotives to oil-production systems — it has felt the pain acutely.GE CEO John Flannery has been receptive to breaking up the company and planned to lop $20 billion in assets off its books. The company has also slashed its dividend in half.Dray said that if Buffett took a big stake in GE, the investor could become another voice — along with activist Trian Fund Management — from which Flannery could draw.He also said the favorable reaction from Wall Street was the ""predictable 'if Buffet is investing, then the stock could be bottoming' response."" But the analyst said any move from Buffett would mean less for shareholders.""However, we caution that any investment by Mr. Buffett would potentially be 'expensive capital,' as he is likely to extract favorable terms from GE,"" Dray said. ""In effect, this Berkshire investment scenario would essentially be in lieu of an equity raise, and would likely be similarly dilutive to existing GE shareholders.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Trump Tax Cuts Help Boost Dividends By Most Since 2012; Buybacks May Hit RecordBoeing 787, Powered By GE Engines, Makes This Historic FlightUnited Technologies Draws Another Activist Investor Amid Breakup TalkBoeing, GE Likely Winners Of This Massive American Airlines Order

1,HON,"General Electric (GE) shares wallowed near multiyear lows Tuesday as two Wall Street analysts soured on the industrial giant's worsening fundamentals, including its credit and earnings outlooks.XJPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa wondered how long credit-rating agencies can ""remain on the sidelines with their commentary, seemingly giving GE precious time to work their way out,"" given a host of problems.Problems dogging the 126-year-old industrial giant include ""material changes in fundamentals,"" little progress on asset sales, delays in revenue recognition restatements, a lack of ""clean numbers"" and an SEC investigation, according to Tusa. The analyst also pointed out that during the Great Recession, GE was AAA-rated and needed a bailout.""So we scratch our heads as to the repeated inertia"" from ratings watchdogs, which should start to get more attention, Tusa wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.He remains cautious on the stock, finding GE's fundamentals are ""worse than expected"" and calling out its ""currently unjustified rating."" The recent appointment of a Moody's board member to its own board should raise investors' eyebrows, in Tusa's view.Moody's cut GE's long-term debt rating in November, citing ""extreme deterioration"" in its energy business. The cut from A1 to A2 still kept the company's bonds in the investment grade category. Also in November, Fitch cut its rating to A+ from AA-, still in investment grade.Tusa, however, has an underweight rating on the stock with an 11 price target, down from 14 a month ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That raises both direct risk in terms of competitive cost pressures and indirect risk in terms of reduced global trade if other countries slap tariffs of their own, he added.""While the value/cost of GE's products are heavily weighted to the engineering performance features rather than the raw material costs, we believe that rising raw material costs (steel and aluminum) can nonetheless still pose significant spread headwinds (""value gap"") for GE,"" Inch said.GE countered the Deutsche Bank note in a statement, saying reports on the impact of potential steel and aluminum tariffs on GE's costs are completely ungrounded.""Our internal data shows our consumption of imported metals likely to be impacted by the tariffs is minimal,"" a GE spokesperson said.

GE has $134 billion in backlogs tied to its power, oil and gas, and renewable energy segments, according to its 2017 10-k report.Inch also warned that the rail business GE seeks to sell or spin off could become less attractive to potential buyers as metal input costs rise.

16,HON,"General Electric (GE) seeks to hive off a part of its industrial gas engine business in a move that could be an opening salvo in a more far-reaching breakup of the industrial conglomerate.X GE's divestiture of the unit, which makes the Jenbacher and Waukesha gas engines, would help management deliver on its promise to right-size its struggling core power division. It could bring inasmuch as $2 billion, Reuters reported Friday. The gas engines generate 100 kW to 10 MW of power and heat for industries in more than 100 countries across the globe. GE has manufactured gas engines for more than 80 years.GE reportedly has hired Citigroup (C) to prepare a sale process for the industrial gas business. Neither GE nor Citigroup offered a comment to Reuters.Shares of GE lost 2.1% to 17.74 on the stock market today. The Dow component's stock has halved in value over the past year and sits at its lowest level in more than six years. Dow peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) lost 2.2% and 0.7%, respectively. Honeywell (HON) rose 0.2% and Siemens (SIEGY) gave up 0.35%.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!GE powers more than 30% of the world's electricity, but sales of power plants and gas turbines fell sharply last year. In Q4, power revenue fell 15% to $9.4 billion and profits plunged 88% to $260 million. In November, the industrial giant said gas power generation remains a key market but admitted to poor planning and operational execution, even as that market became more competitive and overcapacity issues ballooned.GE was hard hit by the acquisition of French multinational Alstom's power and grid businesses for $10.1 billion in 2015. It placed that bet as global markets for gas power grew sluggish, critics say, and made too many concessions to secure the deal. GE anticipated $3 billion in cost synergies and a strong return from the deal, but said in November the transaction was performing below expectations.CEO John Flannery said at the time that he expects it will take one to two years to fix GE Power. In December, GE announced plans to slash 12,000 jobs from its power unit as part of a broader effort to cut $3.5 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Disruptions in the power market are driving significantly lower volumes in products and services, GE Power CEO Russell Stokes said.In January, Flannery signaled he was open to a more far-reaching breakup of the company and floated the idea of spinning off or even selling GE's power, health care and aviation mainstays.Meanwhile, the company is being probed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for issues tied to a legacy long-term-care insurance business.

17,HON,"General Electric (GE) shares turned lower Monday afternoon as a widely followed Wall Street analyst turned more bearish on the stock.X Steve Tusa of JPMorgan said that he sees ""an expedited evolution of outcomes at GE"" given continued underperformance, challenging fundamentals, revelations about the cash hole in its financial  business, and lack of signs of a turnaround.Tusa noted recent management comments on evaluating the conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses. But he sees ""more urgency in the situation"" given the recent moves in GE bonds and, he added, a growing realization that, even if cash improves, the balance sheet does not offer many options for future growth.""In other words, it's either a steady grind in uncertain markets, with risk that things get more extreme in more volatile capital markets, or it's a change in structure to try and de-risk, and simplify the portfolio to grow it in a more focused way in the future, and we see a bit of a mix,"" Tusa wrote in a Feb. 12 note to clients.A low-growth portfolio ""with weak free cash flow and too much leverage"" raises the question of whether an equity raise is possible, Tusa added. He maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and lowered his price target from 16 to 14.Shares of GE fell 0.8% to 14.83 on the stock market today, pulling back from an earlier high of 15.14. The Dow component's stock has halved in value over the past year and sits at its lowest level in more than six years. Dow peers United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM) advanced 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively.

However, such a move would lower leverage, providing safety and optionality, though it could also raise the dividend burden and make a cut more likely, he added.In January, GE countered the idea of a potential equity raise by saying that it has no plans to raise new capital and has already taken steps to shore up its cash position. The company slashed its 24-cent quarterly dividend payout in half  last November.GE rallied at the start of 2018 after a dismal 2017, but the stock resumed its downtrend after the company spoke of an SEC probe and portfolio changes.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Don't Panic, It's Just A Correction: Here's What You Do NowWhen To Sell Stocks — Rules That Help You Protect Profits And Avoid LossesIs It Time To Get Into — Or Out Of — The Stock Market?How To Spot A Major Stock Market Top, The Easy Way

19,HON,"Computer networking equipment maker Netgear (NTGR) plunged on plans to spin off its fast-growing Arlo security-camera business and hold an initial public offering for shares in the firm.San Jose, Calif.-based Netgear announced the move late Tuesday along with its fourth-quarter earnings report, which beat expectations on the bottom line, but missed views on sales.Netgear shares tumbled more than 15% to close at 57.05 on the stock market today. Netgear rose 2% to 67.40 on Tuesday.Netgear expects the IPO of its Arlo Technologies unit to be completed in the second half of 2018. Netgear expects Arlo to issue less than 20% of its common stock in the IPO, with Netgear retaining the remaining interest. Following the IPO, Netgear intends to distribute the shares it holds in Arlo to Netgear shareholders.Netgear says its Arlo devices are the top-selling, do-it-yourself home security cameras in North American retail. Arlo competes with device makers like Canary, Ring, Amazon's (AMZN) Blink and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Nest, as well as smart-home companies like Alarm.com (ALRM), Honeywell (HON) and Vivint.Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said Arlo could easily be valued at $3.5 billion, topping the price Alphabet's Google paid for Nest. Google bought Nest Labs in January 2014 for $3.2 billion. Nest makes smart thermostats, smoke detectors, security cameras and other devices.Arlo has been growing at 100% year over year for each of the past three years, Chowdhry said.""Netgear Arlo should continue to grow over 50% on a revenue base of about $400 million,"" he said in a report to clients Wednesday. ""Conservatively, if we project a revenue growth rate of 50% for fiscal 2018, it gives (Arlo) revenue of about $575 million in fiscal 2018.

20,HON,"The SEC probe into how General Electric (GE) records revenue for servicing industrial equipment raises significant risks for the troubled industrial giant, according to a Wall Street analyst.X GE disclosed during its Jan. 24 quarterly report that it is being investigated by Wall Street's government watchdog. Financial regulators are looking into both what led the company to take a worse-than-feared $6.2 billion charge to its insurance reserves, as well as whether its accounting and controls for long-term service agreements (LTSAs) may have been lacking in any way.The service agreements — a major part of what GE calls ""contract assets"" — are troubling to John Inch of Deutsche Bank. They have become bigger drivers of GE's slowing profits, even though they are drawn in large part from GE's severely challenged power business, he wrote in a Jan. 29 analyst note.""LTSAs potentially comprised 22% of GE's earnings in 2017 — a sizable step-up from 16% in 2016 despite the 2017 collapse of the Power business,"" he noted.That discrepancy highlights issues tied to the value of GE's contract assets. One is that GE often books revenue before it actually gets paid by customers. Another is that the ongoing downturn in the power market heightens the risk that GE may have to revise down the value of its contract assets, Inch said.""If GE were required to revise down the value of its contract assets (which are based on internal company assumptions), this would result in negative drag to the company's book value — coming at a time of rapidly rising GE Industrial debt,"" Inch added. Ultimately, a potential write-down could hurt Wall Street's consensus 2018 EPS guidance of $1 for GE, pushing its share price even lower, he said.Shares of GE slipped 2% to 15.95 stock market today, closing below 16 for the first time since Dec. 1, 2011. Dow industrial peers 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) posted losses of 1.75% and 0.1%, respectively, while Siemens (SIEGY) was flat and Honeywell (HON) gave up 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.GE's contract assets have grown steadily in recent years to roughly $25 billion in 2016, and GE expects that figure to increase to roughly $30 billion in 2018.In recent notes, analysts besides Inch addressed the SEC inquiry into the Boston-based company's contract asset accounting and insurance processes.Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research suggested Jan. 24 that GE's accounting may have been too aggressive, saying more charges or write-downs are possible before GE files its annual 10-K report. Steve Tusa of JPMorgan said Jan. 26 that the probe lends support to concerns around potential shareholder lawsuits.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:How To Choose The Best Online Stock Brokers: Start HereBest Stocks To Buy And WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market Using A Simple Routine

23,HON,"As General Electric (GE) gets ready to kick off a busy week of industrial earnings, the troubled conglomerate on Monday extended its recent slide following an analyst downgrade.X GE and fellow Dow industrial United Technologies (UTX) report results for the fourth quarter Wednesday, with Honeywell (HON) set to follow Friday. Discussion of 2018 outlook is also in the cards.On Monday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch downgraded GE shares to neutral from buy, warning investors that the industrial giant is likely to slash its 2018 outlook when it reports Q4 results.Our outlook ""reflects lower earnings estimates, zero equity value assigned to GE Capital, and lower value assigned to GE Digital initiatives, as we don't see the market paying up for this optionality,"" CNBC quoted BoAML analyst Andrew Obin as saying. ""The relative size of the charge vs. expectations and limited disclosure related to potential off-balance-sheet liabilities once again raise a question about the credibility of the current guidance and capital structure framework.""Here is what to watch when GE and its industrial peers report.Analysts see Q4 earnings tumbling 39% to 28 cents as revenue slips 1% to $32.69 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Shares fell 0.55% to 16.17 on the stock market today, hitting their lowest level since December 2011.GE booked a 13% weekly loss Friday, after announcing it would take a $6.2 billion after-tax charge against fourth-quarter earnings. The charge relates to a legacy insurance portfolio in its finance arm, raising worries that GE's industrial businesses may eventually have to shore up GE Capital with cash.As investors watch for signs of more potential liabilities in the finance unit, they also will tune into commentary around GE's troubled power business. GE Power saw profit plunge 51% in the last quarterly report, amid a severe downturn in the overall market for gas-power generation.GE's 2018 rally has proved to be short-lived, with the stock back at the very bottom of the 30 blue-chip stocks on the Dow Jones industrial average, booking a 7% loss this year so far. GE's status in the Dow industrials may be in doubt.GE CEO John Flannery said Jan. 16 he is open to a more radical breakup than he originally envisaged in November, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for such action. Many GE watchers think not even a big breakup will halt the slump in GE stock, while others believe it could prove transformative.While GE also said Jan. 16 that it expects full-year 2017 earnings to be at the low end of the $1.05-$1.10 range, analysts such as Morningstar's Barbara Noverini are watching whether ""industrial cash from operations may exceed the latest $7 billion forecast"" and whether its cash squeeze will worsen under the Trump tax cuts.The Boston-based company slashed its dividend and 2018 outlook in half in November. Yet its latest woes have analysts like BoAML's Obin worried about further cuts to earnings targets.As GE stock continues to fall, its dividend yield now stands at 3%.IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend.United Technologies should see flat Q4 EPS of $1.56 despite a 5% increase in revenue to $15.40 billion.Shares slid 0.5% to 135.21 Monday afternoon The stock has advanced 9% from a 123.38 cup-with-handle entry in seven weeks, and is up 5% year to date.Analysts will closely watch for updates on Geared Turbo Fan (GTF) production and deliveries, from its Pratt & Whitney division, and on United Tech's recently announced acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL).Pratt's shift from legacy engines toward the GTF has pressured earnings, but the GTF could transform into a significant profit driver over the next decade. It also may give United Tech an edge in the next-generation midsize aircraft, or NMA, market.United Technologies competes against fellow Dow stock GE in jet engines.Besides jet engine makers, United Technologies units include the makers of Otis elevators and Carrier air conditioners. A spinoff of those units could unlock major value, analysts say.Carrier axed more than 200 workers in Indianapolis earlier this month, with those jobs are going to Mexico, where workers make about $3 an hour, Reuters reported.Honeywell should see Q4 EPS rise 6% to $1.84 as revenue grows 7% to $10.69 billion.Shares dipped 0.1% to 158.54, still within buying range from their recent breakout past a 156.80 flat-base entry.Honeywell in December guided Q4 and full-year 2017 EPS to the high end of its previous range, while offering a conservative 2018 outlook. Analysts said that the latter fit the company's pattern of underpromising and overdelivering on financial results.The outlook call showed progress in one of new CEO Darius Adamczyk's top priorities — organic revenue growth, according to Noverini. The company is targeting 2% to 4% organic revenue growth vs. five- and 10-year CAGRs of less than 2%.That will be an area of scrutiny when Honeywell reports, especially for its aero business.Honeywell plans to spin off its home and global distribution business, as well as its transportation system business, by the end of 2018.

24,HON,"General Electric (GE), an icon of American industry and the last remaining component of the original Dow Jones industrial average, now presents investors with a dilemma. At the brink of a potential breakup of the 126-year-old conglomerate, does the widely followed GE stock offer a transformational investment opportunity — or a dead end?X After years of attempts to remake the sprawling company, GE watchers aren't sure. Some say a GE breakup could unleash robust returns, but others see nothing but more damage to its already diminished value.After outlining a major slim-down in November, new GE CEO John Flannery is now open to a breakup, he revealed Jan. 16, and a major activist investor has reportedly pushed for it. But even breakup proponents say there's no quick fix for GE's problems. Indeed, key roadblocks, legal and otherwise, could make sticking together a better bet than a breakup for holders of GE stock.""GE cannot whittle down to three separate entities"" in power, aviation and health care, said Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch. ""Trust me, if it could, it would.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe breakup question comes as investors look for some upside to the beleaguered GE share price, which is at the lowest since December 2011. The company's status as an income stock play, a key reason to hold GE stock, was severely damaged after it halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents a share in November. (The falling stock price, though, raises GE's dividend yield.)IBD'S TAKE: Investing for income alone can be risky if you chase stocks just because of their high dividend yields. Learn how to buy the best dividend stocks that combine yields with earnings growth and a solid share price trend. News of a potential breakup follows a disastrous 2017 for GE stock, which tanked 45% while the Dow Jones industrial average soared 25% and fellow Dow industrials 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX) jumped a respective 32% and 16%. GE's low price could even threaten its status as a Dow component. Other industrial conglomerates like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which also have also taken steps to slim down recently, saw hefty 2017 gains too.But you can't blame GE for not trying. The company is vastly different from what it was a decade ago. It has shed its stake in NBC Universal and most of one-time profit driver GE Capital, as well as its iconic lighting and appliance businesses. Former CEO Jeff Immelt sought to refocus GE on its industrial core and rebrand it as a ""digital industrial"" company, touting its efforts in software and the cloud.But that failed to arrest the decline of GE stock. Immelt stepped down as CEO in June after a 16-year tenure, and General Electric's longtime chief financial officer left in October. Soon after taking over as CEO, Flannery laid out plans in November to unload another $20 billion in assets and focus on the company's aviation, health care and power segments, which together account for most of GE's industrial revenue and profits.Yet the plan pleased almost no one, neither analysts seeking a radical restructuring of its vast asset portfolio nor investors looking for a clear path back to growth. It also left lingering concerns over the flagship power segment, which sells gas turbines and other utility equipment, where plunging profits led to 12,000 GE job cuts in December. Analysts caution that the power market is in the early stages of an extended downturn.The sale of other, smaller businesses had been telegraphed by GE, so Flannery's November announcement produced little sense of a bold vision. Then came the Jan. 16 bombshell that GE was on the hook for $11 billion in charges from its long-term care insurance portfolio and new U.S. tax laws. Management acknowledged more drastic moves might be needed. GE stock ended last week with a 13% loss, marking its worst week since 2009.GE shares fell a fraction Monday ahead of the company's fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday. Some analysts expect GE to slash 2018 earnings guidance again.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said on a conference call. A review ""could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that's what made sense.""For now, GE says everything is on the table, include outright sales and spinoffs. Flannery also floated the idea of staged exits, akin to the merger of GE's oil and gas division into Baker Hughes last July to form Baker Hughes a GE Company (BHGE).Other equity analysts look on GE more favorably. The conglomerate is now an asset story, and GE's well-established aerospace and health care segments would make exceptional stand-alone businesses, Scott Davis of Melius Research told IBD. Those two units alone are worth more than the entire market cap of GE, he says, while accounting for less than 40% of GE's revenue.GE Aviation is ""one of the best aerospace assets out there,"" Davis wrote in a December sum-of-the-parts analysis. He sees significant long-term value in the Leap engine and says aviation should enjoy strong services demand in the next two to three years.Here's What Fidelity Stock-Picker Will Danoff Likes Now – And What He Says About GEAnd General Electric could easily spin off its health care assets to ""unlock value"" in GE stock, similar to Siemens' upcoming IPO of its Healthineers unit, he adds.While Davis calls GE's power business severely challenged due to the rise of renewable energy, he believes it is fixable, with room for positive surprises down the road.Besides, Davis notes, the shareholder bases for GE's core businesses are completely different. For example, power holds appeal as a dividend payer and aviation as a secular growth engine.More immediately, he says Flannery should focus on cutting costs. That includes everything from general corporate expenses to its global research centers and its Predix software platform for the industrial Internet of Things. Many of these he describes as ex-CEO Immelt's ""very expensive investments that have just not panned out.""Since GE's Jan. 16 investor update, Davis has even more conviction in a GE breakup scenario.""The recent news helps confirm the fact that GE is too complex in its current form,"" he said. ""The conglomerate structure incentivizes wasteful and duplicative spending, while stifling the true earnings power of the underlying businesses.""But GE may not be able to take bold action without a feat of financial wizardry. What remains of GE Capital is saddled with $97.5 billion in debt, and the company is on the hook for more than $31 billion in underfunded pension liabilities, Deutsche Bank's Inch said in a Jan. 17 note to clients. GE is unlikely to separate aviation, power and health care into three stand-alone companies, especially since its industrial businesses backstop GE Capital's debt, he argues.""A separation of GE could carry serious ramifications in the bond market on which GE continues to heavily rely"" to fund the pension plan and operations, including the risk of litigation from GE Capital bondholders, he wrote.GE bonds also risk a rapid debt downgrade if General Electric gets rid of cash-generating businesses, which it can ill afford as a company on the hook for billions in pension obligations, he said in an interview.Other risks to GE stock loom. Inch cited billions in potential liability tied to the long-term-care insurance business, an ""inexplicably low"" tax rate that is almost certain to rise over time, a ""completely ineffective board"" that failed its duty to provide oversight and the ""very large, looming threat"" of class-action lawsuits from shareholders who may now feel misled.Before November, ""the company was adamant everything was great, the dividend was safe and secure,"" said Inch. ""I don't see how a company so large sees its earnings and dividends collapse. Somebody in the government, the SEC specifically, should be looking at what happened to get us to this point.""A GE spokeswoman said the company ""continues to work constructively with (government) agents as issues like that come up."" GE has set up a new board committee focused on capital allocation as it explores ""all options"" for its structure and portfolio, and is working through the legal and IP ramifications as part of its rigorous review, she added.For others, the math doesn't support the case for a GE breakup. A sum-of-the-parts analysis by Cowen's Gautam Khanna found GE's breakup value was 11-15 a share, below the current GE stock price near 16, after factoring in the underfunded pension and other debt-like items.""This implies that investors are currently ascribing a 'conglomerate premium' to GE's portfolio,"" Khanna said. In other words, asset sales are unlikely to add value, and a full GE breakup could even destroy value.And that doesn't account for operational synergies among the businesses that would be lost in a breakup of General Electric, he adds.Morningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini also points out that innovations in one GE unit can provide solutions for another. For example, a subsea drilling platform in the oil and gas segment may draw from three other units: turbines from the power segment, distribution networks from energy management and imaging technology created in the health care segment.GE's complicated portfolio makes restructuring likely to be a multiyear slog, depressing earnings growth in the near term, she says. And in the GE dividend cut, the second in a decade, she sees ""a stark reminder that even great portfolios can suffer under the weight of poor capital allocation.""CFRA analyst Jim Corridore, too, points to synergies among General Electric's core units as a reason why a complete GE breakup is unlikely. The ""core R&D"" needed to make a gas turbine or an aircraft engine is basically the same, he says. Additive manufacturing technologies, or 3D printing, also connect its diverse business.""When you build a conglomerate, you build it for a reason,"" he told IBD. ""To break (conglomerates) up just because shareholders don't like the direction of the stock, that's no way to run a business.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:2018 Stock Market Forecasts: Read The Predictions For Top Stocks And IndustriesHow Did This Biotech Stock Become A Dividend Leader?This Top-Performing Dow Titan Is Reaping The Benefits of RestructuringAI In Business: What The Future HoldsHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

27,HON,"General Electric (GE) may have been nudged by a major shareholder to consider a breakup, which the industrial giant signaled Tuesday is an option while announcing a multibillion-dollar hit from a legacy long-term-care insurance business.X Activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management is pushing the 125-year old industrial giant to explore possible sales or spin-outs of its sprawling businesses — including those in the core health and power segments, The New York Post said late Tuesday citing unnamed sources.Trian's founding partner Ed Garden, who also serves on the GE board, reportedly has been meeting with GE chief John Flannery recently. Trian declined to comment to the Post.""We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,"" Flannery said Tuesday in a call with analysts. He added ""separately traded assets really in any one of our units"" was an option. As recently as November, GE had said it would keep its key power, aviation and health care businesses even as it looks to exit several others.Trian has seen its stake in the Dow stock drastically dwindle in value since first making a hefty $2.5 billion investment in 2015, which the Post suggested came at the behest of former CEO Jeff Immelt. Trian bought GE at $26 per share. GE shares dived 4.7% to 17.35 on the stock market today, surrendering the last of their 2018 gains. GE hit 17.26 intraday,  just above a six-year low of 17.25 from Dec. 28.Among GE's industrial conglomerate peers, Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON), which are also slimming down portfolios, were up 3 cents and 0.3%, respectively.

The moves will help restore GE Capital ratios to appropriate levels, he added, noting that the unit plays a key role in helping finance GE's portfolio of industrial products.""At a time when we are moving forward as a company, a charge of this magnitude from a legacy insurance portfolio in runoff for more than a decade is deeply disappointing,"" Flannery, who assumed the role of chief executive in August, said.Deutsche Bank research analyst John Inch flagged GE insurance risks in a Jan. 5 note.

30,HON,"LAS VEGAS — The increase in package deliveries from the growth of e-commerce has brought with it the new problem of ""porch pirates"" — thieves who brazenly steal parcels right off people's front porches.X Now, however, the consumer electronics industry has a solution in security cameras that can help catch criminals and even prevent thefts in progress.Numerous companies, large and small, are at the massive CES consumer technology conference this week showing off their security systems. They range from specialists like Ring and Canary to smart-home experts like Alarm.com (ALRM) and Vivint. Other major players include networking gear maker Netgear (NTGR) and home technologies firm Honeywell (HON).Table stakes for home security cams today are cloud storage of video and smartphone alerts to activity and the ability to scare away crooks with sirens or by talking to them through two-way audio, plus the ability to call the police.In December, e-commerce giant Amazon.com (AMZN) bought Blink, a maker of smart doorbell and porch cameras, adding to Amazon's line of connected home products that includes Echo smart speakers and Fire TV streaming devices.Videos during the holiday season of porch pirates raised awareness of the need for outdoor security cameras, said Don Shulsinger, vice president of sales and marketing for Blink.""We have received a lot of videos of package thefts caught on camera,"" he said. ""It's a big problem for consumers and we see it as a tremendous opportunity.""Blink cameras start at $99 and include free cloud storage.A new trend in the category is the ability for users of home security cameras to share videos of suspicious activity, speeding cars and other occurrences with their neighbors. Ring has the capability in its smartphone app now and Vivint is launching an app called Streety in March.Local television news stations often air videos of burglars and thieves captured on home security cams and the videos have been instrumental in arrests of suspects, Shulsinger said.

36,HON,"Siemens (SIEGY) may ax thousands of workers ahead of the holiday season, becoming the latest conglomerate after General Electric (GE) and Honeywell (HON) to slash costs and restructure a sprawling portfolio in the face of tepid growth.XThe job cuts and redundancies will affect two of the German company's units — power-and-gas and process industries — Bloomberg reported Thursday, citing unidentified sources. Official word of the action, perhaps the biggest since 4,500 jobs were slashed in May 2015, could come in early November.Since taking over in August 2013, Siemens CEO Joe Kaeser has pared back several businesses to focus on the company's industrial core. The segments that are under review or have already been shed include lighting, health care, wind turbines and mobility.That is similar to moves stateside from GE, which saw significant restructuring under former chief Jeff Immelt and has kept on that path under his successor. New CEO John Flannery also reportedly plans aggressive job cuts to cut spending and boost profits. Those measures come as GE stock has plunged nearly 29% year to date.Meanwhile, Honeywell cut thousands of jobs last year as it restructured the company and recently announced plans to spin off two non-core businesses.Shares of Siemens fell 0.4% to 69.58 Thursday as they form a cup-with-handle base with a 71.39 buy point.GE spiked 2% to 23.58 on the stock market today, as investors digested news that it will partner with Apple (AAPL) on mobile apps for factory workers.Honeywell inched up 0.1% to 143.64, with the stock in buying range from a breakout past 140.31.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher.

38,HON,"General Electric (GE) is a leaner, meaner industrial machine under new leadership, but has it been strengthening its free cash flow? Investors may find out when GE reports Friday.XAt the heart of anxiety about GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) is the dividend that springs forth from it. GE currently pays an annualized dividend of 96 cents, translating to a tasty 4.1% yield. That has made this Dow component a favorite blue chip for income investors.But some analysts have warned of a potential dividend cut as GE prepares to report earnings amid major turnover in its corporate leadership.New CEO John Flannery has slashed expenses and trimmed the portfolio since assuming the reins on Aug. 1, though the effect on FCF going forward isn't clear yet. Next month, he is expected to unveil the results of a strategic review that calls for ""thousands of corporate-level job cuts and scaling back of GE's global structure,"" including the closure of three research centers, according to the Wall Street Journal.Analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research see EPS increasing 56% to 50 cents as revenue climbs 9% to $31.92 billion.Organic revenue and industrial orders are two key closely watched metrics. GE must increase attachment rates on service contracts, which can underpin sustained growth in organic revenue, writes Morningstar analyst Barbara Noverini.The industrial giant's profit target of $2 per share for next year is another key issue to watch.

50,HON,"General Electric (GE) needs to boost its target for raising capital, even after its new transportation deal, to hit deleveraging targets, and may also have to consider another dividend cut, according to JPMorgan.GE still must come up with billions of dollars in additional capital to fix its balance sheet, analyst Steve Tusa wrote Tuesday, while reaffirming an underweight rating on GE shares and a year-end price target of 11.""With little available cash flow to naturally de-lever, we don't see how, from a risk mitigation perspective, a company of this size and complexity cannot be seriously considering at least a dividend cut and/or a more aggressive approach to reinforcing its capital base,"" he said.On Wednesday, CEO John Flannery warned there will be no profit growth at its core power business this year, adding that the company will see how its turnaround plans play out to determine the dividend.That may have been interpreted as leaving the door open to another cut, but sources told CNBC Thursday that GE doesn't have plans to cut its payout in 2019.Shares rallied 3% to 14.60 on the stock market today after diving 7% Wednesday on Flannery's bearish profit comments.JPMorgan's analysis followed news that GE's transportation unit will combine with Wabtec (WAB) in an $11.1 billion deal, providing GE with $2.9 billion in cash at the merger's close.But in Tusa's view, GE needs roughly $32 billion in capital, far more than its target of $20 billion in asset sales, to lower its debt-to-adjusted earnings ratio to 2.5.He identified possible sources of capital, saying its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE) could be monetized for roughly $20 billion, while its stake in the merged Wabtec company could yield about $2 billion with other divestitures raking in $4.5 billion or so. But that would still leave a shortfall of $6 billion, Tusa said.Meanwhile, Reuters reported Tuesday that GE is looking for ways to sell off its insurance business, which forced the company to book a steep charge earlier this year.GE had promised in November to shed $20 billion in assets to soothe ratings agencies and find ""their way to get to 2.5x leverage,"" Tusa noted.But he found its leverage ratio is actually worse than generally accepted, estimating it at 4.4x vs. the 3.9x figure that Moody's (MCO) has estimated in its credit ratings.Moody's assumptions on GE's leverage recently ticked up from 3.2x in the fall of 2017, Tusa noted, after the firm included the impact of higher restructuring costs on earnings. Meanwhile, GE's pension obligations remain significant.Against that backdrop, the ""current dividend payout ratio remains too high for the company to deleverage over time simply from running its business,"" Tusa said.The stock bears a 48-cent annual dividend, yielding 3.1%, after the company sliced its dividend payout in half in November.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Boeing Pounces On Lion Air Deal; Stock Soars On China's XiGE Will Offload One Of Its Oldest Businesses In New CEO's Biggest Deal

51,HON,"Third Point, the activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb, reportedly has issued a letter calling for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace unit, which is the industrial conglomerate's largest segment by revenue.Loeb says Honeywell's stock trades at a ""substantial discount"" to its peers and that an aerospace spinoff would produce a ""sustained increase in shareholder value"" of more than $20 billion, according to the New York Times.Shares of Honeywell jumped 3.2% to 134.00 in after-hours trading on the stock market today. The stock remains near record highs after topping first-quarter earnings forecasts last week.Shares of General Electric (GE), which has been under pressure from Trian Fund Management to improve results, edge up 0.1% late to 29.10.

"
52,HON,"General Electric (GE) and fellow industrial giant Honeywell (HON) report first-quarter earnings on Friday. These manufacturing bellwethers' results and comments could give an indication as to whether business' ""animal spirits"" remain frisky five months after Donald Trump's election — and if that's translating into actual stepped-up investment and hiring.Here's a look at what to expect.Wall Street expects General Electric's earnings per share to tumble 19% to 17 cents, with revenue down 4% to $26.405 billion, amid ongoing weakness in the industrial sector.Analysts will also pay close attention to organic industrial orders, which have been sluggish.""Because GE has a broad swath of industrial exposures, it has felt every bump in this industrial recession that we have been in for the past seven quarters,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray said.That slump has been caused in part by low oil prices. The oil crash has hurt GE's oil and gas business, which makes pumps, compressors and other equipment. Sluggish economies in countries outside the U.S., where GE gets more than half its sales, have also challenged the company.Dray, in a research note this month, said to watch for whether GE can put up another organic increase in oil and gas orders, as well as an update on several gas turbine orders that were pushed out from the fourth quarter.Those postponed orders — to Bahrain, Iraq and Africa, where business is more difficult — hurt GE's large, often-reliable power business, where it is working to boost margins at Alstom's power and grid operations. Some of those transactions, management said on the company's fourth-quarter earnings call, would likely go through in the first half of this year.In addition, Dray said, look for more color about GE's recent discussions with Trian Partners, one of GE's biggest shareholders.In March, GE announced in a regulatory filing goals to cut structural costs at its industrial segment — people and facilities are among the biggest structural costs at GE — and tie executive bonuses to the company's ability to hit that savings goal and a profit target for the segment. Those targets, GE said, followed ""intensified"" dialogue with GE's management, Trian had said.There had been reports that Trian wanted CEO Jeffrey Immelt ousted.GE hopes to remedy its difficulties in the oil sector by its merging its oil and gas business with oilfield services outfit Baker Hughes (BHI). Doing so would expand GE's oil offerings and give it more exposure to Baker Hughes' land operations, where oil rigs are coming back online and where a quicker recovery is expected.During the quarter, GE said it would sell its water unit, a move that would help clear the way and finance the Baker Hughes deal.General Electric rose 0.9% to 30.27 in the stock market today. Baker Hughes changed little at 59.50.Analysts expect Honeywell to report EPS of $1.62, up 6%. Revenue is seen slipping 2% to $9.33 billion.Honeywell, which makes jet engines, climate control products and other equipment, in January cut its sales outlook, saying that weaker demand for business jets ""persists"" amid worries about the economy in the U.S. and abroad. The rout in commodities prices, as Bloomberg noted then, also hurt Honeywell's business in Brazil and Russia.RBC said the business jet segment could stabilize this year, and that mergers and acquisitions and the company's market share in aerospace could also be topics in the earnings release and conference call. The company's potential M&A, RBC said, was likely to be ""an international focus unless there is US tax reform.""This earnings season will also be the first for the company's new CEO, Darius Adamczyk.""We anticipate an uneventful quarter, as the company looks to distance itself from its string of operating misses,"" Dray said in the research note.Honeywell is still in range from a 120.12 buy point cleared in early February, but has dropped below its 50-day moving average. On Thursday, shares rose 0.8% to 123.77.RELATED:GE CEO Says ObamaCare Repeal May Make Customers Cautious; Q4 Mixed

58,HON,"It might feel like an age-old sales ploy: ""If you don't act now ... !"" ""Call before midnight ... !"" For many investors, initial public offerings create that same sense of urgency and fear of missing out.Sometimes IPOs live up to the hype, rocketing into the stratosphere without looking back.But the chances are usually higher — as especially seen in years when the market is showing rocky action — that a brand-new IPO will enjoy a brief spurt, then gain little ground or even lose it. As an investor, your odds of booking a big gain are better if you wait.You want an IPO, like any stock, to build a proper base and offer a buy point. Then you want to see a convincing breakout in strong volume.IPOs receive some leniency when it comes to judging fundamentals. Their earnings record might be young. But on the technical side, always hold them to the same chart standards as you would more mature stocks.There will be exceptions, such as Google operator Alphabet in 2004 or China's Home Inns in 2006. But, in general, how do you treat a flat base that's only three weeks long? That may be a key flaw. Is the cup just five weeks old? Again, the risk of a fake-out — rather than a true breakout — is higher than normal, unless the company has truly spectacular fundamentals.Also, most IPO bases are not preceded by a 30% advance, a requirement for all proper bases.The majority of highflying IPOs build valid entry points into their charts. Only 10 of the 151 IPOs in the past year took off within six weeks of their debuts — a period too short in which to form most bases — to post gains of 20% or more.One of the better lessons in patience comes from Sensata Technologies (ST) in the spring of 2010. The Attleboro, Mass., maker of sensors and voltage controllers went public March 11. It nailed a high of 19 on its opening day, then slipped into a consolidation that looked somewhat like a square-box base.A square-box base must gestate for at least four weeks before breaking above the high point in the structure. The decline within the base must also be less than 15%. Technically, Sensata did just that.But a base normally begins with the first down week in the pattern. Sensata didn't post a lower weekly close until the third week of its consolidation (1). When it broke above the would-be buy point of 19.10 on April 14 (2), the consolidation was not yet four weeks old. In other words, no proper base yet.Investors would also have been flying blind with regard to volume. Did the breakout occur on an increase in daily trade of more than 40% above average? There is no way to know in a stock that is so young. It has not yet had time to establish a 50-day moving average for volume, the critical line of demarcation used to gauge volume changes.Sensata's shares ran up 17% through April 23. But the false breakout revealed another trait common to new issues: They sometimes consolidate or form bases near market peaks. The general market turned lower in the last week of April 2010. Sensata rolled over right along with it.IBD's After Market brief story and screen, at the top of the New America page in the IBD Weekly print edition, picked up Sensata's progress shortly after it formed a bottom in its multimonth consolidation. The July 22 After Market noted that it had turned profitable after years of losses and had raised its guidance for the year. The Sept. 23 After Market spotted Sensata's 3% surge in heavy trading, adding that the stock had been forming a base since April (3).Shares moved past the 21.22 buy point in two days of heavy trading after Sensata's Q3 earnings report on Oct. 20 (4). The After Market brief on Oct. 29 (at the time, it was a daily feature) noted the breakout, as well as the stock's 8% surge that day due to its acquisition of Honeywell's (HON) automotive sensor unit (5).By February 2011, Sensata ran up 62% from the 21.22 proper buy point to as high as 34.45, then showed a choppy rise over the next five months. In July, Sensata peaked at 39.63 before diving into a serious correction.In the latest edition of IBD Weekly (May 1, 2017), the After Market feature also shows eight companies that have achieved a gain of 80% or more from their respective offering prices. They include Noble Midstream Partners (NBLX), Ichor (ICHR), FB Financial (FBK) and Airgain (AIRG).

59,HON,"Schlumberger (SLB) is expected to report its first year-over-year revenue growth in nine quarters when it announces first-quarter results Friday, as the rebound in oil prices lifts drilling activity.But the energy sector's recovery has been uneven, and analysts expect the oilfield service provider's earnings to fall 37.5% to 25 cents per share, while revenue is seen rising 7% to $6.98 billion.""It's going to be a tale of two markets"" for Schlumberger international vs. U.S., said Kevin Simpson, managing director at Griffin Securities.In its international segment, which accounts for three-fourths of total revenue, Schlumberger is still likely seeing pricing pressure from larger Middle Eastern customers like government-run Saudi Aramco, which continue to demand discounts, he said.But international activity has hit its low point, Byron Pope, a managing director at Tudor Pickering Holt, who also cautioned that investors should not expect a dramatic recovery any time soon.""The North American landscape cycles up and down faster than international activity,"" he said.

62,HON,"A longtime Wall Street analyst who has watched his bull case for General Electric (GE) unravel fessed up to being wrong on GE stock in a note to clients Monday.""The bears won. The game is over,"" wrote Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has researched industrial equities for 25 years, including prior stints at Barclays and Morgan Stanley.Davis expressed embarrassment at ""being associated as a bull in the worst-performing stock of the year.""Nonetheless, he reaffirmed a buy rating on GE stock and a price target of 27, arguing that a breakup of the iconic company would boost valuations.Shares rose 1.4% to 14.27 on the stock market today, They have been straddling the 50-day moving average since the industrial giant's earnings and revenue beat in April. Among GE's Dow Jones peers, United Technologies (UTX) and 3M (MMM), advanced 0.7%.. Honeywell (HON) rose 7 cents to 144.23. Siemens (SIEGY) climbed 0.4%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHere are the lessons Davis learned from the mistake that he now owns up to:While GE management ""explained away"" degrading contract terms with customers, cash flow was a red flag, Davis said. Margins on industrial free cash flow went from 7.1% in 2015 to 4.8% in 2017.""When down payments decrease, final payments don't match up with product delivery, and receivables grow faster than revenue, there is usually a problem,"" Davis added.Although he sees early signs of improvement in GE's cash flows, a fix for the ""deep"" hole the industrial giant is in will take time.Warning signals included a disproportionate rise in risk tolerance and M&A deals outside GE's historical scope to questionable compensation packages and a dismissive attitude toward those who questioned the company, Davis said.He believes the creation at GE of ""smaller, more focused entities that can build their own cultures"" may repair the problem.The conglomerate's 18-member board under former CEO Jeff Immelt lacked experience in many of the areas where the conglomerate was making a big push — such as software and emerging markets, Davis said. Many also lacked expertise in core GE segments such as power generation, aviation and health care, he added.Now Davis is of the view that ""an unusually large number of board members"" is among the key signs of weak governance, along with lack of diversity and lack of talent in technology, especially software.The $143 million in fees for auditor KPMG can lead to potential conflict of interest and bad behavior, Davis said. It's now clear to him that ""the audit cost alone indicates a company that is way too complex"" — and the company's recent, delayed financial restatement has not allayed that fear. The late filing is another sign of complexity, he added.Davis had a turnaround thesis on GE last year, but later concluded that new CEO John Flannery had ""failed to see the depths of the company's problems and he had too much to fix for any one person to handle.""Davis noted that Flannery has been in charge almost a year now and ""we haven't seen much."" But he also noted that turnarounds that initially looked like they would take two years ended up taking three to five years at other companies.Davis admits his earnings model badly missed the ""the fast degradation in power markets and lack of recovery in oil/gas.""And he had recommended the stock ""while not fully understanding the risk in the insurance business"" and underestimating its complexity.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:GE Dividend Looks Safer On This Good News; Stock Tops Key LevelIf General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?From Boeing To GE, Companies Eye Trump's Decision On Iran Nuclear Deal

63,HON,"General Electric (GE) backed its earnings and cash-flow guidance Friday after reporting strong Q1 results, bolstering prospects for GE's dividend.The industrial conglomerate still sees full-year EPS of $1-$1.07, reaffirming it's tracking to the lower end of the range, as well as adjusted industrial free cash flow of $6 billion-$7 billion in 2018.GE expects to end 2018 with more than $15 billion in cash and doesn't see recent accounting changes impacting its industrial free cash flow, which supports GE's dividend. Cash flow was in line with the company's expectations in Q1 and improved $1.1 billion from a year ago.""Cash is front and center in every conversation,"" CEO John Flannery said in a conference call.Investors, including many who count on GE's dividend for retirement income, have been skittish about the payout since the company halved it last year. Plans to shed cash-generating businesses have added to dividend concerns, and last week's restatement raised worries about the earnings outlook.In fact, Goldman Sachs analysts said earlier this week that a cut to GE's 2018 EPS outlook is ""almost a certainty and could potentially happen as early as 1Q earnings.""Shares rose 3.9% to 14.54 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average for the first time since November, though the stock had been up as much as 7.6% earlier and is still down more than 50% over the past year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The power unit slid 9%, extending a slump.GE saw double-digit profit growth in its core health care and aviation markets in Q1, as well as in renewable energy. But power saw profits tumble 38%. Oil and gas profits fell 30%.Management said the jet-engine market is still strong, benefiting from strong growth in both domestic and international markets. The company is on track to deliver 1,100 to 1,200 next-generation Leap engines in 2018, although currently deliveries are ""about 70 units behind.""The aviation segment in particular is in the spotlight, after a jet engine made by GE's joint venture with Snecma blew apart in midair Tuesday, forcing a Southwest Airlines (LUV) flight to make an emergency landing and killing one passenger.Later Friday, the engine joint venture, CFM International, recommended expanded inspections of engines similar to one involved in the Southwest accident. The FAA is also expected to call for emergency inspection of CFM56-7B engines.GE sees the power market trending to less than 30 gigawatts for the next several years, further lowering its own expectations, as energy efficiency and growth in renewable energy have driven lower demand for coal- and gas-fired power plants.But Flannery said he sees ""green shoots"" as GE adjusts to the power market and improves execution. Those steps include plans for $1 billion in cost cuts this year, new leadership team in the supply chain, and exits from noncore power assets.Meanwhile, Honeywell's (HON) EPS rose 17.5% to $1.95, beating views by 6 cents, as revenue climbed 9.5% to $10.39 billion, above estimates of $9.94 billion.The company sees full-year EPS of $7.85-$8.05 on revenue of $42.7 billion-$43.5 billion.

Meanwhile, a drop in commodities prices has crimped orders in emerging markets such as Russia and Brazil. Honeywell supplies engines for such aircraft as the Bombardier Inc. Learjet 70 and Embraer (ERJ) Legacy 450.Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek told analysts in December that sales to business-jet manufacturers would continue to decline this year and begin to recover in late 2018 and 2019 when more new aircraft models hit the market.Honeywell shares ticked up 0.4% to close at 118.42 Friday. Honeywell rose 20% during the 12 months ending Thursday, in line with the increase in the S&P 500 Index.In the fourth quarter, adjusted earnings rose to $1.74 a share, matching the average of analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Total sales were little changed at $9.99 billion, trailing analysts' estimates of $10.1 billion. Aerospace revenue dropped 8% to $3.67 billion.Profit margins at Honeywell's materials and technologies group, which contains energy-related businesses, widened by more than 5 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Sales were up 5% after adjusting for items such as last year's spinoff of a resins and chemicals operation.Honeywell has benefited from oil prices stabilizing around $50 a barrel, which has freed up projects that had been delayed. Natural gas prices in the fourth quarter averaged $3.17 per million British thermal units, almost a dollar more than a year earlier. Honeywell sells products such as catalysts that improve refining efficiency and filters for natural gas.For the current quarter, Honeywell forecast earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.64, which at the midpoint is the same as analysts' estimates.

72,HON,"United Technologies (UTX) predicted Wednesday its Pratt & Whitney unit will ramp up deliveries of its latest jet engine this year, as production problems come under control.Delays with the new geared turbofan prompted Qatar Airways to cancel an order last year for Airbus (EADSY) A320neo jets.United Tech earlier had cut its 2016 forecast for turbofan deliveries to 150 from 200. On Wednesday, the company said it sees 2017 deliveries of 350-400, including about 50 spares.The industrial conglomerate also reported fourth-quarter earnings rose 13.9% to $1.56 a share, in line with Wall Street forecasts, as revenue rose 2.5% to $14.66 billion, missing views for $14.7 billion.Sales at Pratt & Whitney rose nearly 4% to $3.99 billion. Sales at its Otis elevator unit dipped 1% to $3.06 billion. Sales at the climate, control and security business rose 3% to $4.25 billion. Aerospace systems sales grew 4% to $3.6 billion.The company also backed its full-year 2017 EPS view of $6.30-$6.60, with the midpoint below consensus for $6.56, on revenue of $57.5 billion-$59 billion,  also light vs. Wall Street views for $58.86 billion.United Tech said it plans to buy back $3.5 billion in shares this year and is setting aside $1 billion-$2 billion for acquisitions.""Despite an uncertain global macro environment, our growing aerospace backlog and strategic investments in the commercial businesses position us well to generate higher organic growth in 2017,"" Chief Executive Officer Gregory Hayes said in a statement.Shares fell 0.6% to 110.95 on the stock market today, staying in buy range and finding support at their 50-day line after undercutting both key points intraday.In the latter part of last year, other industrials, like Dover (DOV), Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG), gave dim forecasts about the months to come.Last week, General Electric (GE) reported fourth-quarter results that offered up more of the same: slow growth globally, volatility, an oversupplied oil & gas sector that has less need for GE's oil-related equipment. GE, however, said it remained more upbeat heading into this year.When asked about how potential regulatory changes under the new administration might affect its businesses, CEO Jeff Immelt said they ""could see some caution"" over the Affordable Care Act, which the GOP has been eager to dismantle, from customers who buy medical equipment from its health care division.GE shares were up 1.2% Wednesday.RELATED:Trump Claims Twitter Win On Indiana Jobs; Carrier Stresses State IncentivesTrump Touts Carrier Deal, Says Companies Leaving U.S. Face 'Consequences'United Technologies, Costco Upgraded; Shale Producers Mixed

73,HON,"General Electric (GE) reports fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, after several months of lamenting an environment marked by ""slow growth.""And while CEO Jeff Immelt in October said the industrial giant's orders and organic growth would pick up steam in the fourth quarter, analysts remain cautious.""GE had a rough 2016 and 4Q is an important quarter to show order stability, margin gains, and cash flow improvement,"" Barclays analyst Scott Davis said in a research note, also predicting sequential improvement in 2017.Wall Street expects fourth-quarter earnings per share to fall 11.5% to 46 cents, with revenue dipping 0.5% to $33.66 billion.The company's power and renewables segments are expected to be strong, while transportation and oil & gas — which are still shaking off the effects of a global commodity oversupply — are expected to be weaker, Credit Suisse said in a recent research note.And despite GE's attempts to cut costs, strip back its finance operations to focus on its core industrial segments as well as become more of an industrial analytics firm, Credit Suisse sees earnings lagging those of its peers due to ""sluggish"" orders while consensus forecasts for the first half of the year look too high.But, as with other sectors, investors could be more focused on any guidance. The energy sector has rallied as crude prices recovered late last year, and investors will look for an update on GE's prospects in that market.In October, GE and Baker Hughes (BHI) in October announced a deal to combine GE's oil and gas operations with the oilfield services giant, whose merger with Halliburton (HAL) was called off earlier in the year due to antitrust concerns. Halliburton has said it's willing to sacrifice market share to boost profits as discounts offered during the oil bust are rolled back.Meanwhile, the U.S. oil-rig count has shot up and shale companies are ramping up 2017 exploration and production budgets, boosting demand for oilfield services and equipment.GE shares were down 0.1% at 31.21 on the stock market today. The stock broke out last month but dropped below its 31.59 entry last week. A strong Q4 report could send GE back in buying range.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE's Q4 report kicks off big industrial earnings and will come after a Q3 earnings season in which a variety of industrials offered cloudier forecasts. Honeywell (HON), citing in part weakness in aerospace, cut its sales and profit outlook, while Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) warned of a weaker economy.The election sent industrials surging on expectations of an infrastructure spending package and corporate tax cuts. But the market appears to be tiring of its fling with President-elect Donald Trump, and Q4 results will test the sentiment of new shareholders.""Are the new owners in it just for the Trump infrastructure/tax trade and likely to jump at the first sign of weakness?"" Barclays analyst Davis wrote. ""Are they prepared for what will likely be another very soft quarter?""He said investors are likely to ignore short-term struggles and look ahead toward the second half of the year, when the rebound in oil and gas could strengthen and Trump's policy proposals become clearer either at that time or later.""We think 2017 is a year to buy into any dips,"" Davis said, ""and we do expect some.""RELATED:Apple, General Electric, Microsoft Lead Field In Stock Buybacks

75,HON,"As Donald Trump assumes the presidency and the GOP Congress works to kill ObamaCare, General Electric (GE) CEO Jeff Immelt said Friday that some customers could become more cautious.Still, the industrial conglomerate sees better prospects for its healthcare business internationally as the middle class grows in other nations.""If I took it by segment, the Affordable Care Act is getting the most attention in the media and by our customers,"" Immelt said on a conference call after reporting mixed Q4 results. ""I think you could see some caution around the Affordable Care Act as you go forward. We haven't really seen that much. But that could happen.""GE also said it was more upbeat about the U.S. economy and sees ""strengthening"" in Europe, while oil-related markets are ""stabilizing,"" helped by OPEC's deal to curb oil production.But Q4 offered up a lot of what Wall Street had heard for much of 2016: slow growth, volatility and ongoing weakness in the oil sector. And some on the Street may have been concerned about sales in the company's reliable power segment.Organic revenue and orders, two much-watched figures, fell 1% and 3%, respectively. Oil and gas revenue and transportation revenue — which respectively sank 22% and 23% in Q4 — have weighed on the industrial giant's results due weaker commodity demand.""It's largely a repeat of what we heard in the previous several quarters in 2016,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said.Earnings per share fell 12% to 46 cents, matching estimates. Revenue slipped 2% to $33.1 billion, missing forecasts for $33.63 billion. GE backed its 2017 organic growth target of 3%-5%.Aviation revenue rose 7%, as air carriers update their fleets with planes containing GE's engines. Renewable energy revenue jumped 29%. Healthcare revenue increased 3%. Power systems revenue rose 20%.""I think there's some concern more in that power business that sales were weaker than expected,"" Windau said. ""Some of those orders or shipments got pushed out into 2017.""GE this week said it secured more than $1.4 billion in orders from the Iraqi government to develop power plants.Shares fell 2.2% to 30.53 on the stock market today, dropping below their 200-day line and slipping further below a buy point of 31.59 after breaking out last month.General Electric in recent years has tried to focus more on its industrial roots — and become more of a tech company. GE's oil and gas unit will merge with oilfield services provider Baker Hughes (BHI) this year.Baker Hughes edged up 2 cents to 61.98. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), which also reported results Friday, fell 0.8%, and Halliburton (HAL) climbed 2% ahead of its report Monday.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has attempted to turn more into a tech company, with a big, long-term focus on the so-called Industrial Internet. GE, like other industrials, had warned of a slow-growth environment due to the rout in commodity prices and a sluggish global economy. Several big industrial companies will follow GE's report next week.United Technologies (UTX) reports Q4 results early Wednesday: EPS up 14% to $1.56 with revenue essentially flat at $14.7 billion. Caterpillar (CAT) reports early Thursday: EPS down 11% to 66 cents as revenue slides 10.8% to $9.84 billion. Honeywell (HON) reports early next Friday: EPS up 10% to $1.74 with revenue up 1.7% to $10.15 billion.Some analysts say investors could be focused more on how GE and other industrials might do in the second half of this year and beyond, when oil and commodity prices may rebound more strongly and policies under the incoming Trump administration become more concrete.""These things, from an economic perspective, are taking time to work their way through the system,"" Windau said.RELATED:General Electric Stock Near Buy Zone Ahead Of Q4 Report

78,HON,"General Electric (GE) plans to expand in gene therapy with prefabricated viral drug factories that can quickly scale up manufacturing to reach more patients and lower costs.XGE's health care unit announced that the new KUBio ""ready-to-run factory-in-a-box"" can pump out viral vector-based vaccines, oncolytic viruses to treat cancer, and gene and cell therapies faster than a traditional, stick-built facility. If demand for a particular therapy proves strong, the factory can expand to increase output.This allows drug manufacturers to quickly adapt to market conditions, GE Healthcare said in a news release.Shares popped 3.5% to finish at 13.79 on the stock market today. GE also benefited from reports of a potential sale for its Jenbacher gas-engine unit. Bloomberg said the deal with power company Cummins (CMI) and a private equity firm could value the Austrian unit for more than $3 billion– $1 billion more than reports in January indicated. GE is targeting $20 billion in asset sales as it battles a slump in profits.Dow Jones industrial average peers also closed higher; United Technologies (UTX) 0.6% and 3M (MMM) 1.1%. Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) both rose 1.3%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe popularity of viral vectors, which use modified viruses to carry healthy genetic code into sick target cells, is on the increase.There are more than 700 viral vector-based therapies in clinical trials, GE's $18 billion healthcare business said. Several treatments — such as GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) Strimvelis, Novartis's (NVS) Kymriah and Kite Pharma-Gilead Sciences' (GILD) Yescarta — already have received regulatory approvals.""The market is moving towards more targeted therapies designed for smaller patient populations,"" Olivier Loeillot, a GE general manager, said in Tuesday's statement. But existing large-scale factories are not ideal for drug manufacturers looking to produce small batches of therapies, he added.Additionally, the KUBio factories can help drug makers to lower costs.Many advanced drug candidates for treating Ebola — the deadly West African outbreak —also use viral vector technology. The factory-in-a-box solution can address challenges tied to producing vaccines, which are critical to people around the world but generate low revenue for their manufacturers, the company says.GE looks to grow in the gene therapy business as it battles a severe downturn in its gas-turbine and power-plant business.  The power unit is likely to show a hit when first-quarter results come out Friday.Gene therapy is a risky but promising technique that may one day  allow doctors to treat disorders without conventional drugs or surgery, according to the National Institutes of Health.

79,HON,"General Electric (GE) stock was hit yet again Monday after a Wall Street analyst said its restated financials have put its 2018 profit forecast at risk.Research by Goldman Sachs said the industrial giant's earnings are almost certain to be slashed due to the changes.

81,HON,"General Electric (GE) could be left out in the cold while other U.S. companies, including fellow industrial conglomerates, benefit from a tax windfall, according to an analyst.X The GOP tax package that President Trump signed into law Friday cuts the current corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. But Deutsche Bank says GE could end up a ""significant net loser"" because the plan also calls for a 15.5% repatriation rate on earnings held offshore as cash, and 8% if overseas profits are invested in nonliquid assets, such as plants and equipment. The repatriation tax would be mandatory.As a result, GE could end up owing up to $9 billion in new taxes, or an average of $1.1 billion for the next eight years, on $82 billion in foreign earnings reinvested abroad, according to Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch.""GE's substantial tax bill would come at a difficult time for the company given GE's ongoing cash squeeze from weak cash generation that recently forced the company to cut its dividend in half,"" Inch wrote Dec. 20.GE's quarterly dividend is now 12 cents a share, a 50% cut, allowing the company to save about $4 billion a year.Additionally, Inch noted, $4.5 billion of GE's overseas cash hoard, as of Sept. 30, was held in countries that may restrict or limit the return of funds.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column every day to stay on top of the market direction. As long as the current ""confirmed uptrend"" — the equivalent of a green light — stays in place, leading stocks breaking above a buy point may have the wind at their backs.GE has long enjoyed an ultralow tax rate, the result of ""aggressive"" tax planning that leverages both GE's position as a multinational and GE Capital's ability to move funds around the world for tax advantages, the Deutsche Bank note added.This year, the firm forecasts GE Industrial's tax rate to be less than 5%. By comparison, GE's multi-industry peers on average pay rates from the mid- to high 20s.Companies had held off on paying income taxes on foreign earnings until those funds are returned, or repatriated, to the U.S. The 35% domestic rate has led several companies to stockpile profits abroad, leading to charges of tax avoidance.Several profitable U.S. companies paid an effective tax rate far less than 35% between 2008 and 2015, due to the tax loopholes and special breaks they enjoy, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.In fact, 18 companies, including GE, Priceline (PCLN) and PG&E (PCG), paid no federal income taxes at all over that eight-year period despite consistently churning out profits, it added.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHere Are The Latest Stocks Joining The Bitcoin FrenzyTrump Tax Package Seen Boosting These Players In Info Tech

It first crossed the entry Dec. 18, before pulling back to its 50-day moving average, where it found support. The iPhone maker's relative strength line, however, has been flat to lower.Microsoft gained 2% to a new high. KeyBanc Capital Markets raised its price target to 106 from 94 and kept an overweight rating, citing prospects for Microsoft's artificial intelligence products and initiatives.Gold miners, retail and energy were among the biggest sector fund gainers in the stock market today.

It advanced 7% from an early September bounce off the line to its Dec. 4 intraday high. SPLV was featured in this ETF column, which was published Sept. 27.The fund, which launched in May 2011, has gathered $7.5 billion in assets. It tracks the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index, which comprises the 100 least volatile S&P 500 stocks over the past 12 months. The index also has the ability to respond dynamically to market conditions. So unlike some other low volatility indexes, it can move into better-performing sectors when deemed necessary.Financials account for the biggest sector weighting at nearly 21% of assets. Utilities make up about 20%, industrials 19%, and information technology and consumer staples roughly 10% each. The top 10 holdings as of Jan. 10 included Honeywell International (HON), Coca-Cola, Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), PepsiCo (PEP) and Republic Services (RSG).Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, owned Coca-Cola as one of its biggest positions in Q3. Other Buffett names in the ETF include American Express (AXP), U.S. Bancorp (USB), Moody's (MCO), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Visa (V).IBD'S TAKE: Making money catching ETF uptrends requires knowledge about how to read charts. You can learn how at IBD University.Buffett tends to own some big dividend payers. For instance, Coca-Cola yields an annualized 3.2%, P&G offers 3.1%. SPLV's 12-month dividend is just north of 2%, above the S&P 500's average 1.7% payout. And it has a dividend growth rate of 7% vs. SPDR S&P 500 (SPY)'s 12%.SPLV is up 0.2% this year through Jan. 10, lagging the S&P 500's 2.9% gain. Its average annual returns of 10.2% and 13.6% over the past three and five years also slightly trail the benchmark index, which returned a respective 12.7% and 15.7%.Generally, SPLV tends to perform better if the stock market declines and low-volatility stocks fall less than growth stocks. It carries a 0.25% expense ratio.Thursday's pick, Robo Global Robotics & Automation (ROBO), hit a new high but remains in a buy zone from a 42.69 flat-base entry.

85,HON,"Honeywell (HON) set a conservative 2018 profit target Wednesday, but it was seen as part of a pattern of underpromising and overdelivering.X The industrial giant expects earnings of $7.55-$7.80 per share in 2018, with the midpoint 8 cents below the consensus view of $7.76, according to Zacks Investment Research. Management also see organic sales growth of 2%-4% in 2018.""Our take is that Honeywell typically sets a low bar for its outlook, building in some conservativeness and opportunity for beats during the course of the year,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray wrote in a Wednesday note. But one area of scrutiny, he added, would be ""aero's modest 1% to 3% organic sales growth target for 2018.""Honeywell also guided fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 EPS to the high end of its previous range, at $1.84 and $7.10 (excluding separation costs) respectively, matching consensus views.It also raised its outlook for Q4 sales growth to 9% from 5%-7%, better than the Zacks view for 5% growth, and full-year sales are now seen at $40.6 billion, up from a prior view of $40.2 billion-$40.4 billion, but still below consensus for $40.11 billion.Shares of Honeywell opened lower before popping 1.3% to 155.75 in early trade on the stock market today.

87,HON,"General Electric's (GE) GE Digital business and Schindler Group announced a strategic alliance under which Swiss-based Schindler will use GE's Predix software for digital innovations in ""smart buildings.""Schindler will use GE's digital industrial operating system and software, including advanced analytics, to monitor and analyze data from its connected elevators and escalators, which it said are used by more than 1 billion people daily.Specifically, the Predix-based digital platform will enable Schindler personnel to identify, analyze and resolve possible service issues before they happen, reducing and eliminating downtime and improving the customer experience.The companies did not release financial details of the accord.GE Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said last month he sees the company's digital business, including software and its open-source Predix system, generating about $7 billion in revenue this year. It is positioning itself as a digital industrial firm that can compete head-on with software giant Microsoft (MSFT) and traditional rivals like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON).GE said earlier that it's partnered with AT&T (T), Verizon Communications (VZ), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and about 30 others, and it expects its digital industrial revenue to more than double to $15 billion by 2020, up from an earlier estimate of about $10 billion.On June 29, GE said it had received approval of its request to the federal Financial Stability Oversight Council to removed its designation as a non-bank Systemically Important Financial Institution. Removing the too-big-to-fail designation means GE frees itself from the tight rules imposed on such institutions.The government removed the label after GE shed virtually all of its financial business. On July 1, the industrial conglomerate said it had completed the sale of GE Asset Management, its investment management arm, to State Street (STT), with the proceeds to be deposited into the GE Pension Trust to pay plan benefits.GE shares closed up 0.9% at 31.74 in the stock market today.

89,HON,"Shares of General Electric (GE) and other big U.S. industrials fell  Friday amid concerns about the strong dollar and the possible effect on trade from Britain's vote to leave the European Union.General Electric stock fell 4.3% to 29.82 in the stock market today, undercutting the 50-day moving average. Aircraft engine, elevators and heating and cooling systems maker United Technologies (UTX) slid 3.4% to 98.89.Aerospace and defense giant Boeing (BA) dropped 5.3%, and automotive and aerospace supplier Honeywell (HON) lost 3.7%. 3M (MMM), a leading provider of tapes, adhesives, medical items and office supplies among other products, was off 2.9%.Automakers were also slammed amid the market turmoil. General Motors (GM) slid 4.9, Ford Motor (F) was down 6.6%, Toyota Motor (TM) reversed 5.45% and Volkswagen (VLKAY) skidded 6.85% to 28.71.Both the euro and the pound plunged vs. the dollar, with the latter falling to a 30-year low after hitting a six-month high earlier Thursday, and the euro suffering its worst decline on record. Prior to the Brexit referendum, U.S. manufacturers were already grappling with the effects of a strong dollar, which makes their goods more expensive overseas. Many economists are predicting a U.K. recession, with Europe barely growing in the near term. General Electric early Thursday had for the first time provided details of its strategy to transform into a digital industrial company, and its plan to make its Predix industrial operating system the platform of choice for manufacturers around the globe.Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said at an investor event in Silicon Valley that he sees the company's digital business, including software and its Predix OS, generating about $7 billion in revenue this year and $15 billion by 2020. That's up from an earlier estimate of $10 billion.GE announced Thursday that Cerberus Capital is bidding for its French consumer finance business, GE Money Bank. Analysts said that bid could put GE in position to free itself of the designation of being a Systematically Important Financial Institution, or SIFI, which imposes stringent regulations.The confusion in global markets after Britain's vote to exit the EU could put that deal in less favorable light for Cerberus. GE's stock has been forming a first-stage flat base for about two months, and that base was still intact Friday, although its share price slid toward the bottom of that range Friday.

90,HON,"The weakest pound in 31 years hasn't totally buried U.K. companies' pursuit of acquisitions abroad.In the first post-Brexit transaction involving a U.K. acquirer, Melrose Industries agreed to buy U.S. ventilation-fan maker Nortek (NTK) for $2.8 billion, betting that dollar-profits from the business and operational improvements will make up for a deal made more expensive by the pound's slump.Melrose, which hedged the U.K. currency just before announcing the transaction, said Nortek dollars will be converted back to sterling. And there's plenty of scope for expansion, Chief Financial Officer Geoff Martin said in an interview Wednesday.Shares of Melrose, which plans to raise about 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in a rights offering, jumped in London. Nortek spiked 39% to 87 on the stock market today.The British turnaround specialist was in need of a deal after selling electric metering maker Elster to Honeywell International (HON) a year ago for $5.1 billion. Having returned 2.8 billion pounds to investors, Melrose was able to count on their support to buy Nortek amid global financial turmoil following the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, Martin said.""If you keep giving shareholders a 30% internal rate of return, they'll keep giving you money to do more, and that's exactly what they've done here,"" the CFO said.Melrose is building a new portfolio after selling assets including Elster, Dynacast and McKechnie Group. Before the Nortek deal, Melrose's one remaining investment was Brush, once part of FKI that Melrose bought for 1 billion pounds in 2008.""We've been smaller than we like to be for a little while, looking for a deal,"" Martin said by phone. While the Birmingham, England-based company's focus is on the completing the Nortek purchase, ""there will be future deals,"" he said.Shareholders of Nortek will receive $86 a share in cash under the terms of the reverse takeover to be carried out by a specially-created subsidiary, Melrose said in a statement earlier on Wednesday. The price is 38% above Tuesday's closing level for Providence, R.I.-based Nortek, implying an equity value of $1.4 billion.Melrose is betting a strengthening of the U.S. economy will boost the construction sector, helping Nortek's sales of kitchen range hoods, air conditioning and home-security systems. In keeping with its ""buy, improve, sell"" strategy for investments focused on industrial companies, Melrose said it's identified opportunities to enhance the supply chain and information technology systems at Nortek, lighten the debt burden as well as making more use of a new plant in Mexico.Nortek shareholders holding about 68.7% of the company are backing the deal, according to the statement. Closing the transaction depends on Melrose getting more than half of outstanding shares in Nortek.Nomura International is the lead adviser on the deal. JPMorgan Cazenove and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are also advising Melrose, as well as coordinating the rights offering with Investec Bank and Evercore International Partners.

92,HON,"The power division of General Electric (GE) will slash roughly 12,000 jobs globally as the industrial conglomerate looks to take out $3.5 billion in overall structural costs by 2018. One billion dollars is targeted to come from GE Power.X The core, but deeply troubled, GE unit has been hard hit by weak demand for gas turbines and coal-fire plants. Traditional power markets, including gas and coal, are challenged by ""overcapacity, lower utilization, fewer outages, an increase in steam plant retirements, and overall growth in renewables,"" GE said in a statement Thursday.Russell Stokes, CEO of GE Power, described the decision as a ""painful but necessary"" one that would help drive a turnaround in margins and cash flow for 2019 and beyond.But in the short term, Stokes expects market challenges to continue.

Boom's aircraft is expected to enter service in the mid-2020s.The Concorde, which was made by predecessors to BAE Systems and Airbus, was retired in 2003 in part because it wasn't able to turn a profit, and Air Lease (AL) CEO John Plueger said in June that it's hard to see airlines investing in the technology in the next 15 to 20 years due to cost concerns.By then, however, there could be room in the aviation market for even faster commercial jets.Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg told CNBC in June that hypersonic jets, which fly five times the speed of sound, would be commercially available in the ""next decade or two."" But he said the business case of a hypersonic jet still need to be proved.Shares of Boeing were down 0.9% at 275.54 on the stock market today, after climbing 2.4% Monday.

96,HON,"General Electric (GE) stock should be avoided ahead of two key upcoming events and a further cut may come for the already halved GE dividend, according to Cowen.When GE reports first-quarter results April 20, an earnings miss ""appears probable,"" Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna wrote in a note to clients Wednesday. He expects the conglomerate's largest Q1 profit declines will come from the power and transportation businesses. He also sees GE's planned accounting restatement adding pressure to ""this 'show me' stock.""GE's $1.00-1.07 adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 excludes $3.2 billion of pension and $2.5 billion of restructuring expenses, a 55-cent ""hit"" to GAAP EPS, Khanna said. And GE's plan to sell $20 billion of assets may ""siphon"" another 10 cents or so from annual EPS. So Khanna finds GE's GAAP earnings base and free cash flow to be closer to less than 50 cents a share.He warned: ""This lower, truer EPS base partly explains why we don't believe the $0.48/year dividend is safe unless 'contract assets' convert to cash on a net basis, and/or the power market rebounds sharply and soon.""GE's so-called contract assets reflect revenues that GE books on long-term equipment and service contracts before it gets the cash in hand.

97,HON,"In a rare move, two top proxy advisory firms recommended General Electric (GE) shareholders reject the industrial giant's longtime auditor, citing independence and performance issues.Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) urged voting down KPMG, ""in light of concerns about GE's previously undisclosed liabilities and accounting practices at GE that have prompted an SEC investigation."" Glass, Lewis & Co. made a similar call two days earlier, according to the Wall Street Journal.GE and KPMG did not immediately respond to the Journal's request for comment.In its 2018 proxy statement, General Electric says it benefits from ""higher audit quality"" due to KPMG's familiarity with its vast portfolio. The auditing giant has worked with GE since 1909. It's performing roughly 1,400 statutory audits in some 90 countries.""Bringing on a new auditor requires a significant time commitment that could distract from management's focus on financial reporting and internal controls,"" GE notes in its proxy.

But GE management said the process ""is taking more time than we originally expected"" to finalize, according to a letter to shareholders on Wednesday.GE previously estimated 2016 EPS would be lower by 13 cents and 2017 EPS would be lower by 16 cents after adopting the new accounting standard.It also has said its adoption of the new standard ""is completely independent of the SEC investigation"" of its revenue recognition related to long-term service agreements.Shares of the Dow Jones industrial average component rose 1.1% to 13.43 on the stock market today.

The wing and two gas-fueled engines will be replaced with a long, skinny wing embedded with 14 electric motors.NASA Administrator Charles Bolden said the X-57 is nicknamed ""Maxwell,"" for Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, who did work in electromagnetism. Similarly, Tesla Motors is named for electrical engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla, whose design for an electric motor was adapted for the Tesla Roadster.NASA hopes the X-57 will demonstrate ""advanced technologies to reduce fuel use, emissions and noise, and thus accelerate their introduction into the market place.""Researchers have been looking at ways to use hydrogen cells and electric power plants in place of fuel-burning engines.The Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is working on a hybrid drone with Honeywell (HON) and Rolls-Royce.The commercial sector is looking at electric planes as well.

103,HON,"General Electric (GE) doesn't just make jet engines, wind turbines and locomotives anymore. It now makes data centers -- that also happen to power airplanes, harness wind energy and ride the rails.Connecting these machines is a GE software platform that could underpin an Industrial Internet ecosystem resembling Apple's (AAPL) intertwining operating system, computers, phones, app store and music store.""All of our products are becoming data centers,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Bill Ruh told IBD in an interview.The iconic 124-year-old conglomerate, long synonymous with light bulbs and washing machines, is looking more like a tech company. As it shrinks its finance unit and sells its home appliance business, GE is also reinventing itself as a digital industrial company that could compete head-on with tech stalwarts like Microsoft (MSFT), plus traditional rivals like Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) seeking to capitalize on the Industrial Internet.GE's transformation goes deep. The company is moving its corporate headquarters from Fairfield, Conn., to Boston, due in part to its need for ""technologically diverse"" talent. It also launched an ad campaign earlier this year to rebrand GE as ""The digital company. That's also an industrial company.""""There are still many people who think GE is locked in a time warp of what slow industrial companies used to be,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray. ""GE is breaking all of those molds.""GE estimates the Industrial Internet could be a $225 billion market by 2020, topping the $206 billion seen in the enterprise cloud computing market by then and the $170 billion in the consumer Internet of Things.While the Internet of Things includes connected refrigerators that can buy more milk online before it runs out, the Industrial Internet envisions machines that tell operators how to improve efficiency or fix a malfunction, potentially saving companies billions of dollars a year.For example, aircraft engines that GE makes with partner Snecma have sensors that measure vibration, temperature, heat, noise and emissions particles, Dray noted. They could send information while in flight to command centers, where the data are analyzed before the plane lands.If a fuel nozzle needs replacing, a maintenance team can wait for the plane at the destination airport with a new one. Similar capabilities exist on other equipment, like power generators and trains. Factories could also adjust output to match market demand or eventually operate totally autonomously.GE's Ruh said the company puts a data center at the heart of its locomotives, regulating operations like communications, safety and maintenance.""It's not a bolt-on,"" he said. ""It's a rethink of the products going forward.""In addition to building connected products, GE's tech push includes building virtual doppelgangers.GE says its engineers and scientists are creating ""digital twins"" of every machine delivered to customers that can continuously learn from their physical counterparts through embedded sensors, allowing GE to analyze the health of each machine without disrupting operations.And analyzing the flood of data GE products generate also represents an additional revenue opportunity in services. Last year, Japanese construction and mining equipment giant Komatsu (KMTUY) partnered with GE for Big Data analysis services for mining projects.GE Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt said at GE's Minds+Machines developers conference last September that GE and other industrial heavyweights are evolving into hybrid technology/manufacturing companies.""If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company,"" Immelt said at the event.A cornerstone of the new GE is its Predix cloud-based operating system, which has an open architecture that allows industrial equipment customers to build on it. Ruh believes GE's Predix operating system software can become the standard for big manufacturers, as they continue to add intelligence to their equipment.""We think Predix can be embedded in every industrial machine that’s sold,"" he said.In February, GE launched an open-source digital industrial network, which includes dozens of global companies such as AT&T (T), Intel (INTC), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Verizon Communications (VZ), Japanese telecom giant Softbank (SFTBY), India's Tata Consultancy Services and China Telecom (CHA), among others.The list of partners has grown and includes more tech names. GE Digital recently teamed up with database software giant Oracle (ORCL) to develop and consolidate complementary offerings for the Industrial Internet.In April, GE released the first commercially available applications running on Predix. The Asset Performance Management suite includes a way to monitor equipment health, as well as a function designed to predict maintenance issues. Another feature to come out later this year is meant to help users manage the service life of their assets, maintenance costs and risk.Software is still a small part of GE's business -- about $6 billion of its $130 billion in annual sales. But it's growing at a 20% a year clip, Immelt said, and he's aiming for $10 billion in software sales by 2020, which would make GE one of the world's largest software vendors, and perhaps the largest industrial software maker.So does GE want to be the Microsoft of the Industrial Internet, with its Predix platform becoming as ubiquitous on large equipment as Windows is on PCs? ""Absolutely,"" Rue said.But Microsoft may actually want to be the Microsoft of the Industrial Internet. In April, CEO Satya Nadella spoke at Germany's Hannover Messe trade show, telling the gathered manufacturing executives that the software giant wants to take the lead in creating digital platforms for industry, citing work with Microsoft partners including aircraft engine maker Rolls Royce.""At this point, Rolls Royce is building a software product at the core value of what they do,"" he said. ""This is what we envision for every industrial company. We want to be able to create these platforms that can, in turn, create more digital technology from every industrial company.""Meanwhile, other industrial giants also have the capability to develop an open-standard operating system and will resist using something developed by archrival GE, even if it's an open architecture, noted Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau.""All the major industrial companies are doing this to some level,"" he said in an interview. ""Siemens, Emerson (EMR), Honeywell already have sensors and gauges that collect data on pressure, temperature and such in their equipment. All of them are trying to elevate that.""Ruh says GE has an edge because it knows and accepts that it's transforming into a software and analytics company.""We think we're ahead of our competitors. We've invested for five years in cloud-based Internet-of-Things-focused architecture. Our competitors will be traditional competitors with software capabilities. They're still trying to catch up.""GE sees most tech companies as potential partners as it rolls out its industrial OS.“The reality is we could end up partnering with them,"" Ruh said. ""We don’t have to be competitors. Right now we’re working our way through that.”He hinted GE might partner with IBM (IBM), for example, with its Predix platform. Edward Jones’ Windau said that seems like a likely pairing.“IBM is coming from the top down, and GE is coming from the bottom up. Somewhere in the middle they meet each other,” Windau said.Not everyone thinks GE is succeeding in transforming into a high-tech industrial company. Asked about GE's digital thrust, Deutsche Bank senior analyst John Inch said, ""Talk is cheap. Just because GE says this doesn't mean it's so.""Inch noted that GE has often focused on change and has undergone various transformations over the years. There are positives, he said.""I'm not disputing that (GE) can make products better. But GE is not becoming a digital company. That's a fairly misguided notion,"" he said. ""It's an enormous company with power plant generators and locomotives. That footprint is never going to change.""It will also take two to three years to see if Predix can in fact evolve into an industry standard as GE hopes, Inch added.Still, as a first mover in the Industrial Internet, GE's deep knowledge of industrial manufacturing gives it an edge, said RBC's Dray.""It will be theirs to lose. Shame on them if anyone from the outside came in.""

Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen said that Bitcoin played a very small role in the payments landscape, but that it was ""not a stable store of value"" and ""highly speculative."" Her remarks add to the chorus of banking officials weighing in on the much-hyped cryptocurrency.

It includes 20th Century Fox's movie and TV studios, National Geographic, FX, 22 Fox regional sports networks, and certain international assets. Disney CEO Bob Iger, who is extending his contract past 2019 to 2021 because of the merger, expressed enthusiasm about the deal's ability to boost the media giant's direct-to-consumer strategy and spread the ESPN brand internationally. It's not clear how regulators feel about the transaction, and Disney has promised a $2.5 billion breakup fee. Fox will keep its broadcast, news as well sports networks FS1, FS2 and Big Ten Network.

107,HON,"General Electric (GE) CEO John Flannery isn't surprised by the plunge in GE stock over the past two days to its lowest point in nearly six years, but even GE bulls were surprised by the comeback strategy he unveiled Monday after more than 100 days at the helm — deeming it surprisingly bad, that is.XOn Tuesday, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray yanked his outperform rating from General Electric. He said Flannery's turnaround plan fell short of a hoped-for sweeping reset and sees few reasons to believe the stock has bottomed at roughly 18.""There were very little new or bold ideas among the divestiture targets announced and no meaningful changes to the business model or quality of earnings,"" Dray wrote Tuesday. Instead, he said, Flannery's comments about missteps at the core GE Power segment and admission of systemic cash-flow shortfalls rattled the markets.Worse, GE executives said little about 2019 that inspired confidence in Dray about an eventual profit recovery. He slashed his price target on GE stock from 25 to 20, in light of ""deeper structural problems"" and a turnaround likely to be ""more protracted"" than previously thought.Meanwhile, Flannery told CNBC Tuesday he's unsurprised by GE stock's dive as disappointed investors bail, but insisted he can fix the broken industrial giant. Flannery on Monday vowed to slash both GE's vast portfolio of businesses and its beloved dividend to put GE back on the path to growth.IBD'S TAKE: Forget GE. These are some of the best income stocks for your watch list right now.But not all GE bulls are giving up. Melius Research's Scott Davis, who has a buy rating and $35 price target on GE stock, gave ""a B grade overall"" to that plan in a Monday note. Flannery's reset left him wanting more, and Davis suggested pushback from the board may help GE deliver on promises.Having an activist director was smart, Davis added, referring obliquely to Edward Garden of Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners. Garden joined the GE board just over a month ago.He believes things can get better for GE, if only because they can't get much worse.""Guidance was set appropriately low and seems very beatable,"" Davis said, adding that revenue upside offers ""incredible opportunity"" for investors.Shares of GE fell 5.9% to 17.90 on the stock market today after tumbling to 17.46 intraday, their lowest level since December 2011.

"
108,HON,"General Electric's (GE) moment of truth dawns Monday, with new CEO John Flannery set to reveal a turnaround strategy for the troubled industrial giant.XFlannery is expected to announce dramatic changes at GE, which is staring a cash crunch and meager profits in the face. He has said he will slash more than $20 billion in assets and costs, with Reuters reporting layoffs in its software division. He is likely to slash GE's prized high dividends to fund the turnaround.But even those moves may not be bold enough to satisfy restless investors, who see GE stock stuck near five-year lows while those of other industrial giants like 3M (MMM), Siemens (SIEGY) and Honeywell (HON) have shot up. GE shares rose 2.5% to 20.49 on the stock market today, but have fallen 35% this year, wiping billions off the market capitalization of this 125-year-old giant.Problems dog even its core units, such as GE Power. An executive shake-up is underway after former Chief Executive Jeff Immelt retired earlier than expected, with his own strategy to focus on GE's main industrial operations failing to produce the hoped-for gains. As his successor Flannery gears to share how he will put GE back on the right track, these are some questions that analysts are likely to ask:In just the past few weeks, speculation has ballooned about the businesses that could get sold or spun off. GE's aircraft-leasing, locomotive, and health care IT units are rumored to be headed to the chopping block. But analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets expects more than a nip-and-tuck.""We're looking for an upheaval of the previous GE business model,"" he told Investor's Business Daily.Dray has previously said ""anything less than a promise to 'de-conglomerate' GE will be disappointing"" and he thinks GE could make a wholesale ""staged exit"" from Baker Hughes (BHGE), the oilfield services company of which GE is a majority owner.But in an interview, Dray said shedding the health care unit would be the ""most telling"" sign of GE's commitment to change. That segment, in his view, isn't broken but doesn't fit in GE's industrial infrastructure portfolio.GE could shrink its portfolio to the core aviation and power businesses, he said, adding that he's especially looking for a ""deep dive"" on the strategy for power, which has been hit hard amid a shift to wind and solar, as well as other disruptive technologies.IBD'S TAKE: Find the best stocks to buy now by regularly reviewing screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Flannery has said there will be ""no sacred cows"" as he seeks to reshape GE. Many take that to mean a threat to the company's prized high dividends — GE stock has a 96-cent annual payout.Many income investors have come to view GE's dividend as sacrosanct, in part because the Dow giant has paid it for years and consistently describes it as a top priority.But a chorus of analysts recently pointed out that GE's businesses don't produce enough cash to support its rich dividend and that GE would do better using its cash to fund a new growth strategy.Morningstar's Barbara Noverini is modeling a dividend cut to 65 cents next year. JPMorgan's Steve Tusa, a noted GE bear, says a ""material"" dividend cut is likely, but cautions that this strategy is not sustainable"" in the long run.""Ultimately, it's the state of the business that matters because things have to turn and grow to sustain whatever they decide longer term,"" he wrote in a recent note to clients.RBC's Dray told IBD that GE's portfolio moves and divestitures will give it ""some cover"" to say a smaller notional dividend is in line with a smaller GE, rather than a reflection of cash constraints.While Dray noted that the options market is pricing in a ""more severe"" 66% dividend cut, he considers a 30% cut more realistic.""Everything is on the table,"" Flannery told investors last month.That has led to murmurings that anything is possible — even a once-inconceivable breakup of the industrial giant, whose manufacturing businesses span jet engines, gas turbines, medical scanners, locomotives and more.With that possibility in view, analysts have been crunching numbers as to how GE's market value stacks up against a piece-by-piece tally of its key business components.JPMorgan's Steve Tusa conducted a sum-of-the-parts analysis and calculated the while GE's aviation and health care units are valued at or above sector averages, its power, renewable energy, transportation and lighting units are below them. He assigned GE stock with a fair value of 17, below the current value, and sees downside risk in the event of an expedited breakup.""The standing stock price is likely overvalued, with aggressive portfolio rationalization likely to be a dilutive exercise, at least in the near term,"" Tusa wrote on Thursday.Scott Davis, head of Melius Research, who also conducted an SOTP analysis, concluded that GE's current market cap of $176 billion puts it approximately $90 billion below what the company should be worth, based on the anticipated future earnings of each business unit.Davis believes Flannery will need to break GE apart in a more aggressive fashion.The plan for GE to sell or spin off $20 billion in assets amounts to roughly 12% of GE's market value. ""We think 50% is more in the ballpark of what's needed,"" he said.New CFO Jamie Miller said in October she's considering a ""back to basics"" approach to financial reporting.That comes amid growing disenchantment about how GE reports earnings — specifically, its use of several custom metrics — and how it handles contract assets worth billions on the balance sheet.For example, GE offers at least three different measures for EPS: GAAP net income, GAAP income continuing operations, and industrial operating plus verticals earnings.Dray says new accounting standards, more aligned with standard industry practices, would improve the quality of its reports and boost transparency.He believes there is a very good chance that this highly sought change could come during the meeting GE's CEO will hold with analysts Monday.RELATED:Why There Is Little Hope General Electric's Dividend Will Stay IntactWhich Companies Are Now Outperforming 95% Of All Stocks?Dow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And Analysis

109,HON,"General Electric (GE) slashed its outlook for profits and cash flow Friday after missing Wall Street's expectations for quarterly earnings by a mile, prompting more warnings that its dividend could be at risk.XThe industrial conglomerate now sees full-year EPS at $1.05-$1.10, vs. a previous view of $1.60-$1.70, and well below consensus forecasts of $1.53. Cash flow from operating activities is now estimated at about $7 billion, vs. the prior view of $12 billion-$14 billion.""The lower cash flow target will likely bolster the market's skepticism over whether GE can sustain its dividend at its current level,"" said Deane Dray at RBC Capital Markets, warning that the pressure will be on for GE ""to cut its $0.96 dividend (4.1% yield).""Even prior to GE's Q3 earnings report, a slew of analysts warned of a potential dividend cut.New CEO John Flannery said Friday that he will address the dividend next month during a presentation, when his overall strategy will also be unveiled.Ahead of the much-anticipated event, the new chief executive signaled more than $2 billion in cost cuts next year, double an earlier target, as well as some $20 billion in asset sales in the next few years.In Q3, GE's EPS fell 9% to 29 cents, while analysts expected an increase to 49 cents, even as revenue grew 14% to $33.47 billion, beating estimates for $31.9 billion. Industrial cash flow from operating activity plunged 82% to $465 million or 40% to $1.74 billion after excluding deal taxes and pension funding, due to weakness in the power business.""The results are unacceptable to say the least,"" Flannery said in an earnings call early Friday. He warned that there would be ""no sacred cows"" at GE as he starts a new round of restructurings.But shares staged a dramatic reversal, as investors warmed up to Flannery's vow that ""everything is on the table"" and that no ""sacred cows"" will be spared what is now expected to be a major top-to-bottom restructuring.

112,HON,"Activist investor Third Point's proposal for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace division comes just as the industrial giant's new CEO, Darius Adamczyk, settles into the job, and the hedge fund's timing is ""intriguing,"" according to one analyst.Adamczyk became Honeywell's CEO and president this month, succeeding former CEO Dave Cote, who remains chairman. The change in management, RBC Capital said, could work in Third Point's favor.""New CEOs are often more willing to rethink an organization's portfolio,"" analyst Deane Dray said in a research note. ""But Dave Cote is still Chairman and we will have to see how much of a fight he will make now that his retirement process has been set in motion.""He also noted that the industrials sector is currently in an ""'urge to demerge' mode"" and that Honeywell could be the next illustration of a trend toward keeping it simple. He didn't name examples, but General Electric (GE) has largely shed its finance unit, and United Technologies (UTX) sold its Sikorsky unit to Lockheed Martin (LMT) in 2015.""There are also lingering memories of (Honeywell's) high-profile United Technologies pursuit that was eventually abandoned in early-2016, which would have meaningfully increased the aerospace exposure of the combined company,"" Dray noted.Honeywell shares rose 1% to 131.13 on the stock market today, after hitting 135 intraday. GE, which has said it would tie bonuses to profit and cost-cutting targets amid pressure from Trian Fund Management, slipped 0.3%. United Tech edged up 0.15%.Honeywell has said it would review Third Point's plan to spin off the aerospace business, a move the hedge fund said could increase shareholder value by more than $20 billion.Third Point, in its first-quarter investor letter on Thursday, said Honeywell's aerospace business ""is the chief cause of Honeywell's discounted valuation"" and was better off on its own. The fund argued that the aerospace segment had not kept up with rivals and was the primary reason behind weaker earnings at Honeywell.Honeywell, which makes airplane engines and other aircraft parts, cut its full-year sales forecast in January, citing weaker demand in corporate jets amid global trepidation about the economy and less traction in defense.However, the company, a supplier of Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY), beat first-quarter earnings expectations last week. And Lockheed Martin said it expected more orders internationally for its F-35 jets, which use equipment provided by Honeywell.Third Point, which CNBC reported substantially added to its Honeywell stake, said that separating the aerospace segment would help turn Honeywell into ""an industrial growth company with a focus on automation and productivity.""Honeywell, in a statement Thursday, said ""we intend to take the time necessary to ensure a comprehensive, informed and objective review of the potential separation of the Aerospace business."" The company said that it will ""continue executing its 2017 plan.""""We have a strong portfolio of businesses with great positions in growing industries. Aerospace is no exception,"" the statement added.RELATED:Raytheon Sees 'Significant Demand Signals' As Syria Heats UpThe Brains For Lockheed's F-35 Just Got Smarter

113,HON,"Microsoft (MSFT) unveiled Wednesday a new cloud service dubbed Azure IoT Edge, which can be used for industrial applications, as General Electric (GE) pushes its reinvention as a digital industrial leader.Microsoft's new technology delivers artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and advanced data analytics via the cloud to local computing devices. It will help companies increase operational efficiency or respond more quickly to events like machinery glitches, while potentially slashing their tech-related costs.Meanwhile, GE's Predix cloud-based operating system software allows companies to add intelligence to their equipment, monitor for problems, and enhance efficiency and savings.GE pointed out that it has sharpened its focus on the industrial IoT (Internet of Things) over the past year — and partnered with Microsoft in July 2016 in pursuit of that goal.""In this partnership, we are bringing GE's Predix platform for industrial IoT to Azure, to give our customers access to Microsoft's global cloud footprint,"" a GE spokeswoman told IBD via email. ""We are also leveraging applications available on Azure, combined with Predix, to bring these joint capabilities to our industrial customers.""She noted that GE acquired machine learning company Wise.io in November last year to accelerate development of advanced AI offerings on the Predix platform.Shares of GE closed down 0.8% at 28.69 on the stock market today, after Boeing (BA) halted test flights of its 737 Max jets due to an issue with engines from CFM, a joint venture of GE and France's Safran. Microsoft edged up 0.4% to 69.31. GE, Microsoft and Boeing are all components of the Dow Jones industrial average, which slipped 0.2% Wednesday.The industrial internet market is being eyed by both tech heavyweights such as Microsoft and industrial stalwarts like GE, Honeywell (HON) and Siemens (SIEGY).By GE's own estimate, that market is poised to be worth $225 billion by 2020, topping $206 billion for the enterprise cloud computing market and $170 billion for the consumer IoT market. Major providers of cloud infrastructure include Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM) and Salesforce (CRM).That growth potential has fueled GE's ambitions to become a hybrid tech-industrial powerhouse.""If you went to bed last night as an industrial company, you're going to wake up this morning as a software and analytics company,"" Jeffrey Immelt, General Electric CEO, said in 2015.While Microsoft missed sales forecasts in the March quarter, the tech giant highlighted cloud services as a pocket of revenue strength amid broad global demand.RELATED:How GE Could Become The Apple Of The Industrial InternetGE Sees Digital Revenue More Than Doubling To $15 Billion By 2020Amazon Cloud Services Under Growing Threat From Microsoft, Google, IBM

114,HON,"XDow Jones industrial average component General Electric (GE) on Friday turned out first-quarter earnings that topped analyst estimates. But shares fell, potentially due the state of the company's industrial operating cash flow, which turned negative and was a billion worse than the company expected.Meanwhile, fellow diversified industrial giant Honeywell (HON) also topped first-quarter earnings forecasts, soaring to a record high and briefly hitting a new entry area.General Electric's industrial cash flow from operating activities was negative $1.6 billion, partly due to the timing of things like cash collection for service contracts. But the company held to its forecast for the metric of between $12 billion to $14 billion this year.""That single point, which is very important for quality of earnings, simply gave investors a reason not to feel good about the quarter,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray said.Analysts have focused more on General Electric's cash flow since its separation from its finance arm, GE Capital, he said. That move, done to help GE return to its industrial roots, enabled Wall Street to more closely scrutinize GE's core finances.The company, he said, spent a good deal talking about the cash-flow situation — perhaps too much.""You end up sounding more defensive the more you talk about it,"" Dray said.Questions were also raised about whether General Electric can reach a $1 billion cost-cutting goal this year.In a research note after GE reported results, Cowen analyst Gautam Khanna said several factors — including negative industrial cash flow, and GE's cost-cutting plans — ""may mitigate the stock's reaction today.""General Electric also only tallied $76 million worth of savings toward the $1 billion target, part of an agreement worked out with activist investor Trian Fund Management. However, management on the company's earnings call said the pace of cost cutting would accelerate through the year.In March, following what Trian characterized as ""intensified"" discussions, the fund and General Electric worked out an agreement in which GE would try to slash $2 billion from its industrial segment this year and next. Executive bonuses would be tied to whether it meets those goals.GE also stuck with its full-year earnings-per-share forecast of $1.60-$1.70 and organic growth of 3%-5%.Shares fell 2.4% to 29.55 in the stock market today, undercutting their 50-day line a day after finding upside resistance at the 200-day line.GE has been mired in what has been called an ""industrial recession"" in which slow growth and an oil glut have affected demand for its equipment.While the company in January said that oil markets were stabilizing, management said Friday that ""a large degree of uncertainty remains,"" with stockpiles still flush with crude and OPEC's deliberations over keeping a lid on production hanging over oil prices.U.S. crude oil futures sank 2.2% to $49.62 a barrel, part of a 7.4% weekly tumble.""GE had a good quarter in a slow growth and volatile environment,"" Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt said on the company's earnings call. ""While the resource sector is challenging, we had the strongest oil & gas orders in 10 quarters."" Oil and gas revenue dropped 9% to $3 billion.Immelt said that the company sees ""global growth accelerating while the US continues to improve,"" and that China, Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia were ""all stronger than last year.""General Electric's EPS was flat at 21 cents on revenue of $27.66 billion, down less than 1% vs. a year earlier, topping views for 17 cents and $26.405 billion, respectively. Organic revenue climbed 7% and organic orders climbed 10%.Revenue for GE's aviation segment, which makes jet engines and other equipment, grew 9% to $6.08 billion. Revenue in power systems, which include gas turbines, rose 17% to $6.09 billion.Renewable energy revenue jumped 22% to $2.04 billion. Health care edged up 3% to $4.29 billion, helped by China, whose middle class has expanded.Within the health care division, which offers surgical imaging, ultrasound technology and an array of other products, GE remained upbeat on the global health care market, even as Republicans in Congress try to revive efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.""GE is continuing its portfolio transformation and investing in innovations in GE Digital and GE Additive,"" said Immelt in a statement. ""Our planned combination of GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes remains on track, and we expect the deal to close in mid-2017.""The deal with oilfield services firm Baker Hughes, which does much of its work on land, could broaden General Electric's exposure to the oil recovery as rig activity picks up in the Permian Basin and elsewhere. Much of GE's business in oil and gas is in deep-sea drilling.Investors have grown more cautious about the probability of President Trump and Congress delivering on tax reform and other policy goals quickly, though Trump told AP on Friday that a ""massive tax cut"" package will be released next week. Upcoming elections in Europe have also stirred anxiety.Honeywell's EPS rose 11% to $1.66 excluding divestitures on revenue of $9.492 billion, just below a year earlier. Organic revenue climbed 2%.

115,HON,"General Electric (GE) said Friday that first-quarter industrial revenue dipped as the collapse in oil prices weighed, but its digital unit saw sharp growth amid the conglomerate's tech transition.GE earned 21 cents per share, up from 20 cents a year ago and better than forecasts by 2 cents. Revenue declined 5% to $27.85 billion, but that topped estimates for $27.62 billion. Adjusted industrial revenue dipped 1% to $23.58 billion.GE shares fell 0.7% in the stock market today, finding support at their 50-day line. The stock climbed above a first stage cup-with-handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17. It's struggled to remain in buy range in the past month.""GE had a good performance in a slow growth environment,"" CEO Jeff Immelt told analysts on a conference call. ""We're in the midst of a challenging oil and gas market. However, we're seeing sustained strength in aviation and power markets, and health care is rebounding.""Revenue from its oil and gas segment dropped 18% to $3.31 billion, and its transportation business plunged 25% to $981 million. But power revenue climbed 13% to $5.2 billion, aviation jumped 10% to $6.26 billion, and health care rose 3% to $4.18 billion.Among its faster-growing segments, renewable-energy revenue surged 62% to $1.67 billion, energy connections spiked 34% to $2.26 billion, and digital leapt 29% to $1.2 billion.""That's still a small part of their $27 billion-plus quarterly revenue,"" Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said of the digital segment. ""But it's a real fast growing area for them.""GE is reorganizing into what it calls a digital industrial company, focusing more on selling technology services and software. In Q1, GE opened its Predix digital platform for general availability, and more than 7,500 developers have registered for it.On Thursday, GE Digital and Oracle (ORCL) announced a strategic partnership to build what they called a ""first of its kind"" platform for companies to digitally connect industrial assets.Meanwhile, GE's order backlog climbed 18% to $316.1 billion in Q1. That includes $28.8 billion worth of orders from Alstom, the French industrial giant whose power business GE bought in November for $10.6 billion, its largest industrial purchase ever.GE reaffirmed that it expects 2%-4% organic revenue growth in 2016, with sales expected to accelerate in the back half of the year. It also confirmed earlier EPS guidance of $1.45-$1.55 for the year, in line with analyst views.Windau isn't worried about the Q1 drop in industrial revenue growth, saying that has been seen broadly in the industrial sector as oil and gas has been a headwind for a couple of quarters with lingering currency effects as well.""It's a positive that they stuck by their guidance,"" he added. ""That's baking in a pretty decent improvement in the back half of the year.""Along with its digital shift, GE continues to shed other businesses. In January, GE agreed to sell its home appliances business to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion. Immelt said Friday that GE has inked deals to sell $166 billion of its $200 billion GE Capital businesses and is ahead of schedule on divesting that business.As GE repositions, other diversified manufacturers considered big moves too. Earlier this year, Honeywell (HON) revealed that it had tried to buy United Technologies (UTX) for more than $90 billion. But Honeywell ended its pursuit in March due to United Tech's unwillingness to engage in talks.On Friday, Honeywell also reported quarterly results. Earnings climbed 8.5% to $1.53 a share, beating by 3 cents. Revenue grew 3.4% to $9.52 billion, topping analyst projections for $9.37 billion.It raised the low end of its 2016 guidance and now sees EPS of $6.55-$6.70 vs. $6.45-$6.70 previously, on sales of $40.3 billion-$40.9 billion vs. an earlier view for $39.9 billion-$40.9 billion. Analysts see EPS of $6.61 on sales of $40.58 billion.Shares dipped 0.7%.
"
116,HON,"When General Electric (GE) reports first-quarter earnings Friday before the market opens it will be as a radically different company than it was a year earlier.The industrial giant has been shedding its GE Capital financial businesses aggressively, and in January it agreed to sell its home appliances business to China's Haier Group for $5.4 billion as it dives deeper into technology, selling more software and services.Analyst consensus is for GE to report 19 cents earnings per share minus one-time items, a penny lower than the 20 cents it posted the same quarter in the previous year. It's only missed quarterly EPS estimates once in the prior two years. Analysts project revenue will fall 5.4% to $27.76 billion amid weakness in the energy and railroad industries and global economic uncertainty.Since announcing a few years ago that it planned to sell the bulk of its GE Capital businesses, GE has signed agreements for about $166 billion of the $200 billion in investments it plans to unload and now seeks to have its ""too big to fail"" label removed from its finance unit by federal regulators.Last week, GE announced that it had completed the sale of GE Capital Bank's U.S. online deposit platform, including all $16 billion of GE Capital Bank's U.S. deposits, to Goldman Sachs (GS) for an undisclosed sum.""With this sale, we are now in a position to fully exit the U.S. banking system by extinguishing our final U.S. bank charter and terminating our FDIC insurance, which we are targeting to complete by the end of this week,"" GE Capital Chairman and CEO Keith Sherin said in a statement last Monday.Meanwhile, GE in February launched a global partners network for its Predix operating system software, which is key for GE's ""Industrial Internet"" efforts. The network includes dozens of high-profile companies, such as Accenture (ACN), Deloitte Digital, Infosys (INFY) and No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC).GE's stock rose above a first-stage cup with handle base with a 30.69 buy point on March 17, and has remained in buy range. Shares closed up 0.3% in the stock market today.Among other industrial conglomerates, Honeywell (HON) also reports Friday, and United Technologies (UTX) is due to report April 27.

LinkedIn, which reports earnings on Thursday, rose 0.9% to 120.48.
"
118,HON,"Stocks ended the week mixed – the attention now appearing to shift to the accumulation of weak results being reported across the board. Big tech – the latest to join the band as both Google and Microsoft weighed heavy on the tech industry- and then weighed heavy on the broader mkt. Business conditions for these blue chips is getting more difficult - cost controls can only go so far - investors want growth.....and since they don't see it - they are voting with their feet - taking some $4.5 billion out of tech mutual funds and technology ETF funds. This week will include earnings from Apple (AAPL), Twitter (TWTR), and Facebook (FB)...so it is sure to be another interesting week for tech.....Now while the mkt has seemingly appeared to hold up in the face of poor earnings – Friday's reports hit the Nasdaq hard. Microsoft (MSFT) lost 7%, while Alphabet (GOOGL) gave back 5% - and while these high profile names did steal the thunder – but they were not alone. Other disappointments included General Electric (GE), Honeywell (HON) and Caterpillar (CAT).Over the weekend -I had a conversation with some friends and they asked me about how the earning season really works and how companies can guide lower, miss top line while still beating the bottom line.... – So I said - as the dance begins – we get companies that offer guidance – being very cautious (always better to under promise and over deliver), then you have analysts make predictions on both revenues and EPS (based on the cautious guidance)– usually lower because they don't want to be seen as being out of touch – and then companies report weaker top line (as they guided) while still beating the bottom line (emphasizing cost controls which is supposed to make everyone feel better) and this is confusing to the average Joe (because there is no real growth - yet Obama tells us how strong the US economy is) – which then causes investors to ask – What is going on? Feels more like a casino than a mkt and that my friends is the huge negative. Its about ignoring the noise and sticking with the plan. But this is a story for another time......US futures are off slightly - currently down 1.80.....as mkts now appear to be positioning themselves for this week's FED announcement – just in case there are any surprises at all….in what will be just another opportunity for game playing. It is a big week for both earnings as well as eco data......Today includes New Home Sales and the Dallas Fed Survey - exp of -10. Tomorrow brings Durable Goods exp of +1.9% , Ex transports of +0.5%, Cap Goods Non Def ex Air of +0.7%. Wednesday brings the FOMC announcement while Thursday brings 1Q GDP - published expectations call for +0.6%, while the whisper number is closer to +0.2% with some calling for a negative print......Friday brings Pers Income and Pers Spending. Sprinkled in there are also a couple of other regional fed surveys - Milwaukee, Kansas City and Chicago.As I said last week and in notes prior – I do not expect the FED to do anything at all (and nor does the mkt)…Remember – at the March meeting – Yellen made it clear that she only saw 2 rate hikes in 2016 vs the 4 that Vice Chair Fischer kept trying to jam down our throats….which then was very much at the root of the January/February meltdown in the mkts. The sudden change of heart – coupled with the actions by the BoJ, ECB and PBoC – have all contributed to the 'recovery' off of the early 2016 lows which has sent the US mkt to near all time highs once again – (now THAT may be a reason to suggest a rate hike – just to cool the speculation- but even that won't happen this month).Look – Yellen has been much more dovish than some of the other members of the Fed emphasizing that it is not always about the employment rate or inflation (in direct contrast to some of the more hawkish members) – but we must also consider the state of the global economy - And the state of the global economy is still suspect at best......Recall the Draghi comments last week - about continued concern and the ability for the ECB to do more (think jawboning), add in the policy decisions from the BoJ and PBoC and you have a recipe for continued weakness.So I would not expect any surprises at all – but I do expect her to continue to suggest that June is ON the table (without committing emphatically to a June hike - remember that the BREXIT vote in only days prior to the June meeting - so expect that to play into the conversation as we move forward) – which may cause some short term disruption in the mkts.
"
119,HON,"[BREXIT- is the abbreviation of the 'British Exit'; from the European Union....referring to the possibility that Britain's will vote in early June for such an exit - and if that happens - financial mkts are expected to become fairly volatile]Now look - FED Fund Futures are suggesting a 0% chance of anything in April and they are not convinced that even a June hike is really on the table. Odds have it at a 20% chance that a June hike is happening and if we get no hike in June - then look for the mkt to soar. Remember - if the FED does not move in June it then begs the question – If not June – then when? Because once we hit the summer – we have both conventions taking place -which are sure to create a fair amount of entertainment and concern and you know rates are not going up in July, Aug, Sept, or Oct.On Friday - Markit told us that the US economic picture continues to weaken.....yes - weaken.....despite FED policy. Friday's report saw a FALL in US manufacturing. The manufacturing report showed that U.S. manufacturing activity unexpectedly fell to a 6 yr low in April coming in at 50.8 - down from 51.5 and well below the expectation of 52. .(Remember that a reading above 50 continues to indicate expansion in the manufacturing sector, while a number below 50 suggests contraction - now while the number was 50.2 - it is moving in the WRONG direction.....and this reading sits right on the fence and is barely out of ""recession"" / contraction territory.)Overnight - Asian mkts all moved lower.....ahead of what is going to be busy 'central bank' week....policy decisions from the FED, the BoJ and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand are all on the docket. Remember - the BoJ has indicated that they are about to introduce negative lending rates to go hand in hand with negative deposit rates.....JAPAN -0.86%, HONG KONG - 0.75%, CHINA -0.42% and ASX -0.69%.European mkts are also under pressure following a weaker Asia and concern over global monetary policy. Oil remains in focus - down about 0.40 cts as it looks more like profit taking rather than any real negative news after running into resistance at $44.35. German IFO Survey was the only interesting release, and it was in line with estimates (100.4 vs. (E) 100.5). FTSE - -0.32%, CAC 40 - 0.31%, DAX - 0.50%, EUROSTOXX - 0.47%, SPAIN - 0.34% and ITALY -0.94%.Look for the mkt to churn as we get a slew of earnings...will they continue to disappoint and if so - will the mkt finally retreat? We have teased with the psychologically important 2100 level on the S&P - unable to really pierce and hold.....Earnings that are to be reported today are NOT broader mkt impactful, so do not expect the mkt to find any reason to rally hard or back off. I suspect we will trade tight today - churning within the 2080/2100 range.Take Good CareKP

122,HON,"Stocks dove lower at Wednesday's open, with a sell-off in Asia and mixed U.S. earnings news helping to propel early declines.XThe Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.5%, with Wal-Mart (WMT), Goldman Sachs (GS) and JPMorgan (JPM) opening at the bottom of the index.The S&P 500 also dropped 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite dug in 0.7%, as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) each posted early declines of more than 1%.Markets in China and Japan tumbled in broad-based selling Wednesday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index down 1% and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 faltering 1.6%. The latter pointed the Nikkei toward its first weekly loss since the first week of September.

But he called a potential failure of the effort a ""modest negative"" for the market: ""I don't think it's a huge driver for the market. I don't think the market is going to tank by any means."" Blackstone shares traded down 4% in early action.Wal-Mart led the Dow's declines, feeling some early pull following Target's (TGT) third-quarter report. Target opened 9% lower after reporting a smaller-than-expected third-quarter earnings decline and revenue growth in line with analyst forecasts. But management warned of a ""highly competitive"" holiday season. Shares ended up 15% from a June low, attempting to climb out of an 18-month consolidation.Apple posted an early 1.5% loss, possibly due to quarterly results reported in Taiwan Wednesday by Hon Hai Precision, also known as FoxConn, which assembles Apple's iPhones and other products. Hon Hai earnings fell 39%, almost to half of analyst expectations, largely owing to iPhone X production problems.The decline put Apple's shares less than 5% above the 160.97 buy point cleared on OCt. 27. Investors may want to review rules for stocks that give up gains above buy points. Oil-related names posted some of the S&P 500's biggest early declines, as oil prices backed off 1% and threatened a second day of declines. Drilling contractors Ensco (ESV), Transocean (RIG) and Diamond Offshore (DO) all dropped more than 4%.Sorl Auto Parts (SORL) rocketed 36% higher after reporting a 159% earnings gain and a 59% advance in revenue for its third quarter.

Advanced Auto dipped 2% at the open.Car lot operator CarGurus (CARG) drove ahead 7% in opening trade after reporting a 56% sales gain and earnings of two cents a share in its third quarter, and raising its fourth-quarter revenue guidance above consensus views. The new issue ended Tuesday 86% above its October 12 IPO price.IBD 50 stock YY (YY) swung up 7%, as Jefferies upgraded shares to buy from hold. YY reported a healthy third-quarter beat late Tuesday. The gain put the stock in a buy range, on a rebound from support at its 10-week moving average.Consumer price data were mixed for October, with the Labor Department putting its Consumer Price Index up 0.1%, for the month — down from September's 0.5% gain, but in line with estimates. Core prices, minus energy and food, rose 0.2%, above the prior month's 0.1% gain and also in line with forecasts.Manufacturing growth slowed sharply in November, leaving the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State Manufacturing Survey at 19.4 for the month. That was down from the unexpected spike to 30.2 in October, and well below expectations for a more mild slowdown, to a reading of 26.Retail sales also slowed, edging up just 0.2% in October, according to Commerce Department estimates. That was still better than the downshift to a 0.1% gain expected by economists. Sales had jumped 1.9% in September. Minus auto sales and gas, sales rose 0.3%, just below projections for a 0.4% advance.September business inventories estimates, also from the Commerce Department, arrive at 10 a.m. ET, followed by the Energy Information Administration's weekly oil stockpiles report at 10:30 a.m. ET.Cisco Systems (CSCO) and Sally Beauty (SBH) are among the few companies scheduled to report after today's close.RELATED:The Big Picture: Stocks Fall Modestly As A Few Warnings Lights AppearThese 5 Key Earnings Are On Tap: Investing Action PlanIt Just Took 10 Days For This Stock To Trigger A Rare Hold RuleTrump Is Close To Big Wins On Tax Cuts And ObamaCare

123,HON,"United Technologies (UTX) lifted full-year forecasts Tuesday after topping Q3 estimates, led by growth at its jet engine unit, which is making progress on resolving problems in its Geared Turbofan engine.Estimates: EPS to slip 4.5% to $1.68 while revenue grows 3.7% to $14.89 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: EPS dipped 2% to $1.73 as revenue grew 5% $15.06 billion. Organic sales rose 6%. Sales at the Otis elevator unit rose 4.6% to $3.16 billion. Climate, controls and security sales climbed 6.2% to $4.69 billion. Pratt & Whitney jet engine sales increased 10.6% to $3.87 billion. Aerospace systems sales were flat at $3.64 billion. Commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% at both Pratt & Whitney and aerospace systems.Orders for new equipment at Otis were down 4% on a constant-currency basis, while climate, controls and security saw a 2% increase in organic orders.Outlook: United Tech raised its full-year earnings estimate to $6.58-$6.63 from $6.45-$6.60. It sees sales of $59 billion-$59.5 billion, up from $58.5 billion-$59.5 billion. The Dow industrials component still sees 3%-4% organic growth.Stock: Shares fell 0.9% to 119.76 on the stock market today, falling back below a 120.05 buy point on a cup-with-handle base after hitting 123.28 intraday. Fellow Dow component General Electric (GE), which slashed its guidance last week, slipped 1.9% after diving 6% on Monday.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.United Tech has been grappling with problems in its new Geared Turbofan engines, which have delayed Airbus (EADSY) A320neo deliveries.In July, Airbus said Pratt & Whitney has to ""work harder"" to fix delays and reliability problems. United Tech said Tuesday that it has shipped 245 Geared Turbofan engines so far this year and backed its target of 350-400 deliveries for 2017.Management also said the company is speeding up production for the engines used in the A320neo and Bombardier's C Series aircraft.Meanwhile, United Tech reached a deal last month to buy aerospace supplier Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion, including debt.The combination of United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, and Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, is seen as one of the biggest aerospace deals ever, and may draw a challenge from Boeing (BA), which is looking to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.The United Tech-Rockwell deal comes as Boeing ramps up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note last month.But as United Tech gets bigger, other industrial heavyweights like GE and Siemens (SIEGY) are getting smaller. General Electric said last week it will streamline its business by $20 billion, with thousands of layoffs expected. Siemens may cut thousands of workers at its power-and-gas and process industries, Bloomberg reported last week.United Tech needs to break up some of its assets to ""unlock the conglomerate discount and bring this deal to its ultimate logic,"" according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague.In a Setember note, Sprague wrote that a spin-off of United Tech's buildings units, which includes Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevators, ""could unlock upwards of $20/share in value"" and would be ""the logical conclusion"" to the Rockwell transaction.RELATED:GE Under Pressure To Cut Dividend After Slashing Cash Flow OutlookBoeing May Challenge United Tech's Buyout Of Rockwell CollinsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanHoneywell To Spin Off 2 Units; Pfizer Mulls Consumer Sale; P&G-Peltz Proxy Fight Today

124,HON,"Honeywell (HON) will reportedly spin off noncore assets into at least two public companies, but that might not be enough to appease an activist investor.XThe industrial conglomerate's turbocharger unit, which builds components that make cars and trucks more efficient, is among the units that may be spun off, sources told Reuters. While it falls under the aerospace business, Honeywell isn't planning to spin off that entire unit.That stops short of what Third Point LLC, a hedge fund run by activist investor Daniel Loeb, has urged. Loeb wants Honeywell to spin off its aerospace assets, its largest business.Honeywell shares rallied as much as 1.2% in Monday's stock market trading, but closed down down 0.1% at 143.54. Honeywell is in buy range from a 140.31 buy point.Industrial giants are becoming slimmer and more focused on core assets.Last month, General Electric (GE), under the direction of a new CEO, said it would sell its industrial-solutions business to Switzerland's ABB for $2.6 billion and has been shedding businesses for several years.United Technologies (UTX) might be gearing up to sell assets after agreeing in early September to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion.GE shares fell 3.9% to 23.43, a two-year low.

"
126,HON,"General Electric's (GE) attempts at an image makeover with a slew of cost-cutting measures and executive reshufflings may be signs that things are about to get worse instead of better at the industrial giant.XOn Monday, GE announced that Ed Garden, founding partner of Trian Fund Management, will join its board. Trian has pressured GE to cut its $2.4 billion in corporate costs and revive its slumping stock price. The move followed several C-suite changes at GE on Friday, including the departure of CFO Jeff Bornstein.Analysts at JPMorgan, however, slammed the leadership moves, saying they suggest ""core fundamental challenges are worse than consensus is currently discounting,"" while also reaffirming an underweight on GE stock.""Not only is the baseline of the now hotly debated 'reset' likely lower, but what we think investors are ignoring is the trend line on the businesses, some of which have secular issues (i.e. implications for multiple), a hole that is unlikely to be dug out of with simple cost cuts alone,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa and his team wrote in a Monday note.Tusa was referring to expectations that new GE CEO John Flannery will offer an updated 2018 outlook next month. GE already has signaled that a current EPS goal of $2 for 2018 may be too high.Also, Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague said Friday that the CFO change is ""especially troubling"" because Bornstein had been seen as Flannery's partner in his turnaround plan.Shares of GE dived 3.2% to 23.62 on the stock market today. Among industrial peers, 3M (MMM) edged up 0.1% to 216.64, just above a 214.67 buy point. United Technologies (UTX) rose 0.3% to 118.68 as it forms a flat base with a 124.89 entry point and an alternative entry of 120.29. 3M and United Technologies as Dow components, like GE.Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 143.54 after initially rising to a record 145.30 on reports that it's planning to spin off noncore assets into at least two public companies. Honeywell is in buy range from a 140.31 entry.IBD'S TAKE: Earnings season is about to kick off. Here's a list of Dow stocks near buy points to watch ahead of third-quarter results.On Friday, GE said Jamie Miller, who heads GE's transportation business, will assume the CFO role on Nov. 1. Bornstein exits at the end of the year, with two other GE vice chairs and longtime veterans.JPMorgan's Tusa questioned the ""rationale for a seemingly heavy focus on internal candidates"" in selecting a new CFO and added that the likelihood of a dividend cut ""moves materially higher.""Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague also said Friday that a dividend cut is now more likely.""The dividend consumes all or most of GE's industrial FCF (free cash flow) for the foreseeable future,"" Sprague added. ""A dividend cut could crush the stock as retail investors flee, but maintaining it gives GE little or no excess cash to grow the company. ""And now that activist investor Trian is getting a board seat, RBC Capital Markets analyst Deane Dray says its engagement in shaping GE policy will intensify.""We expect Trian to promote value-adding moves like transitioning closer to GAAP EPS reporting, further boosting structural cost-out, and rationalizing the portfolio,"" he said in a Monday note, adding that the move highlighted that Flannery ""clearly wanted to avoid a messy proxy fight with Trian's Nelson Peltz.""Trian's $2.5 billion bet on GE in October 2015 is now worth about $1.7 billion, with Trian trimming its GE holdings by more than 20% as the stock has underperformed over the past year, Dray noted.RELATED:These 5 Dow Stocks Are Near Buy Zones As Earnings Season BeginsHoneywell's Expected Spinoffs Fall Short Of Investor's PlanDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisGE Shakes Up Top Execs While More Perks Fall To Cost-Cutting Drive

133,HON,"Boeing (BA) announced Thursday it would buy Aurora Flight Sciences as the company looks toward more autonomous applications for aircraft, but the acquisition may hint at details about a new commercial plane being considered.XThe aerospace giant is considering building a new midmarket plane that analysts have dubbed the ""797."" If Boeing goes ahead with it, the plane will help the company compete against Airbus' (EADSY) A321neo, which has allowed airlines to open new routes that aren't accessible with smaller planes and aren't profitable with larger ones.Earlier this year, Boeing said it was looking at a ""hybrid"" cross-section that would cut the amount of cargo space, and the Aurora acquisition would provide some technical know-how on unconventional designs.Aurora has worked on innovative aircraft designs and along with United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit, helped build a so-called double bubble fuselage for NASA.The design features smaller wings that lower fuel consumption, and the engines are placed at the back of the fuselage to reduce the amount of thrust needed.When asked if Boeing would consider a design like this, Chief Technical Officer Greg Hyslop told reporters in a conference call Thursday that the company always evaluates future airframe ideas.While he declined to comment on the midmarket plane, he added that one design Boeing is looking at is a blended-wing body, which lacks any division between the wings and body of the plane.Boeing shares closed up 1.2% at 258.89 on the stock market today, near the high end of its buy range, which maxes out at 258.92. U.S.-listed shares of Airbus slipped 0.6%, and United Tech edged up 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.Terms of the Aurora deal weren't disclosed, but Boeing said it wouldn't impact its financial guidance.The companies aren't expecting pushback from the Defense Department or other regulators and hope the deal will close by the end of the year.Aurora has been a longtime partner with Boeing and the companies worked together on rapid prototyping for military and commercial applications.Other innovations Aurora could bring include advances in sensing technology, artificial intelligence and other areas around autonomous flight to ""make an already safe airplane even safer,"" Hyslop said.Aurora built a robotic co-pilot that has flown a Boeing 737 flight simulator. Boeing is considering more artificial intelligence applications to help with a pilot shortage.""The combined strength and innovation of our teams will advance the development of autonomy for our commercial and military systems,"" Hyslop said in a press release. ""Together, these talented teams will open new markets with transformational technologies.""One of those new markets could be air taxis that zip customers around crowded cities. In April, Aurora flew an air taxi prototype with vertical takeoff and landing technology and plans to deliver 50 to Uber Elevate, the ride-sharing company's flying car enterprise, by 2020.Aurora also is currently building a hybrid-electric plane for the Defense Department along with Honeywell (HON) and Rolls-Royce.Aurora has built 30 autonomous vehicles since it was founded in 1989 and is working on improving perception, machine learning and flight-control systems for its autonomous technology.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhy The Orbital ATK Buyout Is So Important For Northrop Grumman

134,HON,"General Electric (GE) announced several executive changes late Friday, another in a raft of measures that it's taking to cut costs, restructure the portfolio and streamline operations.XJamie Miller, CEO of GE Transportation, takes over as chief financial officer Nov. 1, replacing Jeffrey Bornstein, who is also a vice chair at the industrials giant.Bornstein leaves GE Dec. 31 after 28 years of service. Two other vice chairs and longtime GE veterans, John Rice and Beth Comstock, depart at the same time.Under new CEO John Flannery, GE is showing it's serious about trimming $2 billion in costs by the end of 2018. Late Thursday, news emerged that is whisking away corporate cars on the heels of grounding its corporate jet fleet — perks that senior executives have enjoyed for decades.Top bosses at GE were informed via email that their leases on company cars will only be good through the end of 2018, CNBC reported Thursday evening. The move affects roughly 700 execs, and a GE spokeswoman confirmed the report.In September, the Dow component eliminated the use of GE-owned business jets for company executives to get to meetings around the globe. They will take charter and commercial flights instead.GE plans to eventually sell those aircraft, revealing last month that it had spent $258,000 on personal jet travel for former CEO Jeff Immelt in 2016, and another $75,000 on travel for other top executives.Shares of GE dipped 0.6% to 24.39 on the stock market today and are down 24% year to date. GE earns an IBD RS Rating of 11, meaning it has underperformed 89% of stocks over the past 12 months. Among other diversified industrial giants, Honeywell (HON) and Roper Technologies (ROP) inched up 0.4% Friday, and United Technologies (UTX), Siemens (SIEGY) and 3M (MMM) also clawed out fractional gains.IBD'S TAKE: Market-leading stocks usually boast an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This IBD screen helps you identify top growth stocks with superior price performance relative to the S&P 500.Flannery has promised an ""intense focus"" on operations and a review of the industrial conglomerate's vast portfolio of businesses, as investors worry about cash flow and margins. GE sold its industrial solutions unit in September and finalized the sale of GE Water this month.Also this month, Jeffrey Immelt retired as chairman about three months ahead of schedule and left the board. Flannery, who took over as CEO from Immelt in August, has replaced him as chairman.The industrial giant is also undergoing a restructuring at its corporate headquarters and in some other areas that could result in job cuts, according to news reports.RELATED:GE Is Cutting This Decades-Old Executive Perk To Save MoneyDow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisImmelt Exits GE Ahead Of Plan As New CEO Adds Chairman Role

135,HON,"A respected Apple (AAPL) analyst thinks the company will have shipped only 2 million to 3 million units of its highly anticipated iPhone X smartphone for its global launch on Nov. 3.KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo made the estimate in a report Friday, according to Apple news website 9to5Mac.""Given that Apple usually sells more than 10 million phones in opening weekend sales alone, availability of just 2-3 million units for the launch is unlikely to satisfy customer demand for iPhone X,"" 9to5Mac writer Benjamin Mayo wrote. ""As such, be prepared for the Apple Store to quickly go out of stock when the devices go up for sale.""Apple's contract manufacturers have dealt with several problems while trying to build the premium handset, Kuo said. First, production was postponed when Apple tried unsuccessfully to integrate a fingerprint reader into the device's screen.Then it dealt with a shortage of 3D scanners used for the facial-recognition security feature, because of low production yields. Those issues have been previously reported, but Kuo revealed two other component-related production snags on Friday.Apple also is dealing with supply shortages of circuit boards for the iPhone X antenna and wide-angle camera, he said.The ""biggest hurdle"" is the flexible printed circuit board for the phone's antenna, Kuo said. An initial suppler failed to pass Apple's tests and a second supplier has had to ramp up production, he said. The wide-angle camera circuit board is considered the next biggest bottleneck, Kuo said.Kuo cut his fourth-quarter shipment estimates to a range of 25 million to 30 million iPhone X units, down from 30 million to 35 million. But he believes that iPhone X production will quickly rise in the first quarter of 2018.Apple stock ticked up 0.2% to close at 156.25 on the stock market today.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a flat base with a buy point of 165.04 for the past seven weeks. For more analysis of Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Meanwhile, Nikkei Asian Review reported Friday that Apple Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams will meet with Hon Hai Chairman Terry Gou in Taiwan later this month. Hon Hai, also known as Foxconn Technology, is the only assembler of the iPhone X and its Sharp subsidiary shares 3D-sensor-module manufacturing with LG Innotek. Production delays for the iPhone X are seen as a major topic of discussion.The iPhone X will be available for preorders starting Oct. 27 in more than 55 countries and territories, and will go on sale in stores a week later. The device's price starts at $999.The iPhone X, pronounced ""ten"" as in the Roman numeral, is Apple's 10th-anniversary smartphone. It features a 5.8-inch OLED display, facial-recognition technology, wireless charging, improved cameras, faster processors and a new handset design with no physical home button to interrupt the screen.Nomura Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal on Friday lowered his iPhone X estimates for the December quarter because of production bottlenecks.""We believe iPhone X production is 5 million to 10 million units below plan"" for the December quarter, which is Apple's fiscal first quarter, Kvaal said.He cut his iPhone sales estimates for the December quarter by 5 million units and raised his March quarter estimates by the same number. Kvaal believes Apple customers will wait for the new phone and won't defect to makers of Android phones such as Samsung.""We believe bottlenecks in 3D-sensing modules are improving, if not fast enough to meet Apple's production plans for the iPhone X,"" Kvaal said. ""We shift 5 million units from fiscal Q1 into fiscal Q2.""He now thinks Apple will sell 20 million units of the iPhone X in its fiscal first quarter, accounting for 24% of total iPhone sales in the period.RELATED:Apple Stock Falls On 'Anemic' iPhone 8 Demand, Production CutsApple iPhone X Production Finally Ramping Up, Easing Concerns

136,HON,"After weeks of Wall Street analysts cutting their Apple (AAPL) iPhone X shipment estimates over production concerns, one analyst on Wednesday raised his forecast, noting signs that production is accelerating.Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang upped his iPhone X shipment forecast, but maintained his neutral rating on Apple stock with a price target of 150.Apple shares were down a fraction to close at 159.76 on the stock market today.""We believe iPhone production continues its improvement this week as our industry research suggests (contract manufacturer) Hon Hai added capacity with an additional 20 production lines, reaching a total of 30 production lines this week,"" Zhang said in a report.He estimates that Hon Hai, aka Foxconn Technology Group, can boost weekly production to 600,000 to 700,000 units per week starting this week.""Therefore, we expect 3 million iPhone X shipments before Nov. 3 with production ramping to 7 million to 8 million units in November and 15 million units in December,"" Zhang said. ""We are increasing our iPhone X shipment estimate from 20 (million) to 25 million for the December quarter and maintain our 50 million unit estimate for the March quarter.""Even with increased production, Zhang says, Apple will see supply constraints for the iPhone X, which goes on sale Nov. 3 following a week of online preorders.IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 74 out of a possible 99. For more analysis on Apple, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.""We expect the iPhone X to sell out quickly with positive market sentiment on demand,"" he said.Production of the iPhone X has been slowed by manufacturing-yield issues associated with the device's 3D scanning module for facial recognition, according to analyst reports.The increasing iPhone X production is good news for firms in the 3D-sensing supply chain, including Lumentum (LITE), STMicroelectronics (STM), Viavi Solutions (VIAV) and European-traded AMS, which he described as ""key beneficiaries of the iPhone X.""RELATED:Apple iPhone X Production Woes Weighing On SuppliersApple Stock Gets An Upgrade On Move To Higher-Margin iPhones

138,HON,"An 11-word phrase omitted from an Alexion Pharmaceuticals' (ALXN) statement could be telling in the wake of the unexpected departures of former Chief Executive David Hallal and Chief Financial Officer Vikas Sinha, RBC analyst Simos Simeonidis said Tuesday.Before Monday's resignations of Hallal and Sinha, Alexion had announced an internal probe into allegations by a former employee that some personnel ""engaged in sales practices that were inconsistent with company policies and procedures"" revolving around orders placed for the immunosuppressant Soliris. At the time, Alexion said it hadn't identified ""instances where Soliris orders were not placed by customers for patients.""But that latter phrase was missing from Monday's press release announcing the executives' departure, Simeonidis said. It was unclear what the possible ethics breach might be, leaving analysts to piece together what issues the company faced.""We believe that the omission of the (phrase) from Monday's press release may point to what could be behind yesterday's management changes,"" Simeonidis wrote in a research note. He has an outperform rating and 188 price target on Alexion stock.Hallal and Sinha exited Alexion on Monday, prompting the stock to dive as much as 16.9% before settling down 12.9% at the closing bell. On the stock market today, Alexion stock fell another 4.4% to 110.01, touching a three-year low for a second straight day.IBD'S TAKE: Biotechs have nearly lapped a rally following the election of Donald Trump who, last week, said he would tackle rising drug prices. Could your biotech picks get quashed in the fallout?Alexion postponed filing its quarterly 10-Q on Nov. 9 as a result of the ongoing investigation. The company expects to file the document for the quarter ended Sept. 30 in January. On Monday, it said former  (AZN)AstraZeneca CEO David Brennan will replace Hallal on an interim basis. And ex-Honeywell (HON) CFO David Anderson will permanently succeed Vikas.Simeonidis estimates Soliris sales for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome represent a 115 price target. For the third quarter, reported Oct. 27, Soliris sales in those two segments represented 91% of $799 million in worldwide sales.A change in Soliris sales practices could be devastating, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison wrote in a research report. Harrison downgraded Alexion stock to equal weight from an overweight rating. Management indicated the probe centers on sales recognition and accounting, he noted.This suggests ""limited risk to patient recruitment and field selling practices, (but) modest inflections in factors such as Soliris future growth which could be impacted by changes in selling practices or ability to access certain markets,"" he wrote.However, Harrison finds Alexion's next-generation Soliris, ALXN1210, encouraging. The drug has a seemingly better profile with less frequent dosing vs. Soliris. Furthermore, management's ability to move patients onto the next-generation platform could give Soliris a tail beyond its patent expiration in 2021.RELATED:AMAG Pharma Up On Preeclampsia Drug Potential; Stock On Four-Day Run

139,HON,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) stock crashed to a three-year low Monday after its CEO and CFO unexpectedly resigned amid the company's monthlong accounting probe into sales of immunosuppressant Soliris.In the stock market today, Alexion stock toppled 12.9% to 115.08, earlier falling as much as 20% to its lowest point since October 2013. Shares already had plunged 11% in the two days following Alexion's Nov. 9 announcement of the probe into whether an employee engaged in sales practices inconsistent with company policies.On Monday, Alexion tapped former AstraZeneca (AZN) CEO David Brennan to temporarily replace CEO David Hallal, who resigned for personal reasons. Brennan has been on Alexion's board since July 2014 and previously led AstraZeneca from 2006 to 2012. Spencer Stuart will search for a permanent CEO.Former Honeywell International (HON) CFO David Anderson will permanently succeed CFO Vikas Sinha, Alexion said in a press release. Anderson served as Honeywell's CFO from 2003 to 2014.IBD'S TAKE: More challenged Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Novo Nordisk could fall behind Eli Lilly and AbbVie in 2017. But IBD's 44-company Medical-Ethical Drugs industry group is down 19% for the year.The resignations of Hallal and Sinha were effective immediately and come as Alexion preps to wrap an internal audit into its sales practices. Alexion postponed its Q3 filing on Nov. 9 amid the allegations by a former employee.Alexion expects to file its delayed 10-Q form for the period ended Sept. 30 in January. At this point, the investigation hasn't found cause to require Alexion to update its previously-reported results, the company said.Chairman Leonard Bell touted the management shake-up in a statement.""This leadership transition comes during a period of great strength and momentum,"" he said. ""The fundamentals of Alexion are very strong. We have three highly effective therapies and a robust rare disease pipeline.

142,HON,"Ask a harried air traveler about the basics of modern flight, and you'll probably elicit surprise when they discover commercial airplanes fly only as fast as they did in the 1950s. Given the range of aerospace advances in the past half-century, plus the technological leaps in almost every other area of human endeavor, it seems reasonable to ask: Why can't we fly faster?That's the question driving a startup called Boom Technology, which says it's time to bring supersonic jet travel into the mainstream — in a modern way. The company is pursuing speed with an audacious idea: a 45-seat aircraft that cruises at Mach 2.2, or 1,451 miles per hour — faster than the defunct Concorde and certainly faster than the standard 550 mph. Fares would be no more expensive than a current business-class round trip, which ranges between $5,000 and $10,000.Yet long before travelers can marvel at a quick hop across the Atlantic, Boom will need to sell the airlines not just on a technically disruptive aircraft, but also on one that can accomplish such feats of velocity cost-effectively. It must earn a solid profit — no middling returns allowed — and this, of course, has been a key reason the Concorde was an aberration rather than the harbinger of universal supersonic travel.Boom is likely to encounter deep skepticism in a conservative industry that still relies heavily on a fundamental airplane design devised 70 years ago. The major global airlines Boom will court operate with two cardinal maxims: It's really hard to make money with small airplanes, and it's really, really hard to make money with supersonic airplanes, which are renowned for their fuel inefficiency.""I have no problem seeing the demand for this airplane,"" says Marty St. George, a JetBlue Airways (JBLU) executive and industry veteran. ""The issue is can you do it and make the numbers work?""Boom will face a numerical gauntlet as it seeks to sell airlines on the advantages of a small, supersonic craft, with airlines posing tough questions about weight, range, fuel burn, maintenance, dispatch reliability, and dozens of other issues. The company also plans for its aircraft to fly on three engines, a departure from the industry trend of using two engines as the most efficient configuration.In response to skeptics, Boom touts its design as a radical update of the troubled Concorde, which was operated by only two airlines over 27 years — Air France and British Airways. Airlines no longer abide such loud, kerosene-gulping equipment, which means new engine designs must be fuel-efficient and coupled with meager emissions and low noise.Boom has diagnosed Concorde's operating flaws as twofold. First, the plane had ferociously high operating costs, driven primarily by its voracious appetite for jet fuel.""Grossly uneconomic,"" in the words of a 1978 New York Times article summarizing critiques of the aircraft. Second, the Concorde's load factors were generally lean because of the steep fares Air France and British Airways were forced to charge, typically around $15,000 to $20,000 in current dollars.Boom says it plans to address all of these shortcomings. The startup's signature city pairing is New York to London, which would take a little more than three hours to fly and give a corporate traveler the opportunity to make a day trip across the pond and back. ""Leave New York at 6 a.m., make afternoon and dinner meetings in London, and be home to tuck your kids into bed,"" the suburban Denver-based company says on its website. A flight from San Francisco to Tokyo could be completed in five and a half hours, Boom says.""It's about making the economics work and then delivering the aircraft we say we can deliver,"" says Boom's co-founder and chief executive officer, Blake Scholl, a pilot and former app developer.Boom has struck a deal with the Spaceship Co., the manufacturing division of Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic, to use that company's engineering, design, and flight-test support services. The Spaceship Co. also has options for Boom's first 10 aircraft as part of the arrangement.""Richard has long expressed interest in developing high speed flight and building high speed flight R&D through Virgin Galactic and our manufacturing organization,"" Christine Choi, spokeswoman for Virgin Group (VA), said in an email. ""It is still early days and just the start of what you'll hear about our shared ambitions and efforts.""Another unidentified European airline has taken options for 15 aircraft, Scholl says, and Boom is talking to carriers about options for an additional 170 aircraft. An analysis by Boyd Group International, an aviation consulting firm, suggested that Boom could sell 1,300 supersonic passenger jets over 10 years for a premium service on routes frequented by corporate traffic.Boom's aircraft would target such global business centers as Hong Kong, London, New York, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo, where corporate travelers would likely pay for the time savings a supersonic jet could afford.Boom says the plane would work on more than 500 routes. The company won't disclose a delivery date publicly but says it expects its first airplane to be ready in ""the early 2020s."" One potential tool to attract buyers will be the prospect of penalty payments, which are widely used by manufacturers to compensate customers if engines or aircraft fall short of guarantees. ""If were guaranteed the numbers, someone will try it,"" says JetBlue's St. George.""With the operational costs they are expecting for this airplane … current business-class fares could make this airplane profitable,"" says consultant Michael Boyd in a telephone interview. ""It passed the smell test on this end. This wasn't like a group of Star Trek geeks.""The company will be forced to demonstrate that whatever positive performance data its models yield in computer simulations, the planes will hold up in the real and very brutal world of airline economics. That will require extensive flight testing so that Boom can move beyond the ""paper airplane"" stage, according to St. George. ""You can do a lot of modeling with software these days before the thing flies … but until you actually see it, you never really know,"" he says.Boom plans to fly a one-third-size demonstrator version of its airplane called the XB-1 late next year, working with General Electric (GE). It's aiming to initially fly GE's J85 engines, a model that dates to the 1950s, on the XB-1. Flights will begin at subsonic speeds and then get progressively faster. Boom has hired Honeywell International (HON) for avionics and environmental control systems.The biggest technical challenge, however, will probably be the engine, as noted in a recent analysis by Bjorn Fehrm, an aerospace consultant and a former fighter pilot in the Swedish air force. Fehrm estimated that the Boom design is likely to use about three times the amount of fuel per seat-mile than current flights between London and New York.""Would some buy some as flagship aircraft for high-yield routes?"" asks Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group. ""L.A.-Tokyo, New York-London? Sure, I imagine they would. But, again, it comes down to seat-mile costs, and until we see anything resembling engine specifications, you can't even begin to guess at that.""For development work on the production model's engines, Boom is talking with ""all the usual suspects,"" Scholl says. The company plans to use a proven commercial engine core — the GEnx and Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 power plants on Boeing's (BA) 787 are among ""multiple good options"" — and then modify that engine's turbofan and composite blades, he says. That approach will require regulatory certification as a new engine, which adds to the overall development cost.""In essence, you're taking an engine that has a big fan and putting a medium-size fan on it that's more appropriate"" for the Boom design, Scholl says. Still, all of Boom's engine work involves ""refinement"" of components that have been proven and flown and carry ""a known certification path"" for regulators, he says. ""There's nothing technically impossible here.""Scholl declined to say how much research work an engine manufacturer would have to invest in this project, but the market is almost 4,000 engines, based on the Boyd analysis. Major engine makers would probably be drawn to a business that size.Beyond the engine performance, another issue for airlines would be how to market an upscale supersonic service alongside the premium cabins on existing jets, according to Alex Wilcox, chief executive of JetSuite Inc., a California-based charter service and scheduled airline. Would the Boom aircraft siphon off most or all of a carrier's business- and first-class passengers? If so, what happens to that space on the current aircraft fleets?""You'd have some interesting pricing discussions,"" Wilcox says. ""How do you price it vs. your first-class product into London? Into which you have invested quite a lot, by the way.""Being up in the air is fast becoming the same as being in the office, with robust internet communication a priority for carriers, thus reducing the biggest attraction of supersonic flight — speed. Mix that with the flat beds and premium dining, and the business-class cabin can become a comfortable den in which to be productive, rested, and well-fed on the kind of 15- to 20-hour flights that are quickly becoming routine.""You used to be stuck in a tube,"" says Teal Group's Aboulafia. ""Now it's an office in the sky. Everything has gotten way more comfortable."" Many people now flying for the better part of a day adopt a ""Who cares?"" attitude.Despite the challenges Boom faces, and they are many, aviation experts expect that at some point, years from now, the economic challenges of commercial supersonic travel will be overcome.""I hate to sound cynical here, because I actually want to see this airplane,"" says Wilcox. ""But it's just very, very hard to do.""

143,HON,"Wall Street analysts continue to trim their iPhone X build forecasts for this year as Apple's (AAPL) contract manufacturers struggle with production issues.XOn Tuesday, Credit Suisse cut its iPhone shipment targets through next year with unit estimates for 2017 and 2018 to 217 million and 233 million, respectively. That's down from the brokerage's May estimate of 223 million and 248 million units. It implies no growth in 2017 and 7% growth in 2018.Credit Suisse attributed the cuts in 2017 to the ""lower-than-estimated ramp of iPhone X build."" Its 2018 iPhone shipment cut reflects the impact of higher-than-expected average selling prices for the new iPhone models, including the iPhone 8 series and iPhone X, which could dampen demand.Credit Suisse analysts Manish Nigam and Camille Xu cut their price targets on Apple contract manufacturers Hon Hai, Pegatron and Wistron, which are traded on the Taiwan Stock Exchange.Apple stock was up a fraction to close at 160.47 on the stock market today.On Monday, Susquehanna Financial Group lowered its iPhone build forecasts for the September and December quarters by several million units because of iPhone X assembly snags.""Our recent checks suggest the main issue with iPhone X assembly is poor manufacturing yields associated with the transmitter and receiver used in 3D sensors,"" Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini said in a report. ""This has led to a total iPhone X unit shipment forecast of 37 million in second-half 2017 vs. prior expectation of 47 million.""IBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has been forming a cup base with a buy point of 165.04 for the past seven weeks. For more analysis of Apple stock, visit the IBD Stock Checkup.Susquehanna now expects Apple to ship 23 million iPhone 8 series and iPhone X handsets in the September quarter, vs. its prior expectation of 25 million. For the December quarter, it now predicts 63 million units, vs. the prior target of 65 million.Susquehanna cut its target for total iPhone shipments, which includes older models, to 45 million units in the September quarter and 69 million in the December quarter, vs. earlier targets of 46.5 million and 71 million, respectively.The iPhone X goes on sale Nov. 3 after a week of preorders. It is the first iPhone to use an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display instead of a liquid crystal display (LCD). OLED screens boast richer colors, truer blacks, a faster refresh rate and lower power usage.The push-out in iPhone X shipments could limit or remove the upside to OLED emitter sales for supplier Universal Display (OLED) in the second half of 2017, Hosseini said.However, 2018 looks good for Universal Display as more smartphones adopt OLED displays and production ramps up, Hosseini said. Samsung is rumored to be releasing its OLED-screen Galaxy S9 smartphone early in 2018, while Chinese smartphone vendors also are shifting to OLED screens, he said.Universal Display added 1.1% to close at 136.95.On Monday, KeyBanc Capital Markets said shares of iPhone chip suppliers are likely to be ""range-bound"" until the production issues are worked out.""Until supply constraints ease on the iPhone X, we see limited catalysts for the Apple supply chain,"" KeyBanc analyst John Vinh said in a report.Stocks impacted by the iPhone X include Broadcom (AVGO), Cirrus Logic (CRUS) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), he said.Broadcom gets about 15% to 20% of its sales from Apple. Cirrus Logic gets about 80% of its revenue from Apple. Skyworks gets roughly 40% of its sales from Apple.Broadcom lost 1.6% to end the regular trading session at 242.62. Cirrus climbed 1.9%, near 54.83, and Skyworks was up a fraction to finish at 107.35.RELATED:Apple Stock Gets An Upgrade On Move To Higher-Margin iPhonesApple iPhone X Deliveries Could Be 2 Months After Preorders

The S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.5%. Weakness in solar energy, some software, fiber optics and smaller retailers contributed to the Nasdaq's drop.XVolume was lower from Wednesday's totals, according to early figures.The day's breakouts included several industrial giants, although weak volume made some questionable.General Dynamics (GD) edged past the 206 entry of a flat base, but the price gain of less than 1% and light volume made the move to new highs suspicious.Union Pacific (UNP) cleared the 115.25 buy point of a 21-week base. Volume was about one-third less than average, and the the past couple of breakouts have not engendered big price gains for the rail company.Honeywell (HON) broke out of a flat base, rising past its 140.31 buy point. Volume was more than 50% higher than usual, a robust increase.Meanwhile, a buyout in the building materials industry caused ripple effects in that sector.Ireland-based CRH (CRH) agreed to acquire privately-held Ash Grove Cement in a $3.5 billion deal. The news seemed to fan hopes for more mergers in the field.U.S. Concrete (USCR) rose more than 1% in above-average volume.

146,HON,"General Electric (GE) may have to sell more assets to maintain its current dividend as it battles weak cash flow, and GE investors should brace for more pain after a tough year so far, according to a JPMorgan Chase analyst.XThe industrial conglomerate's fundamentals are ""worse than we think,"" JPMorgan's Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients Thursday. Against that backdrop, he believes GE's prized dividends are safe ""for now"" — but likely not without some tough decisions.""GE is already below break-even when it comes to funding the dividend with ongoing free cash flow, with compounding risk if fundamentals come in worse than expectations,"" Tusa wrote. ""Our sense is that GE will sell assets to plug the near-term hole.""But a Morningstar analyst noted in July that Industrial free cash flow turned positive in GE's second quarter at over $700 million, rebounding from the first quarter's negative $2.2 billion.GE could raise $13 billion to $14 billion by selling assets in transportation as well as energy/lighting and renewables, and ""some smaller businesses within larger segments that most people have never heard of"" also could be dumped, Tusa said.He made note of difficult transportation trends into 2018, including weak locomotive demand in the freight markets, and of low cash margins in energy and renewables.But if GE's businesses suffer further in a tougher macro climate, the dividend would be highly vulnerable, ""meaning GE is not a safety stock,"" Tusa — described by Bloomberg as a consistent GE bear — wrote.GE didn't respond to a request for comment.GE's high dividend payouts — the stock currently has a 3.96% yield — have made it attractive to income investors. Many believe the dividend is safe, with the 125-year-old company merely suffering a short-term setback rather than more permanent distress.But others have recently questioned the safety and sustainability of GE's dividends. A Deutsche Bank analyst warned in May that GE's weak cash flow could mean a cut in dividends, prompting a forceful GE rebuttal.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric shares hit a post-financial crisis high in July 2016, but GE has been underperforming the S&P 500 index for the past five years, or even as far back as 2000. Here is how the Relative Strength Line can help you pick the best stocks to invest in.In his note, Tusa maintained an underweight rating on GE stock and a year-end price target of 22.GE shares crumbled 3.6% Thursday after the JPMorgan Chase report and extended losses Friday and Monday morning. GE pegged a fresh two-year intraday low of 23.58 Friday.GE stock is down about 25% year to date, by far the worst performer on the Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow itself is up more than 10% so far in 2017.GE's tumbling share price has flattered its dividend yield, but that's small comfort to investors who have held the stock on the way down.New CEO John Flannery is expected to present his vision for the future in November as well as a potential reset of GE's earnings-per-share targets. One analyst recently suggested that Flannery may shed the health care unit as he puts the company's vast-but-streamlined portfolio under review.Under former CEO Jeff Immelt, GE cut loose its financial and certain consumer units and returned to its industrial core, which include the power, aviation, energy and transportation segments. But those measures failed to revive investor confidence in the company's overall strategy, leading to Immelt's exit this year.Meanwhile, industrial peer 3M (MMM) rose 0.6%, finding resistance at its 50-day moving average within a flat-base consolidation. Honeywell (HON) added 0.4%, Siemens (SIEGY) slipped 0.9% and United Technologies (UTX) shed 0.4%.3M and United Technologies, which this week agreed to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for $30 billion including debt, are Dow components like GE.RELATED:This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEODow Jones Industrial Average And Dow Stocks: News And AnalysisBest Stocks To Buy And Watch

150,HON,"Quick! Name a good Taiwanese stock.If Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) was the first to pop into your head, you're in sync with the iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF.That's not just because Taiwan Semiconductor is the best recognized Taiwanese company, but also because the stock is the largest portion of the exchange traded fund. Taiwan Semi accounts for a hefty 25% of the fund's portfolio, dwarfing most of the other 90-plus holdings.While that's a lot of eggs in the iShares Taiwan ETF basket, it's turned out to be a good bet. Shares of the chipmaker have been on a steady ascent this year, reaching record highs last month after surpassing the previous peak of January 2000.The ETF uses the company's Taipei-traded shares rather than the American depositary receipts, but both stocks mirror each other quite well. The U.S. and Taiwan shares are pulling back to the 50-day moving average for the third time since breaking out to new highs in June. Both charts bear a resemblance to iShares MSCI Taiwan ETF this year, which is up 20% in 2016.What about the other 75% of the fund?More than 8% is invested in Hon Hai Precision, a stock that surged as much as 31% from its May lows but has retreated back to a prior resistance level. The company is unfamiliar to most U.S. investors, but it is also known as Foxconn, one of the largest contract manufacturers of electronics in the world. Foxconn is one of the principal suppliers for Apple (AAPL) products; its other major customers include Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE), Sony (SNE) and Cisco Systems (CSCO).Largely due to Taiwan Semi's big weighting, 60% of the fund is in technology stocks. Some 16% is financials and materials make up less than 10%.The Taiwan Stock Exchange is up nearly 9% this year, putting it well ahead the Nikkei and the mainland Chinese indexes, which are down about 10%. Taiwan also is outperforming the Hong Kong Hang Seng Index.""The primary drivers of this rally have been more macro-related than fundamentally driven, as earnings growth in Taiwan has increased in line with the broader emerging markets, but valuations in Taiwan have richened faster than the emerging market asset class as a whole,"" says Tushar Yadava, investment strategist at BlackRock's (BLK) iShares.On Nov. 30, the fund will start tracking the MSCI Taiwan 25/50 Index. It is quite similar to the current MSCI Taiwan Index, but the new one caps the largest holding, i.e., Taiwan Semi, at 25% of the portfolio. It also limits the sum of all companies with at least a 5% weighting in the index at no more 50%. The change is to better reflect rules on diversification, which the fund already has been following, iShares says. The caps are applied at quarterly rebalancings, so there may be some drift in between.The IBD ETF Leaders index shows the performance of a model portfolio of exchange traded funds that are leading the overall market.

152,HON,"General Electric (GE) on Friday cut its full-year organic growth outlook, making it the latest industrial to offer a cloudier forecast amid a sluggish global economy.Despite a rebound in oil prices, management sees GE's oil and gas business to remain weak, though the strong dollar should have less of an impact.The company said it now anticipates full-year organic growth being flat to up 2%, compared with a forecast for 2%-4% the company stuck with during its second-quarter earnings call in July. Back then, the company said it expected strong organic growth in the second half of the year.General Electric held to the midpoint of its earnings-per-share guidance for 2016, but narrowed its outlook. The company said it expects full-year EPS of $1.48-$1.52, compared to an earlier forecast for $1.45-$1.55. Analysts see $1.49. A tough foreign exchange environment continues to weigh on the company.The industrial conglomerate also upped its stock repurchase program by $4 billion.GE shares fell as low as 28.33 on the stock market today, undercutting the low end of the flat base that was forming, but recovered to closed down just 0.3% at 28.98. Honeywell (HON), which reported earnings in line with views, rose 0.8%.Prospects for the industrial sector are looking grimmer. Honeywell earlier this month cut its profit and sales outlook, partly on aerospace woes. Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) also warned on financial results, in part due to a weaker economy.General Electric's Q3 earnings per share rose 10% to 32 cents, topping views for 30 cents. Revenue rose 4% to $29.27 billion, missing estimates for $29.64 billion.Industrial segment organic revenue rose 1%. Oil and gas revenue fell 25%, with the effect of low oil prices still making its way through the energy sector. Power unit revenue jumped 37%, and aviation revenue rose 5%.Organic industrial orders fell 6% during the quarter.

153,HON,"The push by Google-controlled Nest into home security products and services shouldn't worry investors in Alarm.com (ALRM), says one Wall Street analyst.XNest — operated by Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google — on Wednesday rolled out Nest Secure, a do-it-yourself $499 system. It includes a hub/motion sensor, two door/window sensors, and two key fobs to arm and disarm the system. A version with a camera that will cost $599. It's expected to be available in November.Nest customers can also buy monitoring services from Moni Smart Security, a customer of Alarm.com.""We do not expect the fact that Moni, one of Alarm.com's largest customers, is providing the professional monitoring service for Nest to be a big headwind to Alarm.com,"" said Bhavan Suri, a William Blair analyst in a report. ""In our view, Moni would rather push its own service (which is run on Alarm.com) vs. Nest due to better monetization and a direct relationship with the customer.""Shares in Alarm.com, ranked No. 14 in the IBD 50 roster of fast-growing companies, slipped 0.6% to close at 44.63 on the stock market today. Alarm.com stock has jumped 60% in 2017.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.ADT, another alarm-monitoring company, is also a customer of Tyson, Va.-based Alarm.com.Alarm.com faces competition from Honeywell (HON) as well as Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T), which have home security services.Google acquired Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion.

155,HON,"United Technologies (UTX) is reportedly within days of clinching a deal to buy Rockwell Collins (COL) for more than $20 billion, potentially combining two aerospace supplier giants.XThe companies are discussing a per-share price of about 140 for Rockwell Collins, which just closed its acquisition of B/E Aerospace earlier this year, sources told the Wall Street Journal. A deal could come as soon as this weekend.Shares of Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, closed up 2.1% at 130.71 on the stock market today, after rising as much as 5.7% to 135.31 earlier in the day. United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, climbed 2.9% to 118.70. General Electric (GE), which also makes engines and supplies aerospace companies, slipped 0.1%. Boeing (BA) edged up 1.4%, while Airbus (EADSY) lost 1.5%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Aerospace suppliers have come under market scrutiny lately. In April, Third Point, the activist hedge fund run by Dan Loeb issued a letter calling for Honeywell (HON) to spin off its aerospace unit, which is the industrial conglomerate's largest segment by revenue.A deal would also come as Boeing looks to ramp up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.RELATED:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing Stays Mysterious As Details Set To Emerge On Airbus A321 KillerHoneywell Has This Retort For Activist Investor Pushing Aerospace Spinoff

156,HON,"Boeing (BA) indicated Tuesday it may try to block United Technologies' (UTX) acquisition of Rockwell Collins (COL), as the jet maker looks to keep it market share in the lucrative maintenance and repair business.XBoeing has reportedly been critical of mergers in the past and — along European rival Airbus (EADSY) — privately lobbied against United Tech's efforts early last year to buy another aerospace supplier, Honeywell, according to the Wall Street Journal.""We intend to take a hard look at the proposed combination of United Technologies and Rockwell Collins,"" Boeing said according to Aviation Week. ""Until we receive more details, we are skeptical that it would be in the best interest of—or add value to—our customers and industry.""If Boeing determines the deal is ""inconsistent"" with its interests, ""we would intend to exercise our contractual rights and pursue the appropriate regulatory options to protect our interests,"" the company warned.The deal comes as Boeing looks to ramp up its parts sales and services business, which provides maintenance and technical support and was launched on July 1.""We believe this deal is partly in response to the increased pricing pressure from the leading aerospace OEMs (Airbus and Boeing) and the increased push by the leading OEMs, notably Boeing, into the commercial aftermarket, traditionally the source of most industry profits and cash flow,"" said Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert said in a note Tuesday.On Monday, United Tech announced it would buy aircraft supplier Rockwell for $140 a share, with $93.33 a share in cash and the rest in stock for a total deal of $23 billion. Including assumed debt, the deal's enterprise value is $30 billion.The combination of United Tech, whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, and Rockwell, which makes cockpit and communications systems, is seen as one of the biggest aerospace deals ever. United Tech shares sank 4.8% to 112.28 on the stock market today. Rockwell shares were up 0.5% at 131.26, well below the bid price. Boeing slipped 1.2%, and Honeywell lost 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term. Meanwhile, United Tech might not be done shaking up its business. The company needs to break up some of its assets to ""unlock the conglomerate discount and bring this deal to its ultimate logic,"" according to Vertical Research Partners analyst Jeff Sprague.In a note out Tuesday, Sprague wrote that a spin-off of United Tech's buildings units, which includes Carrier air conditioning and Otis elevators, ""could unlock upwards of $20/share in value"" and would be ""the logical conclusion"" to the Rockwell transaction.He pointed out that United Tech said in its press release that it will ""have an opportunity to explore a full range of strategic options,"" a sign the company might already be looking at the deal.M&A activity in the aerospace sector has heated up recently. Rockwell  had just closed its takeover of B/E Aerospace, while Honeywell (HON) has been under pressure to spin off its aerospace unit.RELATED: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing Stays Mysterious As Details Set To Emerge On Airbus A321 KillerHoneywell Has This Retort For Activist Investor Pushing Aerospace Spinoff

157,HON,"As General Electric (GE) steps up efforts to cut costs and boost profits, the industrials giant may sell a stake in the industrial software unit that served as a linchpin of ex-CEO Jeff Immelt's ""digital industrial"" vision but proved a drag on GE stock.XNew chief executive John Flannery is contemplating expanded partnerships and the possible sale of some equity in the unit, Reuters reported, citing people familiar with the business.Immelt — who bowed out of the Uber leadership race in a Sunday tweet — reportedly spent six years and poured more than $4 billion into efforts to infuse GE's core industrial businesses with technology. But revenue and returns fell short of expectations, and the Predix industrial software platform was dogged by problems this spring, according to Reuters.I have decided not to pursue a leadership position at Uber. I have immense respect for the company & founders — Travis, Garrett and Ryan.— Jeff Immelt (@JeffImmelt) August 27, 2017But those problems have now been fixed, the report added, and GE will focus on sales to existing customers in its energy, aviation and oil-and-gas businesses, while paring back sales efforts to new customers in other sectors.IBD'S TAKE: GE is a laggard among Dow stocks this year. But the Dow's top stock may be offering a new entry point.""Our resources will go to our fastest-selling markets,"" GE Digital Chief Executive Officer Bill Ruh told Reuters in an interview.Additionally, to help investors better understand Predix and avoid double-counting, GE has redefined digital revenue to shut out certain hardware sales and emphasize ""pure"" software sales.As a result, GE officials now anticipate $12 billion in digital revenue in 2020 vs. $15 billion earlier.The Predix platform — a cloud-based operating system for what GE calls the industrial internet — outfits turbines, jet engines wind farms and medical equipment with data-collecting sensors and then analyzes that data to analyze performance, cut costs or create new businesses for GE customers.GE estimates the market could be worth $225 billion market by 2020.Shares were unchanged at 24.49 in morning trade on the stock market today.

158,HON,"Since July 21, the day before General Electric (GE) reported second-quarter results, the conglomerate's shares have lost around 10% of their value.Even though earnings per share and sales jumped during that quarter, orders fell 16% organically, and industrial organic revenue missed some expectations. Revenue in the company's oil and gas segment sank 22%, with low oil prices continuing to hurt the business. Lower commodity carloads in North America hurt the company's transportation segment. A difficult foreign exchange environment also weighed.On the second-quarter earnings call, CEO Jeff Immelt said General Electric faced a ""slow growth and volatile environment."" However, he added that GE was ""positioned for strong organic growth in the second half.""For the third quarter and further out, analysts will be looking to see if GE can deliver on that position. Wall Street expects General Electric's Q3 earnings per share to rise 3% to 30 cents on revenue up 6% to $29.636 billion. But industrial orders and organic revenue will watched closely.Investors will likely also be watching for continued strength in the company's aviation and power segments.And oil prices have rebounded, potentially shoring up future demand for GE's oil equipment, or at least stopping the bleeding. Analyst forecasts indicate that the drag the energy sector has put on the S&P 500 in recent quarters could subside in Q4.Immelt in July said that GE's oil and gas segment ""faces major cyclical headwinds but by the second half, they have easier comps."" However, he also said improvement in that segment and GE's transportation business was unlikely next year.IBD'S TAKE: Even as General Electric makes its way through messier short-term conditions, its long-term ambitions are vast. For more information, see this story about GE's plans to become a leader in industrial Internet technology.  Barclays analyst Scott Davis said the third quarter was likely to be ""sloppy"" for industrials, according to commentary cited by Barron's. He added that ""business spending hiccupped"" during the period, though it was unclear why, and that the quarter tends to suffer from seasonal weakness.""Some blame the Presidential election, some just cite recovery uncertainty,"" he said. ""It doesn't appear to be a long-term issue, and we have spoken to folks who have seen more stabilization in October and expect projects to move forward post the U.S. election.""""At this point, however, 2016 seems a lost year and all eyes will likely move toward 2017 order books to see if even a modest recovery is realistic,"" Davis later added.Elsewhere in the sector, Honeywell (HON) this month cut its profit and sales outlook, partly on aerospace woes. Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) also warned on financial results, in part due to a weaker economy.The results will come as General Electric undergoes an evolution into more of an industrial tech and analytics company. While General Electric in September said it plans to buy two European 3D printing companies, a Pacific Crest Securities analyst has said GE probably wouldn't buy 3D Systems (DDD).General Electric rose 0.3% to 69.42 in the stock market today, after falling last week to its lowest level in nearly eight months.

161,HON,"Manufacturer Dover (DOV) on Monday cut its full-year sales and profit forecasts, due in part to weakness in some oil and gas markets, and a global economy that it expects to remain sluggish, adding to similar warnings from industrials like Honeywell (HON) and PPG Industries (PPG).Dover — which makes equipment that helps oil and gas producers, as well as refrigeration equipment — slashed its full-year earnings per share forecast to $3.00-$3.05 from an earlier outlook for $3.35-$3.45. Dover also now sees full-year revenue down 4% to 5%, compared to earlier guidance for a 3%-5% decline.Analysts see EPS of $3.34 on a 1.3% revenue decline.""The primary factors driving this revision are generally weaker capital spending across several industrial end-markets, continued weakness in longer cycle oil & gas exposed markets, and continued headwinds in our retail refrigeration business related to production inefficiencies,"" the company said in a statement.Shares sank 7.7% to close at 66.69 in the stock market today, breaching support at their 50-day line and nearly blowing through the bottom of a cup base after climbing closer to a breakout last week. Among other diversified manufacturers, General Electric (GE) fell 0.8% and United Technologies (UTX) lost 0.6%.Dover also said it would complete its acquisition of Wayne Fueling Systems in the first quarter of 2017, later than initially expected, due to U.K. regulators' concerns over competition. In June, the company said that acquisition would likely close in the back half of 2016.Dover's downbeat forecast comes after Honeywell late Thursday trimmed its own full-year guidance, saying a weaker oil industry, along with struggles in emerging markets, have hurt aircraft demand.IBD'S TAKE: Even as energy markets remain a concern, IBD's Oil & Gas U.S. Exploration and Production group has surged to the second best among 197 groups tracked.

162,HON,"WASHINGTON — Qatar Airways announced a deal for up to 100 airplanes from Boeing (BA) on Friday, but it's still too early to tell if the 10 777s that the Mideast carrier ordered will be enough to keep production levels for the widebody jet steady.The $18.6 billion deal includes a firm order for 30 787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ER aircraft as well as options to buy up to 60 737 Max 8 jets.Boeing shares dipped 0.4% to close at 133.85 in the stock market today, after aerospace supplier Honeywell (HON) cut guidance, citing weaker business jet and general aviation shipments. U.S.-listed shares of rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 1.9%.Raymond Conner, chief executive of Boeing's commercial division, said at a press briefing that while the order for 10 777s is ""big,"" the company would have to ""wait and see"" if another production cut is needed, depending on where the airplanes fall in the delivery stream.The aerospace giant had already announced that it is cutting production of the widebody jet to 7 per month in 2017, down from 8.3 per month currently. But that production pace is threatened by slumping sales.Boeing hopes to maintain a certain level of output of its current-generation 777s to engineer a seamless transition on its production lines as workers shift to the next-generation 777X in the coming years. But customers have been reluctant to buy the older design, preferring to wait for the newer one.In a note Friday before Boeing's announcement, Cowen analysts wrote that a 777 rate cut is likely ""even with Mideast orders,"" saying the deal with Qatar Air and an order from Iran for 15 777s probably won't be enough to fill gaps in the delivery schedule. Boeing still needs 777 orders for 2019-2021 as its first 777X deliveries don't start until 2020, Cowen said.IBD'S TAKE: Boeing was initiated with an outperform rating on strong cash flow and solid shareholder returns, but 777 weakness and increased competition from Airbus' A320 family are major risks to the stock's performance. Friday's announcement came just weeks after the White House approved the sale of military planes to Qatar.Qatar Airways Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker said the commercial deal was ""independent"" of any military deal. But sources told Reuters that Friday's order was delayed to try and speed up White House approval for Boeing to sell F-15 fighter jets to Doha.RELATED:Boeing Eyes Options For Larger 737 Max 9 To Challenge A321neoAirbus Deliveries Are On Track; Boeing Rival Signs Vietnamese Orders

Both Halliburton and Schlumberger signaled their put profits ahead of market share.Honeywell and Schlumberger shares broke out Wednesday on the former's earnings, but Schlumberger fell back into its base Friday after its own results.General Electric (GE) cut its full-year organic growth outlook, after industrials like Honeywell (HON), Dover (DOV) and PPG Industries (PPG) had previously warned on Q3 results amid a sluggish global economy. Third-quarter EPS topped, but overall revenue missed and organic industrial orders fell.GE shares initially fell to an eight-month low Friday morning, but closed the week fractionally higher.The nation's largest insurer sailed past third-quarter earnings estimates Tuesday, raised its 2016 earnings forecast, and indicated that it would likely boost 2017 guidance next month. Earnings per share climbed 23% to $2.17 vs. the expected $2.08, due to a drop in medical costs as a share of premiums and strong growth in its Optum health services unit, which has seen revenue growth of 34% year to date. Overall revenue rose 12% from a year ago to $46.3 billion, topping estimates of $46.09 billion.UnitedHealth (UNH) rose 8.55% to 145.37 for the week, above a 144.58 buy point.Existing-home sales jumped in September after pulling back from cycle highs over the prior two months. Housing starts fell sharply yet again, but single-family starts jumped and building permits were strong. Homebuilder sentiment dipped in Oct. but remains high.Meanwhile, the Fed's Beige Book report said the economy is generally positive, with tight labor markets lifting wages. The Philly Fed manufacturing index rose.Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS) got a lift from their bond-trading desks during the third quarter, with Brexit-related activity and easy comparisons from a year ago likely helping. All three banks topped earnings-per-share and revenue estimates. All three stocks enjoyed solid weekly gains.

165,HON,"Stocks ended the week with modest losses Friday as Wall Street mulled a lukewarm September jobs report and lowered guidance from Honeywell (HON).The U.S. economy added 156,000 jobs in September, just below the consensus estimate of 168,000. The unemployment rate ticked higher to 5%.The S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite lost 0.3%, while the Dow Jones industrial average eased 0.2%. The Nasdaq ended the week just above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 ended the week below its 50-day line, and the Dow marked its fifth straight weekly close below the line.

Acacia closed below its 50-day line for the first time since it came public in May.Among retailers, Burlington Stores (BURL) bucked the trend, rising nearly 2%. It's showing supporting action around its 10-week moving average after a breakout from a long consolidation in late May. Gap (GPS), meanwhile, gapped up over its 50- and 200-day moving averages, rising 15% after the company reported better-than-expected sales in September. Deutsche Bank upgraded shares to hold from sell.Arris International (ARRS) also bucked the trend, rising nearly 7% to 29.65. After a pullback to its 50-day moving average, it's back above a 29.04 entry. Arris struck a deal with Charter Communications (CHTR) that gives Charter a warrant to purchase up to 6 million shares of Arris stock, but only after Charter buys a certain amount of products from Arris.Alcoa (AA) kicks of Q3 earnings season in the coming week when it reports Tuesday before the open.

166,HON,"Honeywell (HON) fell sharply Friday after the aerospace and building systems industrial giant cut profit and sales forecasts, citing weaker business jet and general aviation shipments.Honeywell warned late Thursday that it sees full-year earnings per share of $6.60-$6.64, down from its prior forecast of $6.60-$6.70. It now sees core organic sales down 1%-2% vs. the prior target for a 1% decline.Slumps in emerging markets and the oil industry have crimped demand for business aircraft and helicopters, CEO Dave Cote said on a Friday morning conference call. Aerospace sales fell 6% to $3.6 billion in Q3, with Honeywell expecting weakness continuing into 2017.Demand for hand-held scanners from logistics firms also hasn't been strong, Honeywell said.Honeywell plunged 7.5% to close at 106.94 Friday, crashing below its 200-day moving average and hitting a seven-month low of 105.25 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: There's aerospace and then there's space.

United Tech seemed to drop in sympathy with Honeywell (HON), which plunged 8% after it cut guidance.Volume was tracking below Thursday's levels at the same time.Many of the interest rate-sensitive stocks that had been getting hammered — namely metals, utilities and real estate investment trusts — were the best performing in early trading. Fiber optics, defense, enterprise software and chip equipment were leading industry groups that were among the morning's weakest.Fiber optics play Acacia Communications (ACIA) was a leading stock facing a storm as shares gapped down in heavy trading. The company's share offering was priced at 100 each, which sent the stock reeling to as low as 100.75. However, Acacia found support at the 50-day moving average and is staying above the offering price, down nearly 5% to 104.24.U.S. employers added 156,000 jobs in September, modestly below expectations of 168,000, the Labor Department said Friday.

170,HON,"When you leave home, do you worry that you left a door unlocked or forgot to set the alarm, and subsequently wasted large portions of your life driving all the way back to double-check?Alarm.com (ALRM) thinks it has a fix for you.XThe company, which develops cloud-based security and automation technology for homes and businesses, has brought in a lot of sales taking on the anxieties and the obsessive-compulsive urges that have worn on homeowners' minds since, well, homeownership was a thing. So shares of the company, which analysts say was an early adopter of smart-home technology, have risen roughly 150% since they began trading in 2015.The stock's charge also has been helped by a deal, announced last year and closed this year, that has made home-security giant ADT among Alarm.com's biggest clients. And as the business of alarm service moves to the cloud from the phone line, analysts say Alarm.com has gotten more revenue from existing customers by offering them an increasing number of ways to monitor their properties, many with the tap of a smartphone.""It's not a new problem that you just drove down to Florida and realized, 'Oh man, I may have left my garage door open,'"" Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt said. ""People were stupid 30 years ago, too, but now we have the technology to fix it.""Along with closing a garage door remotely, Alarm.com customers, through the company's apps, can lock and unlock doors, view who comes to their home's front door and adjust its lights or thermostats. They can adjust devices according to preset or customizable ""scenes"" to increase comfort when they go to bed or want to save energy when they leave the house. A drone that watches over your property? That's also in the works through a collaboration with Qualcomm (QCOM).""Consumers today view home security as a technology solution that's far more useful and valued than traditional systems,"" company spokesman Matt Zartman said in an email.The market research firm Parks Associates estimates that as many as 16 million North American households will have smart-home security by 2021, compared with 10 million forecast for traditional security platforms. As security gets smarter, analysts also see a greater opportunity for Alarm.com to take share in small to medium-sized businesses, vacation homes and medical monitoring — and eventually in overseas markets.""Any type of sensor-based application you can think of, these guys have gotten involved in and they are increasing their capabilities now toward (security of) family, wellness protection, health care, things that the alarm guys didn't think about years ago,"" Imperial Capital analyst Jeff Kessler said.Customers usually are one of the many smaller security-system providers in the country. When one signs on, Alarm.com provides the sensors and software that bring the thermostats, water meters and other parts of a property online. The security company pays a portion of the revenue it gets from customers back to Alarm.com.That approach, in which the provider can use the panels and smart devices they want on top of Alarm.com's software, has proved advantageous. As the company grows and incorporates new features into its system, it has kept support services abundant and operations easy for installers, service staff and users who might not be tech-savvy, Kessler said.In a recent research note, Kessler described a visit to a smart-home demonstration house in Falls Church, Va., noting how easily a ""new associate"" at the company was able to outline the technology's functionality. And he noted its potential compatibility with other existing smart devices.He said that with the touch of a button or a simple command to a virtual assistant, such features could be used to adjust the lighting, temperature and other functions to create ideal environments for sleeping, dinner or watching sports.Shares of Alarm.com also bounded higher this month after it reported second-quarter earnings, helped by 40% growth in its licensing and software-as-a-service sales. Gains in the hardware it sells — including cameras and video-camera doorbells — helped too.Acquisitions have also played an important role for the company. The company in March said it closed the acquisition of a part of Icontrol Networks. That purchase gave it Connect, a company that offers a home-security and automation platform used by ADT Pulse, ADT's own smart security system.""When the company announced the acquisition of Icontrol (last year) the valuation really improved materially,"" McCourt said.Nearly all of Alarm.com's business is in the U.S., but it has expanded its offerings to Latin America, Australia, Turkey, South Africa and elsewhere. Its wellness business, Kessler said, has the potential to become massive. In that segment, the company's services help family members remotely monitor the conditions and activity of loved ones — whether daily routines have changed or if they've been in bed for an abnormally long period — and respond quickly if there's an emergency.IBD'S TAKE: Alarm.com finished in a buy zone Aug. 4 and has kept climbing ever since. The company has a best-possible Composite Rating of 99. To learn more about where the stock and its industry group stand, visit IBD Stock Checkup.However, Kessler said, more established procedures between health insurers, end users and others — among them, who pays for what — would be needed before Alarm.com's wellness business can further take off. And even as the company churns out earnings growth, McCourt said the company is still focused on investing in growth. Analysts see earnings-per-share growth slowing in the next two quarters and declining into the first half of next year before picking back up.But a bigger threat to Alarm.com is, in part, the nature of home security itself, which easily lends itself to do-it-yourself projects. Consumers can buy security cameras, thermostats and lights themselves at a store.""In other words, there are plenty of ways to get home automation in your home,"" McCourt said. ""You don't need to subscribe from an alarm-monitoring company.""However, even amid increased advertising for DIY security setups, property security dealers that work with Alarm.com hadn't seen a major dent in demand during the second quarter, William Blair analyst Bhavan Suri wrote in a research note.""Some of the advertising has actually helped Alarm.com through educating the market about functionality, including video doorbells, which have been a driver of new Alarm.com activations and have had better traction than anticipated,"" he said.Also looming over Alarm.com's prospects are Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google. Alarm.com already allows someone to control home functions in their home via an Apple Watch, and its technology also integrates with the Google's Nest thermostats. But the tech giants' plans for their smart-home technology remain unclear.More directly, the company also faces competition from Honeywell (HON), which has a smart-home service, and bigger threats from telecom giants like Comcast (CMCSA) and AT&T (T). Comcast's XFinity and AT&T's security services allow people to manage their home security via mobile device.The company's Zartman said in his email that he sees ""a lot of partnership opportunities"" with the telecom and tech giants in the near-term. Still, those far bigger companies have more ability to drop into a market and cut prices to draw customers.But amid a broader cord-cutting movement, attrition rates for the cable companies remain high. Building a network that can work with police and paramedics also isn't easy, and false alarms can kill emergency responders' confidence, Kessler said.""Police and medical people and responders are overstressed to begin with, with all these new systems out there,"" he said.Shares of Alarm.com were up 1% in recent trades to 42.63.RELATED:This No. 1 Ranked Security Stock May Unlock New BreakoutComcast Could Partner With Altice To Acquire Charter, Says CitigroupBig Media Just Gave Sports Fans Another Reason To Cut The Cord

171,HON,"General Electric (GE) reported a smaller-than-expected earnings decline early Friday and sees cash flow improving as costs come down, but signaled that weakness in its oil and gas businesses suggest full-year profit will be at the low end of its forecasts. Industrial bedfellow Honeywell (HON) also topped profit and sales views and gave a generally upbeat outlook.X Estimates: Earnings per share to decline 51% to 25 cents as revenue drops 13.1% to $29.12 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. The revenue drop reflects divestitures in part.Results: GE earned 28 cents a share on revenue of $29.56 billion. Organic industrial revenue rose 2%. Power segment revenue grew 5% to $6.97 billion. Renewable energy revenue jumped 17% to $2.46 billion. Healthcare climbed 4% to $4.7 billion. But oil and gas fell 3% to $3.11 billion, and aviation was flat at $6.53 billion. Transportation revenue fell 14% to $1.07 billion. Adjusted industrial operating margin ticked up to 13.2% from 13.1%.Industrial cash flow was $1.5 billion, reversing negative cash flow of $1.6 billion in the prior quarter. Industrial orders climbed 6% from a year ago to $28.3 billion.""We expect cash flow to continue to improve throughout the year,"" said Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt in a statement. ""We've reduced our industrial structural costs year to date by $670 million and we are on track to meet or exceed our $1 billion cost reduction target for the year.""Outlook: GE backed its full-year EPS forecast of $1.60-$1.70 on organic sales growth of 3% to 5%. But CFO Jeff Bornstein said EPS is trending to the bottom end of that $1.60-$1.70 range due to oil and gas weakness. The oil and gas industry has been weaker than expected with oil prices down in 2017. Customers are delaying purchases and hurting legacy businesses.Stock: Shares tumbled to a 21-month low of 25.26 soon after the market open, closing down 2.9% to 25.91 on the stock market today.RBC Capital Markets questioned the quality of GE's Q2 earnings: ""GE's headline 2Q17 operating EPS of $0.28 was nicely above our estimate and consensus of $0.25. That said, underlying quality of earnings was mixed, with the beat driven almost entirely by lower corporate expense and restructuring.""Vertical Research Partners also saw problems in the details, citing weaker-than-expected industrial operating margins and industrial cash flow.On Aug. 1, GE gets its first new chief executive in 16 years, marking the end of the Jeff Immelt era. The diversified conglomerate made several key strategic changes under his leadership, emerging with a much keener focus on its industrial roots and digital operations. However, GE stock has fallen in value over the course of Immelt's tenure and investors have been impatient for change.Estimates: Honeywell is expected to post a 7% gain in EPS to $1.78 as sales dip 1.6% to $9.84 billion.Results: EPS rose to $1.80 as revenue unexpectedly climbed 1% to $10.09 billion. Organic sales rose 3%. Aerospace sales fell 3% to $3.67 billion but were up 2% on an organic basis. Home and building technologies sales rose 2% to $2.74 billion. Performance materials sales fell 8% to $2.24 billion but rose 6% organically, and safety and productivity sales jumped 30% to $1.43 billion, or ticked up 1% organically.Outlook: Honeywell raised its full-year revenue target to $39.3 billion-$40 billion. It raised the low end of its full-year EPS target, moving from $6.90-$7.10 to $7-$7.10, lifting the midpoint by 5 cents.Stock: Honeywell stock initially fell to 133.70 but found support at the 50-day line. Shares closed up 1% to 136.35, retaking a 135.10 buy point.

172,HON,"Dow Jones industrial average component General Electric (GE) reports results Friday for the last quarter presided over by CEO Jeff Immelt. Peer Honeywell (HON) reports the same day.XLong seen as a bellwether for the U.S. economy, GE has seen that image come under a cloud as GE stock languishes near 2015 levels while stocks of peers such as Honeywell, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies[ticker symb=UTX] flirt with all-time highs.GE is the second-worst performer on the Dow so far in 2017, while 3M and United Technologies are enjoying double-digit gains.Investors will be closely watching top-line results, where growth has been elusive for both GE and Honeywell in recent quarters. They also will be hoping GE's report puts it on the path of becoming a turnaround under John Flannery, who becomes the industrial titan's first new CEO in 16 years on Aug. 1.Industrials is the only S&P 500 sector that has seen estimates for second-quarter earnings growth tick up since the start of the quarter in April. Still, it is expected to report tepid 3.1% earnings growth vs. 8.1% for the S&P 500 overall as of July 14, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts at CFRA describe the outlook for the industrial conglomerates subindustry as neutral.""We think industrial activity metrics indicate the industrial economy continues to experience modest expansion and that the global economy is likely to continue to be relatively tepid in 2017,"" CFRA equity analyst Jim Corridore wrote recently.Here is what to watch when GE and Honeywell report. GE's Dow peers United Technologies and 3M are on the dock July 25.Estimates: Earnings per share to decline 51% to 25 cents as revenue drops 13% to $29.12 billion, according to consensus analyst estimates from Zacks Investment Research. The revenue drop reflects divestitures in part.Stock: Shares were down 0.2% at 26.77 on the stock market today, after rebounding 2.4% last week from a 21-month intraday low on July 10.What to watch: Analysts pay attention to organic revenue, which filters out divestitures and some other noise, along with industrial orders. Both of those metrics have been weak in recent quarters.Cash flow will be in focus after spooking investors in the last report. Does GE's big buyback program make sense given weak cash flow?Investors will want to hear about GE's oil and gas segment following that segment's July 7 merger with oil service giant Baker Hughes and Immelt's recent downbeat comments. Are GE's jet engine and other aviation assets performing well, following positive rumblings during the Paris air show? GE's jet engine comments also will be noteworthy for United Technologies, with its big Pratt & Whitney jet engine division.Does GE's 2018 earnings goal of $2 a share still look like a stretch? GE could choose to lower its guidance to clear the decks for new CEO Flannery.Is General Electric on track to reach a $1 billion cost-cutting goal?Estimates: Honeywell is expected to post a 6.6% gain in EPS to $1.77 as sales dip 1.6% to $9.83 billion.Stock: Honeywell stock was down 0.15% Tuesday, dipping below buy range after rising 1.3% last week and setting a record high Friday.What to watch: The performance of its aerospace unit, which an activist investor has pushed to be spun off, given Honeywell recent cautions about corporate and defense demand for jets.RELATED: Fastenal Growth Accelerates, But Industrial Distributors Dive Once AgainNetflix, Microsoft, GE, Lockheed To Amp Up Earnings: Investing Action PlanBig Hits And Misses Of The Current Earnings Season

175,HON,"The 30-year General Electric (GE) veteran poised to take over as the industrial conglomerate's chief executive promised Monday to review every part of a vastly simplified but sprawling portfolio — and the division he currently heads could be next on the GE chopping block, in one analyst's view.John Flannery, president and CEO of GE Healthcare, told analysts on a conference call that he expects to put each component business under the scanner as he prioritizes capital allocation decisions in his new role. An analyst on the call said that could ironically spell trouble for GE's health care unit, which the company itself describes as a core business.""As GE pares down, it's the one business that looks like an outlier,"" Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets told IBD. ""It has big market share and visibility, but at the end of the day, it's not big infrastructure, it's not big heavy iron like locomotives or engines. It has different demand drivers and the fact that (Flannery) ran them does not exclude potential divestiture.""The division, which includes diagnostic imaging and life sciences, also does not have recurring, high-margin service revenue — as aircraft engines do, for example — and health care faces regulatory pressures, Dray pointed out.In his view, Flannery's prior experience leading GE's business development team, which seeks out M&A deals, would make him ""readily adept at maximizing value and structuring potential exits"" — as Flannery did through the 2015 acquisition of Alstom's power and grid business.Shares of GE jumped 3.6% to close at 28.94 on the stock market today, retaking their 10-week moving average for the first time since late April. The stock got a further lift as GE management said it expects this quarter's results to show an improvement over the previous and year-ago quarters as it reaffirmed its 2017 outlook.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) dipped 0.6% to 119.88 to re-enter buy range, Honeywell (HON) eased 0.4% to 133.26 but remains near a 135.20 buy point, while U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) dropped 2%.A divestment of GE's health unit would follow outgoing CEO Jeff Immelt's efforts to shed the company's financial and media units and bring it back to its industrial core, which include the power, aviation, energy and transportation segments.But other analysts don't see much more unloading of business units and instead expect a heightened focus on long-term strategy execution.""In a conglomerate like GE, some parts of the portfolio will always be up for review, but I don't expect large-scale shedding (of business units), to be honest,"" said Morningstar equity analyst Barbara Noverini. ""The company has the building blocks in place to generate healthier earnings than in the past.""Despite Immelt's efforts at streamlining GE, the Dow stock has been under pressure lately, sliding roughly 11% year to date through Friday vs. 9% gains for both the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average. Activist investor Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners reportedly pushed for Immelt's departure earlier this year. In an email Monday, Trian said it had no comment on the leadership change.Research firm CFRA kept its buy rating on GE stock after the announcement. ""We think GE remains on the right track with its strategy and expect share performance to improve in the coming year,"" said CFRA analyst Jim Corridore.RELATED:5 Red Flags From This GE Warning That Sent The Stock To 15-Month LowsWhy General Electric May Miss This Key Earnings Goal Next Year
"
176,HON,"The third quarter could finally be the bottom — after a year of the embattled, oversupplied energy sector pulling earnings of S&P 500 companies into negative terrain.Earnings for S&P 500 companies are forecast to dip 0.5% from a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. Given that actual results usually top analyst forecasts by a couple of percentage points, this could end a four-quarter earnings decline as the hangover from the oil price crash subsides. Revenue is set to grow 2.6%, ending six quarters of declines.Energy earnings are seen plunging 67%, but that's an improvement from declines of 85% in Q2 and an outright loss in Q1. In Q4, energy earnings are expected to see 3.8% growth as crude prices have rebounded from 12-year lows early this year to above $50 a barrel on Thursday. Leaving out the energy sector, S&P 500 earnings are estimated to grow 2.9% in Q3.""The idea is that the worst is behind us,"" said Sheraz Mian, who manages Zacks' equity research department. ""We saw some early tentative signs of improvement in the last earnings season as well, even though growth was in the negative.  . . . But results were nevertheless an improvement over what was expected.""Financials will add a lift, with sector earnings forecast to tick up 1% vs. drops of 4% in Q2 and 12.6% in Q1. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report on Friday, Oct. 14. Most banking stocks — with the notable exception of scandal-hit Wells Fargo — have been rallying in recent weeks on expectations for a Federal Reserve rate hike.Broadly, the estimates reflect easier comparisons, particularly in energy and materials, whose results have slumped with the price of commodities. And the strong dollar still weighed during the quarter. But it didn't weigh as much as it could have because expectations have dimmed over the year for the Fed to be more aggressive about raising interest rates.Expectations in the months to come — including 8.4% earnings growth for Q4 — are higher but obtainable, Thomson Reuters analyst David Aurelio said. But while loftier forecasts typically get revised downward as the reporting season advances, earnings are still likely to grow in Q4 and early 2017 despite lingering economic anxiety.""I think the overall sentiment doesn't seem to have this positive outlook,"" he said. ""But when you look into the numbers, they're telling you a very different story.""The tech sector's earnings are expected to grow 4.5% in Q3 and 10.1% excluding Apple (AAPL), Aurelio said, demonstrating the company's weight in the index. In fact, taking Apple out of the S&P 500 overall would result in a slim 0.1% profit gain.But Aurelio pointed to pockets of resilience in the tech sector outside of Apple, which has been bogged down on concerns about slowing iPhone demand.In particular, he likes the odds of the semiconductor equipment segment, whose earnings are expected to grow 61% amid greater demand for technology that provides efficient memory storage. Applied Materials (AMAT) is among the leaders in the group, with earnings seen jumping more than 125% on nearly 40% revenue growth.""It's historically always been a gauge for where things are going, because it's supplying the equipment to make the devices that go into other devices,"" he said. ""It's supplying the equipment to make the chips.""The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index of stocks has climbed 50% from a mid-February low to a 16-year closing high Thursday.Elsewhere, there are mixed signals. After posting double-digit-percentage earnings gains over the past year, the consumer discretionary sector is poised to slow to only 4.1% growth, according to Thomson Reuters.The expected slowdown comes largely from the auto industry, in particular Ford (F), with its anticipated 51% drop in earnings. The automaker in July indicated that sales could soon hit their peak, amid concerns about discounts and an auto-loan bubble. Take Ford out of the equation, and consumer discretionary's earnings would grow 7.9%, Aurelio said. General Motors' (GM) earnings should dip 4% after several quarters of more than double-digit gains.Amazon (AMZN), which is included in the consumer discretionary group, is seen doing some heavy lifting for the sector, with earnings growth expected to surge 371% in Q3.Elsewhere in the consumer-facing sector, restaurants across the board have warned of less customer spending, and retailers continue to suffer at the hands of Amazon.The materials sector, forecast to rebound to 7.1% earnings growth after a year of declines, is also seen getting a boost from a single heavy lifter.The section's drive into positive territory was due to the copper sub-industry, Aurelio said. The lone S&P 500 member of that mining subsector is Freeport-McMoRan (FCX), whose earnings are projected to soar 227%. Excluding Freeport, the materials sector's earnings would decline 0.6%.Labor costs in a variety of businesses — in retail, restaurants and even the airlines — could also mean lower profits. And while the health care sector is often immune to the cycles that hurt other businesses, earnings growth for the space is expected to slow to 5.5%. The sector overall is heading into tougher comparisons after getting a boost from the biotech industry in the past.So just as the shock from the oil bust is finally starting to fade, there's the sense that other big companies are losing momentum.""The growth cycle effectively has run its course for large-cap America as a whole,"" Mian said.Analysts expect industrial firms to report a 1.2% earnings decline, and that likely doesn't reflect Honeywell (HON) news. Honeywell late Thursday cut the top end of its 2016 earnings forecast, citing weak Q3 aerospace sales. Honeywell shares plunged 7.5% Friday, with aerospace customers and rivals also slumping.PPG Industries (PPG), maker of industrial coatings, paints and glass, crashed 8.3% Friday on a Q3 profit warning. Fellow S&P 500 paint component Sherwin-Williams (SHW) retreated 1.9%.

177,HON,"The stock market saw mild morning losses expand a bit by lunchtime on Friday, but the decline masked a nice rebound by leaders in the brick-and-mortar space. Meanwhile, Tesla Motors (TSLA) continued to struggle in the wake of bearish commentary by Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs.The Nasdaq composite and S&P 500 slipped around 0.6%, while the NYSE composite fell 0.7%, hurt by sharp losses in aerospace, steel, paint, meat-product and toy stocks. Small caps slid harder; the Russell 2000 was off more than 1%. Volume was mildly lower on both exchanges vs. the same time Thursday.Airplane-components giant TransDigm (TDG) dropped nearly 2% to 280.73 and slid further below its 50-day moving average in volume running quadruple average trade. Failure to hold above the 50-day line would result in a sell signal; the stock initially broke out of a long saucer with handle at 233.87 on May 10.TransDigm is falling in sympathy with Honeywell (HON), a former Dow 30 component that is on pace for a weekly drop of more than 9% after issuing weak sales and profit guidance for the full year. The stock, at 105.95 is trading below the 40-week moving average for the first time since early March.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.5%, seeing drops of 1 point or more in at least six of its 30 component stocks including Home Depot (HD). The home improvement chain giant has struggled to rebound back above its 200-day moving average since crashing below it on Sept. 9.Tesla, the big stock market winner in 2013 to 2014, fell more than 1% to 197.33 in heavy volume. While the leader in all-electric vehicles failed to surpass upside resistance at the 200-day moving average, it also isn't giving up much ground considering that the stock is still above recent lows of 187.87 in late June and 193.45 on Sept. 13. Watch to see if the stock can find support near the 200 price level.Tesla's RS Rating of 12, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, continues to be terrible since it reflects the stock's poor action over the past 12 months vs. all other companies in IBD's database. Meanwhile, Tesla's 50-day moving average has crossed back below the slower-moving 200-day moving average, a bearish sign.Tesla is still forecast to report its first profit in eight quarters when it releases third-quarter results, likely in early November. The Street on consensus expects earnings of 7 cents a share, but the range of estimates of 15 analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters varies widely, from a net loss of 46 cents to a net profit of 60 cents.On the upside, Nordstrom (JWN) defied the skeptics of mall-based retail selling, rallying more than 1% to 54.58 for a fourth straight gain.The stock is still more than 30% below an all-time high of 77.65, yet it's certainly on the verge of snuffing out a shorter-term downtrend. Notice how the stock has traded relatively tightly for six weeks, forming a long handle on a long, deep cup base. While the stock is still nearly 22% below a 52-week high near 70, aggressive traders could consider an entry point at 53.81, 10 cents above the long handle that recently formed.Nordstrom is likely gaining ground on upbeat earnings guidance for the third quarter from clothing rival Gap (GPS). Gap stores tend to be in the same mall locations that are anchored by large department store operators such as Nordstrom and Macy's (M).Gap gapped up in price, rising more than 14% to 26.17 in whale-like volume to jump back on the north side of its 50- and 200-day lines. It too is trying to fashion a bottoming-style base pattern since hitting a multiyear peak of 46.85 back in September 2014.RELATED:What Is A Bottoming Base?

179,HON,"General Electric (GE) is officially a Boston-based company as of Monday, completing its headquarters move from Connecticut. But that's a much bigger move than its stock has been making.GE shares rose 0.2% to 31.32 on the stock market today. GE closed down 0.6% to 31.25 on Friday, staying virtually unchanged for the week and continuing a trend of fractional moves for the economic bellwether.Much of that reflects the general market, which has been moving sideways, grinding higher for several weeks. The major averages rose or fell no more than 0.1% on Monday. Other big-cap stocks such as Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are inching along.But Dow component General Electric has taken this to an extreme: Since pulling back late last month following its Q2 earnings report, GE has acted like a stock that's being acquired. GE hasn't closed up or down more than 0.6% since July 22, mostly in very light volume. GE is up just 17 cents from the end of the last year.GE not only reflects a sideways stock market but also sluggish global economic and manufacturing activity. GE last month reported strong earnings growth -- after excluding many items. But organic revenue was weak while industrial orders tumbled.Still, while GE may be hibernating, don't sleep on this stock.GE has held tightly to its 50-day moving average, closing just below that key support level Monday. It's less than 3% below a prior 32.15 buy point and off 5% from its July 20 peak of 33. On the flip side, it wouldn't take much for GE to fall below its 200-day line or even undercut its recent consolidation.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric has been returning to its industrial roots, but part of the shift is to try to be the operating system for the Internet of Things. Here's an in-depth look at GE's Industrial Internet ambitions.Pay even closer attention to Alphabet and Facebook.Alphabet and Facebook are among the stocks moving sideways in muted action for several weeks. But both are trading near record highs. Google parent Alphabet is slightly extended past a 753.58 buy point. It's still within range of a 791.05 alternative entry point. Facebook cleared a 121.18 buy point late last month and is still in range.Alphabet shares fell 0.3% to 796.95 on Monday, while Facebook rose 0.5% to 124.15.Shares of Honeywell (HON), another diversified manufacturer, is acting more like GE. Since retreating following its Q2 earnings report, Honeywell has done very little over the past month, tracking its 50-day line with minimal moves in light trade. Honeywell rose 0.4% to 116.58 Monday, back above its 50-day. It's working on a flat base with a 120.12 buy point.RELATED:

"
181,HON,"General Electric (GE) on Wednesday announced more business and executive changes, spurring talk of a potential ""brain drain"" similar to what was seen at the industrial conglomerate after its last CEO switch 16 years ago.GE will roll its legacy power and energy connections businesses into one unit called GE Power. The current head of the power business, Steve Bolze, is leaving. He has been with GE for 24 years and led the takeover of Alstom's power and grid unit — the biggest industrial acquisition in GE's history.Russell Stokes, a 20-year GE veteran and the current head of the electrical connections unit, replaces him starting July 3.Bolze's departure has echoes of the exodus of senior managers after Jeff Immelt was named CEO in 2000, said analyst Deane Dray of RBC Capital Markets, noting that Bolze is believed to have been on the list of potential candidates to succeed Immelt.The 2000 transition resulted in the ""immediate bitter"" departure of the losing CEO contenders, such as Bob Nardelli, then-CEO of GE Power Systems, and Jim McNerney, then-head of GE Aircraft Engines, Dray said in a statement. (Nardelli went on to helm Home Depot (HD) and then Chrysler, while McNerney took over at 3M (MMM) and later Boeing (BA).)""That said, it is possible that the brain drain this time will be limited,"" Dray continued. ""We note that the other leading candidate for the role, CFO Jeff Bornstein, was appointed vice chair of GE on Monday, supposedly in lieu of the CEO position.""Shares of GE, a Dow Jones industrial average component, edged up 0.8% to 28.69 on the stock market today, closing just below its 50-day line. GE stock surged on Monday, when Immelt's retirement was announced, its largest gain of the year so far. But the stock is mired 13% below its July 2016 high.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) fell 3 cents to 120.03, just in range from a 114.54 buy point. Honeywell (HON) dipped 0.1% to 134.24, just below a 135.10 buy point.U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) rose 0.1%.IBD'S TAKE: GE shares are having a strong June so far after three down months, but this is why GE is not a buy yet.Despite Immelt's upcoming retirement, incoming CEO John Flannery is expected to build on the strategy of infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology, which began under Immelt and has been generally praised.Still, GE's transformation into a digital-industrial company during Immelt's leadership has done little for the stock, which sits at around 28 — roughly where it was more than two years ago.GE stock has posted an annual average 5.2% gain in the past two years through Tuesday, roughly half that of the S&P 500 over the same period.RELATED:Stocks Flatten Ahead Of Fed, But Dow Etches New HighGE Signals New CEO Will Continue Software Push Started By Immelt

182,HON,"General Electric (GE) is staying the course on its digitally driven strategy started under outgoing CEO Jeff Immelt, as the Dow component on Tuesday unveiled a suite of Big Data tools and software that can transform how companies manage and service their machinery.At an event in Berlin, the industrial heavyweight unveiled digital products that allow utility companies, wind farms and oil drillers to analyze machine data in real time, identify leakages, enhance forecasts, increase productivity and even create new business opportunities.GE said the new offerings could help customers predict potential problems rather than merely react to them, thereby reducing costs and eliminating idle time.GE on Monday announced its first new leader in 16 years after nearly a decade of shedding its finance and media businesses and infusing core units like aviation, power systems, transportation and energy with technology.Underpinning these efforts is the company's Predix cloud-based software platform, a key initiative of Immelt that outfits industrial machinery with sensors that collect and monitor data, which can then be analyzed both on job sites and through remote servers. GE estimates the so-called industrial internet will be a $225 billion market by 2020, fueling massive gains in productivity and innovation.GE Vice Chair Beth Comstock told reporters in Germany that the company won't retreat from its software push under John Flannery, who will take over as CEO on Aug. 1.""I don't know how you don't go digital as an industrial company,"" she said, according to Bloomberg. ""John Flannery knows this firsthand. He's very aware of what's happening in other businesses. He's not in isolation.""In addition to GE's traditional industrial rivals, tech giants like Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) are eying the industrial internet as well, though GE is partnering with them too.Shares of GE closed down 1.7% at 28.45 on the stock market today, dropping back below their 50-day line and reversing an early gain. The stock surged 3.5% in massive volume Monday on news of the leadership change. Despite significant changes to GE's strategy in recent years, its stock has been stagnant for roughly two years.Among other industrial conglomerates, United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.15% Tuesday and still in buy range, Honeywell (HON) inched up 0.85% to 134.39, closer to a 135.20 buy point, and U.S.-listed shares of German rival Siemens (SIEGY) added 0.5%.RELATED:This 'Outlier' GE Unit May Ironically Be Ripe For Sale Under New CEOWill Microsoft Cloud GE's Industrial Internet Hopes?

183,HON,"General Electric's (GE) chief executive suggested clouds hang over the company's earnings outlook for next year, saying volatility in energy commodities poses a significant challenge to core GE businesses such as oil and gas, power and transportation.""Pricing is still tough"" in the resources market, CEO Jeff Immelt said Wednesday at the Electrical Products Group Conference in Florida.An EPS goal of $2 for 2018 is at the high end of expectations ""assuming the markets don't get better,"" he added.Tough equipment pricing and political volatility are additional headwinds for GE, weighing on the outlook for its industrial and health care segments, Immelt warned.His comments sent shares of GE down 1.6% to 27.83 erasing early gains on the stock market today. The stock had rebounded for the prior four sessions. On May 18, shares intraday matched their lowest level since October 2015.GE's relative strength line, which tracks the stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, is even worse. That RS line is at its lowest point since the early 1980s.Immelt is under pressure from an activist investor to improve performance at the industrial bellwether. Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners had reportedly pushed for Immelt's departure earlier this year, insisting the company could earn $2.33 a share next year if it met cost and sales goals. But after some discussions with Trian, GE said in March it would tailor this year's bonus program to the company's ability to meet profit targets and a new cost-cutting goal.Against that backdrop, the chief executive was eager on Wednesday to spotlight recent efforts to narrow the company's scope — actions that he pitched as stoking organic growth and cash flow.""We've made more big portfolio changes over the last three years than at any time in the company's history,"" Immelt said. ""The focus now is to wheel into execution.""The company's recent deals for Baker Hughes (BHI) and French energy company Alstom are part of what Immelt described as a ""much simpler, much deeper portfolio"" focused on businesses with big moats.The company also has disposed off several smaller or underperforming businesses. Those changes put it on track to deliver 3%-5% organic growth, a 100 basis-points margin expansion and 80% to 90% free cash flow conversion, Immelt said.Still, GE stock is one of the worst performers on the Dow Jones industrial average so far this year, down 12% year to date. Only Verizon Communications (VZ) has fared worse, down 16%.By comparison, GE rivals such as Siemens (SIEGY), Honeywell International (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) each flourish double-digit gains year to date, with their stocks trading at or near 52-week highs.RELATED:5 Red Flags From This GE Warning That Sent The Stock To 15-Month LowsThese 2 Industrial Bellwethers Topped Earnings, 1 Hit A Buy PointDow's General Electric Spikes On Report CEO Jeffrey Immelt On 'Hot Seat' With Key InvestorDow Stock GE May Have Headed Off Activist Investor Fight With This Move

184,HON,"Honeywell (HON) touted its aerospace business as being ""in a great position in a growing industry,"" amid pressure from an activist investor who argues it would perform better as a spinoff.In a presentation at the Electrical Products Group conference in Florida Tuesday, Honeywell said increasing global flight hours, new aircraft ramping up and improving worldwide defense budgets offer ""further runway"" for margin expansion.Honeywell's aerospace investments totaled $2.5 billion in 2016 and are expected to climb in 2017. Over 15% of Honeywell sales are channeled into aerospace research and development — two times as much as its closest rivals, the company said.However, Third Point's Dan Loeb has said the aerospace unit has been a laggard relative to industry peers and that a spinoff would boost stock valuations and increase shareholder value by more than $20 billion.Honeywell had already been conducting a strategic review of its portfolio and said Tuesday it is ""modeling various scenarios,"" with its assessment to wrap up by this fall.Honeywell stock rose 1 cent to 131.85 in afternoon trade on the stock market today, still in buy range after clearing a 127.62 entry last month. Among other big industrials with aerospace businesses, General Electric (GE) climbed 0.35%, United Technologies (UTX) edged up 0.3%, and Rockwell Collins (COL) lost 0.1%.New leadership at Honeywell may work in Third Point's favor, according to RBC Capital Markets, which said in a note last month that ""new CEOs are often more willing to rethink an organization's portfolio."" Darius Adamczyk took over as Honeywell's CEO and president in April.Honeywell, which makes airplane engines and other aircraft parts, cut its full-year sales forecast in January, citing weaker demand in corporate jets amid global trepidation about the economy and less traction in defense.However, the supplier to Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) beat first-quarter earnings expectations last month. But the aerospace segment's revenue slipped 4% to $3.55 billion, while overall sales were flat at $9.49 billion.RELATED:A Honeywell Aerospace Spinoff Could Hinge On ThisActivist Investor Third Point Urges Honeywell To Spin Off Aerospace UnitDow Stock GE May Have Headed Off Activist Investor Fight With This Move

185,HON,"General Electric (GE) shares hit a 15-month low after receiving a downgrade to sell from hold from Deutsche Bank, which cited a range of issues for the industrial giant, including cash flow pressure to a potential leadership change.""Overall, we believe GE to be overvalued given weak earnings quality and the wide gap between noncash and cash earnings,"" wrote Deutsche Bank analyst John Inch, who cut his price target on the company to 24 from 28.The core industrial business appears to be struggling, added Inch, who estimates that excluding GE Capital dividends and proceeds from divestitures, ""GE does not appear to be generating sufficient cash flow to sustain its operations.""""We believe GE's cash challenges are ultimately grounded in GE's profile as a manufacturer of 'big iron' capital goods that require high levels of investment and spending to develop and manufacture,"" he wrote.Inch also said GE's ""weak cash flow has become worse in recent quarters,"" noting that it could threaten shareholder returns.""While GE is going to realize cash inflow from business sales (ie, Water, Industrial Solutions) and ongoing PPE (property, plant and equipment) divestitures, the company appears to be operating relatively 'close to the line' in terms of sufficient cash generation to continue to fund such a robust dividend and share repurchase program,"" he warned.Deutsche Bank doesn't see leadership changing anytime soon — and if CEO Jeffrey Immelt does get the boot, Inch warned that ""the next CEO could opt to significantly reset earnings targets lower: possibly closer to actual cash generation.""""In turn, we expect the market could be negatively surprised by this prospective reset,"" he postulated.Immelt is under scrutiny by Trian Partners' Nelson Peltz. The activist investor has reportedly been displeased with the GE head's performance.Deutsche Bank said GE's $31 billion in underfunded pension obligations seems high and ""could be considered a long term cash call on the company,"" adding that the company will contribute $1.8 billion to its pension plan in each of the next two years.GE's ""inexplicably low"" tax rate could actually be a risk, Inch said. If the White House and Congress can manage to revamp the tax code, GE is unlikely to benefit, given that its tax rate is already below what its peers are paying. And if the tax code were simplified and loopholes closed, that could lift GE's taxes.GE shares fell as low as 27.85, closing down 2.1% at 28.27 on the stock market today. GE stock has struggled for most of 2017 to retake support at its 50-day and 200-day moving averages.Among other big industrial stocks, United Technologies (UTX) was off 0.4%, Honeywell (HON) lost 0.3%, and German rival Siemens (SIEGY) rose 3 cents to 71.21.RELATED:Will Microsoft Cloud GE's Industrial Internet Hopes?

186,HON,"General Electric (GE) continues its transformation into what CEO Jeff Immelt calls a digital industrial company, with GE shares clearing a buy point in Thursday trading.GE has formed a first-stage cup-with-handle base over the last 50 days, with a 30.69 buy point.Shares rose 2.6% to 30.96 in above-average volume on the stock market today, almost back to break-even for 2016. The stock hit a 7-year high of 31.48 on Dec. 29.Other industrial conglomerates, like United Technologies (UTX), Honeywell (HON) and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB), have made modest gains so far this year. A weaker dollar in the wake of the Federal Reserve's lowered rate hike path, along with a generally falling greenback in recent weeks, is lifting the prospects for big industrial multinationals.On Tuesday, GE said that it's adding 160 people focused solely on digital advancements in transportation and health care, including software engineers, developers and data scientists, to its Chicago operations.Meanwhile, GE continues to integrate Alstom's power and grid energy business after paying $10.6 billion for that part of the France-based company last November.With the Alstom purchase, GE has the world's largest installed base of electrical power generation equipment, with one-third of the world's electricity generated from GE technology, the company has said.GE's earnings per share growth shrank 7% in the fourth quarter of 2015. Its EPS growth is projected to be flat this quarter and dip a bit again in Q2 before surging in the back half of the year. GE is projected to report 90% year-over-year EPS growth in Q3.Image provided by Shutterstock.

187,HON,"Genpact (G) has made its mark helping companies operate more efficiently, but over the last two years the business processing firm has invested heavily to make its own firm run more effectively.The company, once an India-based arm of General Electric (GE), had gone through some growing pains. The outsourcer for hundreds of companies worldwide -- handling non-core functions such as accounting and finance -- decided it was time to be more selective in the businesses it pursued.Out of the loop went telecom, utilities and government, among other lackluster sectors. More attention was paid to financial services, manufacturing, consumer products, pharma and high tech -- and in finding new ways to service those customers.""We’ve spent about $100 million-plus across a range of new capabilities to take the company to the next level, such as building out mobile and analytical solutions,"" Chief Executive N.V. ""Tiger"" Tyagarajan told IBD.Making such a move came with a price, though. Margins and earnings took a hit initially. In 2014, per-share earnings fell 9%. And as part of that, business from its largest client and former parent, GE, has shrunk to a fraction of what it was.But it’s a different picture now. The strategy to invest in client sectors with the best growth potential and dial back on smaller, less lucrative areas is starting to pay off.""They basically decided to take down their profitability to strategically drive revenue in specific areas,"" analyst Joseph Foresi of Cantor Fitzgerald told IBD. ""You’ve seen growth rates pick up and positive data points in bookings’ numbers.""Genpact's total revenue in 2015 rose 8% over 2014 to $2.46 billion, but new bookings jumped 20%. Earnings for the year climbed 22% to $1.26 a share. In the fourth quarter, earnings grew 31% to 34 cents a share on revenue of $646.5 million, up 7% from the prior year.Revenue would have been higher had it not been negatively impacted by GE’s business divestitures. In the fourth quarter, GE revenue fell 1% year-over-year to $117 million, accounting for 18% of the total. Non-GE revenue from other global clients rose 10% to $529 million.For the full year, revenue from GE was down 1% to $460 million, representing 19% of total revenue. Global-client revenue grew 10% to $2 billion, or up 13% in constant currency.GE once accounted for 100% of Genpact’s revenue, when it was still an India-based business process management and information technology services arm of the massive U.S. conglomerate. In 2005, Genpact started providing services to non-GE clients, too, as an independent company. It went public in 2007.“As GE continues to change its portfolio, our relationship changes,” Tyagarajan said.About 60% of Genpact’s work is still performed in India. The rest is done in 18 other countries, including Romania, the Philippines, China, Mexico and Hungary. The company is headquartered in New York.The shrinking of GE’s contributions has been especially apparent since last March, when GE announced it would divest its financial services arm, GE Capital. Accelerated GE divestitures will weigh on 2016 results: Genpact expects GE revenue to fall 8% to 10% this year. But it forecasts that revenue from non-GE global clients will rise by 12.5% to 14%.Analysts expect total revenue this year to grow 7% to $2.64 billion, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Earnings are seen rising 12% to $1.42 a share.Tyagarajan doesn’t seem worried about lost business from GE.“As GE sells those businesses, it’s natural for us to enter into new relationships with the buyers. The work has to continue,” he said.Of the 12 GE Capital businesses sold so far, Genpact has already entered into contracts with four buyers, including Bank of Montreal (BMO). Tyagarajan says it’s in talks with the eight others.Meanwhile, the outsourcing of business and technology services is a market with a lot of growth left in it, he says.“So much change and disruption in technology is very good for us,” he said. “Our role is to help our clients think about change and help them change.”As Genpact has changed its focus, its client roster has fallen from more than 800 to roughly 700, though Tyagarajan says the value of its contracts has been growing.Clients range from drug-store retailer Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) to manufacturers such as Boeing (BA), Nissan Motor (NSANY) and Honeywell (HON). Consumer products customers include Mondelez (MDLZ) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). In pharma, it counts AstraZeneca (AZN) and others among its clients.The company’s ties with GE are a ""competitive advantage,"" noted analyst Frank Atkins of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey in a recent note to clients, which came with a buy rating and price target of 30.Among those advantages are GE’s culture of lean principles and systems. What’s more, he noted, many GE execs go on to management roles at other firms, creating an expanded network of potential new client wins for Genpact.""Its relationship with GE and recent investments give it solid positioning versus competitors,"" Atkins wrote. The company also addresses more industry verticals than many of its peers, he said.Genpact competes with pure-play business process management providers WNS (WNS) and ExlService Holdings (EXLS), as well as business processing units of larger global consultancies such as Accenture (ACN) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH).Tata Consultancy Services, Wipro (WIT) and Infosys (INFY) are also rivals in certain areas.""Genpact has a longer sales cycle than typical outsourcing companies,"" said Cantor Fitzgerald's Foresi, meaning it takes longer to land a sale and start servicing clients once a deal is signed. ""So the business is potentially stickier.""

188,HON,"Honeywell (HON) has scrapped its $90.7 billion bid for United Technologies (UTX), which said Friday that the offer undervalued United Tech, wouldn't pass muster with antitrust regulators and would ultimately harm the company.The decision to abandon the offer also follows trepidation over the deal expressed by Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA), both of which are customers of the companies.Airbus' CEO said a merger between United Technologies and Honeywell was unlikely to ""be in the interests of Airbus,"" while Boeing said ""healthy competition in our supply chain is vitally important,"" according to the Wall Street Journal.Honeywell said it ""strongly disagrees"" with United Technologies' assessment of the offer and argued that the companies had been trying to get together for some time. The two companies, Honeywell CEO Dave Cote said, had been ""talking about a combination for more than 15 years.""""United Technologies felt the same way as we do when they approached us in May, 2011 and in April, 2015,"" Honeywell said in a statement.The company added: ""In our approach to their chairman and their CEO on February 19, 2016, we had hoped to continue amicable and quiet discussions of a combination. In fact, we were told by them during the meeting that such a combination would be fabulous, they would take it very seriously, and they would get back to us with questions within a week in anticipation of their upcoming board meeting.""However,"" Honeywell said, ""continuing to try to negotiate with an unwilling partner is inconsistent with our disciplined acquisition process.""Either way, Honeywell's acquisitive urges appeared to be intact.The company on Tuesday said it had bought RSI Video Technologies and Movilizer, which add video-verification security and cloud platforms that help manage workflow, to Honeywell's portfolio.The abandoned large bid for United Technologies and the two much smaller purchases come a day before Honeywell's investor day, when the company said it will present ""a terrific growth story for standalone Honeywell.""In a statement, United Tech said Honeywell's decision Tuesday is the ""appropriate outcome given the strong regulatory obstacles, negative customer reaction and the potential for a protracted review process that would have destroyed shareholder value.""United Tech shares closed down 1.6%. Honeywell climbed 4.5%. Boeing rose 1.5%, and Airbus added 3.1%.Image provided by Shutterstock.

189,HON,"United Technologies provided more reasons the industrial conglomerate isn't interested in merging with Honeywell (HON), which detailed its $90.7 billion offer Friday.United Tech CEO Gregory Hayes said the company concluded that antitrust regulators either would block the merger or would drag it out so long as to “destroy shareholder value far beyond any synergies.”A merger also would hurt the company's operations, customer relationships and talent retention, he added.And the proposal “grossly undervalues (United Technologies) and overstates potential synergies,” he said in a statement.“Effectively, Honeywell’s proposal is a leveraged buyout of UTC using UTC’s own strong balance sheet,” Hayes added.Earlier Friday, Honeywell disclosed the terms of its bid. Had the offer been accepted, United Technologies shareholders would have received $42.63 a share in cash and 0.614 share of Honeywell, according to the presentation.Honeywell valued the deal at around $108 a share, or $90.7 billion, in the cash-and-stock offer, using Feb. 18 prices.Honeywell has described the potential deal as a ""significant synergy opportunity"" with ""significant value creation potential.""On Monday, United Technologies said it never explored a Honeywell merger because of ""regulatory obstacles, customer concerns and valuation issues.""The proposed deal also has drawn the criticism of Airbus (EADSY), whose CEO, Tom Enders, described the merger as not being in the aircraft manufacturer's interests. Honeywell and United Technologies are two of Airbus's biggest suppliers.Honeywell shares closed 1.1% lower on the stock market today. United Technologies stock fell 0.4%.

190,HON,"Honeywell (HON) reportedly is attempting to sell off its building-solutions unit, as Airbus has expressed opposition to the company's proposed merger with United Technologies (UTX).The possible sale could net Honeywell between $3 billion and $4 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources. Bankers at Goldman Sachs (GS) are helping with the sales process, WSJ said. The building-solutions unit provides safety and other services to commercial buildings, according to WSJ.Meanwhile, Airbus (EADSY) CEO Tom Enders told the Financial Times that his company opposes a Honeywell-United Tech merger, saying a merger of two of its biggest suppliers ""would not be in the interests"" of the aircraft maker.France-based Airbus buys about $4.4 billion in components from United Tech each year, and its Pratt & Whitney engine-maker unit is Airbus' top supplier. Honeywell sells about $331 million worth of brakes, wheels and air conditioning systems each year to Airbus.Airbus and its rival, Boeing (BA), have pushed suppliers to bring down costs. A Honeywell-United Technologies merger presumably would do that, but would give the combined company unrivaled dominance in the market for certain aerospace components such as air conditioning systems, FT reported.Honeywell shares fell 0.3% to 103.30 on the stock market today. United Technologies stock climbed 2.2% to 93.61. Boeing shares fell 1.2% to 115.59.

193,HON,"X Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) were among firms that promised tech transfers and local development as part of $150 billion in deals with Saudi Arabia announced during President Trump's visit over the weekend.Technology transfers and local production could boost the kingdom's industrial know-how as it diversifies away from oil and potentially reduces its dependence on U.S.-made products, despite Trump's ""America first"" policy promise. However, some of the deals were negotiated under the Obama administration, and many aren't finalized yet, with more negotiations needed.Lockheed said in a release that Saudi Arabia wants to buy more than $28 billion in ""integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs.""A letter of intent was singed with Saudi tech firm Taqnia to form a joint venture to support the completion of 150 S-70 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed has been eager to offer technology transfers and joint-venture opportunities to boost its market share overseas. The company wants 30% of all sales to be from foreign allies in the coming years.Last year, Lockheed offered tech transfers and offered to move its F-16 manufacturing line to India to secure a massive fighter jet order from New Delhi.Lockheed shares closed up 1.55% at 277.03 on the stock market today, still in buy range.The maker of Tomahawk cruise missiles and the Patriot air-defense system announced plans to form Raytheon Arabia, a Raytheon branch that will focus on boosting local Saudi defense and security capabilities.Shares finished 0.6% higher at 161.19, also still in buy range.The aerospace giant didn't give total figures for its agreements, which include a deal for Chinook helicopter and support services, guided-weapons systems and the P-8 reconnaissance plane.Boeing (BA) also announced a joint venture to provide sustainment services on military platforms as part of the Saudi Vision 2030 economic reform program Saudi Arabia announced last year to help ease its dependence on oil revenue.On the commercial side, Saudi Gulf Airlines said it would negotiate buying up to 16 widebody airplanes.Boeing shares rallied 1.6% to 183.67, trying to regain their 185.81 buy point.General Electric (GE) announced $15 billion in deals.

194,HON,"China successfully completed the first test flight of its home-built modern passenger jet, bolstering President  Xi Jinping's ambition of turning China into an advanced economy.Amid cheers from onlookers, the C919 airliner took off Friday from Pudong International Airport in Shanghai, the home base of its builder Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China Ltd., or Comac. The jet landed back about an hour and 19 minutes later after cruising at 3,000 meters (9,840 feet). The single-aisle plane, which is designed to seat as many as 174 people, is slated to enter commercial service with China Eastern Airlines Corp. in 2019.""It shows China made a historic breakthrough in its years-old dream of building a big aircraft,"" Comac said in a statement, calling the test a ""complete success."" The nation's State Council, the top administrative authority, sent a congratulatory note to the designers.The test flight, after repeated delays, marks another step in Xi's ambitious 'Made in China 2025' program, which identified aerospace among sectors that could accelerate China's advancement. The government has said the ability to build and fly a large commercial aircraft is the ""flower'' and ""pearl'' of modern manufacturing.The C919 would be the first major competitor for Airbus SE and Boeing Co. in the most popular sector of the airliner market and gives Comac a home advantage in what is set to become the world's biggest aircraft market. Boeing estimates China will need 6,810 aircraft worth more than $1 trillion in the two decades through 2035.""There's a lot riding on the C919,'' said Xu Yongling, a military test pilot and a member of the Beijing-based Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics. ""The expectation for the C919 is not to become the best-selling single-aisle aircraft in the market, but rather become a stepping stone for COMAC to build something better, with indigenous technology.''COMAC plans to make six planes for tests, and the second one is getting ready at the final assembly workshop in Shanghai, the builder said. Guests who witnessed Friday's test flight included Vice Premier Ma Kai and Han Zheng, Communist Party secretary from Shanghai.The five people on board the test plane were the captain, co-pilot, an observer and two engineers.Getting into the major league with Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA) may be a few decades away as customers typically prefer aircraft with proven track record, reliability and safety, analysts said. COMAC is seeking certification for the C919 from European agencies.""Comac could well be an option for us,"" said William Walsh, chief executive officer of IAG SA, the owner of British Airways Plc, adding he'd only seriously consider the plane when IAG reviews its existing fleet of short-haul Airbus A320-family jets in the long-term. More immediately, he's expecting lower prices from the added competition.Walsh, a former pilot who's flown in the plane's simulator, said he's due to meet with Comac next month to further advise on features that IAG looks for in a new model.""A new entrant will have an impact on pricing,"" Walsh told analysts on a call Friday. ""We've seen that to some degree with the launch of the CSeries. It's something that both airlines and the manufacturers are aware of.""The C919 designation was chosen partly to reflect the idea of long life in Chinese numerology.With a maximum range of 3,450 miles, the plane is powered by two LEAP-1C engines from CFM International Inc., a joint venture between Safran SA and General Electric (GE). Other key system suppliers include Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Collins (COL), Liebherr-International Deutschland GmbH, Thales SA and Panasonic Corp.The test flight of the plane follows China's launch last month of its first domestically built aircraft carrier. The milestones, coming within weeks, burnish Xi's credentials as a modernizer before he presides over the ruling Communist Party's twice-a-decade congress later this year.Almost a billion people will fly to, from or within China by 2025, the International Air Transport Association estimates. Over the next two decades, about 75 percent of the jets ferrying those passengers will be single-aisle -- a category dominated by Boeing's 737 and Airbus's A320 family.In an email, Boeing congratulated Comac for the ""successful development"" of the C919, while Airbus said it welcomes competition, ""which is good for the development of the industry.""Comac, which had postponed the test flight at least twice, says it has commitments from 23 customers for about 570 planes, with Shanghai-based China Eastern lined up to take the first delivery.Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst at Teal Group, said China may have to wait till its next aircraft to really break the duopoly for jets that can carry more than 100 passengers.""At the moment, they are in a real replication mode, which is not where you want to be,"" he said. ""First off, they need to privatize and open their supply chain up to a global network, rather than just people who will transfer yesterday's technology.""Comac has set its sights on building a wide-body aircraft. It is forming a joint venture with Russia's United Aircraft Corp. to develop a twin-aisle jet.""The C919 is a testament to China's civil aviation research and manufacturing capability,"" said Yu Zhanfu, executive director at Roland Berger Management Consultants Shanghai Co. ""China's had a lot of success in making rockets, making spaceships. It shows the country is capable of mega tech-intensive manufacturing projects.""

198,HON,"General Electric (GE) reported its best profit gain in more than five years on Friday. But GE shares fell, as key metrics weakened.Earnings per share minus one-time items soared 65% to 51 cents a share, beating estimates by 5 cents. Revenue rose 15% to $33.49 billion, also better than expected, helped by recent acquisitions. GE's Power, Aviation and Healthcare divisions were strong, offsetting drops in Oil & Gas and TransportationBut industrial orders tumbled 16% excluding recent acquisitions. Organic industrial revenue dipped 1%, below some forecasts, though GE stuck to its 2%-4% growth forecast for the full year. GE shares closed 1.6% lower at 32.06 in the stock market today, just below a 32.15 buy point cleared earlier this month. Shares hit an eight-year high of 33 on Wednesday.General Electric has sold off an array of GE Capital assets over the past year, enabling it to have its designation as a systemically important financial institution removed during Q2. That means it faces fewer regulatory restrictions going forward.""We will continue to invest in key growth initiatives such as GE Digital, while returning about $26 billion to investors through buyback and dividends,"" GE CEO Jeff Immelt said in the company's second-quarter earnings statement Friday.GE reaffirmed its full-year 2016 operating EPS outlook for $1.45-$1.55, the midpoint just below analyst views for $1.51.IBD'S TAKE: General Electric and Honeywell had hit long-time highs recent, but the industrial giants aren't leaders. To see how GE and Honeywell stack up vs. objective criteria, go to IBD Stock Checkup.Revenue for the company's Power business jumped 31% to $6.64 billion, boosted by the $10 billion acquisition of Alstom's energy business. GE ended the quarter with 34 of its HA gas turbine systems in backlog. During Q2, GE announced an agreement to buy the Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) business from South Korea's Doosan Engineering & Construction for $250 million.GE announced more $25 billion in aerospace orders and commitments at the Farnborough Air Show earlier this month for GE and its partner companies, and GE's Aviation revenue rose 4% in Q2 to $6.5 billion.The manufacturer's health systems revenue was also up 4% to $4.53 billion as GE opened a biopharmaceutical facility for JHL Biotech in China, and China orders rose 9% for the quarter.Although GE signed an order for $51 million worth of railroad locomotives for Brazil in Q2, total Transportation division revenue fell 13% to $1.24 billion.Revenue for GE's appliances and lighting business plunged 25% to $1.67 billion, although the company was able to offset some of the drop with $70 million in internal cost savings ""by implementing solar solutions for 18 GE sites.""Petroleum prices began edging up in Q2 from multiyear lows but were still at a low level. GE's Oil & Gas revenue slid 22% to $3.22 billion from $4.12 billion a year earlier. Looking ahead, its oil and gas services backlog rose 15% during the quarter.The company didn't initially break out digital revenue. But GE Chief Digital Officer Bill Ruh said last month he sees the company's digital business generating about $7 billion revenue this year and $15 billion by 2020. During the quarter, GE announced a partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) to bring its GE's Predix operating system for the Industrial Internet to Microsoft's Azure cloud.Honeywell (HON) also reported Q2 results Friday. Adjusted EPS rose 10% vs. a year earlier to $1.66, topping estimates by 2 cents a share. Revenue edged up 2.1% to $9.99 billion, lighter than the expected $10.13 billion.Honeywell on Friday announced it's splitting its Automation & Control Solutions (ACS) business into two new segments: Home and Building Technologies (HBT) and Safety and Productivity Solutions (SPS).The diversified automobile and aerospace manufacturer narrowed its full-year EPS guidance to $6.60-$6.70, the midpoint just below analyst consensus for $6.66. Honeywell now sees organic revenue falling this year vs. its prior target for a 1%-2% gain.Honeywell fell 3.5% to 114.49 in afternoon trade, below its 50-day line but off its morning low of 112.70.

199,HON,"United Technologies (UTX) stock has finally formed its first pattern of 2016, and it's been working through a flat base for going on two months.The question is: Can United Technologies move into a buy range where other large diversified manufacturers such as 3M (MMM), Honeywell (HON) and General Electric (GE) are currently positioned?United Technologies makes aircraft engines via its Pratt & Whitney unit, as well as Otis brand elevators, heating and security systems and other aerospace components and systems. Its stock took a drubbing early in the year but it's risen 25% since hitting a 2016 low at 83.39 on Jan. 20.It's following similar patterns by 3M, maker of various medical supplies and office supplies, and Honeywell, which makes automotive and aerospace systems. They both sank early this year in sync with the sharp early-2016 market pullback and then recovered. Shares of both recently climbed into record territory.General Electric, largest of the quartet with roughly $119 billion annual sales, hasn't slipped this year but continued its slow, steady climb as it transforms into what it calls a digital industrial company, rolling out its Predix Industrial internet operating system and industrial manufacturing software. Its stock, though, is still well below its all-time high.Mining equipment giant Caterpillar (CAT), with $43.8 billion annual sales, has moved into buy territory as well. Like United Technologies, Caterpillar is forming a first-stage flat base, and it has an 80.99 buy point. Its stock has risen on hopes that the long commodities price slump is nearing an end amid higher prices for crude oil and some metals.While 3M, Honeywell and GE are in buy range, United Technologies is working its way through that flat base. Shares were on track for a fifth straight higher close on Tuesday amid new contacts and announcements at the Farnborough Air Show in England. Just before the show, on July 8, Pratt & Whitney received a contract valued at $1.5 billion from the Department of Defense to manufacture F135 engines for all three variations of the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter jet.IBD'S TAKE: United Technologies and a number of other big-name industrial stocks are in buy range, but many don't have high composite ratings from IBD. For a listing on the highest-rated stocks, try IBD's MarketSmith.However, on Monday Qatar Airways at the show said it was looking at buying 30 Boeing (BA) 737s in place of Europe's Airbus Group's (EADSY) A320neos. The carrier canceled delivery of one A320neo saying it found glitches in the Pratt & Whitney engines. Qatar Airways has been in talks with the CFM joint venture between GE and France's Safran S.A. to provide an alternative engine but no deal had been reached as of early Tuesday.United Technologies shares were up 0.5% at 104.50 in Tuesday afternoon trading on the stock market today. It was trading in the upper half of the first stage flat base, with a 107.17 buy point.GE rose 0.2%, Honeywell 0.4% and 3M 0.7% Tuesday.

200,HON,"The stock market took a breather Thursday as earnings results continued to drive big moves in both directions ahead of reports from Chipotle (CMG), Starbucks (SBUX) and Visa (V). EBay (EBAY) soared, while Intel (INTC) sank during the regular trading session.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average shed 0.4% each; the Nasdaq gave up 0.3%. Volume was higher on the NYSE and Nasdaq vs. Wednesday, according to early figures.After the close, Starbucks fell 4% on a revenue miss. Chipotle missed earnings views, but shares were slightly higher in extended trading.Software, automakers and airlines led the downside during the regular session in the stock market today, while gold miners, medical and leisure stocks represented the upside.Construction machinery stocks also outperformed, as Joy Global (JOY) surged 20% in massive volume on a $3.7 billion acquisition by Japan's Komatsu (KMTUY).EBay gapped up and soared 11% to a new high, clearing a 29.93 buy point in fast turnover. The stock has now advanced in 11 of the past 12 sessions. After the close Wednesday, the online marketplace reported Q2 results that topped views and guided its full-year outlook above forecasts.Qualcomm (QCOM) vaulted 7% to its best level since November on a quarterly earnings and sales beat. Shares of the chip designer are 8% off a 52-week high but still nearly 50% below its July 2014 peak.Among IBD 50 stocks, LGI Homes (LGIH) was the clear winner, with a 4% jump in heavy trade.On the downside, Intel gapped down and fell 4% in heavy volume after reporting mixed Q2 results late Wednesday. Shares fell back into buy range from a 32.85 flat-base entry first cleared June 30.In economic news, initial jobless claims dipped to 253,000 the week ended July 16, down from 254,000 the prior week and below economists' projections for an increase to 260,000 claims.Existing-home sales climbed 1.1% in June to an annualized rate of 5.57 million, the best in more than nine years. Tight supply drove prices up 4.8% from last year.A light economic report schedule Friday includes the flash manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index for July.Earnings results are also due out from American Airlines (AAL), General Electric (GE) and Honeywell (HON).

201,HON,"Airbus (EADSY) edged out Boeing (BA) Thursday in the commercial orders race at the Paris Air Show, which saw stronger-than-expected demand for new passenger jets.The European aerospace giant received orders for a total of 421 aircraft, worth $57 billion at list prices. Boeing received orders and commitments for 331 planes valued at $50.2 billion. Buyers typically get undisclosed discounts for large orders.The combined tally of 752 eclipsed forecasts for a weak year as record backlogs and saturated growth markets were expected to weigh on demand. Before the show, Cowen analyst Cai von Rumohr predicted that Boeing and Airbus would have less than the average of 387 orders combined.Boeing shares closed up 1.4% on the stock market today. Airbus dipped 0.7%. Aerospace supplier United Technologies (UTX), which owns engine maker Pratt & Whitney, rose 0.7%. Honeywell (HON) gained 1.3%, and General Electric (GE) edged up 0.4%.This year's tally also topped last year's total of 687 at the Farnborough Airshow, which alternates with the Paris show each year. But Airbus' total was down from last year, when it received orders and commitments for 486 aircraft. Boeing's orders were up this year, as it had deals for just 201 planes at Farnborough.The 2015 number was also down from the 2013 Paris Air Show, which saw orders for 908 aircraft between the two aerospace giants. Blockbuster deals two years ago were led by new planes, including Airbus' A320neo and Boeing's 737 Max and 787 Dreamliner. Those planes have more fuel-efficient engines that were in demand at a time of high oil prices.But while the orders from the past week came in higher than expected, the Paris Air Show failed to impress some analysts.""There weren't any huge surprises there,"" said Robert Mann, president of aviation consultancy R.W. Mann & Co. ""I don't think anyone took home a trophy — unless in the Little League sense where everyone gets a trophy.""The Paris show's orders point to capacity increases in Asia, with China and Indonesia leading the way, he added. Garuda Indonesia, the country's flagship carrier, was among the big buyers at Paris, making deals to buy 30 Dreamliners and 30 737 Max jets from Boeing and 30 A350s from Airbus.Capacity should grow slightly in Eastern Europe, but Mann said most of the orders from the region will be for replacement planes.Major deals in prior shows came from Middle Eastern carriers, which kept a low profile this year as tensions with European and U.S. carriers heat up over capacity increases and competitive practices.Qatar Airway's A380 was featured at the show, but the airline didn't announce any big deals, like the 50-plane order it announced with Boeing at the 2014 Farnborough Airshow.No new planes from the two aircraft giants debuted at the show this year, though there was plenty of buzz over Boeing's acknowledgment that it's looking at a new mid-size plane and is already talking to potential customers about its requirements.Boeing was on track to finish the Paris show with the most orders, helped by a deal from aircraft lessor AerCap (AER) for 100 737 Max jets.But Wizz Air, a low-cost European carrier, made a provisional agreement at the last minute for 110 A321neos, worth $12.5 billion, putting Airbus in the lead. Airbus had forecast only 200 total orders and commitments at Paris.Both Boeing and Airbus must now manage bulging backlogs and plans to ramp up production rates. The companies have a combined backlog of 12,000 planes. Airbus is boosting output of its popular A320 airliner by nearly 20% to 50 per month in 2017. Boeing is lifting production of its 737 to 52 planes per month in 2018 vs. 42 currently.Supply chain issues may curb production growth. Last year, Air Lease (AL) COO John Plueger called the increase in Boeing and Airbus production a ""major concern"" and that suppliers are operating at ""absolute capacity."" GE has opened seven new engine parts plants in seven years to help keep up.Orders are expected to keep rolling in over the long term. Boeing sees demand for over 38,000 airplanes in the next two decades, with single-aisle planes the most sought after. Airbus sees demand for 32,600 new planes in the next 20 years.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

202,HON,"Orders for durable goods rose the most in 10 months in January, boosted by gains in aircraft and core capital goods orders, the Commerce Department said Thursday.Big-ticket, long-lasting orders shot up 4.9%, the most since last March and following two months of declines. Economists forecast a 2% gain. January's total was near the upper end of the consensus range too.December's number was revised upward 0.5 point to a 4.6% decline. Year over year, durable goods orders rose 0.6%.Excluding transportation equipment, orders still rose 1.8% compared to December. But they fell 2.5% vs. a year earlier.Civilian aircraft orders shot up 54% after tumbling 29% in December, reflecting the monthly swings in demand for Boeing (BA) jets and other planes.Core capital goods orders, which exclude aircraft and defense, climbed 3.9% for the month. The business investment proxy had fallen in the prior two months. Core capital goods still slid 4.4% vs. a year earlier, the 13th straight decline. The energy and mining sectors have slashed investment as prices and demand for oil and other commodities tumble.It remains to be seen whether January's positive durable goods orders bodes well for U.S. factories or whether it's merely a blip on the radar screen. Durable goods orders are notoriously volatile.For February, the PMI manufacturing flash index and the Richmond Federal Reserve both reported disappointing manufacturing data. The Kansas City Fed's regional manufacturing index tumbled to -12, the worst since April 2009 low.Factories have been hit hard by a strong dollar and slowing economic growth overseas. The struggling energy sector also has impacted manufacturing.Top manufacturers were up on the stock market today. Boeing rose 1.1%. Whirlpool (WHR) added 0.2%. Honeywell (HON) gained 0.6%, United Techologies (UTX) surged 4.8% and General Electric (GE) rallied 0.4%.Honeywell and United Technologies have held merger talks, but United Tech is worried about antitrust concerns for the aerospace components makers.

"
204,HON,"Honeywell (HON) and United Technologies (UTX) reportedly have discussed merging, as the two industrial companies endure headwinds from a strong dollar and weak global economic growth.The negotiations occurred within the last two weeks and focused on the Morris Plains, N.J.-based Honeywell, which initiated the latest talks, offering a premium in stock and some cash for the Farmington, Conn.-based United Technologies, CNBC reported, citing sources. But United Technologies  is concerned about antitrust objections, with the Wall Street Journal later reporting that United Tech had rebuffed Honeywell on those grounds.Such a deal would create a combined company with $94 billion in sales.A  merger of the two companies that provide so much airplane material likely would face opposition from Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY). United Technologies' Pratt & Whitney unit manufactures aircraft engines for Boeing and others.Honeywell shares fell 2% to 105.17l on the stock market today after initially spiking to a record high of 111.86. United Technologies stock climbed 4.7% to 92.37 after hitting 94.91 intraday. United Tech shares closed above their 50-day moving average for the first time this year.
"
205,HON,"Activist investors Altimeter Capital Management and PAR Capital Management on Tuesday said they would nominate six candidates to United Airlines’ (UAL) board of directors later this year, blasting the airline's directorship appointments a day earlier as a rushed, ""cynical attempt to preserve power by this entrenched board.""The wrangling over United's board is the latest jolt in what has been a bumpy ride at the company's corporate level, and comes amid the company's attempts to better compete with rivals Delta Air Lines (DAL) and American Airlines (AAL).United called the funds' move a ""hostile action"" that could take focus away from CEO Oscar Munoz's plan to turn the company around as he prepares to return to work full-time on March 14. Munoz suffered a heart attack in October, forcing him to take medical leave.United shares closed down 2.2% in the stock market today. Delta dropped 4.5%, and American slipped 3.2%.The two hedge funds -- longtime United investors that, combined, own around 7.1% of the company's stock -- said in a letter Tuesday that ""meaningful change to United's existing board of directors is urgently required in order to reverse long-standing poor board governance and the resulting many years of substantial and inexcusable company underperformance relative to United's competitors.""They also said that despite weeks of talks over changes to the board, United ""hurriedly added"" three new directors and expanded the board to 15 from 12.United argued that it ""repeatedly"" expressed an openness to changing the company's board, offered to extend its March 12 director nomination deadline, and said the funds ""refused to cooperate in making their nominees available to be interviewed.""The company also defended the three independent directors named yesterday as having ""deep relevant experience"" and backed the airline, citing last year's sky-high profits and improved on-time performance.Altimeter and PAR said they would nominate their candidates at United's annual stockholder meeting this year. They are Gordon Bethune, a former CEO of Continental Airlines and a board member of aerospace tech firm Honeywell (HON); Altimeter founder Brad Gerstner; Tina Sharkey, the CEO of SherpaFoundry; Barney Harford, former CEO of travel site Orbitz; Rodney O'Neal, ex-CEO of Delphi Automotive; and Brenda Yester Baty, the strategic initiatives chief at Lennar (LEN).Even as the fight among the suits escalated, United continued, as other airlines have, to quietly reinvest in making flying more pleasant.The company on Tuesday said it would retire its 747 fleet from scheduled service by the end of 2018. It also ordered 25 Boeing (BA) 737-700 planes, adding to an earlier order of 40 such aircraft. United is set to have the planes delivered at the end of next year.United seeks to shrink its regional fleet of 50-seat aircraft, and the 737s are bigger and more fuel-efficient planes.Those will have bigger overhead bins, along with an interior that ""creates a larger sense of space through sculpted sidewall panels and LED cabin lighting that mimics soft blue skies and sunset colors.""The orders continue a shift among the bigger carriers away from smaller jets. That trend, the Wall Street Journal noted, contributed to regional carrier Republic Airways’ (RJET) filing for bankruptcy protection last month.Image provided by Shutterstock.

Energy stocks were among the weakest of the day in the stock market.But leading stocks fared relatively better, with the IBD 50 basically flat in late trade. The retail sector was higher, even though today's report on consumer confidence was disappointing.Restaurants were up. Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) surged 11% as it broke out of a saucer-type base with a 40.92 buy point. The restaurant late Monday beat profit and sales expectations for Q4.Tobacco giant Altria Group (MO) topped the 61.84 buy point of a flat base. Shares also have climbed above the 61.48 alternate entry.Honeywell (HON) slid 1% in heavy trading and is now below a 107.51 buy point. Shares of the aerospace company surged Monday on word of a possible merger with United Technologies (UTX), but the stock reversed sharply lower, and the selling spilled over into today's session.Earnings reports slammed some noteworthy stocks. Store Capital (STOR) skidded 3% in active turnover despite the real estate investment trust's Q4 results that topped expectations. The company backed its 2016 guidance of adjusted funds from operations per share of $1.59 to $1.63.
"
207,HON,"With hotels in 87 countries, Marriott International (MAR) is finding it harder to protect itself from currency swings, as exchange rates in the $5.3-trillion-a-day market defy expectations.The chain locked in its 2016 currency hedges about four months ago, anticipating the dollar would extend a three-year winning streak. Instead, the greenback has had a mixed performance, slumping against the euro and yen this year amid turmoil in global markets. That’s a problem because the cost of the hedges would be wasted if the dollar weakens.“For better or for worse, you are locking in,” said Leeny Oberg, Marriott’s chief financial officer, in a telephone interview from Bethesda, Md. The company set hedges in 2016 with anticipation that the U.S. currency will strengthen, but less than last year.The dollar’s gain in 2015 and surging volatility squeezed revenue for Marriott, McDonald’s (MCD) and other companies that sell goods or services overseas, triggering some headaches for finance executives. It made sense for corporate treasurers to hedge against the dollar’s rally in 2015, which was widely predicted by analysts.This year, the task is becoming trickier as currency forecasts, which corporate treasurers use as a guide of where to hedge, have been upended. Options prices imply that, since the start of December, when some treasurers would have been firming up 2016 hedges, the chances of the greenback strengthening beyond the median year-end forecast of $1.08 per euro have fallen to 37% from 48%. The likelihood of it reaching the median estimate of 121 yen has plunged to 19% from 49%.The dollar’s path hinges on whether the Federal Reserve can keep raising interest rates while its biggest peers expand stimulus and the specter of a global slowdown threatens to derail the tightening cycle.Hundreds of companies in North America and Europe blamed currencies for hurting earnings last year, according to Scottsdale, Ariz.-based FiREapps, which makes software to help businesses reduce the effect of currency swings. Foreign exchange shaved 9% from McDonald’s full-year earnings per share and chopped more than $17 billion from Wal-Mart Stores’ (WMT) sales last year.A surging dollar decreases the value of overseas sales when they’re translated into the U.S. currency for the purpose of reporting earnings. If the revenue is left in the foreign country and not actually exchanged into dollars, the decline is on paper only. The strong dollar also hurts U.S. companies by making imported goods cheaper while U.S. exports are more expensive in foreign markets.""Companies are getting hit big-time by foreign exchange,"" said Niklas Bergentoft, a New York-based director at Deloitte & Touche LLP, who co-authored a report on corporate hedging published this week. ""We see this continuing for 2016."" Deloitte surveyed 133 corporations with revenue ranging from $1 billion to more than $50 billion.For companies in the S&P 500 index, a 1% gain in the trade-weighted dollar lowers collective revenue by about 0.3 percentage point, said Stewart Warther, an equity strategist with BNP Paribas in New York. A Fed gauge of the trade-weighted dollar rallied 11% last year and 8% in 2014. The biggest risk is it keeps going for another year.“All our hedges expired for 2015, and you move into 2016, and there’s a reset for everyone back to the market,” said Tom Szlosek, chief financial officer of Honeywell International (HON).The maker of industrial goods ranging from aircraft engines to gas detectors locked in hedges for the euro at $1.10 this year, said Szlosek, whose treasury team reports to him monthly on currency movements. The euro rose 0.5% for the week to $1.0984 as of 6:41 a.m. New York time Friday.Last year, the company offset about 85% of its euro exposure at $1.24, limiting the hit from foreign exchange to 10 cents of full-year earnings per share, which was $6.04. This year, the lower hedge level means foreign-exchange effects may reduce annual earnings by as much as 15 cents a share, he said.For Marriott, dollar strength will probably reduce the fees it collects for managing hotels by $30 million this year because about a quarter of this year’s estimated $2.02 billion in fee revenue will come from outside the U.S., Oberg said.The company uses forward contracts to manage its exposure to the yen, euro, pound and Canadian dollar, because they’re the most actively traded currencies and cheapest to hedge. These contracts cover about one-third of foreign revenue from hotel management fees.Hedges in 2015 helped keep the decline from foreign exchange at $32 million of fee revenue, said Oberg, who declined to say at what level Marriott has hedged for 2016.“The currencies did move farther than I think people expected,” she said. “So, it was very helpful to have the hedges.”About 90% of companies use derivatives, including forwards and swaps, to offset their currency exposure, the Deloitte study showed. Most surveyed firms hedged an average of 68% of their cash flow for three months -- that hedge ratio dropped down to 59% of transactions for three to six months in the future, then fell to 50% for six months to a year ahead.McDonald’s said it expects the dollar to strengthen this year, but at a slower pace, knocking off about 20 cents from earnings per share in 2016 following a 50-cent hit last year. The company focuses its hedging on the euro, pound, Canadian and Australian dollars and yen, said Becca Hary, a spokeswoman. The hamburger chain only hedges for operations reasons and not for the accounting effect when translating foreign currencies to the dollar for earnings reports, she said.Wal-Mart’s decline in sales because of weaker foreign currencies last year was “by far” the largest ever for the retailer, David Cheesewright, chief of the company’s international operations, said on a Feb. 18 conference call. Wal-Mart expects the strong dollar to drive down sales by $12 billion this year.Companies that have manufacturing plants in foreign countries, such as Honeywell, can mitigate the fallout from currency fluctuations with “natural hedges” by keeping costs in the local money, Szlosek said. Honeywell, which has factories in countries such as Mexico and Hungary, says that including exports it generates about 55% of its $38.6 billion of revenue outside the U.S.“We have a big manufacturing base in those places; we try to source as much as we can locally and pay in local currency,” Szlosek said. “That is a nice offset.”

229,HON,"Aspen Technology's main target customers might be in the slow lane, but the enterprise software company is in high gear. Aspen's stock has trended higher most of this year despite dips in oil prices, even as it works through a major business transition.
"
230,HON,"Investors have responded to its moves. Aspen Technology (AZPN) stock is up nearly 25% this year after falling 16% in 2014.
"
231,HON,"Falling oil prices should, in theory, hurt Aspen, since its business management software targets oil, gas, energy and chemical companies. The software is designed to help these companies better manage their plants and supply chains.
"
232,HON,"But Aspen has a knack for beating quarterly estimates, even in uncertain times for oil prices. For its fiscal Q3 ended March 31, Aspen's EPS minus items of 37 cents, up 32% from the year-earlier quarter, beat Wall Street expectations by 6 cents. Revenue of $111.3 million, up 7.4%, beat by $3 million.
"
233,HON,"The better-than-expected results bewildered some analysts and investors, says Mark Schappel, an analyst for The Benchmark Co.
"
234,HON,"""People think that because crude prices are falling, oil and gas companies will have less money and therefore are going to cut back on their capex, which is going to impact Aspen's business,"" Schappel told IBD.
"
235,HON,"But Schappel, who is also a chemical engineer, says Aspen's software is even more important at such times, since it helps refineries find the most cost-efficient ways to turn crude oil into gasoline, kerosene, jet fuel and more.
"
236,HON,"""Their software is becoming more and more important to refineries and chemical plants because those guys run on very tight margins,"" he said. ""They are trying to squeeze every penny they can out of these plants, and Aspen's software helps them do that.""
"
237,HON,"Most of Aspen's oil and gas customers are refineries, or so-called downstream operations, as opposed to explorations companies, the upstream operations that often have more limited capex spending.
"
238,HON,"The company is aided by that breakdown, says Monika Garg, an analyst for Pacific Crest Securities.
"
239,HON,"""The exposure of Aspen Tech to upstream is only 12% of revenue, whereas their exposure for downstream is almost 28% — and those 28% of companies are making tons of money,"" Garg told IBD. ""That is why the stock has done very well.""
"
240,HON,"Aspen also benefits by its broad range of revenue sources. Garg says the company's revenue breakdown is roughly 38% from energy companies, 31% engineering and construction and 26% chemicals. The other 5% comes from customers in a number of fields, including pharmaceuticals, consumer packaged goods, and mining.
"
241,HON,"The company says its total addressable market is $10.9 billion and that it already is in control of $2 billion of that, Richard Davis, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, said in a May 4 research report following the company's annual investor day. Aspen said rivals combined also control about $2 billion, with the rest up for grabs, Davis wrote.
"
242,HON,"""Considering these projections against the total 2014 presentation, Aspen has increased its market opportunity by more than $800 million in the last year,"" Davis said.
"
243,HON,"Aspen's closest rivals in the process simulation and modeling software market for refining oil and other chemicals are Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Invensys, acquired last year by energy management firm Schneider Electric for $5.2 billion.
"
244,HON,"All three rivals, though, focus more on other aspects of plant operations, leaving the process simulation and modeling software market open to Aspen, Schappel says.
"
245,HON,"""Aspen's product is becoming much better than the other products, the gap is widening and that is why you see them taking market share,"" Schappel said.
"
246,HON,"He says Aspen's lead includes the supply chain software market for oil, gas and chemical industries where it competes with SAP (SAP), and where it's ""taking incremental share from SAP,"" according to Schappel.
"
247,HON,"In October, Aspen's outlook for the December quarter missed expectations. On that report, Aspen stock fell as much as 22% the next day to a 22-month low of 31.57.
"
248,HON,"But the weak outlook was a function of the company's five-year move from a license software model, where it collects a large fee upfront, to a subscription model where customers pay a smaller fee per month for software as needed, says Richard Williams, an analyst for Summit Research.
"
249,HON,"""It takes a long time to go from an upfront software recognition to a subscription model,"" Williams told IBD. ""The process creates a distortion where it makes your revenue look lower than it really is for awhile.""
"
250,HON,"But the move to on-demand software-as-a-service is trend software makers must face, he says, including leaders like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL).
"
251,HON,"On the plus side, eventually the ""subscription model takes a lot of the volatility out of the quarterly numbers,"" analyst Schappel said.Aspen Technology's main target customers might be in the slow lane, but the enterprise software company is in high gear.

Garg says the company's revenue breakdown is roughly 38% from energy companies, 31% engineering and construction and 26% chemicals. The other 5% comes from customers in a number of fields, including pharmaceuticals, consumer packaged goods, and mining.The company says its total addressable market is $10.9 billion and that it already is in control of $2 billion of that, Richard Davis, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity, said in a May 4 research report following the company's annual investor day. Aspen said rivals combined also control about $2 billion, with the rest up for grabs, Davis wrote.""Considering these projections against the total 2014 presentation, Aspen has increased its market opportunity by more than $800 million in the last year,"" Davis said.Aspen's closest rivals in the process simulation and modeling software market for refining oil and other chemicals are Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Invensys, acquired last year by energy management firm Schneider Electric for $5.2 billion.All three rivals, though, focus more on other aspects of plant operations, leaving the process simulation and modeling software market open to Aspen, Schappel says.""Aspen's product is becoming much better than the other products, the gap is widening and that is why you see them taking market share,"" Schappel said.He says Aspen's lead includes the supply chain software market for oil, gas and chemical industries where it competes with SAP (SAP), and where it's ""taking incremental share from SAP,"" according to Schappel.In October, Aspen's outlook for the December quarter missed expectations. On that report, Aspen stock fell as much as 22% the next day to a 22-month low of 31.57.But the weak outlook was a function of the company's five-year move from a license software model, where it collects a large fee upfront, to a subscription model where customers pay a smaller fee per month for software as needed, says Richard Williams, an analyst for Summit Research.""It takes a long time to go from an upfront software recognition to a subscription model,"" Williams told IBD. ""The process creates a distortion where it makes your revenue look lower than it really is for awhile.""But the move to on-demand software-as-a-service is trend software makers must face, he says, including leaders like Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL).On the plus side, eventually the ""subscription model takes a lot of the volatility out of the quarterly numbers,"" analyst Schappel said.

It was the fourth straight quarter that Apple likely captured over 90% of the smartphone industry's overall profits.
"
311,HON,"Of the top smartphone vendors, only Apple and Samsung were profitable in the third quarter. Samsung, which uses the Android operating systems from Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, captured 11% of smartphone industry profits in Q3. But Samsung was No. 1 in smartphone sales, with 24.5% market share last quarter.
"
312,HON,"Together, Apple and Samsung technically accounted for 105% of industry profits because all the other major vendors lost money. Apple took in $17.78 billion in smartphone operating income in calendar Q3, compared with $2.08 billion for Samsung. Together, the two had $19.86 billion in smartphone profits, compared with $18.94 billion for the whole industry, Canaccord said.
"
313,HON,"""Apple dominated the premium-tier global smartphone market during calendar Q3, with record share of industry profits,"" Walkley said in the report. ""We believe the iPhone 6 and 6S products should continue to post strong sales and high-end smartphone market share gains.
"
314,HON,"""With only 31% of the iPhone installed base having upgraded to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices by Apple's fiscal Q4 2015 (ended Sept. 26), we anticipate continued strong replacement sales through calendar 2016 and beyond.""
"
315,HON,"Walkley rates Apple stock a buy with a price target of 160. Apple stock was up 1.5%, near 114, in late-afternoon trading on the stock market today.
"
316,HON,"Walkley predicts that the installed base of iPhone users will hit 503 million worldwide by year-end.
"
317,HON,"""This base should drive strong future iPhone replacement sales, earnings, as well as cash flow generation to fund strong long-term capital returns programs,"" Walkley said.

319,HON,"UBS analyst Steven Milunovich on Monday reiterated his buy rating on Apple stock but trimmed his price target to 140 from 150. His move reflects reports of slowing iPhone production at contract manufacturer Hon Hai.
"
320,HON,"Milunovich expects 75 million iPhone unit sales in the December quarter, in line with consensus estimates. But he cut his March quarter iPhone unit estimate to 61 million from 62.5 million.
"
321,HON,"""Our fiscal 2016 iPhone estimate now calls for 4% unit growth, including 5% growth in the December quarter, a flat March quarter, and mid-single-digit growth in the second half of fiscal 2016. There could be a new 4-inch phone, worth perhaps 10 million units.""

337,HON,"Aggressive growth investors know that betting against the the stock market trendis a bad idea.Yet sometimes aggressive investors will snub a fine-performing sector because it just doesn't sound growthy enough.This too is a bad idea. When the market is rewarding conservative names, savvy investors adjust.Consider four stocks from the Diversified Operations industry group. The names will prompt groans from aggressive investors. But get past the initial emotions. These stocks are outperforming the market.Diversified manufacturer 3M (NYSE:MMM) has gained 24% since mid-October, when the market pegged a short-term bottom. (During the same period, the major indexes gained 12% to 14%.) Big-cap 3M grew earnings 11% to 15% in the past four quarters. The last time the company delivered double-digit earnings in any quarter was in 2010.Pretax margin has stayed in a 20% to 23% range for at least nine years.The strong U.S. dollar could provide some headwinds for 3M. In Q3, 3M estimates that currency effects decreased quarterly income by $10 million.The company has shifted strategies since Inge Thulin became CEO in 2012. Thulin has increased spending on research and development and is pushing international growth.Honeywell (NYSE:HON), also a big cap, gained 20% from mid-October to now. Earnings growth has accelerated from 6% to 8% and 19% in recent quarters. Pretax margin in 2013 was 14%, the best in at least nine years.CEO David Cote said in a recent news release that Honeywell can deliver higher organic growth and expand margins in 2015 despite ""only modest GDP growth in most regions around the world.""Carlisle Companies (NYSE:CSL), a midcap, rose 19% since mid-October. Quarterly earnings grew 19%, 17%, 16% and, most recently, 28%. Revenue growth was 13% in Q3, the best in 11 quarters.Carlisle jacked up sales outside the U.S. from 12% in 2009 to 23% in 2013. The company has been growing through acquisitions.Roper Industries (NYSE:ROP) gained 14% since mid-October, narrowly topping the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Quarterly earnings growth dropped to 9% in Q3, ending a long streak of double-digit growth.All four stocks have Composite Ratings of 92 or better.The stocks also are housed in IBD's Miscellaneous sector, which was No. 1 among 33 sectors in Tuesday's IBD.Of the four stocks, three are extended from proper buy zones. Carlisle, though, appears to be working on a flat base and has found support at the 50-day moving average. The potential buy point is 91.99.Honeywell and Roper are barely extended from first-stage bases.Given the moderate growth these stocks offer, investors who play the conservative stocks should lower their price targets and lower their cut-loss figure.

397,HON,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed.

Are you surprised by his strength?HC: You mean, he's closed within 40 points? Six years older than me even. Yeh, he's a real threat.Q: Thousands of Americans attend his rallies.HC: Thousands of Americans watch the Mets. I know you guys want a horse-race story.

Are you comfortable so far outside the mainstream?HC: I will be by Iowa.Q: What are your qualifications to become president?HC: I was in the Senate, same as Barack.Q: Many people say he had no qualifying experience to be commander-in-chief.HC: Exactly. But look what we got.Q: Ma'am, we wasted a trillion stimulus dollars, got the worst economic recovery since World War II. Our national debt soared. Allies don't trust us. Enemies play us.

The program let iPhone users trade in devices for gift card credit toward the purchase of a new iPhone.In China's iPhone trade-in program, Foxconn refurbishes the iPhones and distributes them on secondary markets.In a research report Monday, Morgan Stanley analysts Joseph Moore and Katy Huberty said the trade-in program is helping boost iPhone 6 sales and is affecting the lower-priced Android market.""Most suppliers expect seasonal quarter-over-quarter growth for total iPhones in the September quarter, which could imply another quarter of at least 40% year-over-year demand for other brands, especially in China, Apple continues to take share.""The report said the trade-in program is seeing ""strong demand.""""Continued strong iPhone 6 demand and early build plans for second-half 2015 are positive for the upcoming iPhone 6s cycle,"" the analysts wrote.

478,HON,"Simon ""Si"" Ramo was the oldest person awarded a patent. He was 100. Now, two years later, he thinks that might have been his last. But you never know with the Energizer Bunny of the centurion set: He led the team that invented the electron microscope for General Electric (GE), earning 25 patents there before he was 30. At Hughes Aircraft, he developed the first guided air-to-air missile for the new U.S. Air Force in the early 1950s. He started TRW Inc. to create the intercontinental ballistic missile system to protect America from nuclear attack by the Soviets. In 1964 he formed Bunker-Ramo, which pioneered computer electronics, including the Nasdaq quotation system. At 95 he became an engineering professor at the University of Southern California and three years later added three more books to his already published 15.""He's a multidimensional leader and a true Renaissance man,"" Bruce Gerding, who has worked with Ramo on projects over four decades, told IBD. ""He's an accomplished violinist, wrote a best-selling book on tennis and a guide to using humor as a management tool, 'To Wit.' ""California Kid At 102Ramo still lives in L.A., where he hangs out with younger Hollywood, like 98-year-old Kirk Douglas, but decided nearly a century of interviews was enough and declined to comment for this story.Ramo was born in Salt Lake City in 1913 to Lithuanian Jewish immigrants who owned a clothing store where he spent his teens working.The whiz kid got into the University of Utah at 16 by investing his $325 savings in a better violin.He played it to win a music contest and gain the prize — a scholarship to study anything he wanted.Four years later, he had a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering. At 23, he graduated magna cum laude with dual Ph.D.s in electrical engineering and physics from the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.In 1936 Depression America, jobs weren't plentiful, but he was hired by GE for two reasons: his impressive academic record and because the recruiter realized Ramo's violin skills could help the company's commitment to the community symphony in Schenectady, N.Y.Ramo soon became its concertmaster while leading the research lab over the next decade.Much of the work focused on high-powered microwave frequencies for radar. He also wrote his first two books while at GE, the second of which, ""Introduction to Microwaves"" in 1945, sold 1 million copies in eight languages and continues to be used.In 1937, Ramo had married Virginia Smith and they had two sons, James and Alan. She died in 2009.Ramo enjoyed living in the Los Angeles area, and in 1946 he accepted an offer to direct electronics research at Hughes Aircraft Co. as unspent war funds poured in.He formed an effective team with Dean Wooldridge, a Caltech classmate who managed the business side of projects, such as integrated radar and fire-control systems.But in ""The Business of Science,"" published in 1988, Ramo described their frustration trying to communicate with the eccentric billionaire owner, Howard Hughes.""It was in 1950, as we were engaged in the challenging task of doubling our size, when his problems with commercial airline operations at TWA and moviemaking at RKO began to make front-page news,"" Ramo wrote. ""Department of Defense leaders expressed alarm that so large a fraction of their most urgent military-technology projects were in a company owned by Hughes. They could deliberately set out to rein in Hughes Aircraft by placing new contracts elsewhere ... yet they knew such action would destroy it and its best people would leave, and failure to perform would result.""They repeatedly hinted that it would be well if a few of the key people were to establish another company to create the competition that was needed — provided the departures did not get out of hand.""After several meetings with Hughes that confirmed their concerns, Ramo and his partner founded Ramo-Wooldridge in 1953 with the financial backing of Thompson Products, an auto parts supplier.The Pentagon quickly tapped the new firm to head development of the first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), playing catch-up to the Soviets.The mission impossible: Invent a missile 10 times more powerful than existing ones. Make sure its material could withstand re-entry into the atmosphere. Include a guidance system that would land it precisely on a target on the other side of the world.Ramo and his teammate ran into plenty of glitches. Such as: After watching several test rockets blow up on their launch pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., one rose six inches before exploding.Ramo turned to the general observing the tests and quipped, ""Well, Benny, now we know the thing can fly. All we have to do is improve its range a bit.""That they did. Coordinating a maze of subcontractors, Ramo beat the Russians in producing the first ICBM in 1958, without serious cost overruns.Aiming HighAlso in 1958, Ramo merged his firm with Thompson Products to form TRW Inc., and he headed development of the Thor, Atlas and Titan rockets over the next decade.The Atlas was the launch vehicle for NASA's Mercury spacecraft that enabled John Glenn to become the first American to orbit the earth in 1962.TRW also built the space probe to Jupiter, made engines for the Apollo moon landings and invented rocket-destroying lasers.Ramo steered his team into other areas, including auto electronics and computerizing customers' bill-paying history for retailers, banks and credit card companies.In 2002 he sold his military business to Northrop Grumman (NOC).The car supply business became TRW Automotive (TRW), headquartered in Livonia, Mich., which enjoyed a 7,500% stock ride from 2009 to last summer.This month the Federal Trade Commission approved the purchase of TRW Automotive by Germany's ZF Friedrichshafen after TRW finishes its sale of its suspension business to THK Co.Back in 1964, TRW and aerospace giant Martin Marietta (now part of Lockheed Martin (LMT) formed jointly owned Bunker-Ramo Corp., with Ramo as president. It manufactured electronics for the military and developed early digital computers.In 1981, Bunker-Ramo was bought by what became Allied Signal, which merged with Honeywell (HON) in 1999.Presidential HubRamo went on to found other companies and sell them. He has also given advice to the White House, Pentagon and NASA.President Gerald Ford named him co-chairman of a group that prioritized science and technology goals. President Jimmy Carter awarded him the National Medal of Science. President Ronald Reagan gave him the Medal of Freedom and had him coach Taiwan on developing high-tech industries.""Dr. Ramo commands respect across government, business and academia,"" said Gerding. ""His greatest strength is as a communicator, with a way of taking complex scientific issues and explaining them so they can be understood by his audience, whether they are industry leaders, students, politicians or the general public. He's also fantastic at telling stories to illustrate his points.""So what has he learned about business management in his long career? He has filled several volumes with advice, such as these tips from ""Meetings, Meetings and More Meetings: Getting Things Done When People Are Involved"": While video transmission may replace some in-person gatherings, teleconferences and email don't let you assess facial expression and body language. Consider why you were invited to a meeting and develop a secret agenda, as well as anticipating those of others. If you chair a meeting, press participants to reach clarity about the differences in their viewpoints, then find common ground. Combine ethics with good manners when criticizing others. Managers should lighten up the discussion if a meeting gets tense.When he was 12, Ramo abandoned his hope of playing violin professionally after seeing the great Jascha Heifetz perform far beyond anything he thought he could attain.Before Heifetz's death in 1987, Ramo went on stage and played a duet with him, showing that with persistence and hard work, any dream can be achieved.

540,HON,"Homes With Good Energy
"
541,HON,"Energy efficiency was a big theme in another recent survey conducted by the NAHB. Among the 10 features homebuilders said they are most likely to include in a typical new home this year were low-emissivity windows to reflect sunlight and heat, Energy Star appliances and windows, and programmable thermostats.
"
542,HON,"Beyond energy efficiency, buyers increasingly want to live in ""healthy"" homes, says Sarah Barnard, an interior designer in Santa Monica, Calif. ""They're interested in nontoxic materials and clean-air quality achieved in the baseline construction of either a new build or remodel,"" she said.
"
543,HON,"Healthy living trumps environmental sustainability these days, she says. ""The distance the item has to travel to get to the job site is less important than the inherent materials.""
"
544,HON,"Healthier materials include water-based paints and adhesives that don't throw off gases, natural fibers such as wool carpets vs. synthetics and natural stones.
"
545,HON,"Features routinely built into homes may get more advanced if builders start adopting the kind of innovations featured in the aspirational ""New American Home"" of 2015, a high-concept dwelling built by Blue Heron in conjunction with the International Builders Show.
"
546,HON,"The home incorporates photovoltaic panels, weather-sensitive irrigation systems and hydronic air handlers, among other innovations.Outdoor living rooms, spa-like baths, retractable glass walls, home-management tech systems — and pet suites. These home amenities aren't just the province of the top 1%.They're among the most popular features homebuyers and renovators want in a home these days, regardless of their budgets, according to builders, designers and remodelers.""Residential trends usually start in the luxury market and trickle down to the rest of the market,"" said Jeffrey Lake, national director of architecture for Irvine, Calif.-based Standard Pacific Homes (SPF).To help determine how buyers use their homes and what features they want the most, Standard Pacific conducts ""livability"" studies with many buyers who have been in their new home six months to a year, interviewing them in person or online.A Real Pet ProjectOne result of those interviews led the company to new options for buyers: pet suites. Ranging from 50 square feet to 170 square feet, they feature low shower stalls with handheld faucets for ""puppy washes."" They boast ample storage for toys, leashes and outfits, and the larger suites feature washers and dryers.""It's been getting rave reviews,"" Lake said. ""It's an option we're offering in a huge number of our communities.""A more common desire, and one that mirrors a huge nationwide trend, is for outdoor living rooms that extend the indoor spaces. Like some other builders, Standard Pacific integrates flooring, installs movable glass walls to eliminate visual barriers and often puts in outdoor fireplaces, flat-screen TVs and refrigerators.""It's more than a covered patio,"" Lake said.Standard Pacific also extends outdoor living spaces in master suites, where models are furnished with resort-style beds or chaises.What Baby Boomers WantNear the top of the want list for all types of buyers are spa-like baths, home designers and builders say.""The baby boom generation has been traveling their entire lives and staying in four-star hotels. They know what a spa bath looks like and they want to have it in their homes,"" said Timothy McCarthy, managing director of Traditions of America, a developer of active-adult housing communities in Pennsylvania.Traditions of America's designers help buyers customize their homes, which average between $300,000 and $400,000. But some buyers spend up to $300,000 more to customize them, McCarthy says.""They don't want to buy an off-the-shelf model. People are investing in their homes. This is their last, best home and they want to enjoy it,"" he said.Millennials may lack the budgets of older buyers, but don't appear to want to skimp on design.""Millennials today would rather have a smaller space but nicer features and options,"" said Joe Duffus, CEO of interior design and merchandising firm Builders Designs, which works with homebuilders and developers.Millennials, he says, are ""the most design-savvy buying group ever.""Automation NationThey are also probably the most tech-savvy homebuyer. Homes catering to first-time buyers will get a little smaller but home technology will become increasingly prevalent, according to panelists at the International Builders Show held in Las Vegas earlier this year.Home automation systems for all age groups are ""hugely popular,"" Duffus says. Various systems allow occupants to program and remotely control temperature, lighting, security and more.""I don't know any builder that is not using a programmable thermostat right now, even for first-time buyers,"" Duffus said.Some popular automated thermostat systems used by builders are by Nest and Honeywell (HON), he says.Kitchens and baths are the two most popular remodeling jobs by far, according to a survey by the National Association of Home Builders. The reason cited: a desire for better or newer amenities.In bathrooms, jetted tubs are out. Soaking tubs placed away from walls are in. So are large walk-in showers with frameless doors and multiple shower heads.""For those who can't afford both, they will settle on a larger shower,"" said Robert Criner, chairman of the NAHB Remodelers and president of Criner Remodeling in Newport News, Va.In kitchens, said Criner, ""everybody wants islands.""

551,HON,"How sweet is it to win a slice of the Apple iPhone 6 business?It should be like candy for analog chipmaker and IBD Leaderboard stock Skyworks Solutions (SWKS), a key supplier for the new Apple (AAPL) smartphone.The Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus use chips from Skyworks, Avago Technologies (AVGO) and other firms, according to findings from tech repair firm iFixit, which opened up iPhones bought in Melbourne, Australia.Multiple power amplifier components from Skyworks were found in the iPhone 6 teardowns, Sterne Agee analyst Vijay Rakesh told IBD.In terms of iPhone 6 component suppliers, ""big winners"" are Skyworks, Avago and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) ""with content up 30%-90% from previous iPhone 5s models,"" he said in a research note.Rakesh estimates about $4 worth of content comes from Skyworks in every new iPhone 6. The opportunity for Skyworks, he adds, depends on the number of iPhones Apple sells.He cites Apple's Sept. 22 announcement that it sold over 10 million new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus models, a record, just three days after the launch Sept. 19.""Apple is always a big catalyst for all smartphone component suppliers,"" Rakesh said.Stock Amps UpSkyworks' stock on Sept. 19 notched its highest closing price since 2000, ending at 57.68 after the Apple iPhone 6 teardown news. It closed up 3.4% Wednesday to 58.84. But Skyworks powered up well before the Apple iPhone 6 debut. It has gained 106% this year.In an interview with IBD, Skyworks CEO David Aldrich would not comment on whether Skyworks is a supplier for the iPhone 6, although the iFixit teardowns found the technology inside.""I am not at liberty to comment about specific companies,"" he said. ""But Skyworks has become very successful at increasing our content with all of our smartphone customers.""Skyworks develops and manufacturers high-performance analog semiconductor products. Its portfolio includes amplifiers, attenuators, battery chargers, circulators, DC/DC converters, demodulators, detectors, diodes, directional couplers and infrastructure RF (radio frequency) subsystems.Its semiconductors enable wireless connectivity in smartphones, tablets and other devices.Leveraging core technologies, Skyworks supports automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, energy management, GPS, industrial, medical, military, wireless networking, smartphone and tablet applications.Skyworks has been on a roll on the financial front. It's seen double-digit sales and earnings growth in all but one of the past seven quarters. Its growth accelerated in the most recent quarter to the fastest pace since mid-2011. Earnings rose 54% to 83 cents a share. Sales climbed 35% to $587 million.Connectivity Is The KeyWhat's been fueling growth at Skyworks?""Fortunately for us, the growth is being driven from both a market and product standpoint,"" Aldrich told IBD. ""We've worked very hard over the past decade to diversify our business into a broader set of markets and to produce more products and solutions. At the core is connectivity in all its forms, whether that is through a smartphone or an automobile or the home, which is becoming increasingly connected in many ways.""He said on a July conference call for Q3 of fiscal 2014: ""Our business results are being fueled by a surge in global adoption of connectivity in all its forms across a diverse set of end markets. We are riding a wave of powerful underlying market forces, all enabled by the availability of efficient, high-performance connectivity solutions.""Among these forces, he said, are ""the enabling of billions of unconnected users with first-time Internet access in the emerging economies; advancing new forms of content delivery, such as streaming music services, on-demand media and over-the-content distribution; and supporting cloud services and mobile ecommerce.""Skyworks' technology has its largest presence in smartphones, Aldrich told IBD.In the past couple of quarters, smartphones and tablets have been big growth drivers, he adds, whether it's increasing Skyworks' content in these products by providing more complete solutions or by gaining market share.""In general, smartphones are becoming more complicated and complex,"" he said. ""They need to operate over many frequencies having more functionality.""Skyworks provides a lot of the technology that goes into the more sophisticated smartphones such as solutions that support GPS and high-resolution cameras.Another growth driver: ""Skyworks has been very successful at capturing developing economic markets like China and penetrating new regions of the world that are deploying connectivity in a big way,"" said Aldrich.He points out that Skyworks is penetrating markets outside Europe and North America, with many Chinese buying smartphones for the first time.As for the future: ""Skyworks is entering a new and exciting growth phase driven by global wireless proliferation and the Internet of Things,"" said Aldrich in a statement announcing Q3 results. ""Quite simply, we are capitalizing on the macro trend to connect virtually everyone and everything, all the time. Our high-performance analog solutions and system-level integration capabilities coupled with our operational agility and scalability are enabling us to connect the previously unconnected.""Skyworks is a part of IBD's Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group. It has the highest Composite Rating in the group, with a 99 out of a possible 99.Key customers include Cisco Systems (CSCO), General Electric (GE), Google (GOOGL), Honeywell (HON), Nokia (NOK) and Samsung Electronics.

578,HON,"General Electric's (GE) acquisition offer for French multinational Alstom's power business reportedly is likely to face a full-scale investigation by European Union antitrust regulators.Last June, GE announced that it had won approval from Alstom's board for the all-cash offer to buy the company's Power and Grid businesses, which at that time GE valued at $16.9 billion.The watchdog European Commission may scrutinize the proposal with an eye to competitive concerns and may demand remedies, Reuters said, citing sources.There is a strong possibility that the commission could open a phase two investigation, the report said, although no final decisions have been made yet.If GE and Alstom, which specializes in manufacturing transport and energy infrastructure, offer concessions, they could alleviate concerns.GE says that it's cooperating with the commission in its inquiry. ""Our goal is to secure the required regulatory approvals and close the transaction by mid-2015,"" the company told Reuters.GE shares were up fractionally at 25.25 in Wednesday afternoon trading in the stock market today.GE has formed an extended flat base, was trading just below a 27.53 pivot point and was on track for its ninth higher close in a row.Still, it has a weak IBD Composite Rating — only 43 out of a best-possible 99 — and was trading above its 50-day line but below its 200-day.A European Commission spokesman declined to comment on the probe of the deal. Alstom couldn't immediately be reached for comment.The EU competition authority is likely to announce the probe of the GE-Alstom deal next week, Reuters said.The European Commission had blocked GE's earlier bid to acquire Honeywell International (HON) even though the proposal had gotten a green light from U.S. regulators.

579,HON,"As the multibillion-dollar market for military and commercial drones gains traction, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are just two firms that could benefit from the State Department's newly announced policy on expanding drone exports to allies.On Tuesday, the Obama administration established new standards for the global export of the unmanned devices that include strict sale conditions and ""end-use assurances"" from recipient nations.The new policy, which prohibits the use of American drones for ""unlawful surveillance,"" opens the door to U.S. drone and arms manufacturers looking to make sales abroad.According to Reuters, the U.S. has sold armed drones to the U.K., while unarmed U.S. military drones have been sold to countries like France and Italy. The State Department will now review requests for armed drones from Italy and Turkey.Lockheed could notably stand to gain from increased drone exports: the General Atomics' Predator and Reaper drones use Lockheed missiles.The State Department's decision could also boost makers of drone components.""Additional sales of Reapers to international users would benefit Raytheon, maker of the MTS-B multispectral targeting sensor, and L-3 Communications (LLL), which provides satellite communications components and training simulators,"" said Guggenheim Partners' Roman Schweizer in a note. ""Honeywell (HON) supplies turboprop engines and guidance components.""Lockheed shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today. L-3 dipped 0.4%, Honeywell rose 0.5%, and Raytheon eased 0.6%.Northrup Grumman (NOC), which makes the Global Hawk drone, and General Atomics, a privately held spinoff of General Dynamics (GD), were part of a growing chorus that reportedly had been pushing the U.S. government for more lenient export rules prior to Tuesday's announcement.Meanwhile, the FAA's proposed regulations for flying commercial drones in U.S. airspace have come under fire.Under draft rules, drones would not able to fly over people and must weigh less than 55 pounds, among other restrictions, preventing retailers like Amazon (AMZN) from making commercial drone deliveries. Companies currently authorized by the FAA to fly drones in the country include Trimble Navigation (TRMB) and AeroVironment (AVAV).

582,HON,"During the 30-plus years that he spent at other jobs before becoming CEO of Apogee Enterprises, Joe Puishys learned a lot of important lessons, including the value of reducing your company's exposure to macro trends.That lesson comes in especially handy at Apogee (APOG), which designs, develops and sells glass products, services and systems. The company operates in four segments: Architectural Glass, Architectural Framing Systems, Architectural Services and Large-Scale Optical (LSO) Technologies.The first three of those segments are exposed to highly cyclical end markets such as commercial construction. The other, LSO Technologies, makes glass and acrylic products for the much less cyclical custom picture framing market.Commercial construction markets in the U.S. have done pretty well over the past few quarters.That's good news for Apogee's architectural segments, whose products and services include the glass used in a building's windows and outer skin, or curtain wall; the aluminum frames for a building's curtain wall, storefront and entrance systems; and the design, engineering and fabrication of most of the metal systems that Apogee installs.""Last year we had a lot of help from the end markets for commercial construction,"" Puishys told IBD. ""Our end markets grew about 10% in 2014. We expect similar numbers for 2015 and also expect continued tailwinds in commercial construction over the next three years.""Diversified BusinessBut Apogee doesn't want to rely solely on favorable macro trends to attain its growth targets, says Puishys, who previously served as president of a couple of different Honeywell International (HON) divisions.""We were trained at Honeywell not to be constrained by macro trends, so we spread our risk factors around,"" he said. ""When I came to Apogee (in August 2011), I felt we should not be too dependent on commercial construction for our growth.""To help reduce its dependency on U.S. commercial construction markets, and to diversify its business, Apogee has put a big focus on new product development, new end markets and new geographies.""You really need a three-year horizon of products to add to your portfolio to be competitive,"" Puishys said.Apogee measures its success at introducing new products through a vitality index, or VI. The VI tells you the percentage of revenue that your business is generating from products released during the previous three years.""In the consumer electronics business, you might want a VI of 100% — all of your revenue should come from products introduced in the last three years,"" Puishys said. ""But in most of our businesses, something in the 20% to 25% range is appropriate.""Each of Apogee's businesses now has a VI target to reach. In some cases the target might be less than 10%, while in others it might be in the mid-20% range.New product ideas cover a range of applications. They include stronger glass systems to meet hurricane-resistance standards as well as new technologies that can make a glass exterior darker when the bright sun hits and lighter when the sun fades away.""The development process comes from many factors — from our customers, from our customers' architects, from looking at competitors to find holes in our current portfolio,"" Puishys said. ""You have to keep your eyes and ears open.""Planning AheadApogee also works hard to establish a large backlog of future business. During its fiscal 2015 third quarter, which ended in November, the company had a backlog of $493.9 million. That was up 65% from the prior year and 3% sequentially.In a research note after the Q3 earnings report, analyst Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson said that Apogee's visibility extends beyond just its current backlog.The company also ""works closely with architects/building owners for proposed projects years out,"" Thielman noted. ""This provides a unique view into the prospective project pipeline.""In terms of new end markets, Apogee has already diversified its business with its LSO Technologies segment. This segment sells different types of picture-frame products — including anti-reflective glass and glass with ultraviolet (UV) protection — to retailers of arts, crafts, hobby supplies and other goods.Apogee is the exclusive supplier to major chains such as Michaels (MIK), Aaron's (AAN), Hobby Lobby and Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores.Although the LSO Technologies segment contributes only about 10% of overall revenue, the business is ""very profitable,"" Puishys said, with operating margins in the upper 20% range.""And it's less cyclical than the architectural businesses,"" he said. ""It is a good fit for us.""On the architectural side of the business, Apogee eyes more revenue in the retrofit market, Puishys says. This is where older buildings are renovated with new glass systems rather than being torn down altogether.The company also looks at ways to diversify its architectural segment into broader end markets, Puishys said, ""whether it's the finishes we put in the metal or the anti-reflective technology used in the picture-frame industry. We have a lot of potential to take some of our current technology to other spaces.""Finally, Apogee looks to broaden its geographic reach, both in the U.S. and internationally.In the U.S. — where about 85% of the firm's revenue comes from — it has room to grow on the East Coast, Puishys says. Internationally, the company's near-term plan is to grow its market share in South America, where it has an operation in Brazil.""It's a very diverse and fragmented market with a lot of growth potential,"" Puishys said.Financially, Apogee is in the midst of its strongest run in years, with four straight quarters of 42%-or-better EPS growth and 18%-or-better revenue growth. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to post a 59% year-over-year gain in Q4 earnings and a 13% rise in revenue.""Robust bidding and quoting levels are expected to result in sequential improvement in backlog in Q4,"" analyst Thielman noted. ""This would mark the fifth consecutive quarter of sequential backlog growth.""Apogee has an IBD Composite Rating of 98. It is part of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous group, which ranks No. 18 out of 197 industries that IBD tracks. Other leaders in the group are Caesarstone (CSTE) — a countertop maker featured in The New America on Feb. 9 — and Headwaters (HW).

620,HON,"Life is expensive, in part thanks to energy costs.
"
621,HON,"Electricity and natural gas or oil for heating and cooking will put a dent in anybody's wallet. Employing the right technology products won't make those expenses vanish, but it can cut those costs.
"
622,HON,"Here are a few suggestions for products that can help reduce the burden on your bank account.
"
623,HON," Heating is, of course, a big part of home energy costs. Even if you're using only a room or two, you typically need to crank up the thermostat and heat all the unused rooms to the same level as those being used.
"
624,HON,"One answer: ceramic heaters. This isn't new technology, but the $220 Honeywell (HON) MyEnergySmart HZ-980 from Kaz USA isn't your ordinary heater. It's a compact box measuring about 18 by 16 inches, and puts out up to 5,200 BTUs, enough heat to warm an entire room, so you don't have to warm an entire house or floor. You can preset two favorite temperatures, and a digital display shows the current temperature in the room. The MyEnergySmart has an automatic shut-off time that can be set. Smaller units are available.
"
625,HON," With a government-mandated phase-out kicking in, incandescent bulbs eventually will be a memory. At the moment, florescent bulbs shaped like conventional light bulbs are the ones you see on the shelf. These contain mercury and have other disadvantages, but they also use a lot less energy.
"
626,HON,"LED bulbs, though, use less energy. An increasing number of manufacturers make them, and the prices have come down a lot. We tested the Cree (CREE) LEDs at 60- and 75-watt equivalents. A 40-watt bulb is also available.
"
627,HON,"We say ""equivalent"" because these LED bulbs use far less energy than incandescents. The bulb that puts out light equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent uses only 13.5 watts of electricity and has an estimated 25,000-hour lifespan. Cree estimates the bulb will save nearly $170 in energy costs compared with its incandescent equivalent over the life of the bulb, which at five hours a day would last more than 13 years.
"
628,HON,"We found the light from the LED bulbs we tested easy on the eyes, and with prices coming down to $10 or less per bulb, replacing incandescent and CCL bulbs with an LED when a new bulb becomes necessary is an excellent way to save money.
"
629,HON," Most of us who are energy-conscious have learned the value of setting the thermostat up or down as needed. Programmable thermostats let you create schedules so that you don't have to continually change settings manually. The Nest Learning Thermostat takes thermostat technology a step further. It learns your usage patterns and adapts to them, raising and lowering the temperature automatically after a few days of ""watching"" you.
"
630,HON,"Last month, online search leader Google (GOOG), making a big move in the so-called ""Internet of Things,"" announced an agreement to acquire the thermometer's maker, Nest Labs, for $3.2 billion.
"
631,HON,"The Nest is easy to install, and can be controlled over the Internet so you can make sure that you return home to a comfortable home. At $249, the Nest isn't really going to save much money if you have multiple-zone heating and cooling. But in this case, we'd put the Nest in the room or zone that gets adjusted most often.
"
632,HON," At first glance, it would be easy to classify the $179 T-fal grill from privately held OptiGrill as just an expensive version of the familiar ones endorsed by ex-boxer George Foreman.
"
633,HON,"But the OptiGrill has some significant differences that make it worth the price, and lets you save money over other cooking methods. Sensors built into the grill let you specify what kind of food is being cooked, and there's a manual setting for foods that don't have an automatic setting. You can put frozen food directly on the grill, and the grill will cook the food to the desired doneness. An indicator changes colors as the food cooks so you can take it off when it reaches your desired level of doneness. We liked the convenience and ease of popping on a steak or burger, and the OptiGrill put a nice sear on our food. Besides all that, it's easy to clean.
"
634,HON," The standard gas or electric cooktop in your kitchen is inefficient and wastes energy. The $170 WaringPro Induction Cooktop — the company is traded over-the-counter — claims to use up to 70% less energy than other types of cooktops.

"
674,HON,"General Electric (GE) hiked its dividend by 16% on Friday, while Honeywell (HON) announced a $5 billion buyback. Boeing (BA) late Monday set a $10 billion buyback and raised its dividend by 50%. 3M (MMM) followed with a $22 billion buyback program while raising its payout by a third.
"
675,HON,"For the full year, S&P 500 companies should pay a record $310 billion in dividends, up 10.4% vs. a year earlier, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. That comes after climbing nearly 17% in the prior two years, including a late 2012 flurry as companies rushed to return cash before a possible tripling of the dividend tax rate.
"
676,HON,"Estimated S&P 500 buybacks should spike 20.8% to $482 billion, though that's below 2007's record $589 billion. Apple (AAPL) accounted for much of the increase with its $60 billion buyback program announced in the spring.

"
680,HON,"CEOs' shorter tenures also may play a role. Making a big investment depresses earnings now, with the potential payoff possibly years into the future. But buybacks boost EPS immediately, triggering performance pay bonuses for executives as well as lifting the value of their existing stock compensation.
"
681,HON,"While the economy grew at a 3.6% annual rate, much of that reflected unusual inventory building. The slow, steady recovery hasn't been enough to spur corporate America into significantly boosting hiring or other internal investments.

"
683,HON,"More Uncertainty
"
684,HON,"So with S&P 500 industrials' cash holdings reaching $1.25 trillion, corporations have been returning cash to investors. Dividends offer direct payments to shareholders. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, boosting earnings per share.
"
685,HON,"The Federal Reserve's stimulus program has poured trillions of dollars of cheap liquidity into financial markets. The S&P 500 has risen 25% so far in 2013, which would be its best annual gain since 2003.
"
686,HON,"On the bright side, jobs and other recent data suggest the economy may be gaining momentum. Meanwhile, Congress' budget deal means less fiscal drag and uncertainty.
"
687,HON,"But those factors may spur the Fed to begin tapering bond buys — perhaps as soon as Wednesday — acting as a monetary head wind going forward.
"
688,HON,"Emerging markets remain sluggish while Europe is growing at a glacial pace after its longest recession since World War II.
"
689,HON,"Corporate executives, looking to bolster their EPS while operating under the philosophy that a company's main objective is to increase shareholder value, have responded accordingly.
"
690,HON,"Dividends also are expected to set a record in 2014. Gregory Harrison, an analyst at Thomson Reuters, urged not to read too much into the the dollar figures of recent share buybacks given the current bull market.
"

756,HON,"The process of refining oil, natural gas, petrochemicals and other fuels is a complex one that involves dozens of steps and variables, and can lead to disaster if you don't do it the right way.
"
757,HON,"To streamline the process and reduce the risk of error, refineries depend on software programs that let them do everything from simulating the refining process to designing the facility itself.
"
758,HON,"One company that provides this kind of software, Aspen Technology (AZPN), has seen a big turnaround in its financial fortunes thanks to efforts to streamline its own process of doing business.
"
759,HON,"Aspen makes business management software for oil, gas, energy and chemical companies. Its Aspen One suite is used in engineering, manufacturing and supply chain processes. The software lets clients model and design facilities, monitor and optimize performances, estimate costs and analyze data.
"
760,HON,"Pivoting For Pricing
"
761,HON,"Refineries can also use the technology to determine what kinds of fuels they should produce to take advantage of price trends.

762,HON,"""If aviation fuel is selling high, you might try to produce more jet fuel than octane fuel,"" said Mark Schappel, an analyst at Benchmark. ""Their software can tell you that you should get this much octane out, this much kerosene out, this much petroleum jelly out. It allows you to simulate what happens in a plant offline. You can do it on the computer first, which helps minimize mistakes.""
"
763,HON,"Because Aspen's technology is so specialized, much of its competition comes from smaller, privately held software firms.
"
764,HON,"Aspen also vies with much larger automated control companies such as Honeywell International (HON), Rockwell Automation (ROK) and Invensys, though Schappel says the software at these companies ""is not considered best in class.""
"
765,HON,"Aspen's technology is considered among the best in the business, analysts say. But that hasn't always been enough to offset problems in other areas of the business.
"
766,HON,"In 2008, Aspen shifted from an upfront license model to a subscription model as a way of smoothing out its revenue stream and giving it more visibility on future business.
"
767,HON,"While that change was being implemented, however, the company struggled on the bottom line. It lost money for three straight years, from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2012.
"
768,HON,"The earnings picture has been much brighter in recent quarters. Aspen returned to profitability in fiscal 2013, which ended in June. It has now produced five straight quarters of black ink.
"
769,HON,"""For several years, restructuring occupied the company,"" Schappel said. ""With that mostly out of the way, they can now act like a real software company and focus on R&D. They are also talking to the sales force instead of sitting in front of attorneys or accountants.""
"
770,HON,"The renewed focus was evident during the company's fiscal first quarter of 2014, which ended in September. Q1 earnings more than doubled from a year earlier to 19 cents a share, topping consensus estimates for 15 cents. The bottom line got a big boost from a much better-than-expected operating margin.

776,HON,"Analysts expect Aspen to grow full-year earnings 53% this fiscal year and 26% in fiscal 2015. The company's stock price set a nearly 13-year high of 39.02 on Oct. 30.
"
777,HON,"Aspen's revenue is fairly evenly split among the U.S., Europe and the rest of the world. Like any company whose fortunes are tied to the oil/gas industry, Aspen must deal with the ups and downs of commodity prices. The prices of both crude oil and natural gas have fallen in recent months from multiyear highs earlier in the year.

785,HON,"EL AL Israel Airlines recently announced that it has launched a fast, reliable commercial in-flight Wi-Fi service, powered by Viasat Inc. , in its aircraft fleet. The high-capacity Ka-band inflight connectivity service will enable non-stop business communication and high speed in-flight connectivity experience for fliers. To date, EL AL has equipped 15 of its aircraft with Viasat's latest equipment, which offers high-speed connectivity to EL AL's Boeing 787 Dreamliners, Boeing 737-900 aircraft and Boeing 737-800 planes.Viasat's high-speed Ka-band inflight connectivity service will enable EL AL passengers to stream more internet content and allow flight crews to remain connected for enhanced passenger service. Notably, while flying on TransAtlantic routes, the company’s in-flight Wi-Fi system will connect to the ViaSat-2 satellite that has the highest Ka-band capacity over the Atlantic Ocean. This will provide passengers a high performing in-flight connectivity from across North America and the Atlantic Ocean to Europe. Notably, EL AL has decided to offer three internet service packages to passengers — “Basic”, “Social” and “Business”.Existing Business ScenarioViasat has been serving the business aviation industry for a decade. With the surging popularity of high-engagement in-flight connectivity and high passenger engagement, leading airline companies are scouting for new ways to utilize Viasat’s high capacity satellite solutions to maximize passenger satisfaction. The company’s impressive bandwidth productivity sets it apart from conventional and lower-yield satellites providers that run on incumbent business models. Also, as the company has a competitive advantage in bandwidth economics, global coverage, flexibility and bandwidth allocation, it believes that mobile broadband will act as a profit churner.Recently, Viasat extended its partnership with Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) to offer high-speed Ka-band in-flight service to large and mid-cabin business jet passengers. The deal enables fliers to experience business and entertainment even at 40,000 feet above the ground. The company is seeking opportunities to extend broadband satellite mobility to rotary wing aircraft, as it is a large addressable market that can emerge as a key profit churner.In the past three months, Viasat has outperformed the industry, recording a gain of 10.4% compared with 6.1% growth for the latter.Further, of late, the company has been ramping up investments in the development of its revolutionary ViaSat-3 broadband communications platform, which will boast roughly 10 times the bandwidth capacity of ViaSat-2. Solid market traction of ViaSat-1 satellites, coupled with strategically planned ViaSat-2 and ViaSat 3 satellites, are expected to provide Viasat with a solid competitive edge over its peers, thereby bolstering growth in the long run.Key PicksA couple of top-ranked stocks from the same space are Comtech Telecommunications Corp.

789,HON,"At present, the U.S. equity market is jittery over the possible outcome of the U.S-China trade war. The turmoil had begun when the world’s largest economy imposed import tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium. Now, with many other goods/items included in the tariff bracket, affected foreign nations like Mexico, Canada, China and European Union are considering undertaking similar retaliatory measures.The import tariff imposition, though aims at protecting the interest of U.S. domestic industries, have side effects. For instance, the tariff on import of steel and aluminium has resulted in many industries facing higher raw material costs and shrinking corporate margins. However, the move has been beneficial for the U.S. steel makers. Likewise, though any restriction on China’s investment in the U.S. telecom sector will benefit the U.S. telecom equipment manufacturers, it will hurt those that rely on Chinese imports.Amid all the trade tensions, we believe that the U.S. economy still holds strong growth potential and some of its policy changes in the recent past have been wholeheartedly welcomed by the market. The most impressive was the implementation of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act in December 2017. This measure has helped in improving liquidity of the corporates, enabling them to make additional investment in growth projects.On a broader aspect, accelerating growth of the global economy — from 3.2% in 2016 to 3.8% in 2017 and 3.9% projected for 2018 by the International Monetary Fund — will help in propelling the economy. This premier institution expects the economy to advance 2.9% in 2018, reflecting hike of 0.2% from its earlier forecasts.Currently, the equity market offers many investment-friendly options. However, choosing the right sector and companies might be a daunting task.At this juncture, our classifications of the country’s stocks under 16 broad sectors and ranking of each of these can be of help. Each sector’s rank is calculated on the basis of the average of Zacks Rank of all the companies within it. The Zacks Sector Rank of 1 is placed at the top, with the first eight sectors placed in the top half and the other eight in the bottom half. Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Sector Rank)Investors interested in gaining exposure in the U.S. equity universe can focus on stocks that belong to the top-ranked Zacks Conglomerates sector.Top-Ranked Conglomerates SectorConglomerates currently occupy the first position in the Zacks sectors list.

Also, strengthening industrial production of the country — evident from 2.8% year-over-year growth registered in January 2018 to 3.5% growth in May 2018 — and an improving housing market help in building favorable operating conditions. Furthermore, year-over-year growth of 7% in shipments and 9.9% in orders of U.S.-manufactured durable goods for the five-months ended May 2018 boost prospects of the conglomerates.4 Suitable Investment Picks in the SectorUsing Zacks Stock Screener, we have zeroed in on four lucrative investment options from the Conglomerates sector that stand tall despite all the near-term uncertainties.Hitachi Ltd.

790,HON,"Carlisle Companies Incorporated (CSL  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent earnings streak, with the bottom line surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimates in the trailing four quarters. We expect the company to continue with this momentum backed by healthy prospect in U.S. commercial construction market andimproving Interconnect Technologies business.Additionally, the company’s diversified product portfolio, diligent restructuring plans and geographical diversity are expected to boost its growth. Carlisle is already witnessing broad-based growth across its segments. In the past six months, shares of Carlisle have outperformed the industry, reflecting investor optimism surrounding the stock. The company has gained 2.8% against the industry’s1.6% decline. Carlisle also enjoys a strong foothold across markets and has several growth drivers.Considering this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the key factors aiding the stock at the moment.Factors to Consider  Carlisle’s diversified business structure enables it to tap opportunities and neutralize operating risks associated with a single market. Of late, one of the company’s major segments — Carlisle Construction Materials (CCM) — has performed exceedingly well. For instance, in the first quarter of 2018, the segment delivered impressive numbers owing to mid-single-digit organic growth led by Accella, Arbo, and Drexel Metals buyouts. Meanwhile, solid recovery of the Carlisle Interconnect Technologies segment through strong SatCom and Aerospace markets has set the tone for solid growth in the future.Moreover, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s global footprint and the ability to penetrate in different markets are commendable. Under the Carlisle’s Vision 2025 program, the company seeks to achieve above-market organic growth, pursue synergistic acquisitions, and further leverage its Carlisle Operating System culture to drive efficiencies through business processes besides continuing to return cash to shareholders. Additionally, Carlisle’s strong liquidity position allows it to pursue acquisitions to augment organic growth. In first-quarter 2018, the company repurchased approximately $129 million of its shares. Generally, such diligent capital deployment strategies boost shareholders’ wealth.However, Carlisle is susceptible to raw material and freight cost inflation, which in turn, may affect its profitability and margin. For instance, in first-quarter 2018, operating income in the CCM segment declined on a year-over-year basis due to challenging raw material and freight cost environment. Furthermore, the company’s selling and administrative expenses increased 18.9% year over year. Also, the company’s high research and development costs might be a drag on its margin, which in turn, should affect its profitability.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Honeywell International Inc.

791,HON,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) yesterday communicated plans to restructure its business portfolio, in a bid to become a high-tech industrial company — focused on Aviation, Power and Renewable Energy. The news lifted market sentiment toward the stock, which rallied 7.8%, ending the trading session at $13.74.As part of the plan, General Electric has decided to separate GE Healthcare and turn it into a stand-alone company. GE Healthcare — which provides medical imaging and information technologies, patient monitoring systems, and biopharmaceutical manufacturing technologies — has generated roughly $19 billion revenues in 2017 while recorded an impressive 9% growth in segmental profit.The company plans to sell 20% interest in GE Healthcare while intends on distributing 80% stake to shareholders in a tax-free manner.

This Texas-based oilfield service provider was formed in last July when General Electric merged its oil and gas services, and equipment business with the acquired assets of Baker Hughes Inc. The stake disposition, to be carried out in the next two to three years, is going to mark the exit of the company from oil and gas businesses.As a reminder, in May 2018, General Electric signed an agreement to combine GE Transportation with Wabtec Corporation. In lieu of its transportation business, the company will receive $2.9 billion in cash at the time of the closing of the transaction (anticipated in early 2019) while its shareholders will gain 50.1% ownership interest in the combined company.Also, General Electric reiterated its intention of shrinking GE Capital business, aiming $25-billion sales in finance assets (energy and industrial) by 2020 and assuming capital contribution of $3 billion in 2019. Moreover, it is working on lowering its exposure to the insurance business.With all these restructuring initiatives, along with other deals like the divestment of Distributed Power business to Advent International a couple of days ago and the disposition of Value-Based Care business by GE Healthcare to Veritas Capital in April this year, the company seems to have achieved its $20-billion assets-divestment target.Benefits From Restructuring ActionsAll of the above-mentioned restructuring moves will make General Electric a more focused player in the aviation, power and renewable energy industry. Its technological expertise, as well as solid product offerings and innovation-investments, will strengthen its businesses.The company anticipates realizing corporate savings of more than $500 million by 2020, resulting from the implementation of the new GE Operating System. It intends to maintain its quarterly dividend until the completion of GE Healthcare separation while it might consider some revision post the completion.Moreover, for its Industrial business, the company intends on reducing debt by $25 billion by 2020, net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 2.5, long-term credit rating of ‘A’ and cash balance of $15 billion.General Electric currently has a market capitalization of $119.4 billion.

794,HON,"Investors looking for stocks in the Diversified Operations sector might want to consider either Crane (CR  -  Free Report) or Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Both Crane and Honeywell have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.38, while HON has a forward P/E of 17.95.

HON currently has a PEG ratio of 1.93.Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P/B ratio of 3.33. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, HON has a P/B of 6.05.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CR's Value grade of B and HON's Value grade of C.Both CR and HON are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CR is the superior value option right now.

795,HON,"Through its Honeywell Connected Aircraft Report released yesterday, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) indicated a high probability of huge investments being made by airlines in the commercial aviation industry on connected technologies in the years ahead. This anticipation is primarily based on the rising need for high-speed Wi-Fi connectivity within the aircraft.Connected technologies help enhancing passengers’ experience by maximising easy flow of data from and to the aircraft as well as on-time arrival and heightened security assurances. It is also beneficial for operators and pilots in terms of landing and navigation, tracking fuel usage of the fleet, providing weather information and many such more facilities.Maintenance is a common concern for airlines as unfortunate issues can jeopardize take-off and landing timings. It can cost airlines a lot and also adds to flyer-dissatisfaction. These issues can be largely addressed via predictive maintenance, made possible with the applications of connected technologies. In addition, a check on fuel consumption as well as aircraft turnaround time is possible with the aid of connected technologies.Per the Honeywell Connected Aircraft Report — result of a survey of 106 aviation professionals — nearly 95% of the respondents is ready to pump resources into connected aircraft within five years. Talking of investments, nearly 50% of professionals is ready to spend up to $1 million (preferably $100,000-$500,000) to equip one aircraft with connected technologies by next year. Roughly 38% of respondents is prepared to spend at least $1 million per aircraft in the coming five years.This survey clearly points toward enhanced business opportunities for Honeywell.

798,HON,"Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with its recent growth momentum driven by its broad-based growth across its segments and solid market potential for its core technology. The company is also gaining traction from its Aerostar segment, which comprise stratospheric balloons, radar systems, and aerostats. Buoyed by the robust performance, Raven expects to beat prior-year quarter’s sales and adjusted operating income in fiscal 2019.Moreover, shares of Raven have outperformed its industry in the past six months, reflecting investor optimism surrounding the stock. While the company has gained 9.9%, the industry declined 9.2%. Raven also enjoys a strong foothold across markets and has several growth drivers working in its favour. Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the key factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company an attractive proposition for investors right now.Factors to Consider  For fiscal 2019, Raven expects to outpace sales and adjusted operating income figures registered in the prior year. In applied technology, the company is increasing market share through technological advancements. Through sustained funding of key R&D projects over the last few years, the company also introduced two significant products — Hawkeye nozzle control system and next-generation rate control system. Notably, these products are getting favorable customer feedback and generating strong demand, thus adding to the company’s strength.Moreover, Raven’s focus on launching products and technologies enables it to gain a competitive advantage over peers. Of late, the company’s new products are consistently gaining traction, particularly through original equipment manufacturer (OEM) channel. Also, it remains optimistic about the market opportunity for its core technology. This apart, Raven is evaluating strategic acquisitions and continues investing in additional manufacturing capacity, research and technology development activities that would augment core product lines.Meanwhile, the company’s Aerostar segment continues to grow across many of its platforms including stratospheric balloons, radar systems and aerostats.  Notably, over the past few quarters, the pipeline of business opportunities for the company’s Aerostar segment has improved significantly. For instance, in first-quarter fiscal 2019, sales at the segment recorded an increase of 13.5% year over year driven by growth across core product lines. The company continues to advance in building the market for its stratospheric technology as well.Furthermore, the company’s considerable advancements in balloon duration continue to support the progress on Google's Project Loon and NASA's mission are impressive.

799,HON,"Investors interested in stocks from the Diversified Operations sector have probably already heard of Crane (CR  -  Free Report) and Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks presents investors with the better value opportunity right now? Let's take a closer look.Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Currently, both Crane and Honeywell are holding a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy). The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that both of these companies have improving earnings outlooks. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.CR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.20, while HON has a forward P/E of 18.96. We also note that CR has a PEG ratio of 1.47. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. HON currently has a PEG ratio of 2.04.Another notable valuation metric for CR is its P/B ratio of 3.52. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, HON has a P/B of 6.39.These metrics, and several others, help CR earn a Value grade of B, while HON has been given a Value grade of D.Both CR and HON are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that CR is the superior value option right now.

800,HON,"The U.S. trade deficit, which has been the major reason for the ongoing tariff and trade war concerns, dropped for the second consecutive month in April. The deficit narrowed 2.1% to $46.2 billion from a revised $47.2 billion in March, marking the lowest level since September.However, the trade deficit is still up 11.5% so far this year from the year-ago level, and is on track to widen in 2018 to the highest level in a decade.Inside the Strong NumbersThe drop came on the heels of a 0.3% increase in exports to a record $211.2 billion, buoyed by higher shipments of industrial materials, soybeans and corn. Meanwhile, imports dipped 0.2% to $257.4 billion. Though trade deficit with Mexico narrowed 29.8% to $5.7 billion in April as exports to the country hit an all-time high, it widened with China by 8.1% to $28 billion. The United States had a $0.8 billion trade gap with Canada.In the first four months of 2018, exports to Mexico, Canada and the European Union have recorded double-digit growth, indicating that United States is expanding strongly in these markets. As a result, the data has bolstered the confidence in the robust economic growth given that the recent decline in deficit is expected to boost GDP in the second quarter.The rise in exports and shrinking trade gap will definitely benefit exporters, leading to a surge in mega-cap stocks. Tariffs: A Threat?Trump is going fierce with its anti-trade policies that could endanger the growth in exports seen so far in the year. He slapped tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from Canada, Mexico and the European Union last week after their temporary exemptions expired on Jun 1.The move also led to retaliation from these countries targeting American products worth billions of dollars. The European Union is seeking to hit back with $7.5 billion of levies on U.S. exports, including motorcycles, denim, cigarettes, cranberry juice and peanut butter, as early as Jun 20.  Mexico plans to retaliate by targeting a wide range of U.S. farm and industrial products and has said it would slap tariffs on imports from the United States, including whiskey, orange juice, steel, aluminum and other products.A trade war is also brewing with China as Washington and Beijing have threatened tit-for-tat tariffs on goods worth up to $150 billion each in order to reduce the United States' $375.2 billion trade deficit with China. Talks to avert a full trade war between the world’s two largest economies have so far failed to produce a fruitful deal though China has offered up to purchase nearly $70 billion worth of U.S. agriculture and energy products if the Trump administration steps back from tariffs.Why Mega Caps?Mega-cap stocks (with a market cap of $100 billion or more) belong to the largest and most recognizable brands in the world. They tend to be the most stable in an adverse economic scenario while at the same time offer capital appreciation in a booming market. Mega-cap stocks have a global footprint, strong cash positions and enjoy leading market positions with most of them offering huge dividends.These stocks are less volatile compared to small caps and thus are well protected in a market downturn. However, they might not experience exponential growth as small caps do in a rising stock market. 5 PicksGiven this, we have highlighted top-ranked mega-cap stocks that pose solid fundamentals and have the potential to move higher in the coming days. All these have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)This world's largest Zacks Rank #2 aerospace company is the leading manufacturer of commercial jetliners and defense, space and security systems.

Toyota Motor flaunts a top VGM Score of A and a market cap of $196.1 billion.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH  -  Free Report)This is Zacks Rank #2 diversified health care company in the United States. Though the stock saw no earnings estimate revision for this year over the past 30 days, it has an expected growth rate of 25.22%. It has a market cap of $234.9 billion and a VGM Score of A.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report)This Zacks Rank #2 software-industrial company delivers industry-specific solutions that include aerospace and automotive products and services; control technologies for buildings, homes, and industry; and performance materials globally. It also witnessed no earnings estimate revision for this year over the past 30 days and has an expected earnings growth rate of 12.80%. The stock has a market cap of $11.9 billion and a VGM Score of B.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge. With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research. It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

Notably, this 11th low rate initial production (LRIP) contract will deal with 135 engines, apart from covering areas like program management, production support, engineering support, spare modules as well as spare parts.Also, the contract is likely to reduce the unit recurring flyaway (URF) price for the 110 LRIP Lot 11 conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) and carrier variant (CV) propulsion systems by 0.34% from the earlier negotiated LRIP Lot 10 URF. Furthermore, the URF price for the 25 LRIP Lot 11 short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) propulsion systems is expected to be reduced by 3.39% compared with the earlier negotiated LRIP Lot 10 URF.Our TakeUnited Technologies has a strong aftermarket business.

807,HON,"United Technologies Corporation’s (UTX  -  Free Report) operating segment — Climate, Controls & Security — recently entered into a definitive agreement with The Middleby Corporation (MIDD  -  Free Report). Per the deal, this segment will sell Taylor Company to Middleby — a manufacturer of commercial foodservice equipment. This $1 billion deal is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2018.Our TakeUnited Technologies serves various end-markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction. This business mix and diversification allows the company to generate profit even during tough economic times by delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. Also, the company’s continuous investment in innovative products, through higher engineering expenditures, secures orders that might drive the top line in future.In the past six months, shares of United Technologies have gained 7.2% against the industry’s decline of 6.2%.  Moreover, the company’s strong aftermarket services business remains relatively stable compared to new product delivery. This, in turn, helps United Technologies to offset the impact of downturns in the new products market. For instance, in first-quarter 2018, its aftermarket business witnessed robust sales across the segments with commercial and military up 18% and 13%, respectively.Meanwhile, the company also revamped its aerospace unit, including an overhaul of its organizational structure. Per United Technologies, its streamlined organizational set-up might enable the company to better serve its customers.However, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets, to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. Therefore, any disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities may adversely impact United Technologies’ ability to meet delivery schedules and increase operating costs.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report). Both these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

809,HON,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) Power Services business revealed new capabilities which will augment the performance and reliability of other original equipment manufacturer (OEM) gas turbine fleets. The conglomerate also disclosed that it had secured more than $200 million in backlog for gas turbine cross-fleet orders.GE’s advanced capabilities and technology will provide gas plant operators greater flexibility, reliability and efficiency. It will also ensure longer maintenance intervals and superior overall performance. The gas turbine cross-fleet capabilities also include remote monitoring capabilities to boost reliability as well as availability and reduce operational risks and maintenance costs.These latest technological developments benefit from the company’s extensive experience as well as the extensive steam turbine, generator and HRSG other-OEM capabilities and expertise acquired from Alstom’s power business in November 2015.GE Power is the largest segment of the conglomerate in terms of corporate revenues. However, the unit has been a drag on earnings in the last few quarters, thanks to increasing global demand for renewable energy sources. Also, overcapacity, lower utilization and fewer outages are other factors that are dampening demand. Per Industry experts, the acquisition of Alstom’s assets further compounded the problems for General Electric, as it hiked operating costs and contracted margins.Nevertheless, in 2017, Flannery assured investors that energy, aviation and healthcare will continue to be the focal points of GE’s operations. It has been nearly five months since Flannery outlined his plan to divest more than $20 billion of assets.In April, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion. The deal marks one of the first notable portfolio-related moves since Flannery announced the plan to exit at least $20 billion of businesses.The overhaul, coupled with cost cuts and cultural changes, encompass Flannery’s attempts to pull GE out of one of the deepest slumps in the company’s 126-year history. The company’s shares have lost 15.2% in the past six months, wider than the industry’s decline of 5.2%.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Electric carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks from the same space include Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

810,HON,"General Electric Company’s (GE  -  Free Report) Power Services business recently entered into an agreement with Saudi Cement to upgrade the latter’s three GE 6B gas turbines at Hofuf plant, based in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Per the deal, GE Power will upgrade these turbines by installing its Advanced Gas Path (AGP) solution, which would enable Saudi Cement to boost power output and efficiency.Notably, this deal marks the first installation of GE Power’s AGPtechnology solutionto boost power generation productivity in a cement industry globally. Currently, it will enable Saudi Cement to boost power output by a total of up to 16.9% across the three turbines.This apart, General Electricalso secured a $52 million contract from Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. Per the deal, General Electricwill install its AGP technology solution on three GE 9E gas turbines at the Jebel Ali Power & Desalination Station. It clinched another service agreement from Ohgishma Power Co. Ltd. to upgrade three GE 9F gas turbines with AGP, DLN2.6+ and OpFlex technologies at the Ohgishima Power Station, based in Kanagawa.Our TakeGeneral Electric is poised for long-term growth backed by improved performances from the emerging markets like India and China. In order to focus more on its core business activities, the company has exited from the financial business and has increased its investments in key industrial businesses through restructuring, state-of-the-art technology, and R&D initiatives. Notably, General Electric’s three core segments — power, aviation and healthcare equipment — require advanced hi-tech products with a high degree of reliability. These products often generate higher margins and are likely to contribute to improved long-term growth.With the company boasting a strong international presence, significant portion of the company’s total revenues are generated from emerging markets. In fact, General Electric has been selling big-ticket items such as locomotives and power turbines to India and China. Moving ahead, it expects to benefit from these regions, given their faster economic growth.In the past three months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 2.3%, outperforming the industry’s decline of 4.8%.Furthermore, General Electric’s solid free cash flow allows it to invest in product innovations, acquisitions and business development. This, in turn, offers the company a competitive advantage over its peers. Its stringent cost-cutting measures are also likely to improve profitability, going forward.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the same space include Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Quanta Services, Inc. (PWR  -  Free Report). All these companies carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

The company’s stronger pipeline vouches for its solid sales in 2019.However, with the forecast for lower agricultural equipment sales volume through the rest of the year, Raven believes that the U.S. agricultural market may remain challenging.

There have been earnings improvement of 38.4% and revenue growth of 14% year over year, per the Earnings Trends issued on May 2, 2018.Against this backdrop, we take a look at some big industrial earnings releases within the last 15 days and see if these can leave an impact on ETFs exposed to the space.Inside Q1 EarningsOn Apr 26, Union Pacific Corporation’s (UNP  -  Free Report) first-quarter 2018 earnings of $1.68 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.65 per share. The bottom line expanded 27.3% on a year-over-year basis. Results were aided by higher revenues. Operating revenues of $5,475 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,370.8 million. Moreover, revenues increased 6.7% year over year. Higher freight revenues boosted the top line.On Apr 24, Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), the world’s leading manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, industrial gas turbines and diesel-electric locomotives, reported first-quarter 2018 results, wherein adjusted earnings of $2.82 surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.11 by a margin of 34%.Caterpillar posted revenues of $12.9 billion, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.6 billion. However, post earnings, stocks got beaten down as management noted that the company is less likely to match the blockbuster performance of Q1 during any of the next three this year.On Apr 24, 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report) reported solid first-quarter 2018 results, with impressive year-over-year improvement in adjusted earnings and revenues. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $2.50, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.

Total consolidated revenues for the reported quarter rose 7% year over year to $28,660 million and trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $27,884 million.In the current scenario, we believe it is prudent to discuss the following ETFs that have relatively high exposure to the industrial companies discussed (see all Industrial ETFs here).ETFs in Focus Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This $12 billion-fund focuses on providing exposure to the U.S. industrial sector. The above-mentioned companies take about 24% of the fund.

An increase in demand for the company’s products by the commercial aviation industry and an increase in spending by the U.S. defense industry have augmented revenues for the company. The strong aftermarket business, which sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running, drove results. United Technologies Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  United Technologies Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | United Technologies Corporation Quote Segmental DetailsNet sales of Otis were $3,037 million, up 8.3% compared with $2,804 million in the prior-year quarter and showing an organic growth of 1% for the quarter.Aggregate quarterly revenues from UTC Climate, Controls & Security came in at $4,376 million, up 12.4% compared with $3,892 million in the year-ago quarter, with an organic growth of 7%.Pratt & Whitney revenues were $4,329 million, up 15.2% from $3,758 million in the year-ago quarter, with an organic growth of 9%.UTC Aerospace Systems sales came in at $3,817 million, up 5.7% from $3,611 million in the year-earlier quarter, showing an organic growth of 6% for the quarter.Operating Profits & MarginsOperating profit was $1,982 million compared with $2,144 million in the year-ago quarter, owing to steep rise in operating expenses despite significant top-line growth.

Backed by these positives, the company raised its full-year 2018 earnings and sales guidance. The company now expects adjusted earnings between $6.95 and $7.15, up from the previous range of $6.85-$7.10. Additionally, the company raised revenue guidance for 2018 from earlier range of $62.5-$64 billion to a band of $63-$64.5 billion.United Technologies’ acquisition of Rockwell Collins, an Iowa-based avionics firm has contributed to the bullish outlook. The acquisition, slated to be completed by the third quarter of 2018, will provide a huge competitive advantage for the company and increase its bargaining power. The resultant operating synergies and lower operating costs will help it create complementary products that will help it serve evolving global customer needs.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderUnited Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the same space include Crane Company (CR  -  Free Report), Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) and Honeywell International Inc.

814,HON,"The materials sector is attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Industrial Metals have been rebounding on greater global optimism. This is primarily due to robust global growth cues and strong demand.However, the relation between the United States and its trade partners is not so sweet right now, with fears of a potential trade war looming large. “We’ll be imposing tariffs on steel imports, and tariffs on aluminum imports. And you’re going to see a lot of good things happen,” Trump said. Trump’s America First agenda has sparked fears of a trade war, as he told steel and aluminum industry executives in a meeting about his intention to implement a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports.Trump's tariff plan ""is bad policy at a bad time and will only add to the risk of a trade war,"" per a New York Times article citing Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital.Into the HeadlinesTrump said the tariffs will be introduced as early as next week. However, it is not yet clear if any specific product or country will be excluded from the arrangement. American stocks for companies that use the metals took a beating as a result of this announcement.The U.S. measures “overturn the international trade order,” per a Bloomberg article citing Wen Xianjun, vice chairman of the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association. “Other countries, including China, will take relevant retaliatory measures,” Wen added.Japan voiced its concerns too. “Steel and aluminum imports from Japan, which is an ally, do not affect U.S. national security at all,” Japan’s Trade Minister Hiroshige Seko told reporters in Tokyo. “I would like to convey that to the U.S. when I have an opportunity,” Seko added.American companies have for long criticized Chinese practices, as they complain that Chinese companies dump their products at below-market prices, thanks to the state subsidy they receive. However, America can expect retaliatory measures from China, as the emerging market nation is the largest producer of steel and aluminum. Amongst the biggest concerns, China is evaluating trade of soybeans and other farm products with the United States, which might weigh on American famers and ultimately on Trump’s support among rural Americans and Republican strongholds.Adding to the agony, if the tariffs lead to an increase in raw material cost for manufacturers who use these metals, they might have to pass on a certain percentage of the rise to consumers. This in turn will add on to inflationary pressures, at a time when Wall Street is already worrying about the impact that rising inflation will have on the markets.The S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. Strong wage growth and jobs data introduced fears of inflation making a comeback and led investors to bet on aggressive rate hikes. Therefore, at an already shaky time for Wall Street, Trump’s tariffs do no good to alleviate investor concerns about the markets (read: 5 ETFs to Bet on Post Fed Minutes).Let us now discuss ETFs that are expected to be impacted because of this announcement.Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to materials’ stocks and tracks the Materials Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $5.1 billion and charges a moderate fee of 13 basis points a year.

It expects a stability in purchase-plan rates for civil helicopters in North America, Europe and Asia which is consistent with its 2017 survey.

816,HON,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 4.2% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is HON due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Honeywell Beats Q4 Earnings on Organic Growth, View UpHoneywell International reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings. GAAP loss for the reported quarter was $2,411 million or loss of $3.18 a share as against net income of $1,034 million or $1.34 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to a provisional charge of $3.8 billion to reflect the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.85 per share compared with $1.74 in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. For full year 2017, adjusted earnings were $7.11 per share compared with $6.46 in 2016.Operational DetailsFourth-quarter 2017 revenues inched up 8.6% year over year to $10,843 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,689 million. The top-line improvement was largely due to organic growth of 6%, driven by strength in Aerospace aftermarket, UOP, Advanced Materials, and Intelligrated. Total revenue for full year 2017 improved to $40,534 million from $39,302 million in 2016.Total segment profit for the quarter was $2,096 million compared with $1,899 million in the prior-year period, with respective segment profit margins of 19.3% and 19%. Operating income increased to $1,716 million from $1,613 million in the year-ago quarter for respective margins of 15.8% and 16.2%.Segment DetailsAerospace sales were $3,902 million in the reported quarter, up 6% year over year. Segment profit was up 21% to $893 million for margin improvement of 270 bps to 22.9%. Impressive growth was primarily driven by strength in the commercial aftermarket and U.S. defense, along with solid demand for light vehicle gas and commercial vehicle turbochargers in Transportation Systems.Home and Building Technologies sales came in at $2,615 million, up 5% year over year. Segment profit was up 3% to $461 million although margin contracted 40 bps to 17.6% due to lower security volumes. The upside in revenues was driven by continued demand in fire and building products in Europe and robust growth in China.Performance Materials and Technologies revenues were $2,854 million, up 12% year over year on healthy growth across all businesses. Segment profit was up 3% to $607 million although margin contracted 180 bps to 21.3% due to unplanned plant outage.Safety and Productivity Solutions’ top-line was $1,472 million, up 14% year over year. Segment profit was up 25% to $231 million for margin improvement of 140 bps to 15.7%. The segment’s sales improved on the back of double-digit organic sales growth at Intelligrated, higher volumes in industrial safety products, sensing controls, and voice-enabled workflow solutions.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowCash and cash equivalents at year-end 2017 were $7,059 million while long-term debt was $12,573 million compared with respective tallies of $7,843 million and $12,182 million in the year-ago period.Net cash provided from operating activities for 2017 was $5,966 million compared with $5,498 million in 2016. Honeywell exited fourth-quarter 2017 with free cash flow of $1,754 million compared with $1,696 million in the year-ago quarter.OutlookConcurrent with the earnings release, Honeywell revised full-year 2018 earnings guidance to better reflect the favorable impact from the tax reform. The company currently anticipates earnings within the range of $7.75−$8.00 per share for 2018, up from earlier expectations of $7.55−$7.80, representing year-over-year growth of 9-13%, up from 6-10% expected earlier. However, revenue guidance is affirmed at $41.8-$42.5 billion.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been three revisions higher for the current quarter, while looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been only two moves up in the last two months.Honeywell International Inc. Price and Consensus  Honeywell International Inc. Price and Consensus | Honeywell International Inc. Quote VGM ScoresAt this time, HON has a nice Growth Score of B, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with a C.

817,HON,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company’s Healthcare segment is likely to report higher revenues in the quarter owing to improved market dynamics.Whether this can buoy the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Impressive 3Q PerformanceIn third-quarter 2017, GE Healthcare’s revenues had jumped 5% year over year to $4,724 million with orders up 6% to $5.1 billion. On an organic basis, orders increased 4% in the domestic market, 8% in Europe and 11% in emerging markets driven by 20% growth in China. On a product basis, healthcare system orders grew 5% year over year, primarily led by higher demand for ultrasound and imaging products (up 11% and 8%, respectively) along with mammography and CT. Order for life sciences products were up 14%, driven by bioprocess (up 17%) and core imaging (up 9%).Operating profit was up 14% to $820 million, driven by volume and productivity gains partially offset by price and program investments. Operating margin expanded 140 basis points to 17.4%.Accounting for 14.1% of total revenues in third-quarter 2017, Healthcare forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare.  He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in the company’s shares. Incidentally, GE was the worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, tanking 44.8% in the year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Healthcare revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is currently pegged at $5,247 million compared with $5,101 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is expected to be $1,103 million, up from $1,030 million in the prior year.Overall 4Q ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,954 million compared with year-ago profit of approximately $5,842 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the Industrial segment are likely to record leaner profits on a year-over-year basis except Healthcare. Total Industrial segment’s revenues are likely to be marginally up to $31,570 million from $31,236 million in the year-earlier quarter, although total corporate revenues are expected to be down to $32,693 million from $33,088 million.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and $6.2 billion charges from the legacy insurance business. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 28 cents. (Read more: Will Lower Industrial Segment Profit Hurt GE's Q4 Earnings?)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a “reset year” and is seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Also, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management has decided to continue its thrust for the Healthcare segment, which remains one of the three core segments for the company.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their fourth-quarter earnings soon include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).  The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

821,HON,"The earnings season is picking up pace, with about 52 S&P 500 companies having reported results as on Apr 18. We believe that the strong momentum of the preceding earnings season has continued in this reporting cycle. Total earnings for these companies are up 27.9% year over year on 10.7% higher revenues, with 84.6% beating earnings estimates and 78.8% surpassing top-line expectations. Clearly, the first quarter of 2018 is projected to register better earnings growth and revenue momentum than what we have witnessed in the previous quarters.Per the latest Earnings Trends, overall earnings for all the S&P 500 are expected to be up 17.8% on 7.6% growth in revenues — the highest quarterly earnings growth pace in the last seven years. This represents an improved growth projection from the previous quarter driven by a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data. This in turn, boosted corporate earnings and stoked investments. Experts believe that earnings growth is likely to improve steadily in 2018 and beyond.In fact, we expect double-digit year-over-year earnings growth for 11 of the 16 Zacks sectors. Only two sectors (Autos & Conglomerates) are likely to register earnings declines.For the Conglomerates space, earnings are expected to fall 9.4% year over year while sales are touted to rise 2.6%, thanks to disappointing performance by one of the leading players in the industry. Ongoing tariff issues, which are likely to impact major U.S. industrials, are weighing on the companies.Let’s take a sneak peek at two major Conglomerate stocks scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 earnings tomorrow and see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter, due to higher operating costs and accounting charges. Flannery had earlier disclosed his plans to focus on just three core segments — power, aviation and health-care equipment — and gradually exit all other businesses to offset the downtrend. However, of late, he has hinted at the possibility of the company’s disintegration into separately traded businesses. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)In the first quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to fall 47.6% year over year on 0.8% higher revenues.

The company is expected to deliver 4.7% higher revenues in the impending quarterly results, owing to a favorable macroeconomic environment. Honeywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers backed by its strong market share and product line-up. Its balanced mix of long and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augurs well for the company. These factors bode well for the company’s upcoming performance.Our quantitative model hints an earnings beat for this Zacks Rank #3 company in first-quarter 2018.

825,HON,"Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) recently announced the availability of Aspire 400, its newest satellite communications system. Apart from offering critical cockpit safety services to pilots, the system provides passengers and aircraft flight crews with an access to global voice and data connectivity. Also, it ensures safer and more efficient flights for business jets, commercial and military aircraft by offering a simultaneous connectivity to both the cockpit and the cabin.Notably, the Aspire 400 satellite communication system is lightweight and takes into account the operator's choice of either a high-gain antenna or an intermediate-gain.

Moreover, it presents opportunity for the passengers to utilize the second channel for SwiftBroadband voice and data connectivity in the cabin.Our TakeHoneywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers backed by its strong market share and product line-up. The company also continues to invest in innovative technologies that are expected to help it maintain its leadership position. Also, as emerging markets expand the demand for the company’s, airplanes, automobiles and construction products is expected to grow.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has gained 20.7%, the industry declined 12.9%. Further, the company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions auger well on a long-term perspective.However, the company is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets despite its proactive restructuring initiatives. Moreover, in order to differentiate its products and prevent commoditization, Honeywell has to continually develop and maintain competitive products by adding innovative features. These, in turn, might lead to high R&D expenditures, often resulting in margin contraction.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report). While Federal Signal sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Danaher and Raven Industries carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

826,HON,"U.S. economy has been on a rally since Donald Trump’s election victory. Trump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, increasing optimism among investors around a faster pace in economic growth and on the prospective passing of other policies of the President.However, with better-than-expected job growth, investors are betting on faster rate rises and inflation, causing havoc in the markets. In such a situation, investors generally flock to traditional defensive investments. However, these investments failed to protect investors in the most recent downturn.Market CorrectionPer data released by the Labor Department, wages grew 2.9% year over year in January compared with 2.6% in the prior month, the highest pace since April 2009. This introduced fears among investors of rising rates and inflation making a comeback.Moving on to interest rates, the Fed is widely expected to hike interest rates multiple times this year to tame inflation. Given this, markets are betting on the Fed to hike rates more than three times suggested earlier. Per the CME Fed Watch tool, there is a 71.9% chance of a 25 basis point rate hike in March (read: 6 Ways to Build a Rate-Proof Portfolio With ETFs). As a result, the S&P 500 entered correction territory, as it declined more than 10% from the record high set in January. This spooked investors and weighed on their risk appetite, which in turn made investors reallocate their portfolios.Defensive Funds in DetailLow-volatility ETFs are the go-to investment vehicles during times of high market uncertainty. These investments fared well in 2017, as high political uncertainty and geopolitical risks brought low volatility plays in favor.Low-volatility ETFs generally include utilities and staples stocks, and try to expose investors to high dividend yields. These funds invest in stocks that are viewed as “bond like” by investors for their steady business. Although this strategy is known to protect investors during uncertain times, the reason it did not work out in the recent selloff is that rising rate expectations were behind it. For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) has lost 5.8% so far in February.High dividend funds are known to be negatively correlated to rising rates. It is a good play to combat market uncertainty. However, with bond yields at record highs and the 10-year yield touching 2.81%, the appeal of bond-like equities declined. For instance, WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report) has lost 6.3% so far in February.As a result, it is no surprise that defensive funds failed to be in positive territory during the sell-off caused by fears over rising rates. As the Fed keeps on raising rates, these so called defensive investments might not be able to protect investors from the wrath of the correction. For instance, Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report) has lost 4.7% so far in February while Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund has lost 5.6% in the period.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the discussed sectors.PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF targeting large-cap U.S. companies with low volatility.It has AUM of $7.1 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Utilities and Industrials with 20.9%, 19.7% and 19.2% allocation, respectively. The fund’s top three holdings are Honeywell International Inc (HON  -  Free Report), Berkshire Hathaway BRKB and Coca-Cola Co (KO  -  Free Report) with 1.3% allocation each. The fund has returned 11.2% in a year but has lost 3.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold), with a Medium risk outlook.WisdomTree U.S. Quality Dividend Growth Fund (DGRW  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to large, established U.S. companies providing high dividends by applying quality screens. It has AUM of $2.0 billion and charges a fee of 28 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Information Technology, Industrials and Health Care with 20.2%, 18.7% and 17.5% allocation, respectively.The fund’s top three holdings are Exxon Mobil XOM, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) with 5.0%, 4.6% and 4.1% allocation, respectively. The fund has returned 22.0% in a year but has lost 1.3% year to date. It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3, with a Medium risk outlook.Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to staples stocks and has AUM of $8.0 billion and charges a low fee of 13 basis points a year.The fund’s top three holdings are Procter & Gamble PG, Coca-Cola Co and PepsiCo Inc (PEP  -  Free Report) with 11.6%, 9.5% and 8.9% allocation, respectively.  The fund has returned 3.9% in a year but has lost 4.6% year to date. XLP has a Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell), with a Medium risk outlook.Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU  -  Free Report)XLU is one of the most popular funds in the utility space. The fund has AUM of $7.3 billion and is a relatively cheaper bet as it charges a fee of 13 basis points a year.

828,HON,"Technology and manufacturing giant, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report), is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. For the quarter, the company anticipates solid revenues from its Aerospace Business, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues.Last quarter, Honeywell reported earnings of $1.85 per share, delivering a beat of 0.5%. In the trailing four quarters, the company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 1.3%.We expect Honeywell to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Honeywell has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Honeywell has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.90 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.89. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors Behind Better-Than-Expected ResultsHoneywell remains well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers backed by its strong market share and product line-up. The company also intends to expand its presence in high-growth regions, with a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity. Furthermore, Honeywell’s balanced mix of long and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augurs well for the company. Also, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products. Honeywell has regularly fine-tuned its portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring another 90 companies, thus contributing $14 billion to revenues over the same time frame. These factors bode well for the company’s upcoming performance and are likely to offset some of the risks it faces.Moreover, the company’s strategic and operational initiatives to improve its business have provided a boost to financials over the past few quarters. For instance, the merger between the Transportation Systems and the Aerospace segments has enabled it to leverage on the shared business models as well as the engineering and technology similarities.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues from the Aerospace segment currently remains high at $3,697 million, reflecting growth of 4.3% year over year. Revenues from the Performance Materials and the Technologies segments are also anticipated to be strong, with the consensus estimate projected at $2,516 million compared with $2,069 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the company’s focus on investing in innovative technologies should help in maintaining its leadership position.However, Honeywell is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. Also, in order to differentiate its products and prevent commoditization, the company has to continue developing and maintaining competitive products by adding innovative features. These, in turn, might increase R&D outlay, resulting in margin contraction.Key PicksHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.45% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.American Financial Group, Inc.

829,HON,"We should have known something big was coming when General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) slashed its dividend in half last November, and now, it looks like the industrial and infrastructure giant is mulling a restructuring move that would break up the company.The speculation began when GE announced that it will be taking an after-tax GAAP charge of $6.2 billion to its fourth quarter earnings—at the new 21% tax rate, the charge will be $7.5 billion—a significant hit that is linked to weakness in the company’s North American Life & Health insurance portfolio.This is a shining example of the difficulties GE and other long-term care insurers and re-insurers have faced over the years. Because of the rise in healthcare costs, and the simple fact that people are living longer, many insurers are struggling to “make good on policies dating back to the 1990s,” notes Reuters.GE also said that over the next seven years, it’s financing segment GE Capital would make $15 billion statutory reserve payment contributions to the long-term care insurance assets. But in order to fund this, the company will be suspending GE Capital’s dividend for the “foreseeable future.”In a conference call with analysts, CEO John Flannery said that “We are looking aggressively at the best structure or structures for our portfolio to maximize the potential of our businesses,” and a review “could result in many, many different permutations, including separately traded assets really in any one of our units, if that’s what made sense.”“Needless to say, at a time when we are moving forward as a company, I am deeply disappointed at the magnitude of the charge,” Flannery said on the call. “It’s especially frustrating to have this type of development when we’ve been making progress on many of our key objectives.”Not only is Flannery seemingly implying that a breakup for GE is on the horizon, but sources told CNBC’s David Faber that a split is “likely,” and could come as soon as this spring.Shares of GE closed the day down almost 3% to $18.21 per share.A Fading IconWhen Flannery took over from previous CEO Jeffrey Immelt last August, he had big plans for GE. He made a promise to consider all options for the company, and emphasized a business strategy that would concentrate on jet engines, health-care machines, and power-generation equipment.Fast forward to November, and you could see those plans beginning to come into focus, though some cost cutting and other major business decisions had to happen first. Besides its dividend cut, GE is planning over $2 billion in cuts this year, along with $20 billion in divestments over the next year or two.This could include the potential sale of oil and gas company Baker Hughes (BHGE  -  Free Report); GE just bought a majority stake in BHGE last year, and the consolidation of each respective company’s oil and gas businesses is going smoothly. GE previously sold its real estate portfolio, its water business, its unit that makes electrical equipment for utilities, its dishwasher and appliance business, and sold its media properties NBC and Universal Studios to Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report).Additionally, the company said that there will be “ongoing actions” to shrink GE Capital’s business over the next two years, continuing a plan set in motion back in 2015 to sell the majority of its finance division’s operations.Too Little Too Late?While its insurance arm has certainly been struggling, it’s just another problem in a long list of problems for GE.The company was the worst performer on the Dow in 2017, with shares losing almost 40% in value. Margins have been on the decline since 2014, and the company’s free cash flow has grown less and less consistent, especially after it decided to sell its very lucrative lending business.Chart via: ZacksSince its founding in 1892, GE grew into a business icon, creating a portfolio along the way that spanned everything from energy and infrastructure to finance and media. The company was once looked to as a reliable symbol of American success, and during the ‘80s and ‘90s, its management practices gained a huge following under then-CEO Jack Welch.Under Jeffrey Immelt, GE began to shrink, with a goal of focusing on businesses it could win in and getting rid of the ones that were distractions. But compared to other multinational rivals like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), GE’s continued underperformance became even more glaring.What’s next for the company? If a breakup is on the docket, GE and its management must make sure that each of its core businesses are performing at the levels where they need to be, and that may be a tough thing to accomplish.But even if GE decides to split up, what’s the guarantee that the move will help the company bounce back? Flannery’s narrowed vision certainly has potential, and a fresh leader at the head of the table is never a bad thing for an older institution like GE. However, with a weakening brand name and strong growth competitors, a breakup may not be the easiest fix for GE after all.GE reports its fourth-quarter earnings on January 24.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation. See Them Free>>

830,HON,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. The company’s Aviation segment is likely to report lower profit in the quarter, thanks to challenging market conditions.Modest Q4 PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2017, GE Aviation revenues were flat year over year at $7,222 million, as Equipment revenues (which declined 6% on fewer legacy engine shipments) offset higher LEAP engine shipments. Services revenues improved 6% on higher commercial spares and military.Orders rose 11% to $8 billion, driven by Equipment and Services. Equipment orders rose 2% year over year, while service orders grew 17% (driven by higher commercial spares business).Operating profit of $1,786 million was up 2% primarily driven by favorable volume and mix, cost productivity and value gap, partially offset by margin pressure from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margin expanded 40 basis points (bps) to 24.7%.Accounting for 23% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, Aviation forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in its shares.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aviation revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 was pegged at $7,091 million compared with $6,804 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment was expected at $1,352 million, down from $1,684 million in the prior-year quarter. The downside was caused by pressure from higher LEAP shipments.Overall Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for theIndustrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,660 million, reflecting a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3,622 million. Total revenues for the industrial segment are likely to decline to $26,425 million sequentially, from $32,214 million in fourth-quarter 2017.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter, thanks to higher operating costs. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 11 cents. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a ‘reset year’ and is contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management decided to continue with its inclination for the Aviation segment, which is one of the three core segments.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their first-quarter 2018 earnings include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

831,HON,"The earnings season is well past the halfway mark with about 294 S&P 500 companies having reported results till Feb 7, 2018. Various analysis and comparisons are being done by industry peers to gauge the underlying metrics and relative performance. Let us perform a similar analysis of two leading players in the Conglomerates sector to pick the best investment option based on the fourth-quarter earnings scorecard.Fourth-Quarter EarningsUnited Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) reported healthy results driven by significant organic growth and diligent execution of operational plans. GAAP earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were $397 million or 50 cents per share compared with $1,013 million or $1.25 per share in the year-earlier quarter. Excluding restructuring and other non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the reported quarter were $1.60 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.56.Net sales came in at $15,680 million compared with $14,659 million in the year-ago quarter. Quarterly sales exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,400 million. The top-line increase was primarily attributable to organic growth of 5% — the highest since 2014. Growth in revenues across all segments of the company helped drive total revenues. An increase in demand for the company’s products by the commercial aviation industry and an increase in spending by the U.S. defense industry have helped augment revenues for the company. The strong aftermarket business, which sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running, has also benefited results. United Technologies carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) reported solid results with healthy year-over-year increase in revenues and adjusted earnings. GAAP loss for the quarter was $2,411 million or loss of $3.18 a share as against net income of $1,034 million or $1.34 per share in the year-ago quarter. The significant decline in GAAP earnings was primarily attributable to a provisional charge of $3.8 billion to reflect the estimated impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Excluding non-recurring items, adjusted earnings for the quarter were $1.85 per share compared with $1.74 in the year-earlier quarter. Adjusted earnings for the reported quarter beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny.Fourth-quarter revenues jumped 8.6% year over year to $10,843 million and exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10,689 million. The top-line improvement was largely due to organic growth of 6%, driven by strength in Aerospace aftermarket, UOP, Advanced Materials and Intelligrated.GuidanceUnited Technologies is poised to grow on the back of continued investments, strategic cost-reduction efforts and a favorable global macroeconomic environment. Backed by these positives, the company has given bullish full-year 2018 earnings guidance. Adjusted earnings are anticipated to lie within the $6.85-$7.10 per share range. Additionally, the company has given revenue guidance for 2018 between $62.5 billion and $64 billion (estimating organic growth of 4-6% year over year).Concurrent with the earnings release, Honeywell revised full-year 2018 earnings guidance to better reflect the favorable impact from the tax reform. The company currently anticipates earnings within the range of $7.75-$8.00 per share for 2018, up from earlier expectations of $7.55−$7.80, representing year-over-year growth of 9-13%, up from 6-10% expected earlier. However, revenue guidance is affirmed at $41.8-$42.5 billion.Price PerformanceFrom earnings release to date, United Technologies has outperformed the industry with an average loss of 2.8% compared with 5.6% decline for the latter. Honeywell, on the other hand, has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 8.4% compared with 7.2% decline for the latter.Estimate RevisionsLast month, United Technologies’ current-quarter estimates increased to $1.50 per share from $1.47 while that for the current year increased from $6.86 to $7.01.Honeywell’s current-quarter estimates improved to $1.88 during the last month from $1.81, while current-year estimates increased to $7.95 per share from $7.75.To Sum UpBased on the current scenario, although there is not much to choose from as the stocks seem to match on most counts, United Technologies seems to have trumped Honeywell only on the basis of price performance and stands out as a better investment proposition.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

832,HON,"Markets started the New Year on a strong note, posting fresh records on multiple occasions. Newly instituted tax cuts had a beneficial impact on stocks with the Dow breaching the 25,000 and 26,000 mark in the same month. Economic data remained strong even as fourth-quarter earnings promised to be the most bullish in recent times. Meanwhile, the Fed refrained from raising rates but indicated that a hike was more or less certain in March.January’s PerformanceFor the month of January, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased 5.8%, 5.6% and 7.4%, respectively. The passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which permanently slashed corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, last December contributed to January’s gains. Additionally, in its Beige Book, the Fed provided an encouraging outlook about the U.S. economy, which in turn also boosted investor sentiment.Moreover, during the month, the Senate gave its consent to pass a short-term spending bill that ends the recent government shutdown. Additionally, an upbeat fourth-quarter earnings season, which includes a very strong revenue momentum, an above-average proportion of positive surprises and an unusually positive revisions trend for the current and coming quarters, also contributed to strong market performance.Benchmarks Breach Multiple RecordsKey indexes achieved multiple milestones over last month. On Jan 2, the Nasdaq closed above the 7,000 mark for the first time. On the very next trading day, the S&P 500 moved past 2,700 for the first time. Optimism over strong market performance in 2018 contributed to these gains.On Jan 4, the Dow touched the psychological level of 25,000 for the first time.

(Read: A Very Strong Earnings Picture)Fed Leaves Rates Unchanged, Hike Likely in MarchOn Jan 31, the Federal Reserve opted to leave benchmark rates unchanged within the 1.25-1.5% range. Nevertheless, Fed policymakers reckon three rate hikes for this year, setting the stage for an imminent increase in March under Jerome Powell. The two-day policy meeting that concluded yesterday was the last overseen by Janet Yellen. Her post is set to be taken by Powell.In its two-day Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that economic activity has increased at a “solid rate” and will continue to grow at a “moderate pace.”Additionally, per the statement, labor market remains strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The FOMC also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.5 Star Performers for JanuaryI ran a screen on Research Wizard for companies with the following parameters:(Click here to sign up for a free trial to the Research Wizard today):Percentage price change over the last 4 weeks greater than or equal to 20%Forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the current financial year (F1) less than or equal to 20.

Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation have weighed on bond prices, sending yields higher.However, effective signaling on the part of the Fed is likely to result in investors pricing in this decision well before the hike actually takes place. Ultimately, a strong fourth-quarter earnings season and steady economic growth are likely to propel markets toward new milestones in the weeks ahead. Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

833,HON,"Whirlpool Corporation (WHR  -  Free Report), the world’s leading manufacturer of home appliances, has been making strategic partnerships and innovations to provide consumers with the best-class service and seamless experience. In this regard, the company said that users will now be able to distantly operate their home appliances through Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) Watch. Notably, this deal makes Whirlpool the first ever appliance manufacturer that has connected the smart home devices with Apple Watch and its capabilities.The activation of Apple Watch functionality across the company’s appliances will be executed in early 2018, thereby allowing Whirlpool’s customers to handle the household chores in a smarter way. Over 20 Whirlpool brand connected appliances to be rolled out this year will be compatible with Apple Watch. Whirlpool app in these smart watches will help consumers control  appliances remotely.Impressively, through the smart watches consumers can communicate with ovens, dryers as well as washers.Concurrent to this press release, Whirlpool has further enhanced its home appliance ecosystem by teaming up with the leading thermostats maker – Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).Per the deal, customers will be allowed to connect their home appliances to the Honeywell’s thermostats via Whirlpool app, hence remotely controlling these appliances and their energy levels. The service will start rolling out across over 25 Whirlpool brand appliances during 2018. Through this, users can auto-adjust their appliances to away mode, when Honeywell geofencing technology identifies a customer is not at home.Notably, the Whirlpool and Honeywell partnership dates back to 2014, where the former has utilized the latter’s low global-warming potential foam blowing agent in insulation in its US-made refrigerators as well as freezers.Additionally, Whirlpool consumers will be able to manage their appliances via voice commands to both Amazon.com, Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report)'s Alexa and Google's home assistant.All these above-mentioned initiatives signify Whirlpool’s commitment toward producing innovative, environment-friendly and consumer-convenient products. Interestingly, it is among the few companies that heavily invest in technologies to produce differentiated products to suit the needs of their end consumers.We believe these strategic initiatives are necessary for the company to bring itself back on the growth trajectory.We note that the company has a dismal earnings surprise trend with five consecutive misses. Moreover, top line lagged estimates for the second straight time, when it reported third-quarter 2017. Raw material inflation and adverse product price/mix have been hurting its performance and are likely to continue throughout 2018. Consequently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock fell 8.1% in the past year, however, it fared better than the industry’s decline of 21.3%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

834,HON,"On Dec 27, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).United Technologies serves various end markets such as aerospace, defense and commercial construction, which move according to their own cycles. This business mix and diversification allows the company to remain profitable even during tough economic times, delivering consistent earnings and dividend growth. United Technologies also has a strong aftermarket business. The company not only manufactures and sells primary products such as elevators, aircraft engines and helicopters but also sells spare parts and offers related services to keep the primary products running. The company’s aftermarket services business is relatively stable compared to new product delivery, and it helps offset the negative impact of downturns in the new products market.In order to fuel its growth momentum, the company remains focused on four key priorities — flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation. United Technologies has also revamped its aerospace unit. These include an overhaul of its organizational structure in the aerospace business along with some key changes in the leadership positions within it. United Technologies anticipates that the streamlined organizational set-up would enable it to better serve its customers. In addition, the company expects that the strategic moves will further ensure a successful entry and production ramp-up of its Geared Turbofan engines to thwart intense competition from peers like General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Rolls Royce.With a diligent execution of operational plans, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 16.4% against a decline of 4.5% for the latter. Moreover, the acquisition of Rockwell Collins is likely to create an industry behemoth with an unrivalled competitive advantage. The transaction is expected to offer United Technologies a bigger clout in the industry and increase its bargaining power as it would emerge as one of the largest aircraft equipment manufacturers in the world. The combined company would be better suited to meet the evolving global customer needs. With complementary products, the combination is likely to yield operating synergies through lower operating costs and more opportunities to cross sell the products. United Technologies expects the merger to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share after the first full year of combined operations with synergies to the tune of more than $500 million.Incorporating its improved expectations for organic sales growth in the near future, United Technologies raised its earlier guidance for 2017. Adjusted earnings are currently anticipated to lie within the $6.58-$6.63 per share range compared with the previously estimated range of $6.45-$6.60. Additionally, the company raised its revenue guidance for 2017 from $58.5-$59.5 billion to $59-$59.5 billion (estimating an organic growth of 3-4% year over year). Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment and continued investments in the aerospace segment, the company expects to generate significant cash from operations to reward shareholders with a risk-adjusted return through share repurchases and dividends.However, with more than 8,000 employees, United Technologies has a considerable presence in the U.K. Consequently, the company is susceptible to high operating risks following the Brexit referendum. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates also affect the company’s net investment in foreign subsidiaries and may cause instability in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. Furthermore, United Technologies relies on suppliers, including third-party contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts, components and sub-systems. This exposes the company to market price volatility and availability risks. A disruption in deliveries from suppliers, capacity constraints, production disruptions, price changes, or decreased availability of raw materials or commodities is likely to have an adverse effect on its ability to meet delivery schedules and thereby increase operating costs. These headwinds look all the more potent with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. A better-ranked stock in the industry is 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), which carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.3M has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.2%. It has surpassed estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 2.5%.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over.

836,HON,"General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 20, before the opening bell. The company’s Healthcare segment is likely to report higher revenues and strong margins, owing to improved market dynamics and growth in medical diagnostics market.Impressive Q4 PerformanceIn fourth-quarter 2017, GE Healthcare’s revenues had jumped 6% year over year to $5,402 million, with orders improving 6% to $5.1 billion, driven by Healthcare Systems and Life Sciences businesses. Stable U.S. and European markets as well as strong growth in emerging markets boosted revenues. Renewables onshore contributed to growth despite significant price pressure in the industry.Orders for the segment increased 8% in the developed markets and 12% in emerging markets driven by strength in China. On a product basis, healthcare system orders were bolstered by higher demand for ultrasound and imaging products along with decent performance in mammography and CT. Order for life sciences products were driven by bioprocess and core imaging.Operating profit was up 13% to $1,159 million, driven by volume and productivity gains. However, the same was partially offset by price and program investments. Operating margin expanded 130 basis points (bps) to 21.5%.Accounting for 18.6% of total revenues in fourth-quarter 2017, Healthcare forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in the company’s shares.In fact, earlier this month, GE inked an agreement to sell a trio of its health-care information technology businesses to private equity firm Veritas Capital for $1.05 billion in cash. The transaction includes GE’s Enterprise Financial Management, Ambulatory Care Management and Workforce Management software assets. This divestiture seems appropriate as the conglomerate has struggled to gain a dominant foothold in a crammed market for health-care workforce management and billing software, of late.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Healthcare revenues in first-quarter 2018 is currently pegged at $4,439 million, up from $4,291 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is estimated at $686 million, up from $643 million reported in the prior year.Overall Q1 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $2,660 million, reflecting a decline of 26.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure of $3,622 million. Total revenues for the industrial segment are likely to be down sequentially to $26,425 million from $32,214 million in fourth-quarter 2017.The industrial goods manufacturer is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs. GE’s first-quarter 2018 earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate pegged at 11 cents. (Read more: Weak Power & Transportation Margins to Hurt GE's Q1 Earnings)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a ‘reset year’ and is contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve liquidity.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management decided to continue with its inclination for the Healthcare segment, which is one of the three core segments.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report first-quarter 2018 earnings include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this year, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

838,HON,"U.S. equities have had a stellar run on strong growth and rising optimism around President Donald Trump’s tax reform. However, latest developments in the political landscape in the United States spell trouble for the Republicans.Positives for TrumpGDP growth for the United States was revised up to 3.3% in the third quarter compared with 3.1% in the previous quarter. The third quarter reading was revised from an initial reading of 3%. This was the strongest quarterly growth reading in three years. Non-farm payrolls increased 228,000 in November, per the Labor Department.Moreover, unemployment rate came in at 4.1%, a 17-year low. This comes as a positive for Trump, who seeks to brand himself as a leader of the masses.Risks InvolvedHowever, all’s not well for the Trump administration. Democrat Doug Jones defeated Republican Roy S. Moore in the Senate election in Alabama, a deep red state which voted overwhelmingly for Trump in the November 2016 Presidential election. Moore had been accused of sexual abuse and child molestation, which might have been a factor for the relatively low support he received.“We have shown the country the way that we can be unified,” Jones said. “This entire race has been about dignity and respect. This campaign has been about the rule of law,” he added.The GOP Senate majority has slimmed to 51-49 after Moore’s defeat. This might create difficulties for the Trump administration to pass its key legislations.Although the Senate passed the Republican tax reform, there are increased concerns around the differences in the versions of the House and Senate. Moreover, geopolitical risks weigh on the markets. Last month, North Korea launched a Hwasong-15 missile with improved technology that flew over Japan in a latest show of force.Owing to the high uncertainty in the markets, we believe it is best to opt for low volatility. Hence, we will now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to the low volatility space of the U.S. equity markets.iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report)This fund is a popular ETF that provides exposure to U.S. companies with low risk.It has AUM of $15.1 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

839,HON,"Investors seem to be optimistic about TE Connectivity Ltd. (TEL  -  Free Report) recent earnings beat streak, as the company’s earnings have trumped estimates in each of the four trailing quarters.This has been an impressive year for the company. We expect this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to retain this bullish momentum going forward, driven by rise in global auto production, continued progress on strategic priorities and solid execution. As investors continue to seek both growth and value in the market, infrastructure stocks which are priced fairly relative to earnings, might witness soaring share prices in 2018 as well.Investors also seem to think the same, as they have favored this stock in recent times. The company has outperformed the industry quarter to date, having appreciated 14.7% compared with the industry’s gain of 9.7%. TE Connectivity recently reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein it reported its eighth consecutive earnings beat, buoyed by encouraging industry trends and solid operational execution. Its adjusted operating margins expanded 110 basis points to 16.8%, with contribution from all three segments, highlighting robust operational execution. The company is enjoying sturdy momentum in emerging markets in Asia, which were up 16% year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter, outstripping the solid growth of the more mature American and European markets, which rose 9%.The company actually recorded 9% revenue growth and 8% organic growth in fiscal 2017, which, according to CEO Terrence Curtin, is best-in-class, compared with its industrial technology peers. The transportation segment registered 11% growth in the year, much ahead of the global oil production growth of 3%, reflecting consistent outperformance due to content growth trends as well as robust global position.In terms of guidance, the company is optimistic about 2018 being another strong year. It expects 6% top-line growth, of which 4% would likely be organic. The company also expects double-digit growth in adjusted earnings.SubCom, the deep sea cable component of TE Connectivity’s business, which has been weak this year, is anticipated to rebound to a strong fiscal 2018. Further, several new projects are in the pipeline for the coming fiscal, including a trans-Pacific Asian-U.S. cable. In addition, the company expects to address a project backlog worth a whopping $1 billion in the next fiscal.Of late, TE Connectivity’s transportation business has been displaying remarkable signs of progress. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business in fiscal 2018.The consensus analyst community’s optimism toward the stock is reflected in its upward earnings estimate revisions. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings being revised upward to $5.02 from $5.27 over the past 60 days, and reflects bullish analyst sentiment.TE Connectivity Ltd.

840,HON,"JP Morgan has launched a new fund focused on providing exposure to the U.S. equity space. It invests in companies with low volatility. JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility ETF JMIN tracks the JP Morgan US Minimum Volatility Index.  Fund Characteristics The fund utilizes a rules-based methodology to select stocks based on volatility. It has AUM of $25.7 million and seeks to provide exposure to low risk equities, while minimizing unsystematic risk. It charges 12 basis points as fee per year and has top holdings in NVR Inc, Walmart Stores Inc and Brownforman Corp, with 0.8%, 0.7% and 0.7% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). It bears less concentration risk as all, just a little over 7.0%, is allocated to the top 10 holdings. From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Health Care, Consumer Goods and Utilities, with 20.4%, 19.4% and 17.0% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017).  Market Impact The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are multiple hurdles for the tax reform to become a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. “Unless they have somebody that we don’t know about, right now we’re unbeatable,” said Trump. The House and Senate differ radically on what they want to establish from the tax reform. Multiple compromises might be needed to come to a conclusion. For instance, the House wants to abolish the estate tax, whereas the Senate wants to raise it. If there are significant negotiations made in reconciling the two plans, appeal for low volatility funds might increase. There is increased uncertainty with regard to Trump’s deregulation plans. This might increase investors’ appeal for safety and in turn make them shift to low volatility funds. Competition The fund faces high competition from other funds focused on providing exposure to the same space. Below we discuss a few ETFs that seek to provide exposure to this corner (see all Total Market (U.S.) ETFs here). iShares Edge MSCI Min Vol USA ETF (USMV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $15.0 billion and charges a fee of 15 basis points a year.

The fund’s top three holdings are Mcdonalds Corp (MCD  -  Free Report), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report) and Visa Inc. (V  -  Free Report), with 1.5% allocation each (as of Dec 06, 2017). The fund has returned 19.0% in a year and 16.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook. PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility Portfolio (SPLV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.  It has AUM of $7.3 billion and charges a fee of 25 basis points a year.

The fund has returned 18.2% in a year and 15.2% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). It has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook. SPDR Russell 1000 Low Volatility Focus ETF (ONEV  -  Free Report) This fund seeks to provide exposure to U.S. companies that are more or less immune to volatility.

(BAX  -  Free Report), with a respective allocation of 1.1%, 1.0% and 1.0% allocation (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund has returned 14.0% in a year and 15.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017).

841,HON,"The Industrials sector has been attracting a lot of investor attention lately. Strong manufacturing sector jobs and growing investor optimism has contributed to the success of this sector.Economic ScenarioThe Institute for Supply Management’s Manufacturing PMI declined to 58.2 in November compared with 58.7 in October. Manufacturing slowed from the 13-year high of 60.8 reached in September. However, per a CNN article, the sector has added about 138,000 jobs in the first 10 months of this year against a loss of 34,000 jobs in the prior-year period.Manufacturing has benefited from a weaker greenback. The manufacturing industry depends greatly on exports and a weaker dollar provided support to the sector. However, strong imports from China led to a record monthly trade deficit of $48.7 billion in October. Higher price for imported crude oil also contributed to the widening gap.The Senate passed its version of the tax reform. The Senate voted 51-49 in favor of the tax reform. Although there are still multiple hurdles to the tax reform becoming a law, Trump called the Senate vote a major victory and the Republican Party unbeatable. The primary concern weighing on the timely passing of the tax reform is that the House and Senate’s respective versions vary significantly. This might then pose some challenges in the passing of the reform without a few key changes.Let us now discuss two ETFs focused on providing exposure to the sector.Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to industrial stocks and tracks the Industrial Select Sector Index. It has AUM of $12.9 billion and charges a low fee of 14 basis points a year. It has 68 holdings and bears significant concentration risk as more than 45% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Aerospace & Defense, Industrial Conglomerates and Machinery, with 24.9%, 18.2% and 17.4% exposure, respectively (as of Sep 30, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report), 3M Co (MMM  -  Free Report) and Honeywell Intl Inc (HON  -  Free Report) with 6.8%, 6.1% and 5.1% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 7, 2017).  The fund has returned 18.4% in a year and 19.5% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). XLI has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook.iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to industrial stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Industrials Index. It has AUM of $1.2 billion and charges a fee of 44 basis points a year. It has 204 holdings and bears concentration risk as more than 33% of the assets are allocated to the top 10 holdings.From a sector look, the fund has high exposure to Capital Goods, Software & Services and Transportation, with 57.1%, 13.5% and 12.6% exposure, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund’s top three holdings are Boeing, General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) and 3M Co with 4.7%, 4.6% and 4.3% allocation, respectively (as of Dec 6, 2017). The fund has returned 20.1% in a year and 20.4% year to date (as of Dec 7, 2017). IYJ has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 with a Medium risk outlook.Bottom LineXLI is more popular than IYJ, as is evident from its higher AUM. Moreover, XLI may also be more appealing to investors owing to its cheaper expense ratio.  However, IYJ has a more diversified exposure in terms of number of holdings and has been the better performer.At the same time, both the funds have had relatively similar year-to-date performance. IYJ has returned a mere 0.9% more than XLI so far this year, whereas in a year, it outperformed XLI by 1.7%. Global manufacturing activity has been picking up owing to stronger demand; hence these ETFs are poised to benefit the investors in the long run. Moreover, if the tax reforms are enacted, companies will be able to repatriate a significant amount of profits back into the United States at relatively low tax rates.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

842,HON,"Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 19, before the opening bell. Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.19 cents per share, delivering a positive surprise of 2.6%.We expect Danaher to score an earnings beat in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Danaher has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is perfectly the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Danaher has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% as the Most Accurate estimate of 95 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Reasons Behind Better-Than-Expected ResultsDanaher has successfully repositioned itself as a healthcare company by expanding its footprint in the healthcare and dental markets. These markets are expected to benefit from rise in the aging population and increased spending on healthcare and fitness. Also, prospects in pharma and clinical end-markets bode well for the company. Per Danaher, it is well-positioned in the biopharma business, which in turn is expected to prove conductive to its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the first quarter.Additionally, within the Danaher Business System (‘DBS’) framework, the company’s number of strategic initiatives with respect to idea generation, product development and others have been significantly boosting its key financials over the past few quarters. For instance, in fourth-quarter 2017, DBS contributed appreciably to the company’s impressive run in delivering year-over-year core revenue growth, earnings improvement and margin expansion.Meanwhile, the company’s recent acquisitions are acting as major profit churners. The buyouts  are anticipated to boost top-line growth in the quarter under review. This apart, Danaher expects core growth rate to accelerate moving ahead, in the light of improving order trends and recent acquisitions like Cepheid and Phenomenex. Notably, Phenomenex has meaningfully enhanced Danaher’s Life Sciences portfolio and is expected to help the company achieve a double-digit return on investment in less than five years.Further, the company’s continuous focus on introduction of products has enabled it to penetrate new markets and gain competitive edge over its peers. Of late, Danaher has also witnessed compelling secular market drivers across each of its platforms and believes that rapid market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Crane Company (CR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.58% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.46% and a Zacks Rank of 3.Parker-Hannifin Corporation (PH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.38% and a Zacks Rank #3.Breaking News: Cryptocurrencies Now Bigger than VisaThe total market cap of all cryptos recently surpassed $700 billion – more than a 3,800% increase in the previous 12 months.

843,HON,"Diversified technology company, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) recently inked a definitive agreement to acquire Italian firm SCAME Sistemi, s.r.l. for an undisclosed amount. The strategic transaction is likely to augment Honeywell’s fire business within the Connected Building solutions portfolio and extend its customer coverage.Since its inception in 1979, SCAME has created a niche for itself with a wide variety of products in the field of fire & gas detection and fire extinguishing systems. It offers an integrated portfolio of products that are user friendly and highly customizable through a single interface and a supervisory software platform. These include system configuration, testing and monitoring to set the equipment at predefined safety integrity levels according to the unique needs of customers. This, in turn, would allow users to maintain a tolerable risk level for their safety systems and thereby actively manage operating risks for a potentially dangerous system failure.With such innovative products, SCAME would enable Honeywell to offer a seamless integration of industrial controllers and management systems that facilitate easy access to critical information, alerts and control.

844,HON,"On Nov 30, we updated the research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell aims to increase its presence in high-growth regions. Population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across its entire portfolio. The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the long term. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products.Honeywell regularly fine tunes its portfolio. It has sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquired 90 companies, contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. The focused approach bodes well for its growth.The company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 32.3% against a decline 4.4% for the latter. Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.However, Honeywell is susceptible to material price inflation, which affects profitability. Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment and result in margin contraction.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Danaher has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.6%.

845,HON,"Shares of industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) hit a 52-week high of $151.10 during yesterday’s trading session, before closing a tad lower at $150.43 for a healthy year-to-date return of 29.5%. Barring minor hiccups, the company’s share price has steadily been on an uptrend since the second half of April. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has the potential for further price appreciation with long-term earnings growth expectations of 9.2%.Growth Drivers    Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet are its key strengths in an enterprising macroeconomic environment.The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with decent organic growth and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the long term. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high-growth regions. The company has regularly fine-tuned its portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring 90 companies, contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. These factors bode well for for Honeywell’s growth in 2017 and beyond.Honeywell continues to invest in its enterprises to create units that grow faster and are more profitable than its competitors. The acquisition of Elster — a leading provider of thermal gas solutions for commercial, industrial and residential heating systems, and gas, water and electricity meters for $5 billion — is likely to augment revenues. Infrastructure investments and increasing gas consumption in high growth regions like India and China are expected to drive demand for Elster’s gas heating assets, strengthening its existing gas combustion portfolio to create a full solution offering.  The company has $300 million in its fund for its restructuring initiatives to improve its overall cost position and drive further margin expansion going forward.Honeywell reportedly has the largest industrial cyber security research capabilities in the industry. The company has hi-tech solutions to protect clients against cyber threats. Two such solutions are Risk Manager — the industry's first solution to proactively monitor, measure and manage industrial cyber security risks — and Secure Media Exchange, which protects plants against threats from removable media such as USB flash drives.With such state-of-the-art products, Honeywell strives to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment revenues.

846,HON,"Diversified technology company, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) recently inked a 15-year agreement with Dubai-based airline firm Emirates to offer maintenance and aftermarket components for its fleet. The agreement with the world’s largest operator of Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 aircraft aims to cut airline operating costs by reducing grounded aircraft time through round-the-clock support services.Over the years, Honeywell has developed a rich expertise in the areas of aircraft component exchange and repairs. The company intends to leverage this strength to provide comprehensive repair and maintenance services to lower cost of ownership and increase the lifespan of aircraft components. This, in turn, will effectively reduce departure delays and cancellations and boost Emirates’ commitment to on-time arrivals.The airline industry is fiercely competitive and each player in the market strives to incorporate all possible options to reduce operating costs. In tune with this strategy, Royal Jordanian Airlines selected Honeywell's Connected Aircraft GoDirect Fuel Efficiency software to minimize fuels usage on its fleet of 24 aircraft. The software utilizes data analysis and various monitoring tools to identify various fuel-saving opportunities to make operations more cost-effective and conducive to green environment.  Fuel consumption usually accounts for 20-40% of an airline’s operating costs and even a single-digit percentage improvement can reportedly save millions for an airline company. With this initiative, Royal Jordanian joins an expanding list of global customers that are patrons to the software, including India's Jet Airways, Japan Airlines, Finnair and Turkish Airlines.On the back of such innovative portfolio of products and services, the company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 25.8% as against a decline of 3.5% for the latter. Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.In addition, the company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well on a long-term basis. With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell remains focused on increasing its presence in high-growth regions. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products.Honeywell currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Some other noteworthy stocks in the industry are Danaher Corporation (DHR  -  Free Report), Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , each carrying Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Danaher has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.6%.

It has beaten earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 21.2%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

848,HON,"Stocks opened higher on Monday as investors seem to think the U.S.-led air strikes on Syria won’t lead to a much larger conflict. The strikes also coincided with the real start of first quarter earnings season, which investors should use as a way to fight off the volatility that has plagued markets recently.Earnings season kicked into gear last Friday when banking giants, JPMorgan Chase (JMP  -  Free Report), Citigroup (C  -  Free Report), and PNC Financial (PNC  -  Free Report), reported their Q1 financial results. Going forward, investors should use this highly anticipated period to try to recoup any losses they might have suffered during the extended bearish run.With that said, investors still need to be selective during earnings season and hunt for stocks that look poised to top quarterly earnings estimates. Conversely, investors should stay away from any companies that might disappoint by reporting lower-than-expected earnings results.Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the Earnings ESP Screener in order to search for stocks that are expected to surprise, in one way or the other.This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time.Today, we are giving our readers a free look at three stocks that look ready to post an earnings beat this week.Check them out now: 1.     Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report)Shares of Honeywell climbed on Monday, which might signal that investors have reason to be excited about the company famous for its thermostats and other control technologies for buildings, homes, and industries. Honeywell is indeed expected to see its revenues climb by 4.7% to reach $9.94 billion, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. Meanwhile, the company’s earnings are projected to climb by 13.9% to $1.89 per share.Honeywell is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and sports an Earnings ESP of 0.46%. Diving a little deeper, HON’s Most Accurate Estimate—the representation of the most recent analyst sentiment—calls for earnings of $1.90 per share, which comes in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. This means that Honeywell could be ready to top Q1 earnings estimates when it reports its financial results before the market opens on Friday, April 20.2.       E-Trade Financial (ETFC  -  Free Report)Volatility might not be great for investors, but online brokerage firms such as E-Trade can benefit hugely. This has been reflected in E-Trade’s stock price, which is up 71% over the last year, and also managed to come out of the recent market downturn nearly unscathed. E-Trade is expected to see its first quarter revenues climb by 23.3% to reach $681.74 million. The company’s bottom line is projected to hit $0.78 per share, which would mark stellar 62.5% expansion from the year-ago period. Better still, E-Trade is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and rocks an Earnings ESP of 1.14%, with its Most Accurate Estimate coming in 1 cent above our current consensus estimate. Therefore, investors should consider E-Trade a stock that looks poised to beat earnings estimates when it reports its Q1 financial results after market close on Thursday, April 19.3.       Abbott Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report)Shares of Abbott popped on Monday morning just a couple of days before the diversified healthcare company is set to report its first quarter earnings results. And it looks like Abbott investors have reason to be excited, with the company’s quarterly revenues projected to surge by more than 14% to hit $7.26 billion.Meanwhile, Abbott’s earnings are expected to expand by 20.8% to reach $0.58 per share. The company is also currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and boasts an Earnings ESP of 0.75%. This means that investors might see Abbott top Q1 earnings estimates when the company reports its financial results before the opening bell on Wednesday, April 18.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization. Billions of dollars in research have poured into it. Companies are already generating substantial revenue, and even more wondrous products are in the pipeline.Cures for a variety of deadly diseases are in sight, and so are big potential profits for early investors.

GAAP earnings for the reported quarter were $1,429 million or $2.33 per share compared with $1,329 million or $2.15 per share in the year-earlier quarter.

852,HON,"ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share in third-quarter 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 61 cents. Further, the figure improved 13.8% from the year-ago tally of 58 cents.The strong bottom-line performance is largely attributable to the company’s initiatives to drive operational improvements. Moreover, improvement in sales as well as market growth strategies in key global end markets proved conductive to the strong performance.Inside the HeadlinesITT’s third-quarter revenues came in at $645 million, up 10.8% on a year-over-year basis. Moreover, the figure came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $604 million. Growth in revenues can primarily be attributed tostrength in transportation, led by strong performance in automotive as well as rail, partly offset by aerospace. Strength in general industrial and chemical markets also contributed significantly to year-over-year increase. Moreover, organic revenues increased 5% year over year on an adjusted basis.Segment wise, Industrial Process revenues increased 1% year over year to $196 million. Increase in revenues came on the back of growth in short-cycle pumps and aftermarket service and parts, partly neutralizedby project declines in the midstream oil and gas as well asmining markets.Total and organic revenues at the Connect and Control Technologies segment were flat year over year at $149 million. Stronger general industrial connectors, actuation components and oil & gas connector activity in the Middle East reflected well on the segment. The segment was formed by integrating the Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies segments to streamline operations, capitalize on shared infrastructure and drive long-term growth in target markets.Motion Technologiesrevenues continued their strong momentum and surged 25.6% year over year to $300 million. Further, organic revenues rose 12%. Significant share gains, double-digit OEM and aftermarket Friction growth as well as impressive growth in the shock absorber business proved conducive to the top-line improvement. Additionally, favorable effects from foreign exchange and Axtone acquisition supplemented the sales of this segment. ITT Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ITT Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ITT Inc. QuoteITT’s adjusted segment operating income advanced 24% year over year to $91 million, mainly driven by strong productivity, restructuring benefits, improved performance on pump projects as well as the favorable impacts of foreign exchange.Axtone AcquisitionIn January, the company completed the buyout of customized components manufacturer, Axtone. ITT believes that this acquisition will continue to fortify foothold in the transportation industry – including railway, aerospace and automotive. In fact, in the third quarter, the strategic acquisitionbolsteredITT’s thriving Motion Technologies business and contributed meaningfully to revenue growth year over year.Liquidity and Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2017, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $395.6 million, down from $460.7 million at end of Dec 31, 2016.For the nine-month period ended Sep 30, 2017, net cash from operating activities totaled $178.4 million compared with $146.7 million in the year-ago period.Share RepurchaseYear to date, the company has executed share repurchases of $32.9 million.Guides UpConcurrent with the third-quarter earnings release, ITT raised top and bottom-line guidance. The company currently projects adjusted EPS in the range of $2.50-$2.55, instead of the previousguidance of $2.40-$2.50. The upward revision came on the back of higher volumes and improved operational execution.Additionally, the company expects GAAP revenue increase for 2017 in the range of 4-5% compared withthe previous guidance of 0-2%. The upward revision of revenue guidance is attributable to the strong year-to-date revenue and order growth as well as the favorable impacts of foreign exchange.Our TakeITT’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to financial performance. The integration of its Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses into the Connect and Control Technologies segment will continue to enhance focus on target markets, streamline operations and leverage shared infrastructure and end markets. Moreover, the company’s simplified operational framework will help unlock growth opportunities, as well as drive long-term growth in the global aerospace and industrial markets.This apart, the company’s focus on market expansion strategies are noteworthy and are likelytoact as a key driver of growth for the rest of the year. Going forward, the company expects its rail and auto businesses to act as major growth drivers, fueled by increase by recent acquisitions and growth in the aftermarket brake pad business. In addition, ITT expects to generate further OEM market share gains, particularly in Europe and China.ITT currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Other Stocks to Consider Other stocks worth considering in the same space include Nutanix Inc.

853,HON,"Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) recently announced the availability of Aspire 40, its newest satellite communications system.

The company also continues to invest in innovative technologies that are expected to help it maintain its leadership position. Also, as emerging markets expand the demand for the company’s, airplanes, automobiles and construction products is expected to grow.In the past year, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have outperformed the industry. While the stock has gained 14.7%, the industry declined 16.4%. Further, the company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions auger well on a long-term perspective.However, the company is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets despite its proactive restructuring initiatives. Moreover, in order to differentiate its products and prevent commoditization, Honeywell has to continually develop and maintain competitive products by adding innovative features. These, in turn, might lead to high R&D expenditures, often resulting in margin contraction.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Leucadia National Corporation  and Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report). While Federal Signal and Leucadia National sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Raven Industries carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Although, later Mnuchin said that his remarks regarding dollar was “misinterpreted.”Meanwhile, President Trump in the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland said that ""the dollar is going to get stronger and stronger” and eventually he wished the greenback to strengthen. However, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index fell 1.5% for the week to settle at 89.07, following Mnuchin’s comments.

(HON  -  Free Report) recently announced the expansion of its GoDirect connected services to the ground, which is one of the last unconnected aerospace frontiers. This latest move will take effect through a collaboration with the global telematics company, Pinnacle, and enable both the companies to connect an airport's ramp service to one single managed solution.  Also, it will offer real-time insights into vehicle activity at the airport, resulting in greater fuel efficiency, better on-time performance and lower maintenance costs.Notably, leverage of Pinnacle’s telematics hardware on ground vehicles will allow transmitting data that feeds into advanced software, thus making actionable data easily available for airlines as well as ground handlers. The collaboration will offer real-time insights into vehicle use & maintenance requirements and precise locations of all ramp operations thereby enhancing efficiency of ground operations. Moreover, this will allow airlines and ground handlers to use predictive maintenance for ground support equipment and observe planes’ reduced fuel costs owing to quicker turnaround times on the ground.Existing Business ScenarioHoneywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers on the back of its strong market share and product line-up. The company also continues to invest in innovative technologies that will help it maintain its leadership position.

860,HON,"On Mar 28, we updated the research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell aims at increasing its presence in high-growth regions. Population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue creating attractive opportunities across its entire portfolio. The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well on a long-term perspective. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products.Honeywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers on the back of its strong market share and product lineup. The company has been boosting its sales outside the United States, particularly in emerging markets like China. As its markets expand, demand for Honeywell's construction, automobiles and airplanes products will grow. Management is also focused on reducing costs and improving productivity. This operational focus should drive higher profitability in the future.Honeywell’s shares have outperformed the industry in the last six months, with an average return of 1.8% against a decline of 11.9% for the latter.The company’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. Honeywell’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.   However, Honeywell is susceptible to material price inflation, hurting its profitability. Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it to navigate better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets.The company is highly dependent on its supply chain to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during volatile demand environment. Honeywell also faces unfavorable foreign currency movements, which affect its top-line growth.A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could adversely impact sales of the Aerospace segment’s products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the segment’s margin and dent the company’s profitability.  Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent long-growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and Crane Co. (CR  -  Free Report) and Leucadia National Corporation , carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

It topped estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.6%.Leucadia has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 18%.

Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

862,HON,"Ahead of the opening bell for the final trading day of this week, new U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures were released, and, while not exactly disappointing, came up short of what many analysts had been expecting. The first read for Q4 GDP reached 2.6%, lower than the consensus estimate of 2.9%.Should this figure remain unchanged through future revisions — the second read is expected February 28 — this would amount to domestic economic growth of roughly 2.6%. This is nothing to sneeze at; in fact, it is almost exactly the average GDP growth rate of the previous 5 years. It’s a level which has brought the U.S. from the edge of the abyss during the Great Recession all the way to current all-time highs in the major stock market indexes.That said, the 30 basis-point miss does come as a bit of a surprise, especially considering a very strong Retail industry over the holiday shopping season, as well as a recovery in Oil & Gas and Construction and Manufacturing — all of which served as albatrosses in previous years. Indeed, some analysts were expecting a positive surprise for Q4 GDP that would have pushed the December quarter to 3% growth three times in a row for the first time this decade.This may yet happen, of course — future GDP reads have the benefit of more data points over time, and should this information break more to the positive, we could indeed see the most robust U.S. economy since the Recession. In particular, we look toward adjustments to private inventory investment, which shook out at 2.5% in Q4; personal consumption expenditures of 2.8% were the highest we’ve seen in a couple years.Q4 Earnings Roll OnWe finish the week as we began it — with a new batch of Q4 earnings results. Overall we’ve enjoyed a very strong earnings season, with positive surprises far outweighing negative ones. Even better: earnings revisions in future quarters for companies already having reported are currently up double-digits for the first time in many quarters, according to Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian.Industrial giant Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) beat earnings estimates by a penny to $1.85 per share. Revenues of $10.84 billion outpaced the $10.69 billion in the Zacks consensus. Fiscal year earnings guidance was ratcheted up to a range of $7.75-8.00 from a previous guide of $7.55-7.80. For more on HON’s earnings, click here.Defense contractor Rockwell Collins (COL  -  Free Report) posted fiscal Q1 2018 earnings of $1.59 per share, ahead of the $1.53 expected.

866,HON,"Manufacturers in the United States witnessed a solid start to 2018, per data released by IHS Markit. The Flash Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) survey showed that production volumes and new orders have been reporting robust growth. Moreover, strong export growth has also been supporting manufacturers in the United States.Into the HeadlinesUnited States Flash Manufacturing PMI increased to 55.5 in January compared with 55.1 in December. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. Coming to drivers of manufacturing growth, IHS Markit Flash U.S. Manufacturing Output Index increased to 56.2 in January compared with 55.9 in December, a 12-month high.Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said, ""January saw an encouraging start to the year for the US economy. Business activity across the manufacturing and service sectors continued to expand, driving further job gains as companies expanded capacity. Manufacturing is faring especially well, in part thanks to the weaker dollar, providing an important spur to the economy at the start of the year.""Given the excessive dependence of American manufacturers on overseas customers, a weaker dollar coupled with strong global growth bode well for the U.S. manufacturing sector, as goods were cheaper for international customers.

867,HON,"Industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 26. The company is likely to report higher Aerospace segment revenues in the quarter owing to improved market dynamics.Whether this will benefit the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Top-Line ExpansionWith a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell aims to increase its presence in high-growth regions. The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses along with decent organic growth are likely to lead to improved performance in the quarter. Population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across its entire portfolio. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products by divesting non-core operations and focusing on core businesses.Honeywell's Aerospace segment develops innovative technologies designed to make aircraft safer and more fuel-efficient and accounts for the lion’s share of total revenues. Over the years, Honeywell has developed a rich expertise in the areas of aircraft component exchange and repairs. The company intends to leverage this strength to provide comprehensive repair and maintenance services to lower cost of ownership and increase the lifespan of aircraft components.The airline industry is also fiercely competitive and each player in the market strives to incorporate all possible options to reduce operating costs. Fuel consumption usually accounts for 20-40% of an airline’s operating costs and even a single-digit percentage improvement can reportedly save millions for an airline company.Amid this backdrop, the Zacks Consensus Estimate the Aerospace segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $3,873 million, which is relatively higher than the year-ago tally of $3,666 million. The higher revenue expectations can be primarily attributed to an uptick in demand of Aerospace’s products and services by aircraft manufacturers, airlines and the U.S. military.Revenues from Performance Materials and Technologies segment are likely to be $2,866 million, up from $2,228 million. Total revenues for the company are expected to be $10,689 million compared with $9,985 million in the prior-year period.Other Key FactorsHoneywell remains susceptible to material price inflation, which in turn is expected to affect its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the fourth quarter. Further, high dependency on supply chain to scale production and adjusting delivery of long lead-time products during times of volatile demand remains matters of concern. High operating risks in one of the key ingredients of its business might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.Given its international presence, the company often faces unfavorable foreign currency movements, impacting its top-line growth. Any slowdown in the global economy, particularly after the Brexit referendum or the manufacturing industry as a whole, will have an adverse impact on its business and would affect earnings. A geopolitical impasse due to various conflicts and disruptions may further affect its international operations in key markets. In order to fend off competition, Honeywell has to continually develop and maintain competitive products by adding innovative features that differentiate its products and prevent commoditization. These increase R&D expenditure and have often resulted in margin contraction and reduced bottom-line growth.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is -0.06%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Honeywell International Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Honeywell International Inc. QuoteZacks Rank: Honeywell has a Zacks Rank #3. Although this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to make us confident of an earnings beat.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.  Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.94% and a Zacks Rank #3.AmerisourceBergen Corporation (ABC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.50% and a Zacks Rank #2.

(AFG  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #2. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

868,HON,"Shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) slumped more than 1.5% in morning trading Thursday, adding to the conglomerate’s recent losses amid a tariff scare that has seen investors ditch major U.S. industrials and importers.GE is now down more than 50% over the past year, and as mounting debt issues continue to create headwinds, this once-iconic American brand seems to be on the brink of losing its place in the global economic conversation.But has the selloff extended too far? Could now be a great opportunity to buy GE at a major discount? Let’s take a closer look.Recent ChallengesOn top of sluggish activity in its core businesses and an intimidating debt pile, General Electric faces regulatory challenges. The company recently adopted new accounting standards that restated its earnings for fiscal 2016 and 2017—a move that came on the back of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into GE’s accounting for lengthy service contracts.The once-dominant industrial behemoth also faces potential legal action over allegations that two of its financial units violated U.S. law related to subprime mortgages. General Electric is now looking to shed as much as $20 billion worth of assets to trim some of the fat from its existing structure.Furthermore, President Trump’s recent tariffs on imported steel and aluminum could lead to a rapid rise in prices that would force GE to re-value its backlog, while an all-out trade war against a major economy like China could see companies like GE face retaliation.What’s more, a recent analyst note from JPMorgan questioned whether General Electric’s earnings guidance is realistic. The firm argued that GE’s guidance for full-year earnings of $1.00 per share is “not credible” and fundamentally “disconnected” from its free cash flow guidance of $0.75 based on the effect of asset sales.Current ValuationDespite all these challenges, value investors might be interested in GE following its significant slump. After all, if the company avoids a catastrophic situation like bankruptcy, the stock could very well rebound from its current lows.But even still, traditional valuation models do not show that GE is trading at any sort of discount right now. When considering companies in GE’s peer group, including other massive conglomerates like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report), its Forward P/E trend is hardly attractive: Considering how drastically GE has been sold off within the past year, it might surprise investors to learn that the stock is still trading at a slight premium to its larger peer group. In addition to this unattractive P/E, General Electric’s PEG ratio of 2.6 is not great, and its current cash flow of $1.69 per share is less than the industry average of $2.05.Overall, GE is holding a mediocre “C” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Estimate Revision TrendsGeneral Electric is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). But the Zacks Rank does not necessarily consider the aforementioned valuation metrics. Instead, the proven strategy focuses on earnings estimates and estimates revisions to determine which stocks have an improving outlook and which stocks are trending in the wrong direction.Here’s a look at the revision trend for GE: As we can see, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has come down significantly on the back of universal downward agreement among revising analysts.Some might assume that the worst of the damage is already done for GE, but analyst estimates actually tend to come down gradually over time. As GE continues to struggle, analysts could become increasingly bearish, adding even more volatility to the stock.Want more market analysis from this author?

869,HON,"Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) announced that its GoDirect Flight Efficiency software is being deployed by International Airlines Group, an Anglo-Spanish multinational airline holding company, across its fleet of more than 500 aircraft. It will use the Connected Aircraft flight data analytics platform, which uses flight analysis tools, to reduce carbon emissions, enhance efficiency and reduce fuel costs.Honeywell’s GoDirect Flight Efficiency software integrates with existing systems to produce more than 100 analysis reports. These reports improve flight-planning capabilities and empower pilots with key insights, helping to expand their knowledge of operations and allowing them to learn from previous flight experiences.    The GoDirect solution is a one-stop shop for Honeywell's services and applications that provide airlines, business aviation operators, ???ight crews and maintenance teams with the information they need to monitor their services and network.Honeywell is focusing on expanding its industry-leading range of Connected Aircraft offerings. It has set a new benchmark with the launch of its newest connectivity solution, the GoDirect Router.The GoDirect Router maximizes available onboard Wi-Fi bandwidth and offers reliable, in-flight wireless connection on any network, including Honeywell's own GoDirect Cabin services. The router enables fast and reliable connectivity that passengers, pilots and operators expect.Its small design and light weight make it easy to install and suitable for all kinds of aircraft. It also gives access to all kinds of data and services that increase safety and at the same time saves time and money.The new router provides the same access to Honeywell's GoDirect software and services as Honeywell's larger CNX-900, irrespective of the connectivity provider. It is an upgrade for Honeywell's existing CNX-250, CNX-200 and other Satcom Direct routers.Honeywell is well-positioned to gain from long-term expansion in markets like aerospace, facility automation and automotive turbochargers on the back of its strong market share and product lineup. Honeywell’s shares have outperformed the industry in the last three months. It has lost 2% compared with a decline of 5.3% for the industry. The company continues to invest in innovative technologies, which helps to maintain its leadership position.   Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderHoneywell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the industry are Leucadia National Corporation , Raven Industries, Inc. (RAVN  -  Free Report) and 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report). While Leucadia and Raven sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 3M carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

While the Industrial segment revenue improved 10% year over year to $30,046 million, GE Capital revenues declined 8% to $2,397 million.

The GE Lighting and Current business were reported as a separate segment called Lighting.Revenues from Lighting decreased 16% to $483 million, while Oil & Gas revenues were up 81% year over year to $5,365 million due to revenues from with Baker Hughes Incorporated.

Transportation revenues declined 14% year over year to $1,074 million on lower locomotive shipments.Power segment revenue was down 4% year over year to $8,679 million, while revenues from the Healthcare segment improved 5% to $4,724 million due to solid volume and cost productivity. Revenues from the Renewable Energy segment were up 5% year over year to $2,905 million largely due to higher services revenues. Revenues from the GE Capital segment decreased 8% year over year to $2,397 million.Margins, Balance Sheet and Cash FlowDespite stringent cost-cutting and simplification initiatives, General Electric recorded lower margins in the reported quarter due to headwinds in the Power and Oil & Gas segments. Industrial segment operating profit decreased 7% year over year to $3,501 million, with a decline in profits in Power (down 51%), Oil & Gas (down 35%), and Transportation (down 11%), partially offset by a significant rise in profits in Renewable Energy (up 27%), Healthcare (up 14%) and Aviation (up 12%).

872,HON,"Shares of General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) dipped more than 1% on Wednesday, extending the struggling conglomerate’s nearly 25% slump over the past two months. At these levels, many investors might sense an opportunity to buy on the dip as the historic company looks to turn things around. However, a number of lingering problems—including President Trump’s proposed tariffs—could continue to cause issues for GE.Recent ChallengesOn top of sluggish activity in its core businesses and mounting debt issues, General Electric faces regulatory headwinds. The company recently adopted new accounting standards that restated its earnings for fiscal 2016 and 2017—a move that came on the back of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into GE’s accounting for lengthy service contracts.The once-dominant industrial behemoth also faces potential legal action over allegations that two of its financial units violated U.S. law related to subprime mortgages. General Electric is now looking to shed as much as $20 billion worth of assets to trim some of the fat from its existing structure.Meanwhile, the Trump Administration’s latest trade rhetoric could add even more problems to GE’s growing list. If Trump’s proposed 25% tariff on imported steel and 10% levy on non-U.S. aluminum becomes a reality, it could lead to a rapid rise in prices that would force GE to re-value its roughly $134 billion backlog across its power, renewable energy, and oil & gas businesses.Current ValuationGeneral Electric’s struggles are hardly new, and the stock has now lost more than 50% over the past year. But even with this monumental slump, GE does not present great value for investors looking to buy on the dip.Our system lumps seven other companies into GE’s peer group, including other massive conglomerates like Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies (UTX  -  Free Report).  Here’s a look at how the company’s Forward P/E stacks up against that group:Considering how drastically GE has been sold off within the past year, it might surprise investors to learn that the stock is still trading at a slight premium to its larger peer group. In addition to this unattractive P/E, General Electric’s PEG ratio of 2.8 is not great, and its current cash flow of $1.69 per share is less than the industry average of $2.05.Overall, GE is holding a “D” grade for Value in our Style Scores system.Estimate Revision TrendsGeneral Electric is also currently sporting a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).

874,HON,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jan 24. The company’s Aviation segment is likely to report lower profit in the quarter owing to challenging market conditions.Whether this would hurt the bottom line of the company remains to be seen.Solid 3Q PerformanceIn third-quarter 2017, GE Aviation recorded revenues of $6,816 million, up 8% year over year driven by strong growth in global passengers and air freight volume. Orders in the quarter improved 12% to $6.9 billion led by equipment orders (up 8%). The military equipment orders were up 10% year over year. Service orders grew 13% with commercial services up 11% on spare parts growth of 21%. Military services were up 56% driven by orders for advanced combat engine and advanced helicopter programs.Operating profit of $1,680 million was up 12% primarily driven by volume, structural cost productivity and value gap, partially offset by margin pressure from higher LEAP shipments. Operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 24.6%.Accounting for 20.4% of total revenues in third-quarter 2017, Aviation forms an integral part of GE as CEO John Flannery intends to focus on just three core segments — Power, Aviation and Healthcare. He aims to gradually exit all other businesses to plug the downtrend in its shares. Incidentally, GE was the worst performer of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2017, tanking 44.8% in the year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Aviation revenues in fourth-quarter 2017 is currently pegged at $7,203 million compared with $7,187 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit for the segment is expected to be $1,592 million, down from $1,749 million in the prior year as margins are expected to be under pressure from higher LEAP shipments.Overall 4Q ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Industrial segment profit in the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $4,954 million compared with year-ago profit of approximately $5,842 million. Almost all the sub-segments within the Industrial segment are likely to record leaner profits on a year-over-year basis except Healthcare. Total Industrial segment’s revenues are likely to be marginally up to $31,570 million from $31,236 million in the year-earlier quarter, although total corporate revenues are expected to be down to $32,693 million from $33,088 million.The company is likely to report lower industrial segment profit in the quarter owing to higher operating costs and $6.2 billion charges from the legacy insurance business. GE’s fourth-quarter earnings are likely to be hit by high overall expenses with the Zacks Consensus Estimate being pegged at 28 cents. (Read more: Will Lower Industrial Segment Profit Hurt GE's Q4 Earnings?)Moving ForwardFlannery has termed 2018 as a “reset year” and is seriously contemplating to spin off its operations to maximize shareholder returns. In addition, GE aims to reduce overhead costs by $2 billion in 2018, majority of which is likely to come from the power segment that sells electrical generation equipment. The company further intends to sell assets worth $20 billion to improve its liquidity. Also, the company halved its quarterly dividend to 12 cents per share — the first dividend cut since 2009 at the peak of the recession.Amid such drastic portfolio restructuring initiatives, management has decided to continue its thrust for the Aviation segment, which remains one of the three core segments for the company.Other stocks from the industry that are likely to report their fourth-quarter earnings soon include 3M Company (MMM  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report).The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

Based on the hitherto observed pattern, the second quarter is anticipated to register high single-digit percentage growth on a year-over-year basis.  Per the latest Earnings Trends, overall second-quarter earnings for all the S&P 500 companies are expected to be up 7.2% on 4.5% growth in revenues. Although it represents a slightly tempered growth projection compared with the double-digit growth rate of the first quarter, the dollar amount of the total earnings is likely to be on par or even better than the all-time high achieved in fourth-quarter 2016. The relative improvement in the quarterly performance is largely due to a turnaround in the economy, improved job market scenario and rising oil prices. Experts widely believe that earnings growth is likely to be in double digits in 2018 and beyond.For the second quarter as a whole, about six of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline, with Autos, Conglomerates and Utilities being the biggest drag.The Conglomerates sector appears to be a major decliner. For the sector, earnings are expected to decline 24.9% year over year while sales are touted to fall 7.1% due to a likely disappointing performance by one of the leading players in the industry.Let’s have a sneak peek at two major Conglomerates scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 earnings tomorrow to see how things are shaping up for the upcoming results.General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results before the opening bell. With a reshuffle in its top management, General Electric is aiming to focus on its core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. Despite prudent steps to limit its financial exposure by divesting GE Capital assets, General Electric is still susceptible to various market risks. The company’s objectives of simplification and productivity improvement pose operational execution risks as well. For a company as big as General Electric, the additional revenues needed for growth are quite large, posing a challenge to developing businesses on such a vast scale. (Read more: GE to Report Q2 Earnings: Will it Pull Off a Surprise?)In the second quarter, the company’s earnings are expected to fall 51% year over year on 13% lower revenues. For the impending quarter, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, and Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), making an earnings surprise prediction uncertain. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for a likely earnings beat.

During the quarter, the company inked a definitive agreement to acquire Nextnine, a privately held security management solutions provider for industrial cyber security, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to augment Honeywell’s cyber security portfolio with complementary products and services. Nextnine’s comprehensive portfolio will also be utilized in Honeywell Connected Plant that facilitates connected plant operations to improve plant availability, safety and reliability quotients. This is likely to generate incremental revenues for the company and boost its bottom-line growth.

876,HON,"The defense stocks in the U.S. got a solid boost due to the U.S. House of Representatives passing the 2018 defense policy bill last Friday. The bill, reflecting a spending level of $696 billion, easily surpassed the nation’s current spending caps, which limited annual military spending to $549 billion. It even exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March.As a result, an upside was witnessed across the major indices in the Aerospace-Defense space, over the trailing five trading sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index rose 1.4%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index inched up 0.6% during this period.Also, a generous flow of funds from Pentagon continued to boost growth in this industry.

877,HON,"Industrial goods manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 21. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 2%, beating estimates on three occasions. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors in the Second QuarterDuring the quarter, Honeywell pledged its support yet again for eco-friendly products with the announcement of the start of commercial operations in its new manufacturing plant in Geismar, LA. The facility will manufacture HFO-1234yf, sold commercially as Solstice yf, to meet the increasing demand for this environment friendly air conditioning refrigerant for the auto industry. Honeywell has invested significantly to build this state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Louisiana, which is likely to become the world’s largest producer of Solstice yf. In the process, the company also created several jobs in the area to boost the economic development of the region. With a ramp up in production, 40 million cars are expected to use Solstice yf by the end of 2017, up from its present tally of 20 million. Higher adoption of this refrigerant across the globe is expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions produced by over 30 million cars. With such state-of-the-art products, Honeywell aims to gain a competitive edge over its rivals and augment its revenues.Also, the company inked a definitive agreement to acquire Nextnine, a privately held security management solutions provider for industrial cyber security, for an undisclosed amount. The transaction is likely to augment Honeywell’s cyber security portfolio with complementary products and services. Nextnine’s comprehensive portfolio will also be utilized in Honeywell Connected Plant that facilitates connected plant operations to improve plant availability, safety and reliability quotients.However, Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth, volatility in crude oil prices and a tempered Chinese economy. Consequently, the company projects 2017 revenues to be down 1% to up 2% year over year.Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment margin and affect its profitability.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Honeywell is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is  0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate and the consensus estimate are both pegged at $1.78.

881,HON,"Technology and manufacturing giant, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20. In the quarter to be reported, the company anticipates weak revenues in Aerospace Business, which constitutes the major portion of total revenues.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of $1.80, reflecting a beat of 1.7%. Overall, Honeywell pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 2.1% over the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to Consider In a bid to better positioned itself to leverage the shared business models and maximize share-owner value through focused strategic decision making, Honeywell has reorganized operating segments. However, the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives are yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets.Particularly, Honeywell’s revenues for its Aerospace’s defense and space-related products and services remain vulnerable to changes in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding. Further, the high research and development costs could also be a drag on this segment margin and affect its profitability in the upcoming quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from the Aerospace segment in the to-be-reported quarter currently remains low at $3,535 million compared with second-quarter revenues of $3,674 million. Revenues from Materials and Technologies segment are also anticipated to be low with estimate of $2,194 million compared with reported revenues of $2,239 million in the prior quarter.Moreover, Honeywell remains susceptible to material price inflation, which in turn is expected to affect its operating profit and bottom-line growth for the third quarter. Further, high dependency on supply chain to scale production and adjusting delivery of long lead-time products during times of volatile demand remains matters of concern. High operating risks in one of the key ingredients of its business might reflect poorly on the upcoming quarterly results.However, Honeywell’s balanced mix of long and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well for the company. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products. It has regularly fine-tuned portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring another 90 companies contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. These factors bode well for the company’s quarterly numbers and are anticipated to offset some of the risks it faces.Furthermore, infrastructure investments and increasing gas consumption in high growth regions like India and China are expected to drive demand for the company’s acquired business Elster’s gas heating assets, strengthening its existing gas combustion portfolio. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Honeywell this time around. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.74.

882,HON,"Spin-off activities have stepped up lately, with biggies like Honeywell International (HON  -  Free Report) and Pfizer (PFE  -  Free Report) being the most active ones. Lately, the industrial giant Honeywell announced plans of spinning off its homes and global distribution units and its transportation systems unit into two publicly traded companies by 2018 end (read: 5 ETFs to Buy on 13-Year High Manufacturing Activity).On the other hand, Pfizer is exploring strategic alternatives to possibly bid good-bye to its Consumer Healthcare segment. A sale or spin-off of its consumer-health unit is expected next year. Pfizer's consumer sales have been essentially “flat for the past three years.”This clearly explains why Pfizer intends to concentrate on the more promising, innovative pharmaceutical unit and separate it from Consumer Healthcare. The move also signifies the likely introduction of more deal-making, as per Wall Street Journal. However, the company also kept open chances of retaining the business.Inside Spin-offsSometimes businesses form another autonomous entity from an existing business/division, when they believe that the separated line would add more value as an independent company. In such situations, the parent can focus on its core business management while the new entity can focus on its relative different goals.How Profitable Spin-offs are to Investors?According to Cantor Fitzgerald, “spinoffs completed between 2009 and 2013 outperformed the S&P 500 in their first year of trading by an average of more than 17 percent.” As per an article published on benzinga, spun-off entities have been performing better than parent companies lately.PayPal (PYPL  -  Free Report) (up about 114%) generated higher gains than parent eBay (EBAY  -  Free Report) (up about 56%) in the last two years (post spin-off). WhiteWave Foods Co  gained about 67.8% in the last three years against an 11.2% decline in Dean Foods Co (DF  -  Free Report). WhiteWave Foods was spun off in May 2013. Abbot Laboratories (ABT  -  Free Report) cut ties with part of its business and formed a new company called AbbVie (ABBV  -  Free Report) in Jan 2013. ABBV was up 85% while ABT gained 41% in the last three years (as of Oct 12, 2017).What’s Behind the Recent Surge in Spin-OffA Chicago-based partner at The Boston Consulting Group recently commented that in a bull market, which we are witnessing currently, equities are overvalued. This makes materialization of mergers and acquisitions difficult. Instead, high valuations better justify “spinning off assets or divesting assets."" If this logic holds good, we are likely to see more such actions in the coming days (read: 4 Bargain ETFs in a Pricey Market).Notably, the United States saw 88 completed spinoffs in 1999, which fell to 80 in 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The number further declined to 55 in 2001. The number of actions again rose from 24 in 2007 to 30 in 2008, before sliding to 17 in 2009 when the financial crisis kicked in, as per the data provided by Dealogic, quoted on CNBC. The momentum again gained momentum in 2015 by value, though 2016 and 2017 have been subdued.ETFs to Play There are always ways to play such corporate actions. Below we highlight two spin-off ETFs in detail. These ETFs can get further boost from Honeywell and Pfizer’s announcements.Guggenheim S&P Spin-Off ETF (CSD  -  Free Report)The 61-stock fund looks to track the S&P U.S. Spin-Off Index. Paypal Holdings (7.98%), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (7.85%) and Synchrony Financial (7.39%) are the top three holdings of the fund. CSD charges 65 bps in fees (read: PayPal's Strong Q2 Results Put These ETFs in Focus).VanEck Vectors Global Spin-Off ETF (SPUN  -  Free Report) The 95-stock fund follows the Horizon Kinetics Global Spin-Off Index, which is a rules-based, equal-weighted index intended to track the performance of listed, publicly held spin-offs that are domiciled and trade in the U.S. or developed markets of Western Europe and Asia. The net expense ratio of the fund is 0.55%. United States accounts for about 78.8% of the fund. Gannett Co (1.2%), Time Inc. (1.1%) and Timkensteel (1.1%) are top three stocks of the fund.Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

During the reported quarter, Oil & Gas revenues were down 3% year over year, due to macroeconomic headwinds and volatility in oil prices, to $3,108 million.

John Flannery, the current President and CEO of GE Healthcare would take the helm as the CEO from Aug 01, 2017, and Chairman and CEO effective Jan 01, 2018, replacing Jeff Immelt, who led the company since 2001. Flannery has led complex financial and industrial businesses of General Electric across the world and is likely to capitalize on his rich experience to fuel its growth engine.General Electric also completed the merger of its Oil & Gas business with Baker Hughes Incorporated to form an industry leader with an unrivalled mix of service and equipment capabilities. Under the terms of the agreement, GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes formed a new entity (the “New” Baker Hughes – a General Electric company) using a partnership structure, following which both the parties contributed their operating assets to the newly formed partnership. General Electric owns the majority stake of 62.5% in the new company and the remainder is held by the erstwhile Baker Hughes shareholders. The “New” Baker Hughes, to be listed as BHGE, has dual headquarters in Houston, TX and London, U.K., along with nearly identical representation in the Board of Directors. It has operations in over 120 countries and combined revenues of $23 billion.With a complementary portfolio of operating assets and integrated offerings, the new entity will be able to better serve the existing customers of both the companies. While General Electric possess unique capabilities in fullstream oil and gas manufacturing and technology solutions spanning across subsea & drilling, rotating equipment, imaging and sensing, Baker Hughes has proven expertise in drilling & evaluation and completion & production services. The transaction has reportedly created the second largest player in the oilfield equipment and services industry. Through effective utilization of combined resources, the synergistic deal is likely to yield $1.6 billion by 2020. The transaction is anticipated to be accretive to General Electric’s earnings by 4 cents per share by 2018 and 8 cents by 2020.Outlook ReiteratedGeneral Electric aims to build upon the momentum for a healthy rise in operating profit and reaffirmed its guidance for 2017. The company continues to anticipate operating earnings to be within $1.60–$1.70, with organic growth of 3–5%. General Electric intends to return $19–$21 billion to the shareholders in 2017, including $8 billion in dividends and $11–$13 billion in share repurchases.

892,HON,"To finish off this first busy week of Q2 earnings season — and with a lack of new economic headlines and/or tweets from the President this morning — perhaps we’re best served with a quick run-down of earnings reports ahead of today’s opening bell. We also look for an 11th straight day of gains on the Nasdaq, which would be the longest such stretch in 8 years.General Electric (GE  -  Free Report) posted beats on its Q2 top and bottom lines this morning, with 28 cents per share topping the Zacks consensus by 3 cents, and revenues of $29.56 billion surpassing the $29.13 billion expected. This marks the 4th earnings beat in the last 5 quarters for GE (that 5th quarter was a meet, not a miss), and the company has reiterated its fiscal 2017 guidance. GE also announced that incoming CEO John Flannery will be taking over for Jeff Immelt as of August 1st, and will secure the reins to the Chairmanship as of the first of the year.Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)-rated Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) modestly beat estimates on the bottom line to $1.80 per share. $10.08 billion in quarterly sales also topped expectations. The New Jersey-based industrial major raised its fiscal 2017 guidance, and this Q2 earnings report also represents the 4th beat in the last 5 quarters (the 5th quarter was also a meet, not a miss).Oil & gas services major Schlumberger (SLB  -  Free Report) handily outperformed estimates on both top and bottom lines, with 35 cents a share beating the Zacks consensus by 5 cents and revenues of $7.46 billion surpassing the $7.26 billion expected. The company’s Drilling business was up 77% in the quarter, and its Production Group income rose 170% year over year.Fifth Third Bank (FITB  -  Free Report) put up mixed Q2 results this morning, topping estimates by 4 cents to 46 cents per share but with a miss on the top-line: $1.50 billion in revenues compared with the $1.53 billion expected. Higher net interest income and lower provisions for loan and lease losses — down 43% — were the quarterly highlights. Fifth Third has beaten earnings estimates in 3 of its last 4 quarters.Railroad major Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) posted a strong Q2 before today’s opening bell, with earnings of $1.45 per share beating the Zacks consensus by 8 cents — +24% year over year — on quarterly sales of $5.25 billion that outpaced the estimate of $5.16 billion. Freight revenues grew 11% overall, with Operating Income up 21% to $2 billion. The company also bought back $850 million in KSU shares in the quarter.Posting a real blow-out quarter this morning is Encana (ECA  -  Free Report), the Calgary, Alberta, Canada-based natural gas E&P firm, which blew away expectations on both top and bottom lines. Its 18 cents per share more than quadrupled the 4 cents anticipated, on sales of $1.08 billion that easily topped the $773 million in the Zacks consensus.

898,HON,"Global consulting giant, Accenture Plc (ACN  -  Free Report), yesterday announced its plan of opening an innovation center in Midtown, Atlanta, next year, and creating 800 tech jobs by 2020. As described by Accenture, an innovation hub is a place where its clients “can work side-by-side” with the company’s professionals “to ideate, rapidly prototype and launch solutions”, in order to meet the requirements of the fast-changing digital world.The center, which will be located at Technology Square’s Centergy building, is likely to open its doors next summer.

Accenture operate several offices and currently employs about 2,800 professionals in the city.Atlanta has emerged as the best destination for business communities, particularly the tech companies, in the last five-six years due to the availability of relatively less expensive and talented workforce. Apart from Accenture, some other Fortune 500 companies which have offices in Atlanta include General Electric Co. (GE  -  Free Report), Anthem Inc. (ANTM  -  Free Report) and Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With the opening of the innovation center, the company will be able to help clients create, manage, integrate and analyze value-focused solutions, thereby giving them “tangible results faster than ever.” Furthermore, the company noted that it intends to create more than 800 jobs over the next three years, across its “Strategy, Consulting, Digital, Technology and Operations” businesses.The recent move is part of its planned strategy of making $1.4-billion technology and training investment in the United States.

899,HON,"Industrial goods manufacturer General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) recently grounded its fleet of corporate jets that ferried its top executives across the world amid sales slump. Notably, sales have decreased 12% year over year to $29,558 million in second-quarter 2017. The concerted move is part of the company’s strategic plan to trim costs to the tune of $2 billion by the end of 2018.Corporate Aviation FleetAccording to the Federal Aviation Administration records, the aviation fleet of GE includes three Challenger 600s and two Global 5000s manufactured by Bombardier Inc., a HondaJet — a light business jet manufactured by Honda Aircraft Company — and two AgustaWestland helicopters. Over the years, GE utilized its corporate jets to shuttle executives around the globe, both for personal and official purposes, with its pilots clocking hundreds of flight hours each year.Per data from the Conklin & de Decker aircraft cost evaluator, each Challenger 600 aircraft has an annual flight and fixed cost of $1.75 million (based on a common benchmark of 423 flight hours) while that of each Global 5000 and HondaJet is $2.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively.  Policy ChangeAccording to the proxy statement filed by the company, ex-CEO Jeff Immelt’s expenses for personal trips alone in 2016 were $257,639. Data compiled by Bloomberg further reveal that top managers cumulatively spent $1.4 million on personal trips on corporate jets in the last three calendar years.The current CEO John Flannery intends to save these costs to boost sagging sales and shore up earnings. Consequently, the company has changed its erstwhile policy for executive travel and has made it mandatory to avail charter services for air travel. However, the company has decided to continue with its helicopter services although it has not divulged its usage criteria.Moving ForwardSuch strategic moves seem to be the call of the hour as GE underperformed the industry with an average year-to-date loss of 23% compared to a decline of 2.1% for the latter. Investors have long been expecting such radical moves by this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to boost its sagging share price. Whether such radical steps will actually be beneficial remains to be seen.Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Bunzl plc , each carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

900,HON,"Geopolitical risks have been rising as North Korea refuses to stop its threats. Moreover, with countries expanding their weapons system, defense stocks have been rallying lately.Is North Korea Driving Defense ETFs?On Sep 3, North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test of a hydrogen bomb, which can be mounted on an intercontinental ballistic missile. Kim Jong-Un’s actions have created quite a stir in the United States and a number of Asian economies (read: Safe Haven Currency ETFs Gain, Dollar Loses Amid Geopolitical Uncertainty).Per a Bloomberg article, the state-run Korean Central News Agency citing a statement by the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee said on Thursday, “Japan is no longer needed to exist near us.” The statement further added, “The four islands of the archipelago should be sunken into the sea by the nuclear bomb of Juche”.Han Tae Song, North Korea's ambassador to the UN, told a UN conference, ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK (the Democratic Republic of Korea) will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history.""These threats come as UN passed new sanctions on North Korea. The sanctions are aimed at starving North Korea of oil to run its nuclear program by reducing oil imports by the country. Although the United States aimed at total oil embargo on North Korea, sanctions were watered down in order to secure China and Russia’s support, as they held veto power on the decision.North Korea has received repeated warnings from the United States, that if it does not stop its nuclear tests, it will have to face significant military response. As a result, major nations have started focusing on their defense systems in order to prepare for any mishap.Strong FundamentalsThe earnings performance for the sector has been impressive in the second quarter and is expected to continue in the third quarter as well.

903,HON,"Shares of industrial goods giant General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) continued to fall for the second consecutive day, nearing its two-year low as changes across top management failed to quell negative investor perception. Its shares closed at $23.36 yesterday — very close to the lowest level since Aug 25, 2015.  Glass Half-Full or Half-Empty?GE has been the worst performer in the Dow Jones Industrial Average this year, with a decline of 26.1% year to date as against a gain of 15.5% for the latter. In order to boost its sagging shares, the company restructured its businesses and focused on core industrial operations after completing the GE Capital exit plan. Also, the company initiated a reshuffle in top management to bring in new ideas as John Flannery took the helm as CEO, replacing Jeff Immelt.Early last week, Flannery further assumed the role of the Chairman of the company as Immelt retired three months in advance. Three top order exits followed in quick succession with Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Bornstein stepping down after 28 years of service on Oct 31, 2017 and fellow vice chairs, John Rice and Beth Comstock, retiring at year end after 39 and 27 years of service, respectively. The strategic moves seemed to be an effort by Flannery to start his tenure as the CEO and Chairman with a clean slate and a completely new support staff.However, such sweeping changes in top management created a negative investor perception and fueled speculations that fundamental challenges within the company are worse than what Wall Street is currently discounting.Down But Not OutDespite a dismal stock performance, GE has offered bullish guidance for 2017. The company anticipates operating earnings to be within $1.60-$1.70 (up 7% to 14% year over year), with organic growth of 3-5%. GE intends to return $19-$21 billion to the shareholders in 2017, including $8 billion in dividends and $11-$13 billion in share repurchases.In addition, the company expects to generate $18-$21 billion in cash flow from industrial operations in 2017. GE has solid long-term earnings growth expectation of 10%. It has beaten earnings estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 9.7%.For the first half of 2017, organic revenues improved 4% while operating profit increased 11% year over year. The company has returned $7.8 billion to shareholders in the first six months of the year, half of which was through share repurchases. A healthy dividend yield in the vicinity of 4% is also fully covered by earnings and has enough scope for further appreciation.With such a favorable outlook and decent dividend yield, investors can expect to profit in the future by buying this blue-chip stock at a discount.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGE presently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

He also termed North Korea’s move as a serious threat to global peace. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace space, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the green zone.

905,HON,"On Tuesday, technology and manufacturing giant Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) announced major changes to its corporate structure. The company, known for its services and software across a number of different industries, is planning on spinning off parts of its business in order to create two new publicly-traded companies by the end of 2018.After a full portfolio review, Honeywell decided to spin off its home and ADI global distribution unit, which pulls in $4.5 billion in annual revenues, and its transportation systems unit, which has about $3 billion in revenue. The new, separate home business will focus on heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning, and the distribution of security and fire protection products; the new transportation company will deal with technologies used in a wide range of vehicles.In a news release, Honeywell president and chief executive Daruis Adamczyk said that the new companies will be “better positioned to maximize share-owner value through focused strategic decision making and capital allocation tailored for their end markets.”Honeywell also announced that it would be keeping its aerospace technology business, a decision that went against the recommendation of activist investor Daniel Loeb. For months now, Loeb and hedge fund Third Point have placed pressure on Honeywell to overhaul its business, in particular to spin off its aerospace unit. Loeb believed that the move would “result in an increase in shareholder value in excess of $20 billion,” notes TheStreet.However, Loeb will likely be partially satisfied with Honeywell’s final decision, but if he isn’t, he would have to wait until the company’s 2018 annual meeting to make any dissenting moves, added The Street.Additionally, Honeywell raised the low-end of its full-year 2017 earnings guidance by five cents to the range of $7.05 to $7.10 per share, saying it would spend the proceeds from the spinoffs on acquisitions, share buybacks, and paying down debt.Shares of Honeywell are up a slight 0.20% in mid-morning trading, but have gained well over 23% so far in 2017.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

906,HON,"In the complex world of investment, debt financing is a well known strategy adopted by the majority of corporations for expanding their business operations from time to time. Dearth of ample funds is the primary driving force behind this strategy. Yet, resorting to debt is still considered a taboo as it carries the burden of interest payments.In particular, companies with large debt loads are more vulnerable during economic downturns and can even go bankrupt in the worst case scenario. Of course, companies may resort to equity financing as an alternative option to boost their financial resources. However, it is the easy and cheap availability of debt that makes it more popular among corporations.In fact, statistics indicate that America, the richest economy in the world, is the biggest borrower too. Notably, huge spending on wars, big tax cuts and stimulating economic programs have all added to the nation’s burden over the years. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the debt held by the public will rise to 150% of the economy’s GDP in 2047 from 77% currently.Nevertheless, this should not discourage investors from spending on U.S. stocks, since debt has been part of the economy since its foundation and yet the country stands atop others. What investors need to do is choose stocks with caution, thus avoiding those that carry high debt loads.Here comes the significance of leverage, better to say financial leverage, which indicates the degree to which a company utilizes debt to boost its operations and earn escalated profit margins. Usually investors tend to avoid companies bearing higher degree of financial leverage.The next question that comes to our mind is that how can we measure a company’s degree of financial leverage. To this end, several leverage ratios have been constructed as efficient tools to evaluate a company’s credit level to support prudent equity investments.The most popular among them is the debt-to-equity ratio.Analyzing Debt-to-EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A company with a lower debt-to-equity ratio implies that it has a more or less financially stable business, thereby making it a more worthy investment opportunity.With the Q3 reporting cycle set to gain steam in the coming weeks, an investor must be looking for solid growth stocks. Blindly investing in stocks displaying solid earnings growth without considering their debt level might not be a wise move. As, uncertainty can hit the global equity market any time, it is reasonable to expect that investors will be more attracted to companies with low leverage than high earnings growth.The Winning StrategyIn theory, the optimal capital structure for a company is one  with the ideal debt-to-equity ratio that maximizes its value and minimizes its cost of capital. Since, in practice, screening stocks based on these criteria is a bit difficult, herein, we choose low leverage stocks as these are considered safe bets.However, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy): No matter whether market conditions are good or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here are five of the 46 stocks that made it through the screen.Humana Inc. (HUM  -  Free Report): It is a health services company that facilitates the delivery of health care services through networks of providers to its medical members. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 and came up with an average positive earnings surprise of 7.24% in the trailing four quarters.Alibaba Group Holding Limited (BABA  -  Free Report): The companyoperates online and mobile marketplaces in retail and wholesale trade, as well as cloud computing and other services.It carries a Zacks Rank #2 and delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 12.16% in the trailing four quarters.Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report): It is a global diversified technology and manufacturing company with a wide range of aerospace products and services.

908,HON,"The world’s biggest advertising group, WPP plc  reported strong results for first-half 2017. Earnings per share (EPS) improved 146.6% year over year to 46.6 pence ($58.67) on the back of revenue growth across all geographic regions and strong performance in all operating segments.WPP PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  WPP PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | WPP PLC QuoteReported revenues for the period increased 13.3% to £7,404 million (down 0.4% to $9.328 billion) year over year, with constant currency growth of 1.9%. The difference between the reportable numbers reflect the continuing weakness of the pound sterling against the U.S. dollar, the euro and other major currencies. The company recorded strong revenue growth in North America, the U.K., Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & the Middle East and Central & Eastern Europe.Revenues by RegionDuring the first half, revenues in North America displayed constant growth, climbing 13.4% year over year to £2,767 million ($3,483.9 million) on a reported basis. The rise in revenues was led by strong growth achieved in advertising and media investment management, part of the company’s public relations & public affairs businesses and branding & identity, direct, digital and interactive operations.Revenue growth in the U.K remained strong as it rose 5.6% to £979 million ($1,232.7 million), driven by healthy growth in advertising and media investment management and public relations and public affairs businesses.Revenues in Western Continental Europe grew 11.3% year over year to £1,494 million ($1,881.1 million) with Austria, France, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands and Portugal showing weakness. This was somewhat offset by steady performance by Germany, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.In Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa, the Middle East and Central and Eastern Europe, revenues rose 18.5% year over year to £2,164 million ($2,368.5 million) on a reported basis, driven largely by robust performance in all the regions, slightly offset by Africa and the Middle East, which showed slight weakness.Revenues by SegmentBy segment, Branding and Identity, Healthcare and Specialist Communications showed a robust performance in the first half with revenues of £2,023 million ($2,547.2 million) rising 10.6% year over year on reported basis. The segment witnessed strong growth in direct, digital and interactive businesses, especially WPP Digital, VML and Wunderman, with parts of its healthcare, branding & identity and specialist communications businesses also showing robust growth.Revenues from Advertising and Media Investment Management improved 17.7% to £3,489 million ($4,393 million). While Advertising gained traction in Asia Pacific, Media Investment Management was strong across the U.K., Continental Europe and Latin America.Data Investment Management’s revenues were up 5.1% year over year to £1,308 million ($1,646.9 million). The mature markets continued to be difficult.Revenues from Public Relations & Public Affairs showed growth of 16.9% year over year to £584 million ($7.5.3 million). Ogilvy Public Relations, Cohn & Wolfe, the specialist public relations and public affairs businesses in the United States and the U.K., H+K Strategies and Germany performed well while Burson-Marsteller was less impressive.MarginsOperating margin for first-half 2017 came in at 13.9% on a reported basis, up 20 basis points year over year.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowFree cash flow for the first six months of 2017 was £1,001.1 million ($1.3 billion), of which the company utilized £241 million ($303.4 million) for acquisitions and £290 million ($365.1 million) for share repurchases.Average net debt for first six months of 2017 was £4.81 billion, ($6.1 billion) compared with £4.39 billion in 2016, as sustained improvement in working capital was offset by significant acquisition spending and share buybacks.Acquisitions WPP completed 23 transactions in the first six months; nine acquisitions and investments were in new markets and 18 in quantitative and digital. Of these, one was driven by individual client or agency needs and five were in both new markets and quantitative and digital. The acquisitions were in accordance with the company’s strategic focus on new markets, new media and data investment management.Subsequent to the QuarterIn addition, eight acquisitions and investments were made in July and August, with one in advertising and media investment management in Germany; one in branding & identity in Italy; and six in digital eCommerce & shopper marketing in the United States, France, the United Arab Emirates, China and Brazil.OutlookFast growing geographical markets of North America and the U.K, and the rapidly growing functional sectors of advertising, media investment management and Branding and Identity, Healthcare and Specialist Communications lend optimism to the company’s growth prospects. However, this strength will, to some extent be moderated by geopolitical concerns and growth worries in China, as well as soft growth in the mature markets of Western Continental Europe.For 2017, the advertising giant expects EPS growth to be in the range of 10% to 15% through revenue growth, margin expansion, acquisitions and share buybacks. Growth in net sales margin of 0.3 margin points or more is expected.Our TakeWith sustained revenue growth in faster-growing geographic markets, strategically targeted acquisitions and continued emphasis on improvement in operating costs to enhance margins, WPP expects its growth momentum to continue in the coming times.WPP currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

909,HON,"On Aug 23, we updated the research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report).With a flexible yet disciplined focus on cost and productivity, Honeywell aims at increasing its presence in high-growth regions. Population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive opportunities across its entire portfolio. The company’s balanced mix of long- and short-cycle businesses, along with a decent organic growth in new products and expansion in high-growth regions augur well on a long-term perspective. Additionally, the company is building a robust pipeline of new products.Honeywell has regularly fine-tuned its portfolio, having sold about 60 of its units (accounting for $7 billion in sales) since 2002 and acquiring another 90 companies contributing $14 billion in revenues over the same period. The focused approach bodes well for Honeywell’s growth in 2017.The company has outperformed the industry with an average year-to-date return of 18.2% against a decline of 3% for the latter. Honeywell’s diversified business portfolio has the potential to earn consistent above-average returns and mitigate operating risks. The company’s diligent focus on working capital management, free cash flow generation and a conservative balance sheet remain key positives amid a challenging macroeconomic environment.However, Honeywell expects a tepid demand pattern for its business jets and mobile scanners in 2017 due to sluggish global growth, volatility in crude oil prices and a tempered Chinese economy. Consequently, the company projects 2017 earnings in the range of $6.90-$7.10 per share while revenues are anticipated to be down 1% to up 2% year over year. Although the company’s proactive restructuring initiatives have positioned it to navigate better than many of its peers, it is yet to witness signs of stabilization in a number of its major end markets. A change in the U.S. government’s defense and aerospace funding could also adversely impact sales of Aerospace’s products and services. The high research and development costs could also be a drag on the Aerospace segment margin and affect its profitability.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the industry include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Graco Inc. (GGG  -  Free Report) and RBC Bearings Incorporated (ROLL  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Barnes has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9%.Graco has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 10.5%.

912,HON,"ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report) has managed to impress investors with solid second-quarter 2017 results, wherein its earnings beat estimates by 3.2%. The company expects to continue its earnings momentum on the back of strong productivity, business streamlining and cost containment measures. ITT Inc. raised its earnings guidance for fiscal 2017 in the last quarterly report, tangibly reflecting these growth drivers.Investors have been encouraged by the company’s striking performance, and consequently, its shares have appreciated 12.2% in one year, in stark contrast to the industry’s average decline of 1%. We believe ITT Inc., which enjoys a strong foothold in an expanding automotive market which has several growth drivers working in its favor. Read on to find out the key drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company right now.Factors at PlayITT Inc. experienced healthy revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by sound performance from the Motion Technologies on the back of market growth in automotive brake pads in Europe and China, and strong sealing solutions at Wolverine. Particularly, the Motion Technologies segment saw robust execution, with organic revenue growth of 5%.Encouraged by the overall positive performance, management raised the lower end of the previously announced revenue guidance of a decline of around 2% or increase of up to 2% to the range of 0% to 2%. Management also raised the guidance of adjusted earnings to the band of $2.40–$2.50 per share from the previous estimate of $2.28–$2.48.  In light of the strong momentum and raised guidance, analysts have become increasingly bullish on the company in recent times. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings has trended up over the past couple of months, from $2.42 to $2.46, on the back of six upward estimate revisions versus none lower.ITT Inc.’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continue to prove beneficial to its financial performance. The integration of its Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses into the Connect and Control Technologies segment is expected to deepen its focus on target markets, streamline operations and leverage shared infrastructure and end markets. Its simplified operational framework will help unlock growth opportunities and drive long-term growth in the global aerospace and industrial markets.We are highly optimistic about ITT Inc.’s market expansion strategies which are expected to act as key drivers of growth for 2017. Going forward, the company expects its rail and auto businesses to act as major growth drivers, fueled by an increase in acquisitions and growth in the aftermarket brake pad business.However, the company faces risks from uncertainty in the global macroeconomic environment, especially weakness in industrial markets. Also, pricing pressure on large projects and lesser petrochemical and mining project activity are anticipated to aggravate the decline in the petrochemical business in North America and China.Moreover, the year-over-year decline in total revenue and organic revenues both at the Industrial Process and Connect and Control Technologies segments remains a matter of concern. The decline in revenue at the Industrial Process was primarily attributable a lesser number of oil and gas projects in North America, Asia and Latin America. Revenues in the Connect and Control Technologies segment fell primarily due to decline in demand in commercial aerospace and restrictions on sales of military-specification connectors.Considering the growth drivers and the risks that the company faces, we have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) on ITT Inc.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks worth considering are Federal Signal Corporation (FSS  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and EMCOR Group, Inc. (EME  -  Free Report) each of them carrying Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Buoyed by positive industry trends and solid operational execution, the company raised its 2017 bottom-line guidance third time in a row.Let’s take a better look at the long-term growth drivers of the company.Overarching Business ModelThe company’s long-term growth strategy rests on three pillars — drive above market expansion through focus on harsh environment applications, leverage on “TEOA continuous improvement” system to expand margin and execute a balanced capital allocation strategy. Overall, strong demand in end markets, along with its overarching business model, helped TE Connectivity improve organic sales by 8% and adjusted EPS by 15%.Solid Harsh Application BusinessTE Connectivity is the market leader in the connectivity and sensor business, armed with a comprehensive portfolio. About 80% of TE Connectivity’s revenues are driven by harsh environment applications. Over the past five years, the company’s harsh business applications have experienced mid-single digit growth, driving top-line growth.Going forward, the company believes that this business will provide ample opportunities of margin expansion. Also, it might help fend competition from key players including Hubbell Incorporated (HUBB  -  Free Report), Honeywell International Inc. (HON  -  Free Report) and Amphenol Corporation (APH  -  Free Report).Positive Industry TrendsOf late, TE Connectivity’s transportation business is showing remarkable signs of progress, adding to its strength. Growth in electronic content and a rich pipeline of platform ramps from design wins bode well for the company’s transportation business. For fiscal 2017, the company expects high-single-digit organic rise in auto on approximately 3% production growth.Commercial Transportation business has been faring well, driven by the content expansion in the heavy truck market, especially in China, content growth due to the adoption of new emission standards and regulations. Also, healthy demand from Europe and North America are expected to supplement growth. TE Connectivity continues to expect mid-single-digit increase for the full year in sensors business.The other businesses of the company, namely Industrial and Communications Solutions are also faring well and TE Connectivity believes that they have ample room for growth, going forward. The company has affirmed that much of its operating margin expansion in the past few years have been driven by the transportation segment. However, of late Communications and Industrial business is contributing significantly to margin expansion.Going forward, Industrial Solutions segment is anticipated to grow organically in low-single overall through the Creganna and Intercontec acquisitions. Further, the Communications segment has bright prospects and is expected to grow by solid growth in appliances and SubCom business line.

918,HON,"ITT Inc. (ITT  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 results, with adjusted earnings of 65 cents per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. Strong productivity and restructuring benefits led to better-than-expected earnings. However, the bottom line came in 3% lower than the year-ago tally of 67 cents.Higher environmental costs along with unfavorable foreign exchange, more than offset favorable impacts of improved efficiency, a lower tax rate and interest expense.Inside the HeadlinesThe company’s second-quarter revenues came in at $630.9, up 0.8% on a year-over-year basis. The figure also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $627 million.Organic revenues declined 2% year over year due to lower industrial and global oil and gas pump project activity, which was somewhat mitigated by growth in automotive market.Adjusted operating income for the reported quarter was $88.3 million compared with $92.2 million in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in adjusted operating income was attributable to a rise in commodity costs, unfavorable foreign exchange and a rise in strategic investments.ITT Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ITT Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ITT Inc. QuoteSegment PerformanceTotal revenue and organic revenue at the Industrial Process declined 10% year over year to $192 million. The decline was primarily attributable a lesser number of oil and gas projects in North America, Asia and Latin America along with declines in baseline oil and gas pumps.Revenues at the Connect and Control Technologies segment declined 3% year over year to $150 million. In addition, organic revenues fell 2% on a year-over-year basis. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in demand in commercial aerospace and restrictions on sales of military-specification connectors.Motion Technologies’ revenues continued the strong momentum and climbed 12% year over year to $290 million. Additionally, organic revenues recorded an increase of 5%. Significant share gains and market growth in automotive brake pads in Europe and China and strong sealing solutions at Wolverine proved favorable to the top-line improvement.Balance SheetCash and cash equivalents totaled $355.3 million as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $460.7 million on Dec 31, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, cash flow from operating activities totaled $92.7 million and capital expenditures were $53.3 million. At the end of the quarter, the company had 88 million shares outstanding.2017 GuidanceFor full-year 2017, ITT raised its previously announced revenue guidance of a decline of around 2% or increase up to 2% to the range of 0% to 2%, due to the favorable impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted earnings are now projected to be in the band of $2.40–$2.50 per share, up from the previous estimate of $2.28–$2.48.Our TakeITT’s focus on business streamlining, cost controls and efficiency continues to prove beneficial to its financial performance. The integration of its Interconnect Solutions and Control Technologies businesses into the Connect and Control Technologies segment will help enhance focus on target markets, streamline operations and leverage shared infrastructure and end markets. Its simplified operational framework will help unlock growth opportunities, as well as drive long-term growth in the global aerospace and industrial markets.However, the company faces risks from uncertainty in the global macro-economic environment, especially weakness in industrial markets. Also, pricing pressure on large projects and lower petrochemical and mining project activity are anticipated to aggravate the decline in petrochemical business in North America and China.The company currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
