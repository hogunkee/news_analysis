0,IVZ,"An exchange-traded fund tracking Saudi Arabian shares has delivered the biggest return among peers so far this year as investors anticipate an upgrade of the Middle East's biggest economy to emerging markets status.The iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia (KSA) has returned 17% year-to-date, more than any other of the 229 ETFs focused on emerging-market equities tracked by Bloomberg. Its gain compares with an average loss of 6.6% for the group in the same period.Qualified foreign investors have been net buyers of Saudi shares in all but three weeks this year on anticipation that the country would earn emerging markets classification from major index compilers this year. FTSE Russell announced the upgrade in March with implementation starting next year, and MSCI followed suit last month.Total assets of the KSA fund have increased almost 20 times to $271 million since December. The fund has Saudi Basic Industries, Al Rajhi Bank and National Commercial Bank as its top holdings. All of these are expected to be added to emerging markets indexes compiled by FTSE and MSCI.Bets on the upgrades have helped the Tadawul All Share Index produce a 14% gain this year, one of the biggest advances among major bench marks globally. And as the interest in Saudi stocks grows, other investment firms are launching similar products. Franklin Templeton Investments is seeking approval from U.S. regulators for a Saudi Arabia ETF, while Invesco (IVZ) last month listed Europe's first fund tracking the country's shares.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1,IVZ,"Saudi Arabia's addition to indexer MSCI's (MSCI) group of emerging markets starting in June 2019 is expected to lure $40 billion in foreign investment to that country. Now, U.S. investment firms are looking to get in on the action.Franklin Templeton Investments, a longtime active asset manager, is seeking approval for a Saudi Arabia ETF, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on June 22.Currently, there's only one such fund, iShares MSCI Saudi Arabia (KSA). It has about $269 million in assets, a figure that's ballooned by as much as 1,700% this year, the most among all single-country funds. This comes at a time when investors are pulling billions from broad emerging-market funds and investing in single-country ETFs.""For Saudi Arabia and the region, this is a great opportunity to move into the limelight of international foreign investors, and to attract inflows,"" said Michael Bolliger, the head of emerging-market asset allocation at UBS Wealth Management's (UBS) chief investment office.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe 20 countries promoted to MSCI emerging-market status since 1994 had a median return of 55% in the year before official inclusion, according to Bassel Khatoun, managing director for frontier and MENA, and Salah Shamma, head of investment for MENA, at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity.It's unclear how Franklin's fund will differentiate itself from KSA or what it will charge investors. But when the firm made its passive ETF debut in November by launching 16 single-country funds, it clearly tried to undercut rival BlackRock (BLK). Franklin charges less than $1 for every $1,000 invested in its developed single-country ETFs and $1.90 for emerging-market funds, while BlackRock charges at least $4.80 for developed markets ETFs and $6.20 for EM funds.Two weeks ago, foreign investors jumped at the opportunity to invest in Saudi Arabia when Invesco (IVZ) issued the first European ETF to track the country's shares in expectation of MSCI upgrading the country's status.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Apple, Tech Stocks Rebound As Nasdaq Leads AdvanceLatest ETF News And AnalysisBest ETFs Monthly Performance Report

2,IVZ,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) is shopping around for an ETF business that would boost its presence in the $3.5 trillion U.S. exchange-traded products market, according to people familiar with the matter.X The bank's asset-management unit has had talks with the U.S. business of ETF Securities, said two of the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. JPMorgan also spoke with Global X, which it held a minority stake in at one point, though that firm entered into a definitive agreement this week to be purchased by South Korea's Mirae Asset Management, the people said.ETF Securities' U.S. unit, with about $2.8 billion in assets, specializes in precious metals and commodity exchange-traded products. The company has been in conversations with as many as 10 potential buyers, including U.K.-based Aberdeen Asset Management, and is expected to be acquired some time in the first quarter, one person said.Shares of WisdomTree Investments (WETF), an issuer of ETFs, were up 7.5% to $10.51 at 2:29 p.m. ET, extending gains after Bloomberg reported JPMorgan's interest in takeovers. Invesco (IVZ) rose 1.7% to $33.76, reversing earlier declines.Chloe Etsekson, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said the firm doesn't comment on market rumors.

8,IVZ,"Closed-end funds (CEFs) are often viewed as the redheaded stepchildren of the investment world, having attracted a fraction of the assets that mutual funds and ETFs have. Yet, because of their unique characteristics, savvy investors realize CEFs can provide a portfolio with consistent distributions of high-yielding income.X Like mutual funds and ETFs, closed-end funds are investment vehicles that fall under the Investment Company Act and that pool assets and sell shares in the portfolio to retail investors. The Investment Company Institute counts 531 CEFs, whose assets total about $275 billion. They typically invest in a single asset class, such as stocks, taxable bonds or municipal bonds, and are actively managed.Mutual funds, with $18.9 trillion in assets,  and ETFs, with $3.14 trillion, are called open-end funds because they can create more shares as demand increases and buy back shares when investors want to redeem them.Where To Find Income Without Taking Big RisksDoes Steady Earnings Growth Lead To Big Dividends?Shifting Global Markets Offer Income Investors Ripening OpportunitiesChase For Yield Risky This Late In Credit CycleClosed-end funds are closed because they sell a fixed number of shares in an initial public offering like a stock, and only offer news shares under certain circumstances. The shares then trade on a stock exchange, as do ETFs. Open-end funds often hold cash so they don't have to sell positions when shareholders redeem shares. CEFs rarely hold cash and can be fully exposed to the securities they own.All three types of funds are valued at the total value of their underlying securities called the net asset value (NAV). But a CEF's share price often doesn't match its NAV. It can be below, selling at a discount to NAV, or above, selling at a premium, depending on investor demand for its shares in the market.ETF shares also trade on the stock exchange, but ETF authorized participants and other big traders can arbitrage any difference between shares and NAV. This keeps the share price and the NAV in line with each other. But CEFs have no such arbitrage mechanism and CEFs often trade at a discount to NAV, though some sometimes spike to premiums.""If sentiment is poor and people don't want to own that asset class, the fund will trade at discount to NAV,"" said Rajeev Das, head of trading at Bulldog Investors, a registered investment advisor (RIA) in Saddle Brook, N.J. Bulldog operates Special Opportunities Fund (SPE), a closed-end value fund with a total market value of $135 million.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at stocks that are enjoying more successful breakouts, make sure to check out MarketSmith's screener tools. You can filter recent breakouts, stocks hitting new highs, tight trading action and more. Take a risk-free trial of MarketSmith.On the other hand, if investors think a fund is cheap or pays a big dividend, they might bid up the shares of the CEF to where its share price is greater than its net asset value.""There's been academic work done on why they trade at a discount,"" said Das. ""Some say poor management, taxes, or illiquidity. There's not a model out there that captures why. And that creates an opportunity for the investor to buy assets at a lower value than what they are worth.""For example, say you're interested in buying a stock fund benchmarked to the S&P 500 that pays a dividend of 50 cents. If the NAV of its underlying securities is $10, then the yield is 5%. If you buy the fund when the share price is $9, a 10% discount to its NAV, your yield is 5.5%. So, with the same portfolio and without taking on any additional risk, you get an immediate yield increase.That is one of the advantages of buying a CEF. If over the year, the equity prices rise 6% and the discount on the share price narrows from 10% to 4% of its NAV, you would gain another 6% gain from the discount narrowing, for a total return of 12%.""The closed-end fund offers the possibility to create alpha over the underlying asset class without taking on additional risk,"" said Das. Of course, if market sentiment moves against you, then the share price drops and the discount widens.Most CEFs are good for generating income. These include equity funds, taxable bond funds, and tax-free bond funds.""About 92% of closed-end funds pay monthly or quarterly dividends,"" said John Cole Scott, chief investment officer of Closed-End Fund Advisors, an RIA in Richmond, Va. The firm runs portfolios with only CEF and business development companies. It also provides data on all CEFs. ""And about 87% use leverage.""Distributions from CEFs can be composed of interest income, dividends, capital gains and sometimes return on capital.""That is something you don't see other structures do,"" said Greg Neer, partner and portfolio manager at Relative Value Partners, an RIA in Northbook, Ill. ""For people relying on income, this allows the funds to have more sources of monetizing a distribution.""CEFs also use leverage to boost yields. They borrow at cheap rates and then invest in high-yielding income-producing securities, which helps them pay more attractive distributions than mutual funds or ETFs. The advantage of leverage is that it can increase total return and yield. The disadvantage is that when borrowing costs rise, interest costs rise or the market moves against you, the losses increase.The top sponsors of CEFs are Nuveen, BlackRock (BLK), Eaton Vance (EV), Pimco, Legg Mason (LM) and Invesco (IVZ).For investors seeking a high-yielding tax-free fund, Scott recommends $2.1 billion Nuveen Municipal Credit Income Fund (NZF), which has an NAV of $16.02, and a share price of $15.23, a 5% discount. It pays a monthly distribution and with 36% leverage it has an annualized dividend yield of 5.8%, according to Closed-End Fund Advisors.Scott says only 70% of the portfolio is investment grade and the duration is higher than the average fund. If interest rates spike this will go down faster than other funds, but this is a lot of yield for a tax-free income. The expense ratio including the cost of leverage is 2.07%.He also likes $695 million BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust (BIT), which has an NAV of $19.93, and a share price of $18.16, an 8.9% discount. It pays a monthly distribution that yields 7.7% on 37% leverage, according to Closed-End Fund Advisors. It's a multisector taxable bond fund holding U.S. corporates, asset-back securities and preferred stock. The expense ratio including the cost of leverage is 2.17%.AllianzGI NFJ Dividend, Interest & Premium Strategy Fund (NFJ), with a market value of  $1.28 billion, has an NAV of $14.69 and a share price of 13.39, an 8.9% discount. With no leverage it pays a quarterly distribution that yields 9%. This holds mostly common stock of U.S. companies, but Scott says it has a sleeve of convertible bonds and that some of the managed distributions are return on capital and short-term gains. The expense ratio is 0.96%.Neer recommends $1.6 billion BlackRock Credit Allocation Income Trust (BTZ), a multisector taxable bond fund with an NAV of $14.83 and a share price of $13.25, a 10.7% discount. With 21% leverage, it pays a monthly distribution that yields 6%.""This fund has had strong historical NAV performance vs. its peers,"" Neer said. ""It's a diversified portfolio of investment grade credit, some non-U.S. developed market bonds of about a BBB credit quality and some high yield."" The expense ratio with leverage is 1.19%.Before buying a CEF, check to see whether its discount to NAV is near the top of its recent range or whether its trading at a rare premium to NAV. If so, look into whether market conditions are likely to develop to send the CEF to a discount or bigger discount, thus possibly eroding the value of your investment.More information about closed-end funds can be found at the Closed-End Fund Association, a trade group that promotes and tracks CEFs, also at the Investment Company Institute and Morningstar Direct.RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

In fact, year-to-date bond ETF inflows recently topped $100 billion, the first time that's occurred in a single calendar year.Bonds have also been on investors' radar as the Federal Reserve is expected to continue hiking interest rate. As such, the two-day conference will cover everything from whether investors should own bonds to how smart beta works in fixed income to understanding Fed speak.Speakers include executives from ETF providers including Invesco (IVZ), State Street Global Advisors (STT) and Vanguard, bond managers DoubleLine and Pimco, and index providers FTSE Russell and S&P Dow Jones Indices. Asset managers, as well as industry experts from Inside ETFs and ETF.com, are also slated to present.IBD'S TAKE: On the lookout for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look?

Other topics covered during the day include the outlook for fixed income, how smart beta works in fixed income, and if rising rates will destroy high yield.The morning keynote on Thursday will be delivered by Jeffrey Sherman, deputy chief investment officer at DoubleLine, who will share his thoughts on what the next decade in the fixed income market could yield.In the evening's keynote speech, Jim Grant, founder and editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer, will address how to make sense of the Fed's mixed signals in a presentation titled ""Living in the Age of 'Abnormalization': Understanding the Language of the Fed.""In Friday's keynote, FTSE Russell Benchmarks CEO Waqas Samad will discuss the shift in the fixed income benchmark business from investment banks to more traditional index and data providers.RELATED:Bond Funds Give Back Gains As Yields Pick UpHow To Invest In A Rising-Rate Environment3 Ways To Help Navigate Bonds In A Rising Rate EnvironmentBond ETFs Mark 15th Anniversary; Which Fund Is Beating S&P?

10,IVZ,"As rumored back in August, Invesco (IVZ) may soon add Guggenheim Partners' exchange traded funds to its PowerShares lineup.XThe Atlanta-based money manager is expected to announce a deal as soon as Thursday, according to the Financial Times, with an expected purchase price of more than $1 billion in cash.Invesco — the fourth-biggest ETF provider, with $125 billion in assets under management — would add north of $30 billion if it buys Guggenheim's ETF business. Guggenheim has about 70 ETFs, with the fixed-income variety accounting for its top funds.It's unclear how the top leadership of the combined business will play out, but Scott Minerd, Guggenheim's global chief investment officer, isn't expected to stay on. The Financial Times has referred to a ""power struggle"" between Minerd and Guggenheim CEO Mark Walter.While it's too early to speculate what the acquisition will mean for the two firms' clients, Todd Rosenbluth, CFRA's ETF and mutual fund research director, doesn't anticipate a big impact.IBD'S TAKE: The Finance-Investment Management industry group has rallied for much of this month. How do Invesco's fundamentals and technicals rank in the  group? Find out now at IBD Stock Checkup.""PowerShares and Guggenheim have complementary ETF lineups focused primarily on smart-beta strategies and have a strong connection to S&P Dow Jones Indices,"" he said in a note. ""Leading equity offerings include PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) and PowerShares S&P 500 Quality (SPHQ) and Guggenheim S&P 500 Equal Weight (RSP) and Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG). As such, we don't expect there to be a need for product rationalization or confusion among clients.""Rosenbluth thinks the deal could help PowerShares gain ""much-needed scale"" to compete with increased competition, from both established ETF providers and recent entrants such as Goldman Sachs. In the past two years, iShares, Vanguard and SSGA have grown their combined market share to 83%, he says, while PowerShares and Guggenheim's combined market share has slipped to 5.3% from 5.9%.He expects the ETF industry to keep growing.""We expect advisors and investors to increasingly use passively managed ETFs to build asset allocation strategies, helping to drive continued asset growth for the industry,"" Rosenbluth said. ""PowerShares has been positioning itself in recent years to be a beneficiary of this shift, and we view the expected deal favorably.""Invesco in April bought Source, a European ETF provider with $25 billion in assets.

13,IVZ,"Invesco (IVZ) entered the exchange traded fund universe in 2006 when it acquired PowerShares, one of the top five ETF providers in the U.S.XWith more than $150 billion in assets under management, Invesco PowerShares offers more than 140 domestic and international ETFs.Its flagship PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, remains near the top of the list among all U.S. exchange traded funds in terms of both assets under management and year-to-date gains.The $52.7 billion fund has returned more than 24% this year through Sept. 14, according to Morningstar Direct, nearly double the S&P 500's performance. It's also steadily outperformed the benchmark index over the past three, five, 10 and 15 years. PowerShares launched QQQ in March 1999.While QQQ accounts for a sizable chunk of Invesco's ETF assets, the Atlanta-based investment manager has been drawing attention for its smart-beta products. Smart beta — also known as strategic beta — adds an extra layer of analytics to traditional index investing. Rather than simply mimicking a benchmark index, smart-beta ETFs target bigger returns by selecting stocks based on dividends, volatility, size or other factors.For instance, PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV) screens for the 100 S&P 500 stocks with the lowest volatility. PowerShares Buyback Achievers (PKW) focuses on companies that have reduced their shares outstanding by 5% or more in the trailing 12 months.IBD'S TAKE: Looking for exchange traded ideas but not sure where to start? Check out the weekly ETF Leaders column and accompanying ETF Leaders list for some highly rated funds.PowerShares is considered a pioneer on the smart-beta front. In 2003 it introduced the first ""intelligent index"" ETFs, based on a quantitative analysis indexing method developed by PowerShares executives.Today, Invesco PowerShares' lineup includes more than 90 smart-beta ETFs. It has $45 billion in smart-beta assets, according to Invesco's website.We checked in with Dan Draper, managing director of Global ETFs for Invesco PowerShares, to find out more details about its smart-beta line of products, stock market outlook and what kinds of investments make sense in a rising interest rate environment. He joined Invesco in 2013 from Credit Suisse, where he was managing director and global head of ETFs.Draper's been busy helping grow PowerShares offerings. In August, Invesco expanded its global reach by completing its acquisition of Europe-based ETF provider Source. Invesco has already launched nine new ETFs this year, bringing its new product total to 33 since 2013.The full interview with Draper follows:IBD: What is the overall strategy for Invesco PowerShares?Draper: Our strategic priorities are threefold. First, we aim to lead and grow demand for smart-beta ETFs by providing differentiated and highly innovative content that's focused on smart-beta/factor investing.Second, we're working to strengthen our position in institutional markets. We see a real opportunity to expand in the institutional space given the increasing use of smart-beta products among institutional investors. We believe we are well positioned since we offer the broadest suite of smart-beta strategies, which provide access to track-tested tools needed to create tailored portfolios.Third, we're trying to selectively grow our international footprint while not losing focus on U.S. markets. We're seeking to increase global market share through our global brand and with products in targeted high-growth, non-U.S. markets. We are pursuing both organic and inorganic opportunities to achieve this growth.IBD: How much has PowerShares grown since its 2002 founding and 2006 acquisition by Invesco?Draper: PowerShares proprietary business has grown from $1.2 billion in assets under management on May 1, 2003, to $155 billion as of June 30, 2017.IBD: What sets your ETFs apart from the competition?Draper: Our product line consists of tools to help investors extract alpha, manage risk or gain targeted market exposures. We have always been a product innovator, launching many first-to-market strategies, including the first multifactor ETF, first single-factor ETF and first fundamental weight smart-beta fixed-income ETF.Our smart-beta ETF line is the broadest in the industry with 98 smart-beta offerings and has the longest track record — 73 ETFs have a five-year history. It's also the deepest with 21 smart-beta ETFs that each have at least $500 million in assets, and the second-largest in terms of most overall assets, at $47 billion.IBD: PowerShares has long offered factor-based investing, and now 'smart beta' is everywhere. Why do you think that's the case?Draper: PowerShares is a leader and innovator in this space, and we offer more than 90 smart-beta ETFs. Smart-beta and factor-based investing represents an innovative approach to investing that provides investors transparent, low-cost and efficient exposure to strategies. These portfolios provide a wider toolset than traditional cap-weighted portfolios and allow for customization by clients in meeting their objectives.IBD: Any thoughts on what will be the next big trend among ETF providers?Draper: As we look ahead in the ETF industry, providing more-efficient solutions for clients will be key. The combination of active and passive strategies with a digital experience will enable investors to more efficiently utilize ETFs in their portfolios. Additionally, we expect to see smart-beta portfolios become an even more crucial component of investors overall asset allocation strategies.IBD: What are your most popular ETFs/strategies in terms of assets and inflows this year?Draper: Our PowerShares fixed-income and factor strategies were the most popular as of Aug. 30, based on assets under management and net flows. Year to date, our net flows have been driven by fixed income, which gathered $4.3 billion. Short-duration products led our fixed-income flows. Factor and low-volatility products are also seeing strong inflows. For example, year to date, our low-volatility suite has gathered more than $550 million.Below are the top five PowerShares ETFs by inflows in 2017, which are also our top five in AUM with a different order (as of 8/25/17):IBD: What is your outlook for the U.S. and global stock markets?Draper: We expect the weaker U.S. dollar will become a driving force in the market during the second half of this year. The weaker dollar will support profit growth in the U.S., and will boost emerging-market economies by reducing their debt burden in local currency terms, as they often borrow in dollars.We also think the weaker dollar will push up inflation later this year, putting upward pressure on long-term interest rates and, thereby, potentially creating some volatility for high price-to-earnings (P/E) stocks.IBD: Are there certain types of ETFs investors should focus on in a rising interest rate environment?Draper: PowerShares Variable Rate Investment Grade (VRIG) and PowerShares Variable Rate Preferred are two favorites for income, and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility and PowerShares S&P 500 Enhanced Value (SPVU) are favorites for domestic equity as value stocks' lower P-Es may fare better than high P-E stocks as rates rise. And, since rising rates often contribute to volatility in equities, so SPLV would serve one well.IBD: What's your take on the long-standing active vs. passive debate?Draper: We believe portfolios can include actively managed funds, smart-beta strategies and traditional passive approaches that are all intentionally chosen and allocated with a client's goals in mind.IBD: Has increased competition pressured PowerShares to lower its expense ratios?Draper: We continually monitor our product line to ensure our ETFs are appropriately priced.

18,IVZ,"What was all that hubbub about President Trump wanting to kill your ability to deduct your 401(k) retirement account contributions? Any such proposal would slash your incentive to contribute to your 401(k) account — making it harder for you to save for retirement, maybe prompting you not to contribute as much, leading to a smaller retirement nest egg.So why did that news story explode into the headlines — then disappear? Here's why: It was a mistake by some news outlets, a misunderstanding. At least that's all it is for now.On April 26, White House officials outlined Trump's tax plan. A single-page summary said the plan would eliminate the vast majority of tax deductions, leaving intact a few exceptions such as charitable contributions.The next day, at the daily White House press briefing, a reporter asked if the deduction for contributions to 401(k) accounts would be among the many deductions axed by the president's plan. Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the plan would preserve mortgage deductions and charitable gifts and ""that's it.""And that's what triggered the headlines about the demise of 401(k) deductions. Spicer clarified later that day that the plan would not eliminate the deduction for retirement plan contributions. But it took awhile for that clarification to spread.But who knows what will happen to the popular deduction once Trump presents a detailed tax proposal to Congress. ""There's always a danger that it could come into play as part of a compromise or negotiation between the White House and Congress,"" Rick Meigs, president of 401khelpcenter.com, told IBD.Katrina Hooper, global market strategist for Invesco's (IVZ) PowerShares line, told IBD that she expects the deduction to be left intact by the time a tax reform package is passed by Congress and signed into law. ""The American people need to be incentivized to save for retirement, and without the deduction we will see a reduction in contributions,"" she said. ""That would not be in the U.S.' interest.""But Hooper also said it's impossible to predict the outcome once Congress starts to ponder details of tax reform and once special-interest lobbyists fight to preserve a wide array of tax rules and deductions.""A lot of details will emerge through the negotiation and bargaining process that is bound to happen,"" Hooper said. ""The ultimate outcome will be a detailed plan that is much more of a compromise. There will have to be a lot of give-and-take among a lot of people with different viewpoints — congressmen, Republicans, Democrats.""But for now, the deduction stays.RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Keep Your Retirement Plan's GPS On Track In A Wild, Woolly World

19,IVZ,"A federal appeals court on Thursday declined to slap down the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule, which is intended to minimize conflicts of interest by brokers and financial advisors dealing with clients' retirement accounts.The court action was a setback for opponents of the DOL and Obama administration rule, which requires brokers and advisors to recommend investments that are in the best interests of clients, not merely suitable for them. As a result, the new rule will require brokers and advisors to put their clients' best interest before their own profit.Discount brokers like Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) are expected to benefit from the rule. A Goldman Sachs report said the rule will likely heighten investors' concern about fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs and passive mutual funds. That should benefit iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.IBD's TAKE: This IBD report analyzes the financial impact of the fiduciary rule on workers and on the financial services industry.In its Thursday ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied a request by the National Association for Fixed Annuities for an emergency injunction against the DOL and Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez.In their order, D.C. Circuit judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, David Tatel and Sri Srinivasan said NAFA ""has not satisfied the stringent requirements for an injunction pending appeal.""The Justice Department had asked the court to not enjoin regulations that had been issued after six years of public comment, which the government called essential to the nation's retirement security.The department had described NAFA's accusation that the new regulations will cause irreparable harm to members of the annuities group as speculative.Critics of the new rule say it will make some retirement investment advice unaffordable by middle-income families.More lawsuits against the fiduciary rule are still pending in Texas, Kansas and Minnesota federal district courts.How President-elect Donald Trump will deal with the fiduciary rule is a wild card. Trump and his intended Labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, are seen as advocates for reduced regulatory burdens.RELATED:New, Tighter Retirement-Advice Rule Raises Industry ConcernsNew DOL Rule Forces Investors To Weight Their Options

21,IVZ,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base. Spectra Energy (SE), International Paper (IP) and Enbridge (ENB) are all four weeks into flat consolidations, which point to more possible bases maturing the week beginning October 17.Rising Optimism Among This Insurer's Clients Bode Well For Its StockCummins' Triple Threat: Dividend Growth, Cash Flow And Big Price GainsBank Stocks Have Work To Do, But Could Be Worth WatchingCisco Systems Spending $4 Billion In Mexico

22,IVZ,"Clouds are gathering over the robo-advisor industry. And the forecast should inspire investors who use robo-advisors to keep an umbrella nearby, according to a prominent observer of the robo-advisor space.Robo-advisors are finding it increasingly difficult to grow their rate of asset inflow.IBD'S TAKE: Having their own robo-advisor may be a good strategic move for asset managers, but investors should think twice before buying these stocks now. The Finance/Investment Management Group has lagged the general stock market over the past six months, ranking 119th out of 197 industries tracked by IBD. To find the groups that are leading the market now, bookmark the daily IBD Industry Themes column.And while that does not put investors' account balances in jeopardy, ""it increases the risk that some robo-advisors may have to raise prices in the coming year,"" Michael Kitces, director of wealth management for Pinnacle Advisory Group and a prominent commentator on the retirement-funding industry, told IBD.Still, even after a price hike, robo-advisors' fees may remain well below what full-service brokerages, for example, charge. On an account balance of $125,000 with a 60-40 stock-bond mix, prominent robo services like that of Charles Schwab (SCHW) levy a 0% annual robo fee plus a 0.23% average ETF expense ratio, according to investorjunkie.com. Betterment assesses a 0.15% robo fee plus a 0.15% average ETF fee. Vanguard charges a 0.30% robo fee plus a 0.09% average ETF fee. In contrast, full-service wirehouses tend to sock clients with fees of 1% to 1.5%.Asset-gathering growth rates are falling rapidly for robo-advisors, especially independent ones, Kitces says. Key robos' growth of assets under management (AUM) is just one-third of what it was one year ago, Kitces wrote on his website. Wealthfront is growing AUM at a little more than 2% annually, down from above 6%. Betterment's growth rate north of 6% is down from better than 17%.Dan Egan, Betterment's director of behavioral finance and investing, says asset growth can reflect temporary factors such as overall market run-ups or pullbacks. Robo-advisors in general and Betterment in particular, he says, remain very popular. And Betterment's AUM continues to grow in dollar terms, he adds. ""Betterment is the largest and fastest growing (robo-advisor),"" he said. ""When something gets very large, growth is harder to sustain on a percentage-wise basis.""Robos' slowing pace of AUM growth reflects high client acquisition costs and an inability to achieve economies of scale.The slowdown could force some robos to shut down or, ""more realistically, to be sold,"" Kitces told IBD. If your robo-advisor folds, you would not lose assets -- but you would have to transfer your account holdings to another asset manager, he says.""Fortunately, many of the independent robo-advisors have raised significant capital (from investors in the advisory firm itself) though. So even that prospective 'day of shutdown' (or 'forced sale') could still be a long, long ways off,"" Kitces said.""In terms of costs, though,"" he continued, ""a growth slowdown is not a good thing, especially since many (industry observers) have noted that robo-advisors don't even appear to be profitable (or financially viable) at their current pricing and volume of clients. If they can't dramatically increase the number of clients and scale,"" price hikes by robo-advisors will be more likely in the next 12 months, to avoid running out of operating capital.Egan says Betterment is not considering any such move. His shop's growth, he adds, will enable it to fund continued innovation and new services, such as January's rollout of its 401(k) plan offering.Kitces says it is unclear whether robos' root problem is that competition is crimping their ability to attract net new assets, or that they ""grossly underestimated the challenge of getting clients in a scalable manner.""The net amount of new dollars flowing into robo coffers has stayed even, he says. Robos are not taking in less money.""It's just that taking in the same money as the base gets bigger means the growth rate is falling. Getting $100 million per month when Betterment (had assets under management of) $1 billion was a 10% monthly growth rate,"" he said. ""Getting the same $100 million now when Betterment is $5 billion (in AUM) is only a 2% monthly growth rate.""Worse, Kitces cites research that says robo-advisors need tens of billions of dollars in AUM to be profitable and financially healthy. So to become and remain profitable, their asset-growth rate must rise, not decline, he says.Of 13 active robo-advisors that investorjunkie.com views as big enough to track, the only one with more than $10 billion in assets is Vanguard's, which has $31 billion in AUM. That's just a fraction of Vanguard's overall AUM, which topped $3 trillion as of Dec. 31. The next-largest is Schwab's with $8.2 billion.The slowdown in AUM growth comes as Wells Fargo (WFC), the world's largest bank by market cap, said on Wednesday that it plans to start a robo-advisory service in 2017.And yet another big player in the mutual fund industry, Legg Mason (LM), just entered the robo-advisor field with its acquisition of an 82% stake in Financial Guard, which has $454 million in AUM.Legg Mason had $718 billion in assets under management as of May 31.The move gives Legg Mason a beachhead in the robo-advisor space. Despite robo-advisors' profitability woes, they've attracted investors largely with their offering of low-cost, automated, online investment strategies, which typically make heavy use of ETFs.In contrast to independent robo-advisors, the outlook may be easier for robos that get gobbled up. Financial Guard now gets access to Legg Mason's deep pockets and distribution channels. A Legg Mason news release said, ""The transaction expands Financial Guard's access to financial institutions that serve the needs of investors.""Does the slowdown in growth make robo-advisors less crucial for asset managers to have as an option for their clients? Big mutual fund shops and other asset managers that don't have their own robo-advisor still risk losing out on a meaningful number of clients and their assets. Robo-advisors' cumulative share of assets under management by advisors of all stripes should rise to 5.6% by 2020, up from 0.5% in 2015, research firm A.T. Kearney forecasts.Legg Mason said its Financial Guard deal would help financial advisors who partner with it to grow their practices and meet the new Department of Labor (DOL) fiduciary standard, which is due to take effect in April.The DOL rule aims to prevent brokers who provide retirement plan advice from putting their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests. Brokers could meet the new standard by making use of low-cost robo-advisors, at least with some small-account clients. Otherwise, many advisors might avoid taking on small-account clients because it would not be profitable to provide them with service without charging higher fees. But by avoiding smaller accounts, an advisor would risk losing a client whose account could grow over time.Reflecting this concern, Legg Mason noted that there is about $845 billion in small IRA accounts holding less than $25,000 each at U.S. wirehouses, independent broker-dealers and regional brokers that may be impacted by the new DOL rules.""Legg Mason will offer the Financial Guard platform to firms who are looking for technology solutions to assist them in meeting expanded compliance requirements in a holistic, cost efficient way,"" the release said.The DOL deadline has helped drive a wave of acquisitions similar to the Legg Mason move in the past 18 months. BlackRock (BLK) took over FutureAdvisor last summer. Invesco (IVZ) grabbed Jemstep early this year. UBS (UBS) bought a stake in SigFig in May.Other key players in the mutual fund industry have created their own robo-advisory services:Legg Mason announced its move earlier this month.

23,IVZ,"It wasn't long ago that complex advances in investing, such as automated asset allocation, portfolio management and tax-loss harvesting, were considered high-minded concepts reserved only for the elite.Enter the robo-advisor, an automated version of the financial consultant, born in the wake of the last financial crisis. It quickly became the new norm, delivering these same services to ordinary investors for very low costs and putting them on the path to modern investing in minutes instead of days. It was another in an endless series of examples where technology leveled the playing field.As it made services more accessible, digital advice also threatened to put the squeeze on traditional financial services firms. These new robo-players gave their regards to Main Street on their way to infiltrating Wall Street, armed with algorithm-driven, web-based platforms that undercut big names such as Vanguard and BlackRock (BLK).But established players in the investment industry are striking back, flexing their own muscles in a variety of ways. Their methods are familiar -- one popular choice is buyouts, often a quick fix -- yet their arsenal is vast, ranging from white-labeling robo-advice services to building partnerships. In some cases, they're creating their own proprietary platforms.Ultimately, the robo-advisor industry is headed for a shakeout that could mean fewer upstarts and more power to established players. For investors, that means financial advisors will be more attentive to them right now as the established names vie with upstarts for accounts, but that could change after the shakeout is over and choices dwindle.""Investment industry incumbents are finally taking the digital advice threat seriously,"" analysts at research firm Corporate Insight wrote in a recent report.After years of waiting and watching, several financial heavyweights elbowed their way into the digital advice space since the beginning of 2015. Among them:BlackRock shares fell 7% Friday as the market sold off on Britain's planned exit from the EU. Schwab's stock sank 12%, Interactive 6%, Bank of America 7% and Invesco 14%.The moves into automated advice are opening up possibilities for these companies.The BlackRock-FutureAdvisor deal was particularly striking in that it expanded the reach of the robo-advisor, says influential financial blogger Michael Kitces. The world's largest investment manager announced that the acquired FutureAdvisor unit would meet the needs of banks, broker-dealers, insurers, other advisory firms and even 401(k) plans.In other words, the classic direct-to-consumer robo model pivots toward a more business-to-business model, with automated advisors integrated into a partner's web portal in some cases.According to BlackRock, the B2B approach will allow a much larger and broader segment of clients to benefit from digital advice. Industry watchers point out that it may benefit BlackRock too. See sidebar on how robo-advisors will fare in the next market meltdown.""The robo-advisor is now a distribution channel,"" Kitces wrote after the FutureAdvisor deal was announced. Asset managers are trying to pick up robo platforms to distribute their exchange traded funds, Kitces told IBD. He noted that Schwab's robo channel ""is filled primarily with Schwab ETFs,"" and its success prompted similar moves from BlackRock for its iShares ETFs, and Invesco for its PowerShares ETFs.Fourteen of the 54 ETFs on Schwab Intelligent Portfolios are Schwab ETFs. The average portfolio in the service has about 60% of assets allocated in Schwab ETFs, based on objective selection criteria including low costs, according to Charles Schwab.Recent research highlights both the successes of, and pressures on, robo-advisors.Corporate Insight has found that as of July 2015 -- the latest period for which data are available -- the 11 leading digital advice providers had $8 billion in managed account assets, a 208% jump from $2.6 billion in April 2014. Betterment, the largest independent robo-advisor, reports its assets under management have vaulted more than 300% to a current $4.8 billion since the start of 2015.However, Morningstar (MORN) estimates that robo-advisors need between $16 million and $40 billion in assets under management just to break even. The fees-per-customer robos generate far outstrip their average costs to acquire a client.Investors are increasingly comfortable in giving control of their assets to a digital portfolio manager, according to Corporate Insight.""Spearheaded by such firms as Betterment and Wealthfront that offer low-cost, online managed accounts and have significant venture capital backing, these innovative startups are creating a growing market for digital advice,"" the firm recently reported.The first robo-advisors emerged on the investing scene around 2008, in the wake of the financial crisis. They succeeded by identifying key consumer demands, especially among millennials -- the use of technology to deliver financial advice and cheap, index-based exchange traded funds to lower the costs of investing.That growing market for low-cost, online managed accounts caught the attention of traditional firms, Corporate Insight's report said.It added: ""The wealth management industry's existing clients, baby boomers, are nearing retirement. Incumbents seem aware that the next generation of young investors will have different expectations than boomers, particularly when it comes to technology and cost.""According to Vanguard Group, its new Personal Advisor Services (PAS) was a response not to a vague robo-advisor threat, but to specific client demand. The product went into testing stage three years ago and was in development even before that, a Vanguard spokesperson said.Like a robo-advisor, PAS generates client portfolios using software programs, based on responses to online questionnaires about risk tolerance, time horizon, current income and other matters.PAS, however, caters mainly to baby boomers nearing retirement rather than to millennials, and it offers an ongoing client-advisor relationship, Vanguard's Katie Hirt told IBD. The spectrum of advice spans everything from financial behavior coaching to cash flow analysis. The client and Vanguard advisor chat between two and six times a year on average.For this hybrid service, Vanguard charges a 0.30% annual fee, or $150 on the minimum portfolio balance of $50,000 -- not far removed from Betterment's annual advisory fee of 0.25% for an account of the same size.""A robo offer that's targeting a younger investor may be well suited for someone who's looking for a purely online experience and not looking to work with an advisor,"" Hirt said.At PAS, investors' assets are allocated in portfolios comprised of Vanguard mutual funds and Vanguard ETFs. Assets under management have more than doubled since PAS debuted -- from $17 billion in May 2015 to $36 billion as of March 2016.To put that achievement in context, here's a simple fact:Total assets of the 11 leading robo-advisors were $21 billion in July 2015, including both online managed accounts and paid investment advice, according to Corporate Insight.Robo-advisors initially outmaneuvered the investment industry's old guard, but their future is anything but assured, a recent Tabb Group report said.""The value of their much-needed innovation is not in question,"" wrote Marlon Weems and Alexander Tabb, analysts with the international research firm. ""The rising concern (is) that the sleeping giants they have awakened, i.e. traditional firms, have superior economies of scale and resources that will allow them to respond quickly and at a lower price.""Robo-advisors aggressively and successfully targeted millennials, whose needs will become more complex as they age, Weems and Tabb said. That raised this question: Can robo-advisors make those young investors stick as long-term clients?Weems and Tabb point out that traditional wealth managers are able to charge fees on the underlying ETFs in their portfolios. That gives these firms an edge over smaller, upstart robo-advisors. Another key issue is that millennials simply don't have much in the way of assets, at least as of now.In fact, financial blogger Kitces observes that some robos are struggling to keep growing as they face increasing competition, get buried by client acquisition costs and struggle to grow their average account size. That's why FutureAdvisor and others are agreeing to be bought out, he says.Classic robos like Betterment and Wealthfront earn a flat advisory fee regardless of which portfolio or fund a client is invested in. Kitces has argued that Schwab and BlackRock's use of proprietary products in their new robo channels, coupled with their discretion over clients' investments, could be problematic.Other industry watchers wonder if even industry leaders like Betterment and Wealthfront can remain independent in the long run.In an interview with IBD, Daniel Egan, Betterment's director of investing, said it is not the target of any big investment manager. Nor is it rattled by the ETF and mutual fund firms rushing into the digital advice business. As a fiduciary advisor, Betterment is aligned with a client's best interests, he said.""I couldn't be happier,"" Egan said. ""I love when, effectively, existing players validate our business model.""

24,IVZ,"Apprehension that Britons will vote to secede from the European Union is exerting influence great and small in disparate corners of the U.S. equity market. Here's a map to where.A YouGov poll for the Times newspaper published late Monday showed ""Leave"" at 44% and 42% for ""Remain,"" while a survey by ORB for the Daily Telegraph had ""Remain"" at 53% and ""Leave"" at 46% once ""don't knows"" were stripped out. JPMorgan published a list last month of stocks with the highest sensitivity to the Brexit outcome, and that group has been trailing the market of late.The 22 stocks on the list, which encompasses companies from PPL Corp. (PPL) to Invesco (IVZ), have lagged behind the S&P 500 by an average of 2.2 percentage points in June, with Penske Automotive Group (PAG) and PRA Health (PRAH) trailing by as much as 9.1 percentage points.To be sure, the potential impact on U.S. companies is diluted by distance, and it won't be the end of the world for these shares if Brexit goes through, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note to clients last month.""U.K. subsidiaries of U.S. companies are relatively insulated from potential disruptions"" because they ""tend to focus more on domestic end markets rather than trade or export out of the U.K."" Lakos-Bujas wrote. ""We therefore see the fallout from potential disruptions in trade agreements as less significant for their fundamentals.""Among companies with the highest revenue exposure in the U.K., there's still time to hedge risks ahead of Thursday's vote, according to Katherine Fogertey, a derivatives strategist at Goldman Sachs. ""The options market is not pricing in strong incremental downside to the stocks with the largest exposure to the region,"" she wrote in a note to clients last week. ""It is still attractive to buy puts for many stocks with high U.K. sales exposure.""Among 18 stocks with liquid options and more than 15% of sales from the U.K., the top two candidates are Penske Automotive and PPL, Fogertey wrote. She recommends buying puts of Penske as insurance related to the company's scheduled earnings on July 28 and its U.K. exposure. Similarly, for PPL, a strategy known in the options market as a straddle can be used to hedge for its earnings scheduled for July 28 and the company's large foreign-exchange exposure.Within U.S.-domiciled companies, there's a lack of consistency when reporting international sales, particularly by region. With the caveat that such reporting is ""poor,"" Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, last week compiled a list of 20 companies in the S&P 500 Index with a high proportion of foreign sales in the U.K. Topping that list are Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), Ford Motor (F), Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) and Amazon.com (AMZN).Beyond the U.S., Bloomberg has compiled an equally-weighted index of 10 stocks -- including Rolls-Royce Holdings, Barclays (BCS) and Berkeley Group Holdings -- to track British exposure to the EU across multiple industries. The Bloomberg Brexit Equity Index is down 16% in the past 12 months and is on track for its worst year of performance since 2008.Most visibly, bookmaker odds tracking prospects for the referendum's defeat have converged with the direction of the broader stock market in recent days.Odds on the U.K. remaining in the EU have fluctuated from as low as almost 63% a week ago to 79% currently, according to Oddschecker calculations based on bookmakers' quotes. That's more or less aligned directionally with fluctuations in the S&P 500 this month.

25,IVZ,"The financial services industry breathed a sigh of relief when the Department of Labor (DOL) issued its new rule last week. That rule aims to shield individual investors from retirement plan advice by brokers who put their own profits ahead of their clients' financial interests.The sigh of relief was because the DOL's new restrictions on brokers' conflicts of interest was less onerous than the industry had expected. The DOL imposed a fiduciary standard, but provided exemptions and a slower implementation timetable.Still, the industry does stand to feel a megabuck impact. The rule could fuel as much as trillions of dollars in client asset shifts -- mainly from high-cost actively managed mutual funds -- with hefty losses of fees and commissions. It will also likely impose billions of dollars in upfront and subsequent annual compliance costs.In the $23 trillion U.S. retirement market, much of that impact will be in the $7.3 trillion IRA market, says a new report by Goldman Sachs. About $5 trillion of that will not be affected by the new rule. That's because that money was already subject to the fiduciary rule or is in self-directed accounts that don't use a financial advisor's recommendations or for some other reason, Goldman says.That leaves about $2.2 trillion in mutual funds where advisor-aided buy-sell decisions could change due to the new rule. And financial firms could be hurt by the loss of sales commissions -- also known as loads -- as well as by the loss of annual fees, as shareholder investments into those accounts slow or as assets are shifted into other, lower-cost types of assets such as index funds and ETFs, Goldman says.Mutual fund front-end loads -- commission paid when the fund is bought -- range from 0.50% to 5.75% of the value of the shares purchased, Morningstar Inc. says. Deferred loads, -- paid when shares are sold -- range from 1% to 4%.The average annual expense ratio, or percent of assets paid by the shareholder to the fund manager, is 1.18%. Stock funds bear an average annual cost of 1.25%. Bond-fund shareholders pay 0.96% on average.At 1.18%, $2.2 trillion in at-risk IRA assets would generate $39.6 billion in annual fees alone.Shareholders have been shifting to no-load share classes for years, says the Investment Company Institute, an industry group.And shareholders are already voting with their wallets against what is perceived to be higher cost mutual funds. Those $2 trillion in retail mutual funds that generate brokerage commissions account for 20% of active mutual fund assets under management. That's down from a 37% share in 2007.And where are those assets going? Individual investors are not putting them under their mattresses. They're shifting them into lower-fee ETFs and index mutual funds. Boosted by this rotation, ETF assets could mushroom to $7 trillion globally by 2020, up from $2.8 trillion today, Goldman says.In addition, the industry will also be hit by compliance costs: costs of revamping procedures to comply with the new rule, costs of retraining staff. Goldman says annual compliance costs will be more than $13 billion in upfront costs and more than $7 billion in annual costs.Retail brokers, asset managers and life insurers face swirling crosswinds of benefits and financial harm as shareholders shift existing assets and shift future asset allocation strategies, Goldman warns.""We see discount brokers like SCHW, AMTD and ETFC as relative gainers, likely gaining share as FAs"" -- financial advisors -- ""seek new platforms built for a fiduciary world and smaller accounts migrate to self-directed IRAs (and/or) auto-advisors,"" a Goldman report readers, referring to publicly traded brokerages Charles Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC).""Furthermore, we believe the end result will likely be further pressure on fees, accelerating the shift to ETFs/passive (mutual funds),"" Goldman's report added, citing iShares and PowerShares parent asset managers BlackRock (BLK) and Invesco (IVZ) as likely beneficiaries. State Street (STT) and WisdomTree Investments (WETF) should also benefit.In addition, Goldman predicts that rollovers to IRAs from 401(k)s by retirees will slow. Because that process will be subject to the fiduciary rule, brokers will simply avoid it. Instead, financial advisors may advise their clients to leave assets in their 401(k) accounts. That should help a fund family like T. Rowe Price (TROW), Goldman says. T. Rowe Price does much more business running 401(k) accounts than it does as an IRA custodian, according to Morningstar analyst Greggory Warren.The largest players in the 401(k) business should gain, Goldman says. Among publicly traded companies, that includes BlackRock, State Street, Prudential Financial (PRU), Northern Trust (NTRS), Principal Financial Group (PFG) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK).T. Rowe Price and AllianceBernstein (AB) are also positioned to gain market share in the target-date fund business.Image provided by Shutterstock.

35,IVZ,"Best Mutual Funds 2015: May Performance Report
"
36,IVZ,"Volatility was the name of the game in fixed-income markets in May. But for investors who've been tracking the bond market, this was nothing new, nor is it expected to change significantly in the coming months.
"
37,IVZ,"Aside from short-term paper, high-yield and a few specialty bond mutual funds, most other sectors ended the month with negative returns as rates spiked.
"
38,IVZ,"The biggest move came from the 30-year Treasuries, whose yield gyrated from 2.66% to 3.08% to 2.88% at the end of May. The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond also rose significantly from 1.98% to 2.12%.
"
39,IVZ,"Competing Market Forces
"
40,IVZ,"""The volatility can be attributed to competing forces between (Federal Reserve Chairman Janet) Yellen's speeches and some of the domestic data we received from the economy,"" said Jennifer Vail, head of fixed-income research at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""In both of Yellen's most recent appearances, she's preparing the market for a lift-off, probably in September.""
"
41,IVZ,"Among U.S. fixed-income funds, the average ultra-short obligation fund gained 0.06% each in May, while short investment-grade debt slipped 0.11%, according to preliminary Lipper Inc. data. Year to date, those fund categories are up 0.37% and 1.04%, respectively.
"
42,IVZ,"High-yield bond funds advanced 0.32% for a year-to-date gain of 3.68%, while loan participation funds rose 0.14% in May, culminating in a 2.95% increase so far in 2015.

General muni debt funds were down 0.24%, while high-yield muni debt funds were off by 0.15%. All muni funds were up or down a fraction for the year, except for the high-yield munis, which were up 1.06%.
"
49,IVZ,"Vail expects the normalization of interest rates to be slow-paced: ""It's not going to be a traditional Fed normalization of rates.

50,IVZ,"Now, market participants are trying to gauge whether there will be just one or two rate increases in 2015. The Fed stressed again that their policy is data-dependent.

In turn, oft-mentioned providers' sites included those of BlackRock (BLK), Vanguard, Charles Schwab (SCHW) Invesco (IVZ) and State Street (STT).
"
63,IVZ,"Such preferences emerge at an important time: Especially in recent years, ETFs have been multiplying in number and growing in complexity. But though assets in ETFs have mushroomed to about $2 trillion, data show many people still are not using them. And evidently, even investing pros could use more ETF information.
"
64,IVZ,"Consider the data: According to a recently survey by Fidelity and BlackRock, the ETF industry has been growing at a record pace. Yet, only 32% of individual investors currently own ETFs in their portfolios, says the survey report. And, although the survey found 75% of advisers currently use ETFs in client portfolios, 76% of them want to learn more.
"
65,IVZ,"So what can investors expect from ETF websites? Of course, the content does vary by site. But broadly, the most popular sites offer a range of tools and information, from data points on individual funds — in providers' case, on their own ETFs — to analytical tools and instructional information, and perhaps even news coverage on ETF investing.
"
66,IVZ,"A few examples of what site users can expect:
"
67,IVZ,"To various investing pros, Morningstar — known for its star-system for ranking investments — gets kudos for its extensive data on ETFs and its ability to search for ETFs across a range of providers. Broadly, its ETF information covers everything from ETFs' performance to their portfolio composition, fees and risk ratings, says Jason Stipp, site editor of Morningstar.com. And articles on the free portion of its site cull from research on the roughly 300 ETFs that Morningstar analysts regularly track. Access to analysts' reports and certain other features requires a $199 annual subscription. In addition, for $189 a year, investors can get a subscription to the monthly newsletter, Morningstar ETFInvestor.
"
68,IVZ,"At ETF Database (ETFdb.com), some popular free features include its head-to-head comparison of two ETFs as well as its mutual fund-to-ETF converter. To investment adviser Nathan Geraci, of the ETF Store, the latter ""would be particularly useful to mutual fund investors looking to buy ETFs. You'd enter your mutual fund ticker symbol, and that tool gives you a list of ETFs with a similar exposure.""
"
69,IVZ,"Two of ETFdb.com's features highlighted by Stoyan Bojinov, editor of the site's monthly newsletter: its array of screening options for narrowing down the ETF field and its stock exposure tool. For those seeking diversification through ETFs — but who have an interest in a particular security — the stock exposure tool reveals how much of a weighting a specific stock has in an ETF. While the site offers plenty of free information, access to its premium service, ETFdb Pro, costs $199 a year.
"
70,IVZ,"Experts say ETFs' own websites have a major limitation: They don't compare their products to specific ETF peers. Nonetheless, observers say the best such sites do excel at detailing information on their own products. And increasingly today, many provide schooling on ETFs, generally.
"
71,IVZ,"One frequently cited example: iShares.com, the website of BlackRock's iShares brand of ETFs. Geared to investing pros, the site details data on BlackRock's 311 U.S. iShares and provides education on ETFs, generally. And among other features is a section on iShares resources.
"
72,IVZ,"It includes tools for comparing iShares, such as seeing the correlation between one iShare ETF and how any of these ETFs have performed historically, says Jennifer Grancio, chief marketing officer at iShares by BlackRock.
"
73,IVZ,"Increasingly, the iShares site uses videos, as well as written material. Approved registrants can even access some ETF data from Morningstar's site. And last November, the firm added a feature called iThinking. ""It displays some of BlackRock's current investing ideas and how they could be executed in a portfolio using iShares,"" says Grancio.Among the most touted independent online ETF resources: the sites of Morningstar, ETF.com and ETF Database.

In addition, for $189 a year, investors can get a subscription to the monthly newsletter, Morningstar ETFInvestor.At ETF Database (ETFdb.com), some popular free features include its head-to-head comparison of two ETFs as well as its mutual fund-to-ETF converter. To investment adviser Nathan Geraci, of the ETF Store, the latter ""would be particularly useful to mutual fund investors looking to buy ETFs. You'd enter your mutual fund ticker symbol, and that tool gives you a list of ETFs with a similar exposure.""Two of ETFdb.com's features highlighted by Stoyan Bojinov, editor of the site's monthly newsletter: its array of screening options for narrowing down the ETF field and its stock exposure tool. For those seeking diversification through ETFs — but who have an interest in a particular security — the stock exposure tool reveals how much of a weighting a specific stock has in an ETF. While the site offers plenty of free information, access to its premium service, ETFdb Pro, costs $199 a year.Experts say ETFs' own websites have a major limitation: They don't compare their products to specific ETF peers. Nonetheless, observers say the best such sites do excel at detailing information on their own products. And increasingly today, many provide schooling on ETFs, generally.One frequently cited example: iShares.com, the website of BlackRock's iShares brand of ETFs. Geared to investing pros, the site details data on BlackRock's 311 U.S. iShares and provides education on ETFs, generally. And among other features is a section on iShares resources.It includes tools for comparing iShares, such as seeing the correlation between one iShare ETF and how any of these ETFs have performed historically, says Jennifer Grancio, chief marketing officer at iShares by BlackRock.Increasingly, the iShares site uses videos, as well as written material. Approved registrants can even access some ETF data from Morningstar's site. And last November, the firm added a feature called iThinking. ""It displays some of BlackRock's current investing ideas and how they could be executed in a portfolio using iShares,"" says Grancio.

78,IVZ,"Investment manager Invesco (IVZ) is making shareholders happy on two fronts: It's delivering growth and higher dividends.On Tuesday, the Atlanta-based company said its adjusted Q1 earnings climbed 18% to 52 cents a share. That marked its best performance in seven quarters and it beat views by a nickel.Invesco's revenue rose 10% to $1.14 billion, slightly edging expectations. The company had some spotty top-line results in parts of 2011 and 2012, but has now delivered two straight quarters of double-digit sales growth.The company's assets under management (AUM) rose 8% to $729.3 billion in the first quarter from a year ago. Since the end of 2012, AUM grew 6%.Asset managers have benefited as the stock market rallied in recent months. The S&P 500 hit a record high Tuesday. During the quarter, Invesco reported record net inflows of $19.2 billion.Based on its strong results, Invesco raised its quarterly dividend by 30% to 22.5 cents a share. The new rate represents a more than 100% increase from levels in March of 2011. Invesco will pay the dividend June 7 to shareholders of record May 17.On an annual basis, Invesco pays 90 cents a share, which works out to a yield of 2.8%. Its yield is higher than that of the S&P 500, but still one of the lowest in the Finance-Investment Management group. Companies in the group run the gamut from giant investment firms to small asset managers that invest in mortgage-backed securities.Invesco cleared a 28.59 entry from a cuplike flat base on March 14, but volume was just mildly above average. Still, the stock has ridden its 10-week line higher. While Invesco is extended, investors should watch for pullbacks for a potential new entry point.

97,IVZ,"In October 2011, the Obama administration distributed a memo mandating that the U.S. Department of Defense increase the rate at which it transfers technologies to the private sector for commercialization.
"
98,IVZ,"The feds aimed to boost the economy by spurring more early-stage innovation, while also increasing licensing revenue the government gets from such transfers from the DOD's 100 research labs.
"
99,IVZ,"White House officials weren't expecting that a whole new model of technology transfer would emerge, but that is what's happened.
"
100,IVZ,"Less than a year later, the DOD inked a partnership to have an unusual private investment company — Boston-based Allied Minds — pick its most promising lab innovations, license those technologies and form companies to commercialize the resulting products.
"
101,IVZ,"""What's different with Allied Minds is that they're more or less looking at a range of technologies that have been developed here, and more holistically looking at whether some of these haven't been thought of before and can be commercialized,"" said Joe Wienand, director of Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, a DOD research lab that operates under the auspices of the U.S. Army's Research, Development and Engineering Command. ""We have not entered into an arrangement like this before.""
"
102,IVZ,"Wienand points out the relationship with Allied Minds is not exclusive. ""We'd welcome any other company offering a similar arrangement,"" he said.
"
103,IVZ,"Labs such as Edgewood had approached technology transfer agreements with a narrow tech focus, rather than the holistic strategy Allied Minds employs. Edgewood has 64 tech transfer agreements in place, Wienand says.
"
104,IVZ,"But Allied Minds CEO Chris Silva says the old strategy left a lot of great technology on the sidelines. The DOD is bringing in just $16 million a year in licensing royalties, despite investing $100 billion annually to fund its research facilities.
"
105,IVZ,"Given that technologies such as GPS, lithium-ion batteries, satellite communications and the Internet have come out of DOD labs, world-changing technologies may be waiting to be fully developed by the right private-sector partner.

"
108,IVZ,"Allied Minds acts as a tech-transfer clearinghouse. Rather than targeting specific innovations, it's being given carte blanche access to the numerous inventions springing from DOD labs.
"
109,IVZ,"So far, Allied Minds is engaged with nine DOD labs. Silva wants that up to at least 15 by year's end.
"
110,IVZ,"Eventually, he'd like to be working with all 100 DOD labs — a tall order given that this represents the research of some 50,000 scientists and engineers. Silva says he expects to eventually have to expand the 15-person company.
"
111,IVZ,"In the first couple of months of its DOD partnership, Allied Minds had created two startup companies: Allied Communications, which is melding more than a dozen DOD mobile network technologies into a spectrum-sharing platform; and Broadcast Routing Fountains, which is working with DOD methodologies to improve the security and efficiency of the Internet.
"
112,IVZ,"Both companies are subsidiaries of Allied Minds Federal Innovations, a company Allied Minds formed to serve as the umbrella for its DOD relationship.
"
113,IVZ,"Silva says his firm has raised $100 million it's prepared to invest in its DOD partnerships. Investment firm Invesco (IVZ) is one investor. Silva says he has verbal commitments for the funding that Allied Minds expects to close in Q1 or Q2 2013.
"
114,IVZ,"Silva stresses that Allied Minds is not strictly a venture capital firm. It's a full-fledged operation that identifies inventions with commercial potential, puts management in place for each of the new companies it forms, provides funding until those companies are self-sustaining, and develops and markets the resulting products.
"
115,IVZ,"In the past five years, Allied Minds has been developing its approach with universities. That model has created 20 active companies employing 220 people, says John Serafini, director of Allied Minds Federal Innovations. (Six other startups that came out of the effort have since folded.) Silva pegs the value of Allied Minds at $400 million, in cash and in the value of companies created.
"
116,IVZ,"Allied Minds fills a gap that's resulted from a change in the behavior of VC firms, says Serafini, who worked as a venture capitalist in the D.C. area, specializing in security and defense. He says VC firms have become more reluctant to take the kind of technology risks necessary to bring DOD inventions to market.
"
117,IVZ,"""We're willing to take on that science risk,"" Serafini said. ""We feel very comfortable working on a new, nascent technology that needs incubation. We know how to use investment dollars early in a company's life, to incubate it in the lab itself.""
"
118,IVZ,"Allied Minds hasn't yet started commercializing any innovations at the Edgewood facility, which develops technologies to protect against, decontaminate and analyze chemical and biological weapons. Wienand says they're mulling at least three options.
"
119,IVZ,"He says much of what's developed at the facility could be useful to police, firefighters and other first responders. An example from the recent past is a lightweight detection system that was developed by another partner and eventually sold back to the DOD for use on military missions.
"
120,IVZ,"Which gets at another goal of tech transfer at the DOD: helping Edgewood and other facilities bring their innovations to fruition for military applications.
"
121,IVZ,"Said Wienand: ""It's less expensive to let industry finish the engineering of a prototype.""In October 2011, the Obama administration distributed a memo mandating that the U.S. Department of Defense increase the rate at which it transfers technologies to the private sector for commercialization.The feds aimed to boost the economy by spurring more early-stage innovation, while also increasing licensing revenue the government gets from such transfers from the DOD's 100 research labs.White House officials weren't expecting that a whole new model of technology transfer would emerge, but that is what's happened.Less than a year later, the DOD inked a partnership to have an unusual private investment company — Boston-based Allied Minds — pick its most promising lab innovations, license those technologies and form companies to commercialize the resulting products.""What's different with Allied Minds is that they're more or less looking at a range of technologies that have been developed here, and more holistically looking at whether some of these haven't been thought of before and can be commercialized,"" said Joe Wienand, director of Edgewood Chemical Biological Center, a DOD research lab that operates under the auspices of the U.S. Army's Research, Development and Engineering Command.

122,IVZ,"The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 economic net income (ENI) of 65 cents per share, which handily surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. However, the figure was 20% below the prior-year quarter level.Shares of Blackstone have gained more than 2% in pre-market trading. It appears that investors are encouraged with its announcement of additional capital deployment action. Nonetheless, the stock’s price performance after the full day’s trading will give a better indication about investors’ sentiments.The quarter saw an improvement in assets under management (AUM), mainly driven by inflows. However, lower revenues and a rise in expenses were the undermining factors.Blackstone reported ENI of $791.7 million, down 18% year over year.Revenues & Costs DeclineTotal revenues (GAAP basis) declined 8% year over year to $1.77 billion. The decrease was mainly due to lower total investment income and incentive fees. However, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.69 billion.Total expenses (GAAP basis) rose 7% year over year to $982.9 million. The increase was primarily due to a rise in fund expenses and general, administrative and other costs.Fee-earning AUM grew 23% year over year to $334.7 billion. Total AUM amounted to $449.6 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, up 22% year over year. The rise in total AUM was largely driven by $18.2 billion of inflows.As of Mar 31, 2018, Blackstone had $5.4 billion in total cash, cash equivalents and corporate treasury investments.Capital Deployment UpdateBlackstone authorized share repurchase of up to $1 billion of common units and Blackstone Holdings partnership units. This nearly triples $335.8 million of buyback authorization left under the prior authorization.Moreover, Blackstone received approximately $580 million of pre-tax proceeds in connection with concluding GSO’s investment sub-advisory relationship with FS Investments in April. The company plans to distribute part of the proceeds to unitholders. This will likely result in an incremental 30 cents per unit to be distributed over the next three quarters.Our ViewpointBlackstone remains well positioned to capitalize on the changing investment landscape by making long-term investments and augmenting its fund-raising abilities. However, increased dependence on management and advisory fees can affect the company’s financials in the near term.The Blackstone Group L.P.

125,IVZ,"Given a solid liquidity position and steady earnings growth, Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) seems to be a good investment option now. Moreover, its widening global presence, along with broad diversification, will help it generate further momentum.Shares of the company have gained 5.1% in the past year, underperforming 24.8% growth recorded by the industry.Nevertheless, analysts seem to be optimistic about its growth prospects as evident from the upward estimate revisions. Over the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 5.8% upward. Thus, the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).In fact, given the positive estimate revisions and solid Zacks Rank, its price performance is expected to improve in the future.The various other aspects that make Invesco an attractive investment option are:Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth: In the last three to five years, Invesco witnessed EPS growth of 4.6%, driven by strong global presence and organic growth. The company’s earnings are projected to grow 14.1% and 9.2% in 2018 and 2019, respectively.Further, its long-term (three to five years) expected EPS growth of 12.1% promises reward for shareholders.Revenue Strength: Invesco’s net revenues witnessed a five-year CAGR of 2.7% (2013-2017). The company’s diverse product offerings and alternative investment strategies will continue to attract investors, which will support top-line growth in the upcoming quarters. Moreover, the top line is expected to grow nearly 12% in 2018, higher than the industry average of 7.2%. This indicates the company's superiority in generating revenues.Steady Assets Under Management (AUM) Growth: Invesco’s AUM has consistently demonstrated strong growth, aided by increasing net inflows. Over the last five years (2013-2017), total AUM witnessed a CAGR of 4.8%. The growth trajectory will likely continue to be driven by the company’s diversified products, revenue mix and growing demand for passive products and alternate asset classes.Stock Seems Undervalued: Invesco looks undervalued with respect to its price/book and price/earnings ratios. The company has a P/B ratio of 1.6, which is below the industry average of 1.8. Also, its P/E (F1) ratio, which is currently 10.8, is lower than the industry average of 11.6.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Invesco has an ROE of 13.51%, slightly better than the industry average of 13.45%. This shows that the company reinvests its cash more efficiently.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks in the same industry worth considering are Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.

132,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results tomorrow before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues and long-term inflows, partially offset by higher expenses.That said, Invesco has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.2%.Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco PLC QuoteMoreover, activities of the company in the fourth quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward.

Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 18.6%.For 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $2.67 reflects year-over-year growth of 19.7%.Factors to Influence Q4 ResultsPer the monthly metrics data published by Invesco, its preliminary assets under management (AUM) as of Dec 31, 2017 of $937.6 billion were up 2.2% from the Sep 30, 2017 level. The rise in AUM is mainly driven by favorable market returns and net long-term inflows. Thus, given the improvement in AUM in the quarter, the related fee will likely witness an increase, thereby supporting revenue growth.Management expects performance fees for the fourth quarter to be around $5–$7 million and other revenues to be in the range of $16–$17 million.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.37 billion, which is projected to witness growth of 15.1%. For 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $5.21 billion.On the cost front, management anticipates compensation expenses to increase to $370 million in the to-be reported quarter. The rise is expected to result from the Source acquisition, investments in key strategic initiatives as well as resources that are being added to meet the growth in regulatory and compliance requirements on a global basis.The company expects market expenses to be in the range of $36–$38 million owing to seasonality. Further, property, office and technology costs are expected to be in range of $92–$94 million, driven by the impact of large technology-related projects being put into service and a rise in outsourced administration expenses.The company expects G&A expenses to be in the range of $70–$73 million in fourth-quarter 2017.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Invesco will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around.

136,IVZ,"On Jan 2, we issued an updated research report on Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report). The company’s strong balance sheet position along with cost savings efforts, improving assets under management (AUM) and diverse product offerings are likely to continue supporting growth. However, high-debt level as well as amortization of goodwill and intangible assets might adversely affect its profitability in the long run.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have gained 2.3% in the past six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 14.2%.The company’s top-line growth looks impressive. Net revenues grew at a 5-year (2012–2016) CAGR of 4.6% despite witnessing a fall in 2016. The increase was primarily driven by improving AUM balance. The momentum continued in 2017 as well.Also, Invesco’s diverse product offerings and alternative investment strategies should continue attracting investors, which will support top-line growth in the quarters ahead. Given a robust institutional pipeline along with a solid retail channel, the company seems to stay on track to achieve its organic growth-rate target.Meanwhile, the company’s total AUM has been witnessing a consistent improvement. Over the last five years (2012–2016), AUM had recorded a CAGR of 5.1% with momentum continuing in 2017. Further, AUM is expected to benefit from the prevalent volatility in equity market.  The company has been capitalizing on the growing demand for passive products and alternate asset classes as well.Moreover, Invesco’s operating expenses have been witnessing a declining trend over the past few years. Although expenses increased in 2017, it has been falling at a 3-year (2014–2016) CAGR of 4.1%.The company’s effort – Business Optimization – is also likely to transform key business support functions, thereby boosting efficiency. In fact, Invesco expects costs related to these initiatives to be nearly $133 million, of which roughly $31 million will be incurred through mid-2018. It remains on track to achieve annualized run-rate savings of approximately $50 million by 2018.However, high debt level of the company could restrict it from procuring additional finance for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or other purposes. As of Sep 30, 2017, Invesco’s long-term debt amounted to $2.1 billion (nearly 7% of total assets). High-debt obligation, if combined with unfavorable economic and industry conditions, can drag the company to a relatively disadvantageous position.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other stocks worth considering from the same space are Ashford (AINC  -  Free Report) and Legg Mason (LM  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and Woori Bank (WF  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

137,IVZ,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Invesco has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.3, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 21.4. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Invesco’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number remaining more or less stable over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 16.9. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Invesco has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 13.8, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Invesco stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Invesco has a P/S ratio of about 3.0. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4 right now. As we can see in the chart below, this is just slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.As we can see, the stock is trading at its median value for the time period from a P/S metric. This does not provide us with a conclusive direction as to the relative valuation of the stock in comparison to its historical trend.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Invesco currently has a Zacks Value Style Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Invesco a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Invesco is 1.2, a level that is marginally lower than the industry average of 1.4. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, IVZ is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Invesco might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of B. This gives IVZ a Zacks VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of B. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen two estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen three upward and zero downward revisions in the same time period.As a result, the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 1.5% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has inched up by 0.4%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Invesco PLC Price and Consensus  Invesco PLC Price and Consensus | Invesco PLC QuoteThis favorable trend is why the stock has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineInvesco is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. With a good industry rank (among the Top 42%) and strong Zacks Rank, Invesco looks like a strong value contender. In fact, over the past two years, the industry has outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

146,IVZ,"Investment management (part of the broader Finance sector) performed decently over the last several quarters. This time too, decent results are expected on positive markets, favorable currencies and better-than-expected flows.The S&P 500 Index recorded a total return of 3.1% in the second quarter. Though the U.S. equity market recorded positive returns amid mixed economic data, it underperformed both non-U.S. developed and emerging markets. Hence, asset managers with global presence are anticipated to record a rise in equity asset under management (AUM). Moreover, weakness of the U.S. dollar drove the global diversified AUM mix. Further, rising interest rates are expected to lead to decline in fee waivers. Also, demand for alternative investment sources might have aided revenue growth for the investment managers. However, rise in operating expenses, driven by marketing and investments might hurt the bottom line.Conversely, during the quarter, fixed income generated positive returns as investors ran for safe haven assets. Consequently, fixed income prices increased and resulted in reduced yields.Notably, some investment managers, including The Blackstone Group L.P. (BX  -  Free Report), T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. (TROW  -  Free Report) and BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report), have already released their results. Out of these, Blackstone Group and BlackRock have missed estimates despite recording AUM growth, while T. Rowe Price beat estimates.Notably, per our Earnings Preview report, overall earnings for the Investment managers in second-quarter 2017 are expected to be up 6.7%.Let’s take a look at the three major investment management stocks that are scheduled to release their results on Jul 27.Federated Investors, Inc. (FII  -  Free Report) is set to announce its results after the market closes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents for the company for the upcoming release indicates a year-over-year decline of about 6.29%. However, Federated’s activities during the quarter were enough to win analysts’ confidence, as is evident from two positive revisions in earnings estimates (versus one negative revision) over the last 30 days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the same time frame.Moreover, our proven quantitative model does not conclusively predict a likely earnings beat. The company has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Federated recorded positive earnings surprises in all the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.71%, as shown in the chart below:Federated Investors, Inc.

(PFG  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results, after the market closes. The company has a Zacks Rank #3, with an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. Principal Financial is likely to witness AUM growth in the to-be-reported quarter, primarily backed by strong performances at the asset management and asset accumulation segments. Furthermore, the company is likely to experience improvement in revenues on the back of its fee-based model. In addition, the company’s investment results are likely to improve due to a rising interest-rate environment.Nonetheless, escalating expenses might impact margin expansion (read more: Can Principal Financial Q2 Earnings Pull a Surprise?).Meanwhile, Principal Financial has a positive average surprise of 7.54% for the trailing four quarters, having outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the four quarters as demonstrated in the chart below:Principal Financial Group Inc Price and EPS Surprise Principal Financial Group Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Principal Financial Group Inc QuoteInvesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release results, before the market opens. Expenses are likely to increase. Management expects property, office and technology expenses to increase to $88 million, owing to the large, technology-related projects, which would come into service, including investments around data and cyber security. On the revenue front, management estimates performance fees to be around $5–$7 million, down year over year (read more: Invesco to Report Q2 Earnings: What's in the Cards?).With respect to the surprise trend, Invesco posted positive surprises in three of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 3.16%, as shown in the chart below:Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco PLC QuoteIrrespective of an earnings beat or miss, investors should focus on companies’ fundamentals to make investment decisions.

147,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Improvement in assets under management (AUM) was another positive.Invesco has a decent earnings surprise history, with the company surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.2%.These earnings beats supported a 19.6% year-to-date rally of the stock, marginally outperforming the 19.1% growth of the industry it belongs to.Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco PLC QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q2 earnings? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with an earnings beat and improved financials.Our proven model cannot conclusively predict if Invesco will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Invesco is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 61 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Invesco’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive Earnings ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q2 ResultsInvesco’s expenses in the quarter are likely to increase. Management expects property, office and technology expenses to increase to $88 million, owing to the large, technology-related projects that would come into service, including investments around data and cyber security.On the revenue front, management expects performance fees to be around $5–$7 million, down year over year.Because of continued pressure on short-dated equity UITs as a result of the early adoption of Department of Labor (DOL) rules and a structural change in the pricing of real estate products, other revenues are also expected to fall.However, Invesco’s activities during the quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased 1.7% over the last 30 days to 61 cents.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few finance stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around.Banc of California, Inc. (BANC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release results on Jul 26. It has an Earnings ESP of +8.33% and a Zacks Rank #3.Hilltop Holdings Inc.

148,IVZ,"BlackRock, Inc. (BLK  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $5.24 per share, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.39. However, the bottom line came in 10% higher than the year-ago quarter.Lower-than-expected results were primarily due to a rise in operating expenses and lower investment advisory performance fees. However, increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, along with growth in assets under management (AUM) acted as tailwinds.Net income (on a GAAP basis) came in at $857 million, up 9% from the prior-year quarter.Revenue Growth Offsets Rise in ExpensesRevenues (GAAP basis) increased 6% year over year to $2.97 billion. The rise was due to increase in investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenues, and technology and risk management revenues. The reported figure was in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Total expenses amounted to $1.72 billion, up 6% year over year. This was due to a rise in all cost components except amortization of deferred sales commissions and stable amortization of intangible assets, which witnessed a fall.Non-operating income (on a GAAP basis) came in at $1 million as against Non-operating expense $25 million in the year-ago quarter.BlackRock’s adjusted operating income came in at $1.25 billion, up 6% year over year.Strong AUM & InflowsAs of Jun 30, 2017, AUM totaled $5.7 trillion, up 16% year over year. Further, during the reported quarter, the company witnessed long-term net inflows of $94.5 billion.Share RepurchasesDuring the quarter, BlackRock repurchased shares worth $275 million.Our ViewpointBlackRock remains well poised for opportunistic acquisitions, supported by a strong liquidity position. Moreover, its initiatives to gain market share in the ETF business are expected to drive revenue growth in the future. However, increased dependence on overseas revenues and regulatory restrictions remain primary near-term concerns.BlackRock, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  BlackRock, Inc.

157,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) recently announced that it has acquired the leading U.K.-based advisor-focused digital solutions firm, Intelliflo from HG Capital Trust. The financial terms of the deal, not expected to have any material impact on the company’s earnings, were kept under wraps.Invesco’s plan to resume share repurchase by this year-end, following the reduction in its debt leverage, will not be impacted by this acquisition.Why Intelliflo?Martin L. Flanagan, President and CEO of Invesco said, “We fully recognize that digital solutions are increasingly important as we seek to improve the support we provide for advisors to help them and their clients achieve their desired investment outcomes.”The U.K. operations continue to remain in focus for Invesco. Intelliflo, being the top technology platform for financial advisors in the country, was an obvious choice.Notably, Intelliflo supports nearly 19,000 investment advisors who manage more than £300 billion of assets on behalf of their clients. Also, the company’s revenues have witnessed a CAGR of 19% in the past three years.Further, Intelliflo's Intelligent Office (""iO"") software platform is the mainstay of the U.K. wealth management sector. iO operates from a single instance, multi-tenant SaaS platform, which aids integration and connectivity, high scalability and rapid functionality development.Going ForwardThe use of technology is the need of the day.Invesco’s efforts to increase the use of technology to help clients is not new. In 2016, the company had acquired Jemstep, a Silicon Valley-based provider of advisor-focused digital solutions. This deal supported the company’s advisors with the advanced and flexible tools, helping to deliver professional advice to their clients online.Now, Invesco expects the acquisition of Intelliflo to do the same in the U.K. market. Colin Meadows, Senior Managing Director and Chief Administrative Officer for Invesco said, “We look forward to seeing what Intelliflo can achieve for UK advisors with increased product investment.”Thus, these initiatives are expected to support Invesco’s growth prospects. However, high-debt levels and mounting expense level remain major concerns for the company in the near term.The stock has lost 23.8% so far this year compared with 3.4% decline for the industry it belongs to. Currently, Invesco carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks Worth ConsideringSome stocks in the same industry worth a look are Lazard Ltd (LAZ  -  Free Report), Prospect Capital Corporation (PSEC  -  Free Report) and Noah Holdings Limited (NOAH  -  Free Report).

158,IVZ,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.2% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IVZ due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Invesco Q1 Earnings In Line, Revenues & AUM Rise Y/YInvesco reported first-quarter 2018 adjusted earnings of 67 cents per share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure was 9.8% above the prior-year quarter level.Results were primarily supported by higher revenues and long-term net inflows. Further, the company reported a rise in assets under management. However, increase in operating expenses was an undermining factor.On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to common shareholders came in at $253.9 million or 62 cents per share, up from $212 million or 52 cents per share a year ago.Revenues & Expenses RiseGAAP operating revenues for the quarter were $1.36 billion, up 13.7% year over year. The figure marginally lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 billion. Adjusted net revenues increased 10.5% year over year to $958 million.Adjusted operating expenses were $600.7 million, up 11.1% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was due to an increase in all expense components except employee compensation costs.Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 37.3% compared with 37.6% a year ago.Strong AUMAs of Mar 31, 2018, AUM was $934.2 billion, up 11.9% year over year. Average AUM for the reported quarter totaled $951.3 billion, up 14.6% from the year-ago quarter. Further, the reported quarter witnessed long-term net inflows of $0.3 billion.OutlookThe company expects to witness organic growth rate of 3% to 5% in the near future, driven by better flow consistency and business diversification.Management expects net revenue yield (excluding performance fees) in 2018 to be nearly 40 bps (1 bps lower than the previous guidance). This will be attributable to the acquisition of ETF business (Source and Guggenheim), which will be dilutive to the net revenue yield by 1.5 bps. These will be partially offset by improving foreign exchange rates and sales mix trends.Moreover, in 2018, performance fees are projected to be around $10-$15 million per quarter and adjusted other revenues to be in the range of $16-$17 million on a quarterly basis.On the cost front, management expects compensation expenses to be roughly $400-$405 million per quarter in 2018.On a quarterly basis in 2018, the company expects market expenses to be nearly $32 million, property, office and technology costs to be in range of $102-$104 million and G&A expenses to be in the range of nearly $76-$79 million.Based on the above-mentioned guidance and expecting flat markets and foreign exchange, management expects incremental margin target for 2018 at the 40% to 50% level. For 2019 and beyond, the company anticipates incremental margin to be in the 50% to 65% level, mainly driven by revenue growth.Management expects effective tax rate in 2018 to be 20-21%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter.Invesco Ltd. Price and Consensus  Invesco Ltd. Price and Consensus | Invesco Ltd. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, IVZ has a poor Growth Score of F. Its Momentum is doing a lot better with a C. The stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the second quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for value investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. It's no surprise IVZ has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). We expect a below average return from the stock in the next few months.

159,IVZ,"The Finance sector, which has been in the spotlight since the U.S. Presidential elections in November 2016, reported impressive first-quarter 2018 results. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the S&P 500 finance stocks recorded 24.7% year-over-year earnings improvement. This was mainly driven by favorable macroeconomic factors, higher interest rates, decent loan and deposit growth, and lower tax rates.So far this year, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF  -  Free Report), which tracks the overall S&P Financial Select Sector Index, is up nearly 1.2%. The bullish trend is expected to continue, going forward.Performance of finance sector is directly related to the healthy of the economy. Per the ‘advance’ estimate released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, real GDP increased 2.3% in first-quarter 2018. Driven by this favorable backdrop, performance of finance sector stocks will likely improve further as the U.S. economy continues to gain strength.Additionally, the Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance will support the stocks’ financials. Barring REITs, the other components of the Finance sector — banks, brokerage firms, asset managers and insurers — benefit from higher rates. The steeper yield curve helps the financial stocks to improve revenues.Moreover, as the bill on rolling back of the 2010 Dodd-Frank legislation is expected to become a law soon, finance stocks are expected to reap benefits. The bill is aimed at lowering compliance costs and hence will help boost profitability.Apart from these, the new tax legislation will lower effective tax rates for almost all finance sector stocks. This will, thus, enable them to earn more profit. Reduced tax rates are expected to provide further stimulus to the economy, therefore indirectly to the finance sector.Despite these positive factors, there are quite a few finance stocks that are not expected to perform well, mostly owing to some fundamental weaknesses. So, one should reassess portfolio holdings in the light of the present environment and dump the worst performing stocks right away.5 Finance Sector Stocks to AvoidSelecting stocks to dump could be a bit tricky. However, with the assistance of the Zacks Stock Screener, one can locate stocks with a red flag.One could begin by selecting stocks that have lost more than 5% value year to date. Further, stocks that witnessed downward estimate revisions (over the past four weeks) for the current year are likely to plunge the most and should be dumped.Additionally, these stocks have a market cap of $3 billion or more. Under no circumstances one should buy a stock with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) coupled with a VGM Score of D or F.(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.)Here are the five finance stocks that should be avoided now:Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report), headquartered in Atlanta, GA, is an investment management company. This Zacks Rank #4 stock, which has a VGM Score of D, has plunged 21.9% year to date. Further, the company’s current-year earnings estimates have been revised 5% downward over the last 30 days.New York Community Bancorp, Inc.

166,IVZ,"The Zacks investment management industry, part of the broader Finance sector, performed decently over the past several quarters. However, the trend seems to have picked up pace to some extent in the first quarter on the back of improved domestic growth environment.The companies that have reported first-quarter 2018 earnings so far witnessed growth in their trading revenues due to increased volatility in the quarter. However, dismal overall investment banking activities remained a drag.The Investment managers’ earnings are expected to get support from rising interest rates and lower tax. Also, the quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety on uncertainty over the number of rate hikes on upbeat economic numbers and rising inflation, along with President Trump’s trade-tariff announcements on Chinese imports. This led to increased volatility, which indicates higher trading activities and increased trading revenues.Apart from this, the global M&A activity increased in the quarter. Per the Thomson Reuters data, the total deal value of announced M&As globally rose during the quarter. Also, strong equity issuances globally might have gotten a boost from IPOs and follow-on offerings. Hence, the related fees are projected to increase.However, debt underwriting remained disappointing as rising rates limit corporates’ involvement in  these activities. Thus, overall investment banking income is likely to witness a decline. Also, increased spending in technology is expected to keep costs up, in turn, hurting the investment managers’ bottom line.Per the latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the finance sector are expected to grow 27% year over year on revenue growth of 5.4%.Now, let’s take a look at some of the investment management stocks that are scheduled to announce first-quarter results on Apr 26.Franklin Resources (BEN  -  Free Report) is slated to report before the opening bell. The company is likely to record a fall in assets under management (AUM) in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total AUM is expected to decline 1.2% year over year to $745 million.Thus, due to decrease in AUM and lower sales and distribution fees (the Zacks Consensus Estimate is $417 million, reflecting a fall of 3.2% from the prior-year quarter), Franklin’s revenues are likely to decline. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $1.6 billion indicates a year-over-year increase of 0.86%.However, earnings are projected to rise year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents indicates a 1.35% jump from the year-ago quarter.(Read more: Will Lower AUM Drag Down Franklin's Earnings in Q2?)You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) stock has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average positive surprise of 8.34% in the trailing four quarters.Franklin Resources, Inc.

167,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results tomorrow before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues and long-term inflows, partially offset by higher expenses.Moreover, Invesco has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.4%.Invesco Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise  Invesco Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco Ltd. QuoteHowever, activities of the company in the first quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 67 cents decreased 2.9% over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 9.8%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.37 billion, which reflects growth of 14.6% year over year.Invesco’s price performance does not seem very impressive. Its shares have lost 20.2% in the last three months compared with 14.8% decline of the industry.Will the price performance improve post Q1 earnings? Before having a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to impact the quarter’s results.Factors to Influence Q1 ResultsPer the monthly metrics data published by Invesco, its preliminary assets under management (AUM) of $934.2 billion as of Mar 31, 2018, were marginally down from $937.6 billion as of Dec 31, 2017. The fall in AUM was mainly due to unfavorable market returns and net long-term outflows. Given the decline in AUM in the quarter, the related fee is also not expected to witness improvement.In fact, management expects performance fees for the first quarter to be around $10-$15 million, down from $43 million reported in the prior quarter. Adjusted other revenues are expected to be $16-$17 million.On the cost front, management anticipates compensation expenses to increase sequentially to nearly $410-$415 million in the to-be-reported quarter. The quarter’s results are expected to include the seasonality of payroll taxes, one-month impact from the base salary increases and the impact of higher foreign exchange.The company expects market expenses to be nearly $32 million in the first quarter. Further, property, office and technology costs are expected to be $102-$104 million, stable sequentially.The company expects G&A expenses to be $80-$83 million in first-quarter 2018.Earnings WhispersAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Invesco beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the first quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Invesco is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: Invesco has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further decreases the predictive power of ESP.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks that you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.SVB Financial Group (SIVB  -  Free Report) is slated to release results on Apr 26.

Also, the figure was 37% above the year-ago quarter level.Results benefited from an improvement in revenues. Also, growth in assets under management (AUM) and assets under administration (AUA) supported the earnings. However, a rise in expenses was an undermining factor.After taking into consideration several significant items, net income came in at $594 million or $3.91 per share, up from $403 million or $2.52 per share in the prior-year quarter.Revenues and Costs RiseNet revenues (on a GAAP basis) were $3.17 billion for the quarter, reflecting 8% increase from the year-ago quarter.

The dividend will be paid on May 18 to shareholders on record as of May 7.In the reported quarter, Ameriprise repurchased 2.4 million shares for $387 million.Our TakeAlthough the company has been taking initiatives to strengthen expense management, advertising campaign and technology upgrades are likely to keep expenses elevated in the near term. Also, outflows in the company's Asset Management segment continue to be a major near-term concern. However, its efforts toward modifying its product and service-offering capacity are expected to support top-line growth in the quarters ahead.Ameriprise Financial, Inc.

172,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) has been facing setbacks of late with its shares gaining only 4.5% over the past six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 13.9%. So what’s the reason for investors' apathy toward this stock?Elevated expense levels remain a major concern for Invesco. After recording a fall in 2015 and 2016, operating expenses increased in 2017. While the company’s initiative — Business Optimization — will boost efficiency, expenses are expected to continue increasing due to its inorganic growth efforts and investment in franchise.Additionally, Invesco’s high debt burden remains a headwind. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company’s long-term debt amounted to $2.1 billion (nearly 7% of total assets). It has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.77 compared with the industry average of 0.12. The high debt obligation might drag it to a relatively disadvantageous position.Further, Invesco has lately been witnessing downward revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $3.08 for 2018 declined marginally over the last 30 days. For 2019, it remained stable at $3.37 over the same time frame.The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an unimpressive VGM Score of C. Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) offer the best upside potential.

173,IVZ,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report). Shareshave lost about 11.7% in the past month, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is IVZ due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Invesco Beats Q4 Earnings as Revenues and AUM RiseInvesco reported fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of 73 cents per share, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 70 cents. Also, the bottom line came in 23.7% higher than the prior-year quarter.Results were primarily supported by higher revenues and long-term net inflows. Further, the company reported a rise in assets under management (AUM). However, increase in operating expenses was an undermining factor.On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to common shareholders came in at $408.2 million or 99 cents per share, up from $226.5 million or 55 cents per share a year ago.For 2017, adjusted earnings per share of $2.70 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.67 and were up 21.1% year over year. On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to common shareholders was $1.13 billion, up 32% from last year.Revenues Rise Modestly, Expenses UpGAAP operating revenues for the quarter were $1.38 billion, up 15.1% year over year. The figure marginally topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.37 billion. Adjusted net revenues increased 16.3% year over year to $1 billion.For 2017, GAAP operating revenues for the quarter were $5.16 billion, up 9% year over year but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.21 billion. Adjusted net revenues grew 10.7% year over year to $3.75 billion.Adjusted operating expenses were $605.7 million, up 14.8% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was due to an increase in all expense components.Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 39.7% compared with 38.9% a year ago.Strong AUMAs of Dec 31, 2017, AUM grew 15.3% year over year to $937.6 billion. Average AUM for the reported quarter totaled $930.3 billion, up 15% from the year-ago quarter. Further, the reported quarter witnessed long-term net inflows of $4.4 billion.OutlookThe company expects to witness an organic growth rate of 3% to 5% in the near future, driven by better flow consistency and business diversification.Management expects net revenue yield (excluding performance fees) in 2018 to decline 0.5 basis points (bps) year over year to nearly 41 bps. This will be attributable to the acquisition of ETF business (Source and Guggenheim), which will be dilutive to the net revenue yield by 1.5 bps. These will be partially offset by improving foreign exchange rates and sales mix trends.Moreover, in 2018, performance fees are projected to be around $10-$15 million per quarter and adjusted other revenues to be in the range of $16-$17 million on a quarterly basis.On the cost front, management expects compensation expenses to be roughly $410-$415 million per quarter. First-quarter 2018 will include the seasonality of payroll taxes, one-month impact from the base salary increases and the impact of higher foreign exchange. Notably, seasonal taxes will then drop in the second quarter, but will include expenses related to the Guggenheim ETF business and variable compensation.On a quarterly basis in 2018, the company expects market expenses to be nearly $32 million, property, office and technology costs to be in range of $102-$104 million (on par with the fourth- quarter 2017 level) and G&A expenses to be in the range of $80-$83 million.Based on the above-mentioned guidance and expecting flat markets and foreign exchange, management expects incremental margin target for 2018 at the 40% to 50% level. For 2019 and beyond, the company anticipates incremental margin to be in the 50% to 65% level, mainly driven by revenue growth.Management expects effective tax rate in 2018 to be 20-21%. How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates.

Also, the bottom line was 47% above the prior-year quarter’s tally.Higher revenues and growth in assets under management (AUM) supported the results.

Also, the top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $417 million.Total expenses increased 14% from the prior-year quarter to $285.6 million, largely due to higher compensation and related costs, fund-related expenses and distribution expenses.Total operating income jumped 25% year over year to $135.8 million.Liquidity Position Strong, AUM ImprovesAs of Jan 31, 2018, Eaton Vance had $533.3 million in cash and cash equivalents compared with $610.6 million as of Oct 31, 2016. Further, the company had no borrowings outstanding against its new $300 million credit facility.Eaton Vance’s consolidated AUM increased 24% from the year-ago quarter to $449.2 billion, reflecting net inflows of $37.1 billion and a market price appreciation of $48.4 billion.Share RepurchaseDuring the reported quarter, Eaton Vance repurchased nearly 0.7 million shares of its Non-Voting Common Stock for $36.3 million under its existing repurchase authorization.Our ViewpointEaton Vance’s improving AUM along with revenue rise are likely to support its growth in the quarters ahead. However, rising expenses remain a major headwind.Performance of Other Investment ManagersBlackRock, Inc.’s (BLK  -  Free Report) fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings of $6.24 per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.08.

177,IVZ,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Invesco plc (IVZ  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 5.5% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout?

Also, the bottom line came in 18.3% higher than the prior-year quarter.Results were primarily supported by higher revenues and long-term net inflows. Further, the company reported a rise in assets under management. However, increase in operating expenses acted as a headwind.On a GAAP basis, net income attributable to common shareholders came in at $267.5 million or 65 cents per share, up from $241.2 million or 58 cents per share a year ago.Rise in Revenues More Than Offsets Higher CostsGAAP operating revenues for the quarter were $1.34 billion, up 11.3% year over year.

Adjusted net revenues increased 14.3% year over year to $976.6 million.Adjusted operating expenses were $579.2 million, up 12.4% from the prior-year quarter. The rise was due to an increase in all expense components.Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 40.7% compared with 39.7% a year ago.Strong AUMAs of Sep 30, 2017, AUM grew 11.9% year over year to $917.5 billion.

178,IVZ,"AllianceBernstein Holding L.P. (AB  -  Free Report) and Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) have market capitalization of $2.4 billion and $14.2 billion, respectively. These publicly-owned investment managers operate from the same region and are influenced by similar economic conditions. The Zacks Industry Rank is #56 (top 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries) for the industry to which these companies belong. Our back-testing shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.  The industry benefits from a stabilizing economy and improving interest rate scenario. In terms of price performance, AllianceBernstein’s shares have gained 10.1% in the past year, while Invesco’s shares have rallied 12.5%. Though both asset managers have similar business trends, thorough research of their financials will help pick the winner. AllianceBernstein AllianceBernstein has a trailing 12-month Return on Equity (ROE) of 13.7% compared with the industry average of 12.9%. This shows that the company reinvests earnings more efficiently. Further, the stock is undervalued with respect to its price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratios. It has a P/E ratio of 12.21 compared with the industry average of 13.35. Also, the company’s P/B of 1.67 is below the industry average of 1.78. Additionally, AllianceBernstein’s debt/equity ratio is 0.00 compared with the industry’s average of 0.09, which implies no debt burden. It highlights the financial strength of the company in an unstable economic environment. Moreover, the company’s earnings for the current year are projected to be up 11.1%, while sales are likely to rise 6.8%. Analysts are optimistic about the stock’s earnings prospects. Over the last 30 days, AllianceBernstein has witnessed two upward revisions (against no downward revisions) for 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved up about 1% to $2.10 for the current year. AllianceBernstein has a Value Score of A and VGM Score of A. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score and/or VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2, offer the best upside potential. Invesco Invesco has a trailing 12-month ROE of 13% compared with the industry average of 12.9%. This suggests that the company is efficient in reinvesting its earnings. However, its debt/equity ratio of 0.75 is higher than the industry average of 0.09. This reflects that the company has a relatively higher debt burden and will not be financially stable during turbulent economic conditions.Nonetheless, the stock looks undervalued with respect to its P/B ratio of 1.69 compared with the industry average of 1.78. Additionally, the company’s current-year earnings are projected to rise 19.1%, while sales are estimated to increase around 10%. Also, analysts seem optimistic about the stock’s financial performance. For the current year, it witnessed eight upward revisions (against no downward revision) in the past month. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has climbed 2.3% to $2.66. Invesco currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. Also, it has a Value Score of B and a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our Take Both AllianceBernstein and Invesco are undervalued shares and are well positioned in terms of ROE, Zacks Rank, VGM and Value Score. Though Invesco has better sales and earnings growth potential, no debt burden and more reinvestment potential make AllianceBernstein a better pick. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

179,IVZ,"Riot Blockchain (RIOT  -  Free Report) briefly gained more than 15% in morning trading Tuesday, extending the stock’s strong run and lifting it to a new 52-week high. Shares quickly fell from that peak, but the former biotech equipment company, which now focuses on buying cryptocurrency and blockchain businesses, have still soared nearly 50% in the past five days.If you are feeling left out of the fun—or if you are thinking ‘What the heck is a Riot Blockchain?’—don’t worry, you are not alone. The company has exploded into popularity on investing social media forums only recently, and for many, Riot’s business model is still relatively unclear.Let’s start with what we do know. On Wednesday, Oct. 4, a small firm focused on manufacturing biotech diagnostic machinery, Bioptix Inc., changed its name to “Riot Blockchain Inc.” in the hopes of more accurately representing its new focus.Based in Castle Rock, Colorado, Bioptix found itself in dire straits recently. The company was once known as Venaxis Inc., but it changed its name after buying out BiOptix Diagnostics Inc. in 2016. According to company management, that acquisition turned out to be a mistake.“When I got on the board, they had made an acquisition that we decided as a board did not make sense, so we closed that down and then decided to change our focus,” Riot Blockchain CEO Michael Beeghley told Bloomberg last month. “We looked at the sector and said, ‘How can we participate in this, and how can our shareholders participate in this very exciting industry that’s like the beginning of the internet?’”But what exactly is this exciting new industry that Beeghley speaks of? We know that Riot’s new focus is to invest in companies that utilize blockchain technology or engage in the cryptocurrency business, but what does that even mean?Let’s define some key terms here. First up, the word “cryptocurrency” refers to any form of digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions, verify transfers, and control the creation of new units.A blockchain is basically a continuously-growing record book that uses cryptography to link and secure individual records, which are called “blocks.” By now, you have likely heard of bitcoin, the world’s most popular cryptocurrency. Bitcoin helped revolutionize digital currency because it utilized blockchain as the public ledger for its transactions.According to Riot Blockchain’s official website, the company has launched its own bitcoin mining operation and intends to “gain exposure to the blockchain ecosystem through targeted investments in the sector, with a primary focus on the bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains.”Riot’s first move under the new name was to invest in Coinsquare Ltd., a Canadian company that operates an online cryptocurrency exchange. Riot also boasts stakes in Tesspay, a blockchain-based escrow service for wholesale telecom carriers, as well as Verady, a cryptocurrency accounting service.In the near term, Riot Blockchain will face questions related to debt and revenue. The sale of the company’s Bioptix assets might have generated some cash, but after a problematic acquisition and a minimal revenue year, Riot is likely deep in the red.Nevertheless, management has already made some attempts to answer its critics. On Tuesday, Riot announced that it appointed Frank M. Bishop, a former top executive at Invesco (IVZ  -  Free Report), to its advisory board.Bishop’s experience at one of the world’s largest investment management companies should be valuable, and his appointment could add legitimacy to Riot’s new business direction. Still, with share prices skyrocketing, investors will want to see results fast.Want more stock market analysis from this author?

180,IVZ,"Eaton Vance Corp. (EV  -  Free Report) is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 (ended Oct 31) results tomorrow, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to improve year over year.The company is expected to benefit from increase in revenues supported by its strategic initiatives and a rise in assets under management (AUM). However, higher expenses will likely offset the positives to some extent. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter’s earnings is 71 cents, up 24.2% year over year.Last quarter, Eaton Vance’s adjusted earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily hurt by a rise in expenses.Also, Eaton Vance does not boast an impressive earning surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate only once in the trailing four quarters. Thus, the company came up with an average negative surprise of 4.4%.Eaton Vance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Eaton Vance Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Eaton Vance Corporation QuoteFurther, the company’s shares have rallied 23.7% so far this year, underperforming the industry’s growth of 25.2%. Will the stock’s price performance improve post fiscal fourth-quarter earnings release? Let’s see how things are shaping up.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model indicates that chances of Eaton Vance beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate is high as it has right combination of two key ingredients — positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Eaton Vance is +0.99%.Zacks Rank: Eaton Vance has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors at PlayOn the revenue front, Eaton Vance is likely to gain from the continued improvement in the global equity markets. Also, AUM is projected witness an improvement during the quarter. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company reported a 3.4% rise in AUM from the Jul 31, 2017 level.However, pressure on average effective fee rates is likely to hurt growth in investment advisory and administrative fees. Nonetheless, the top line is likely to witness improvement if outflows from higher fee strategies decrease. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues shows 18.1% increase from the prior-year quarter.On the expense front, Eaton Vance’s NextShares initiative is likely to lead a slight rise in costs during the quarter. Also, the company’s plan to launch new fund products in the United States might result in higher marketing expenses.Also, non-compensation costs are likely to rise due to higher distribution expenses and fund-related costs. Hence, overall expenses are expected to trend higher in the quarter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookSome other stocks in the same space worth considering are Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (AMP  -  Free Report), Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) and SEI Investments Co. (SEIC  -  Free Report). All the stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2.

182,IVZ,"Amid cyclical movements in the asset management industry, asset managers are striving for growth through different avenues. Recently, New York-based WisdomTree Investments, Inc. (WETF  -  Free Report), an exchange-traded fund (ETF) and exchange-traded product (ETP) sponsor and asset manager, entered into a stock-cash acquisition deal with ETF Securities. Under this deal, WisdomTree will acquire $17.6 billion worth European exchange-traded commodity, currency and short-and-leveraged business (the ""Acquired Business"") for about $611 million.The combined entity will form the ninth largest ETF provider in the world with significant presence in the two largest markets — Europe and the United States. The deal is likely to close by first-quarter 2018, subject to certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.ETFs are one of the fastest-growing products in the asset management industry. These allow investors the ease of trading the entire portfolio of stocks against trading only one stock. ETFs are often constructed to track a broad market index, which can be done at quite a low cost.Terms & Benefits of the DealOn entering into the agreement, WisdomTree has expanded its foothold in Europe, acquiring the leading position in the European-listed gold and commodity products industry. Further, diversified AUM internationally and increased profitability at WisdomTree Europe and its International Operating segment will serve as tailwinds.Further, on completion of the Acquired Business’ acquisition, as of Nov 9, 2017, WisdomTree’s assets under management would total nearly $66 billion internationally, on a pro-forma basis.Per the deal, WisdomTree will pay $253 million in cash and 30 million shares for the Acquired Business. Cash portion includes $200 million of newly issued debt and $53 million of cash in hand.Moreover, the dividend will be reduced to 3 cents per quarter from 8 cents, following the transaction. Though the acquisition is likely to be accretive to earnings per share immediately on completion, excluding one-time transaction and integration costs, the above-mentioned deal might face near-term headwinds on dividend reduction and increasing debt burden.""We are very excited to meaningfully expand and enhance our presence and capabilities in the European market by adding ETF Securities` market-leading commodity platform to WisdomTree`s differentiated European product offering,"" said Jonathan Steinberg — WisdomTree CEO and president. ""The acquisition will immediately add scale, diversification and profitability to our business in Europe, the second largest ETF market in the world and a growing and strategically important region for us and the entire industry. The addition of this complementary and competitively positioned commodity business is an important development in WisdomTree`s strategy to establish itself as a differentiated and diversified ETP provider that can thrive globally and generate long-term shareholder value,"" Steinberg further noted.Similar Moves by Other Asset ManagersInvesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) acquired the ETF business of Guggenheim Partners LLC and London-based ETF provider — Source — in 2017. Further, Franklin Resources Inc.’s (BEN  -  Free Report) Franklin Templeton is on the verge of developing a new ETF strategy for which operations have been rolled out in Canada and Europe.Bottom LineWe believe the latest acquisition is a befitting one that will likely support the future prospects of WisdomTree, which remains focused on executing strategic growth initiatives, including expansion of distribution capabilities, investment in technology, launch of innovative products, as well as addition of personnel. However, the asset manager has significant exposure to internationally-hedged products, particularly major currency-hedged funds — HEDJ and DXJ — which are highly unstable and might act as headwinds.Notably, the company's share price rose nearly 18.7% over the last six months as compared with 11.2% growth recorded by the industry.Currently, WisdomTree carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.A better-ranked company is TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (AMTD  -  Free Report), which has been witnessing upward estimate revisions for the past month.

188,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26 before the market opens. Its revenues and earnings are projected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were primarily driven by an increase in revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. Improvement in assets under management (AUM) was another positive.That said, Invesco has an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.9%.Moreover, activities of the company in the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings increased 3.1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year improvement of 10%.Looking at Invesco’s price performance, its shares have gained 22.8% so far this year. However, it underperformed the industry’s growth of 27%.Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Invesco PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Invesco PLC QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings? It depends on the company’s ability to impress the market with an earnings beat and improved financials.Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted if Invesco will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time around. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Invesco is 0.00%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 66 cents matches the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: Invesco has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsPer the monthly metrics data published by Invesco, its AUM as of Sep 30, 2017 of $917.5 billion was up nearly 6.8% from the Jun 30, 2017 level. The rise in AUM for the third quarter is driven by favourable market returns and net long-term inflows. Thus, given the improvement in AUM in the quarter, the related fee should also witness an increase, thereby supporting revenue growth.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales for the to-be-reported quarter is $1.31 billion, which is projected to witness growth of 9.4%.Invesco’s expenses in the quarter are likely to witness a marginal increase. Management expects property, office and technology expenses to increase and be in the range of $92-$94 million, owing to the large technology-related projects being put into service and a rise in outsourced administration expenses.Nevertheless, market expenses are expected to stay flat in the quarter, while G&A expenses are projected to be in line or slightly elevated from the second-quarter levels.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc. (LM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.97% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. It is scheduled to report results on Oct 25.Lazard Ltd. (LAZ  -  Free Report) is slated to report results on Oct 26.

191,IVZ,"Shares of Waddell & Reed Financial Inc. (WDR  -  Free Report) declined 1.4% following the release of its third-quarter 2017 results. Earnings of 45 cents per share outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents. However, it compared unfavorably with the year-ago quarter’s earnings of 65 cents.Apart from dismal year-over-year performance, the fall in share price reflects investors’ pessimism over Waddell & Reed’s decision to cut quarterly dividend by more than 45%.Results were adversely impacted by lower revenues and a rise in expenses. Also, despite higher gross sales and a fall in net outflows during the quarter, assets under management (AUM) continued to decline. Nevertheless, a solid balance sheet position was a positive for the company.Net income attributable to Waddell & Reed totaled $38 million, down 29.5% from the prior-year quarter.AUM & Revenues Fall, Expenses RiseOperating revenues for the quarter decreased 4.5% year over year to $289.4 million, reflecting a decline in all components. However, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $285.4 million.Gross sales increased 14.2% year over year to $2.88 billion. Redemptions declined 23.5% to $5.67 billion. Also, net outflows were $2.79 billion at the quarter end, down from $4.89 billion at the end of the prior-year quarter.Operating expenses rose 2.2% year over year to $234.4 million. The increase was primarily due to a higher compensation and related costs, and sub-advisory fees.Operating margin was 19%, down from 24.3% a year ago.As of Sep 30, 2017, AUM totaled $80.90 billion, reflecting a decline of 4.9% from the Sep 30, 2016 level.As of Sep 30, 2017, the company’s cash and cash equivalents as well as investment securities totaled $923.1 million. Long-term debt was $94.8 million and stockholders’ equity was $870.3 million.Performance of Distribution ChannelsAt the Retail Broker-Dealer channel, gross sales remained stable year over year at $1.02 billion. However, net outflows totaled $1.23 billion, increasing from the year-ago quarter figure of $712 million.At the Retail Unaffiliated Distribution channel, gross sales surged 35.6% year over year to $1.90 billion. Also, net outflows were $483 million, down 85.6%.Gross sales at the Institutional channel were $68 million, declining 62.2% from the year-ago quarter. The segment witnessed net outflows of $1.07 billion, up 27.8% from the prior-year quarter.Update on Capital DeploymentWaddell & Reed bought back 190.1 million shares for $3.6 million during the quarter. The company returned a total of $42.1 million to its shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter.Further, as part of its regular assessment of the return of capital to stockholders, management intends to implement a revised capital return policy. This will give Waddell & Reed greater financial flexibility to invest in business, maintain a strong balance sheet and continue providing competitive return to stockholders.Therefore, the Board lowered the quarterly dividend on Class A common stock to 25 cents per share. This dividend will be paid on Feb 1, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Jan 11, 2018.Additionally, the company’s capital plan includes an authorization to repurchase $250 million worth shares over the next two years.Our ViewpointWaddell & Reed has been facing pressure on its revenues, which will continue to hamper its financials in the near term. A declining trend in AUM is another key concern. Although the company is taking initiatives through Project E to boost its top line, it will take a while to witness a rebound.Nevertheless, expenses remain manageable. Also, its continued investments in the Retail-Broker Dealer channel might help boost revenues and AUM, going forward.Waddell & Reed Financial, Inc.

Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 15%.However, Zions’ activities in the third quarter failed to encourage analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of 72 cents for the to-be-reported quarter remained stable over the last seven days. Nevertheless, it reflects a year-over-year improvement of 26.5%.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $666.8 million is projected to witness an increase of 8.6% year over year.Further, the company’s price performance has been decent. Its shares have gained 7% year to date, outperforming the industry’s growth of 2.6%.Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise  Zions Bancorporation Price and EPS Surprise | Zions Bancorporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of Zions beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter are low. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Zions is -0.34%.Zacks Rank: Zions carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsThe third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Moreover, driven by continued growth in investment securities portfolio as well as benefit from rate hikes, management expects net interest margin (NIM) to improve in the quarter. Thus, higher margin should further have a positive impact on NII.Zions has been undertaking a spate of initiatives to control costs. Although its cost-saving efforts are likely to reduce operating expenses to some extent, the company’s continued spending on technology systems overhaul and normal salary adjustments will keep overall expenses stable during the quarter.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc.

193,IVZ,"State Street Corporation (STT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report third-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Oct 23. Its earnings and revenues are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, an increase in revenues drove the company’s operating earnings growth. In fact, the number outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, higher expenses were the downside.State Street boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 8.7%.Moreover, activities of the company during the third quarter encouraged analysts to revise estimates upward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter increased 1.3% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 19.4%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $2.95 billion for the quarter, reflecting 12.7%  year-over-year growth.State Street’s fundamental strength has supported a 25.5% year-to-date rally of the stock, significantly outperforming the 9.8% growth of the industry it belongs to.State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  State Street Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | State Street Corporation QuoteWill the rally in stock price continue post Q3 earnings release? To a great extent, it depends on the company’s ability to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of State Street beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — which is needed for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for State Street is +0.27%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.62 is above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61.Zacks Rank: State Street has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsImprovement in Net Interest Income (NII): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest earnings assets of $194.5 billion for the quarter represents a decline of nearly 3.8% year over year. Nevertheless, overall lending witnessed modest improvement in the quarter. Thus, loan growth coupled with higher interest rates is expected to boost the company’s NII.Moreover, the company expects net interest margin (NIM) in the quarter to expand 3-5 basis points, given the Fed rate hike in June. Thus, higher NIM should further lead to an improvement in interest income.Muted Fee Revenue Growth: In the last quarter, the company witnessed an improvement in management fees on a year-over-year basis, driven by the benefits of the acquired GE Asset Management business. We expect a similar trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, due to seasonality, the company expects growth in trading services revenue to remain muted. Further, securities finance revenue is anticipated to decrease sequentially. Thus, overall fee revenue is not expected to witness much improvement in the quarter.Expenses to Remain Stable: Although the benefits of the company’s cost-saving initiatives through State Street Beacon are not expected to be realized much in the quarter, the same is likely to partly offset expenses to support new business, continued business investments, and merit and depreciation increases.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Legg Mason, Inc.

194,IVZ,"SunTrust Banks, Inc. (STI  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 20, before the opening bell. Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, SunTrust’s earnings outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefitted from an improvement in net interest income, partially offset by higher expenses. Also, lower provision for credit losses was a positive.Moreover, SunTrust boasts an impressive earnings surprise history. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.3%.However, the company’s activities in the third quarter failed to impress analysts to revise earnings estimates. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings of $1.06 remained stable over the last 30 days. Nevertheless, the figure represents a year-over-year improvement of 16.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $2.29 billion reflects an improvement of 4.2% from the prior-year quarter.The company’s price performance has not been that impressive. Its shares have gained 7.9% year to date, underperforming the industry’s growth of 9.6%.SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  SunTrust Banks, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | SunTrust Banks, Inc. QuoteWill the price performance improve post Q3 earnings? To a great extent, it depends on whether the company manages to beat earnings estimates this time around. Let’s check what our quantitative model predicts.According to our quantitative model, chances of SunTrust beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the to-be-reported quarter are bleak. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to be confident of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for SunTrust is -0.18%.Zacks Rank: SunTrust currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. But we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsNet Interest Income (NII) to Improve: The third quarter witnessed a moderate improvement in lending, particularly in the areas of commercial and industrial as well as consumer. Thus, loan growth combined with a rise in interest rates should boost the company’s NII in the quarter.Moreover, the company expects net interest margin in the quarter to range from 3.14-3.16%, up from 2.96% in the prior-year quarter. Thus, higher NIM should further boost the company’s NII.Relatively Stable Non-Interest Income: Expectations of a higher rate environment might have encouraged refinancing activities during the quarter. However, with the refinance boom nearing its end, no major help is expected from this segment and hence mortgage revenue is not expected to witness much improvement.Nevertheless, given that the overall equity markets witnessed some improvement in the quarter, trust income is expected to rise. Along with this, a rise in investment banking activities in the quarter should provide some support to overall fee income growth.Expenses to Decline Slightly: The company’s initiatives of consolidating its branch networks should translate into marginal expense reduction.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Invesco Ltd.

This is likely to lead to stable or improving fee income for the company.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AUM of $378 billion for the quarter reflects a 1.95 improvement sequentially.Also, Blackstone continues to expand its investment activity to capitalize on public market dislocation and should report higher deployment of capital during the quarter.On the expense side, as the company’s well-performing funds require more headcount, costs are likely to increase.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.SLM Corporation (SLM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Its revenues and earnings are expected to grow year over year.Last quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. A rise in revenues and provision benefits were offset by an increase in expenses.BNY Mellon has a decent earnings surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and matched once in the trailing four quarters, with the average beat being 4.8%.Moreover, activities of the company in the third quarter have encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 93 cents has increased 1.1% over the last 30 days. Also, the figure reflects year-over-year growth of 2.8%.Further, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $4 billion for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting an improvement of 1.4% year over year.Also, BNY Mellon’s price performance seems impressive. Its shares have gained 15.5% so far this year, outperforming the 8.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Bank Of New York Mellon Corporation (The) QuoteWill the rally in share price continue post Q3 earnings? To a large extent it depends on whether the company will be able to maintain its trend of beating earnings estimates. Let’s take a look at what our quantitative model predicts.A Likely Positive Surprise?According to our quantitative model, chances of BNY Mellon beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the third quarter are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients, a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better, which is required to increase the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for BNY Mellon is +0.08%.Zacks Rank: BNY Mellon carries a Zacks Rank of 3. This when combined with a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings surprise.Factors to Influence Q3 ResultsModest Improvement in Fee Revenue: The equity markets have performed decently in the third quarter. As a result, performance fee is expected to improve. Moreover, Depositary Receipts revenues witnessed a slight seasonal boost during the quarter. Although, a stronger U.S. dollar and seasonally lower securities lending revenues can be offsetting factors, overall fee revenues should improve during the quarter.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fee revenues of $3.13 billion reflects a marginal year-over-year improvement.Higher Rates to Boost Net Interest Revenue (NIR): The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average interest-earning assets of $293 billion reflects a 1.2% decline from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, overall loan growth remained decent in the quarter. Given the improvement in loan balances along with the effect of rising interest rates, BNY Mellon should record an increase in NIR.Moreover, management believes any rate hike will lead to an improvement in margin. Hence, improving margins due to the June rate hike is likely to more than offset the reduced size of balance sheet and hence lead to a modest increase in NIR in the quarter.Expenses to Decline Slightly: Management expects legal and professional expenses to decline by nearly $10 million in third-quarter 2017. Despite the impact of investment-related expenses, overall costs are expected to decline.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model, these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.SLM Corporation (SLM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.01% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

200,IVZ,"Invesco Ltd. (IVZ  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire the exchange-traded funds (ETF) business of Guggenheim Partners LLC for $1.2 billion. The deal, which is expected to be completed by the second quarter upon receiving necessary third-party approvals, will be funded using cash and debt.Earlier in August, there were reports of Invesco buying the entire retail business of Guggenheim Partners.

It will add to its already-expanding portfolio, which offers ETFs under the PowerShares label. Once the deal is complete, Invesco's ETF AUM is expected to be worth more than $196 billion globally, as of Aug 31, 2017.The deal should lead to further improvement in the company’s top line, which has been growing since the last few years, owing to continued improvement in its AUM balance. Moreover, Invesco believes that the transaction will help in expanding, strengthening and broadening its investment capabilities in the growing ETF market globally.Moreover, the acquisition is likely to enhance Invesco’s ability to provide solutions to its institutional and retail clients, both in the United States as well as globally so that they can better achieve their investment objectives.Invesco’s President and CEO, Martin L. Flanagan, said, “We've built and managed Invesco over many years with a single focus:  to help clients achieve their investment objectives.

Miller, Guggenheim Investments’ president, said, “Guggenheim Investments remains committed to delivering strong, risk-adjusted performance to clients by employing our rigorous and repeatable investment processes, as well as executing sound fundamental research and analysis. We are confident that Guggenheim ETF shareholders will find in Invesco the right partner and platform for our suite of distinctive and innovative ETF products, including one of the industry's leading equal-weight ETF offerings.”Shares of Invesco have gained 11.4% in a year’s time, underperforming the 27.2% growth for the industry it belongs to.Currently, Invesco carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks from the same space are Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM  -  Free Report), Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.
