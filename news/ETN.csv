1,ETN,"Eaton (ETN) saw a welcome improvement to its Relative Strength (RS) Rating on Monday, with an increase from 67 to 71. X This unique rating measures technical performance by showing how a stock's price action over the last 52 weeks measures up against that of the other stocks in our database. Over 100 years of market history shows that the top-performing stocks typically have an RS Rating north of 80 as they launch their largest runs. See if Eaton can continue to rebound and hit that benchmark. Looking For Winning Stocks? Try This Simple RoutineEaton broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 82.44 entry from a cup without handle. If a stock you're tracking clears a buy point then retreats 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. Wait for the stock to set up and breakout from a new chart pattern and buy point. Also understand that the latest pattern is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. Earnings growth fell in the most recent quarter from 67% to 15%. But revenue moved higher, from 4% to 7%.

3,ETN,"Those most hurt by the Trump administration's planned tariffs on steel and aluminum could include United Technologies (UTX), Ingersoll-Rand (IR), and Johnson Controls (JCI), RBC Capital Markets warned.X In a noted dated Sunday, RBC Capital's Deane Dray also cautioned that Atkore International (ATKR), Eaton Corp. (ETN) and Pentair (PNR) would feel the pain especially.Trump set off a storm in the stock markets Thursday, saying he would impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports. While he said Monday that he doesn't think there will be a trade war, he added that the U.S. is ""not backing down"" on tariffs.Eaton has already sized the tariff impact as a potential 2% headwind to 2018 earnings per share, Dray noted.Overall, the tariffs would squeeze near-term margins for manufacturers of automobiles, HVAC systems, electrical equipment, and construction or building products, Dray added.Still, RBC expects multi-industry companies to eventually withstand the tariff  impact, citing strong underlying fundamentals in the manufacturing sector and the recent tax reform windfall.Shares of United Technologies closed up 1.4% at 131.71 on the stock market today, on reports that Republicans in Congress were pushing back more against the tariff plan. Ingersoll-Rand dipped 0.1%, Johnson Controls gained 1.6%, Eaton rallied 1.8%, Atkore gained 2.6%, and Pentair rose 0.6%.Use IBD's MarketSmith For Free Until March 11

6,ETN,"Technology and oil were among top-performing ETFs during the past month, though health care and cocoa led their respective sector and commodities categories.Little change occurred near the top of the diversified stock fund category as the broader market remained relatively stable during the past month. It was a close race as the top four performers were separated by one basis point at most.First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus (FV) moved up two spots to take the lead with an 8.1% year-to-date gain through May 9, according to Morningstar Direct.PowerShares S&P 500 Pure Growth (RPG), last month's top fund, tied with FV with an 8.1% return.

West Texas intermediate crude made headlines during the week — first, as prices topped $70, then took out $71 a barrel, to multiyear highs.The Trump administration's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear treaty deal boosted oil prices on Thursday, amid expectations for tighter global supplies.PowerShares DB Oil (DBO), United States Oil (USO) and United States Brent Oil (BNO) moved up from fifth, sixth and seventh place, respectively. DBO gained 21.6% year to date, USO 19.7% and BNO 18.9%.""A rise in Persian Gulf-related geopolitical risks has helped fuel double-digit gains in oil this year,"" BlackRock's Turnill said.

For investors seeking exposure to oil now, we see more appeal in energy equities than in the commodity.""Why does he favor energy stocks over the underlying commodity?""Oil prices have run well ahead of energy stocks this year but this trend has started to turn,"" he noted.

7,ETN,"The problem with investing is you can lose money — and sometimes a lot of it.Investors in VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term Exchange-Traded Note (XIV) learned that the hard way. The product blew up and has since been liquidated, leaving investors with big losses. Now, they're suing Credit Suisse Group (CS), the note's issuer, and Janus Index & Calculation Services, the publisher of the note's intraday indicative value and closing indicative value.XIV was one of 19 exchange-traded products that tracked the Cboe Volatility Index, better known as the VIX. XIV wasn't an ETF, but an exchange-traded note (ETN). ETNs don't hold underlying securities, like stocks or bonds. They're unsecured debt instruments issued by a bank that promises to pay the performance of an index. XIV promised to pay the inverse of the VIX. If the VIX went down, XIV would go up that amount, and vice versa. It did this by buying and shorting VIX futures.XIV had become popular because over the previous five years it had returned 2,200%, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. Then on Feb. 5, the VIX jumped 100%. Reports say the note's price was $72.59 at 4 p.m. ET and fell to $4.22 by 5:10 p.m., during which time its indicative value was not updated every 15 seconds as was typical. Janus Index & Calculation Services was responsible for providing the estimates of the note's value. Because the note had lost more than 90% of its value, Credit Suisse enacted a provision the next day to close the ETN to prevent further losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""The issuers build in a cushion so that if it lost 70% of its value, it liquidates. It's all done,"" said Peter Shea, partner at law firm K&L Gates. ""In this instance, the VIX shot up so high it ate into about all their cushion by the end of the day.""The investors are suing, saying they suffered damages because they relied ""on the integrity of the market, they paid artificially inflated prices for the Notes. Plaintiff and the Class would not have purchased the Notes at the prices they paid, or at all, if they had been aware that the market prices had been artificially and falsely inflated by defendants' misleading statements,"" according to court documents.Credit Suisse told IBD: ""The publicly available prospectus accurately and fully disclosed the risks of an investment in XIV, which is only intended for sophisticated institutional clients. Credit Suisse did not engage in any conduct designed to mislead investors regarding XIV's value or cause the Feb. 5, 2018, decline in XIV's price.""Janus was not available for comment.""People will sue because they'll say that they didn't realize they would get liquidated and have their losses locked in. In other words, they didn't read the prospectus,"" Shea said. ""It's a very sophisticated product and a lot of people don't have the basics to understand it or have simplified disclosure to educate themselves on the basics of it, so a lot of retail investors should stay away from products like this.""""There's no denying it was painful,"" said Bloomberg's Balchunas. ""But unless there is some kind of manipulation we haven't seen, it doesn't seem like much of a case, because everything was disclosed in the prospectus and the ETN tracked what it was tracking. VIX futures had as good of a day as the ETN had bad. Since you're inverse the futures, you went down as much as they went up.""Another exchange-traded product suffered huge losses on Feb. 5 as well, but managed to stay open.The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) also fell about 90% that day. On Feb. 27, the fund changed from giving the inverse performance to one-half the inverse (-0.5x) of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index for a single day. If the fund meets its new objective, on a day the index falls 1%, the fund should rise approximately 0.5%, before fees. Similarly, on a day the index rises 1%, the fund should fall about 0.5%.Its sister fund, the ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY), now seeks to give one and one-half times (1.5x) the performance of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index for a single day. If the fund meets its new objective, on a day the index rises 1%, the fund should rise approximately 1.5%.The change was made without notifying shareholders because, as ProShares says on its website, it believed it was in the best interests of the funds and their shareholders to promptly implement this change.

8,ETN,"Exchange traded funds' popularity keeps growing as investors plow money into the popular low-cost vehicles that offer access to a basket of stocks.X And that trend doesn't appear to be waning. The combined assets of U.S. ETFs surged to $3.6 trillion in January, according to the Investment Company Institute, up 38% from a year ago. And the total number of U.S. ETFs rose 7% to 1,853 from January 2017.In the 25 years since the launch of the very first ETF, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY), there are now some 2,000 funds available across a variety of categories and styles.To gain further insight into ETFs, their potential benefits and growth outlook, we checked in with Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA. Before CFRA acquired S&P Global in 2016, Rosenbluth was director of ETF and mutual fund research in the U.S. for S&P Capital IQ. His previous experience includes managing editor of Value Line Mutual Fund Survey and financial advisor at Morgan Stanley.The full interview with Rosenbluth, who also discusses current trends in the ETF space, follows:IBD: Should an investor own ETFs, and why?Rosenbluth: Investors who want exposure to the stock or bond market should look to ETFs, which typically provide low-cost exposure to a broad investment category or a narrower thesis with the benefits of diversification and transparency. For example, rather than own just Merck (MRK), investors in Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) or Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index ETF (FHLC) would hold Merck; its peers, including Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Pfizer (PFE); and companies in other related industries, including Medtronic (MDT) and UnitedHealth Group (UNH). Unlike in an actively managed mutual fund, investors can see daily what's in an ETF and determine if they think it continues to fit their portfolio.IBD: Are there too many ETFs out there?Rosenbluth: Approximately one-third of CFRA-rated ETFs came to market since March 2015. So we think (that before investing) investors should determine whether an ETF serves a legitimate investing purpose. If so, it's more likely to gain sufficient assets to be viable.Keep in mind that CFRA rates far more mutual funds than ETFs, with several dozen asset managers offering similar-sounding products. Given the sentiment shift toward lower-cost ETFs and away from more expensive mutual funds, CFRA expects more mutual funds to be closed or merged in response.Get IBD's Market Prep And Tech Report Newsletters — For Free!IBD: What do you think could fuel further ETF growth — and what could hinder growth?Rosenbluth: Investor and advisor adoption of ETFs designed to support their asset-allocation needs is going to further drive ETF growth. Vanguard S&P 500 (VOO) or iShares Core MSCI EAFE (IEFA) are examples of such well-diversified products. As more investors gain comfort with ETFs, money will continue to flow into both established and up-and-coming products.Some investors will always favor the mutual-fund wrapper, wanting active management. To address this, many large asset managers including Davis Funds, Legg Mason, PIMCO and Vanguard offer actively managed ETFs — another area of potential growth.IBD: Even though factor-based ETFs aren't new, ""smart beta"" continues to be a buzzword. What has contributed to the rising popularity of smart-beta funds?Rosenbluth: As actively managed mutual funds struggle to keep up with the returns of the S&P 500 or the MSCI EAFE index, investors are seeking an alternative. Smart-beta ETFs launched in the last three years, including popular Goldman Sachs ActiveBeta U.S. Large Cap Equity (GSLC) and iShares Edge MSCI MultiFactor USA ETF (LRGF), combine factor approaches to offer a diversified yet lower cost approach to quantitative investing.Here again, many large asset managers have expanded their ETF presence using smart-beta products in response to growing demand. In the last six months, JPMorgan U.S. Minimum Volatility (JMIN), Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Low Volatility Factor (OVOL) and USAA MSCI USA Value Momentum Blend Index ETF (ULVM) have launched. All of these are covered by CFRA Research.IBD: ESG (environmental, social and governance) funds have been in the news too. Do you think that's a lasting trend?Rosenbluth: ESG mutual fund assets have been quite sticky, even as many actively managed mutual funds slowly bleed assets in favor of index-based ETFs. We expect over time, ESG ETFs will gain traction as investors further embrace ETFs and put money to work focused on the conviction of their values.IBD: Any new trends you're seeing now?Rosenbluth: We're seeing investors look more closely at thematic ETFs. Unlike traditional sector or well-diversified ETFs, these ETFs focus on robotics, blockchain or other potentially long-term investment trends. These more narrowly constructed products — such as Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence (BOTZ), ROBO Global Robotics & Automation Index (ROBO), Reality Shares NASDAQ Nexgen Economy (BLCN) and Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF (KOIN) — tend to charge a premium price relative to market-cap-weighted ETFs, but as more asset managers compete for investor interest, fees have and will continue to move lower.IBD: Which types of ETFs do you expect to outperform as interest rates rise?Rosenbluth: With equity ETFs, CFRA thinks more economically sensitive sectors, including financials and industrials, should benefit if rates rise due to a strong U.S. economy. Vanguard Financials Index ETF (VFH) and iShares Transportation Average (IYT) are a couple of examples.In addition, as interest rates rise, CFRA is focused on bond ETFs with limited interest-rate sensitivity. These low-duration products reduce the downside impact as the Federal Reserve raises rates. IShares 0-5 Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond (SHYG) and SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Short Term High Yield Bond ETF (SJNK) are examples of short-term ETFs rated favorably by CFRA.IBD: Given the Feb. 5 market sell-off and early redemption of VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), what are your thoughts on VIX-tied volatility ETFs? Are they appropriate for any type of investors?Rosenbluth: VIX-based products are not rated by CFRA as we focus on ETFs that directly hold stocks or bonds and not derivatives. However, investors need to understand that inverse and leveraged ETFs can aggressively move without warning and losses can pile up quickly.IBD: Does XIV's early redemption mean it's harder for investors to manage risk — and if so, how does that affect how the market operates?Rosenbluth: XIV was an exchange traded note, not a traditional ETF as are the other products we've talked about. With ETNs, investors need to understand that there is issuer risk to consider on top of the usual investment risks. With an ETF that shuts down, investors get fair warning and can understand what's inside the portfolio. This helps them track what they will receive if they hold until the product closes. With XIV, the mechanics were much different and the road to closure was much shorter.It's important to note, however, that what happened with XIV was spelled out in its prospectus. So this is less an example of a larger market issue and more an example of why investors need to know exactly what they're getting involved with, particularly with leveraged, inverse and volatility products.IBD: What is a sound strategy for a long-term investor in ETFs?Rosenbluth: Long-term investors should regularly review what's inside the ETFs they're holding to understand how the securities fit going forward. Investors should also periodically rebalance their assets as positions do not move up or down in tandem. You should not necessarily stand still even with passively managed ETFs.IBD: How does CFRA assess ETFs — and how does that differ from other industry researchers?Rosenbluth: CFRA provides a forward-looking rating on more than 1,300 ETFs, combining holdings analysis with fund attributes, including expense ratio and technical analysis. What's inside an ETF and how much it costs is a bigger driver of future returns than its three-year track record or how well it tracks a typically unique index. ETFs that rate favorably to CFRA do so because we have confidence in the valuation and risk considerations of the holdings. We also compare ETFs with one another and separate from mutual funds, as the relevant metrics differ, while others compare active mutual funds trying to beat the S&P 500 with ETFs such as SPDR S&P 500 that seeks to replicate the index.Since our equity ETF ratings launched nearly 10 years ago, under the S&P Global umbrella, our top-rated ETFs have outperformed the S&P 500 index and the bottom-rated ETFs have underperformed. S&P Equity and Fund Research was acquired by independent research provider CFRA Research in late 2016.

9,ETN,"Exchange-traded products tracking VIX futures are seeing their first signs of life after investors yanked more than $570 million from two ETPs following the spike in market volatility.The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term ETN, known by its ticker TVIX, took in more than $20 million this week, the first time the $300 million ETN has seen inflows this month, according to Bloomberg data. And the $210 million ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures fund, or UVXY, gathered $13.3 million, the data show. Both funds promise to provide twice the performance of the Cboe SPX Volatility Index.The funds had been hemorrhaging money since the equity selloff sent the VIX to its highest level in two years on Feb. 5. The price of UVXY, for example, soared as much as 71% that day, but then plunged by a record 33% in the following session.In the meantime, buyers also have been pouring money into a strategy that bets against volatility. The ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures fund, ticker SVXY, saw a single day inflow of almost $300 million following the market rout. With the VIX showing a hint of normalcy, sliding back to around 20 after soaring by the most on record last week, some investors are comfortable betting on market calm again.

11,ETN,"The biggest rally ever in the Cboe Volatility Index (CBOE) is raising thorny questions about the future of exchange-traded products tied to the gauge.An ETP meant to mirror moves in the front of the VIX's futures curve plunged more than 75% in after-hours trading following an 80% spike in contracts that comprise its underlying index during the trading day, potentially putting in play triggers that would enable the fund's owners to liquidate it to avoid losses.Nicole Sharp, a spokeswoman for the note's sponsor, Credit Suisse AG's VelocityShares, said in an emailed statement that ""The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today's market volatility. There is no material impact to Credit Suisse."" She didn't elaborate on the fate of the product.But professional traders said a logical interpretation of language in their prospectuses suggests the notes could be liquidated under circumstances that resemble today's.The surge in volatility has already claimed one victim: Nomura Europe Finance announced the early redemption of its Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN, which had 32.4 billion yen (approximately $300 million) in assets.Trading was halted in VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), which trades under XIV, according to a market statement Tuesday.""If they lose more than 80% of their value, the sponsor has the right to liquidate and they should, or they take on the risk. Thus if Bloomberg's indicative value is correct, they are due to be liquidated,"" Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading, said.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The fund, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN, has been wildly popular in the past year as volatility on American equity markets sank to historic lows, delivering an eye-popping return of more than 187% last year. It pulled in nearly $1 billion in just the first five weeks of this year, while the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN has added almost $750 million over the same time frame.Meanwhile, investors have been reluctant to bet on volatility amid the market's extended period of calm. The ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (UVXY) has experienced $83 million in outflows this year, while the iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has seen $52 million leave.That all changed in a hurry Monday when the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank as much as 1,597 points on its way to the worst percentage loss since August 2011. The VIX jumped 115%, sending the XIV and SVXY funds down at least 15%.Those moves picked up steam in after-hours trading, as the spike in the VIX spread to its futures contracts — the assets used to determine the price of the funds, in this case, the inverse of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. To prevent massive selling from pushing the value of the fund into negative territory, the issuers outline so-called acceleration events that would give them the power to liquidate the fund. From the prospectus:""An Acceleration Event includes any event that adversely affects our ability to hedge or our rights in connection with the ETNs, including, but not limited to, if the Intraday Indicative Value is equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's Closing Indicative Value,"" the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN's prospectus states.OTHER KEY INVESTORS.COM CONTENT FOR THE CURRENT MARKET:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

12,ETN,"The avalanche of volatility pouring down on investors took another victim Tuesday with the liquidation of a newfangled security at the center of the storm. It remains to be seen if the move will stabilize markets that have already seen $3 trillion of value erased.X While U.S. equities calmed somewhat, questions remain over how a security that quickly became a favorite of investors could enact enough stress in the market's plumbing that it shook stock markets from New York to Tokyo.The catalyst has been unprecedented moves in the Cboe Volatility Index (CBOE) that have roiled the market for exchange-traded products tied to the fear gauge. Credit Suisse said a spike in VIX futures will force it to liquidate an ETP that moves in the opposite direction, effectively wiping out a fund whose market value topped $2 billion three weeks ago.More than a dozen other funds triggered limit up/limit down rules that halted trading as of 10 a.m. ET. Among the suspensions was a ProShares inverse ETP, which sank more than 80% in after hours trading Monday. Horizons ETFs Management Canada  suspended redemptions of its ETF that bets against VIX futures.The VIX swung wildly Tuesday, tumbling as much as 40% before trading flat around 36. It more than doubled on Monday in its biggest-ever runup and topped 50 earlier Tuesday.Betting against volatility has become a popular money-making strategy in the years since the financial crisis, with banks and other financial companies offering a plethora of 'short-vol' products. But exchange traded notes and funds that give investors a quick and easy way of entering the trade have also been criticized for their risks. BlackRock has been calling for regulation that would clearly spell out the dangers associated with such inverse and leveraged exchange-traded products.Credit Suisse Group is buying back the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), which it issued. The ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures ETF (SVXY) is meanwhile expected to open for business on Tuesday, ProShares Advisors, which manages the fund, said in a statement.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.The VelocityShares notes, which mirror the inverse performance of the Cboe volatility index, will be called on Feb. 21, the bank said in a statement Tuesday. XIV dropped 14% during the session on Monday and its net asset value plunged more than 80% in late trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Credit Suisse said it's redeeming early because the indicative value on Feb. 5 was equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's closing indicative value.The bank has not suffered any trading losses related to the exchanged-traded note, the company said in an earlier statement Tuesday. The Swiss lender was the biggest holder on the note with 32% at the end of the third quarter. The ETN had a market value of about $2.2 billion at its record high on Jan. 11.The surge in volatility had already claimed one victim: Nomura Europe Finance announced the early redemption of its Next Notes S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Inverse Daily Excess Return Index ETN, which had 32.4 billion yen ($297 million) in assets.OTHER KEY INVESTORS.COM CONTENT FOR THE CURRENT MARKET:How Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

13,ETN,"The stock market didn't let up on volatility Friday, leaving key index ETFs vacillating between red and black throughout the session. They were mixed in late-afternoon trading.Microsoft (MSFT) and Intel (INTC) boosted the Dow Jones industrials Friday as techs led the rebound from Thursday's sell-off. Nvidia (NVDA) soared on earnings.X PowerShares QQQ Trust (QQQ) rose 0.9%, SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) advanced 0.8% and SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) added 0.5%. Emerging markets also led, with iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) up 0.9%. The S&P 500 index fell to its 200-day line but found support and rebounded.Big-cap techs advanced in the blue chip index: Microsoft was up 2.5%, Intel 1.9% and Cisco (CSCO) 1.3%. Apple (AAPL), which has been in both positive and negative territory today, held a fractional gain%. Microsoft recovered its 50-day moving average; Apple is still below its 200-day line.Semiconductor, technology and banks were among the biggest sector-fund gainers in the stock market today. VanEck Vectors Semiconductor (SMH) and iShares PHLX Semiconductor (SOXX) reversed from earlier losses to advance 2% each. Nvidia surged 7% on a big earnings and sales beat. The graphics-chip designer raised guidance for the current quarter.Gold, energy and consumer staples lagged. Oil and gold plays slipped along with their underlying commodity prices. VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) and VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) tumbled 2.9% and 2.4%, respectively. PowerShares DB Energy (DBE) slid 2%, on track for a sixth straight decline as it dropped further below its 50-day line.It's tough to find rising ETFs when the stock market takes such a nasty tumble like it did on Thursday. But a handful of leveraged inverse funds scored.Leveraged funds are not for the faint of heart, or even for most retail investors. They can jump sharply when a major index is up, but can crash hard when the opposite occurs. Likewise, leveraged inverse funds tend to soar when the index they track sinks. They are not intended to be a long-term play.ProShares Ultra Short QQQ (SQQQ) vaulted nearly 13% Thursday as the Nasdaq 100 index dropped more than 4%. The $455.5 million fund, which aims to provide three times the inverse of the Nasdaq 100's daily performance, has been mired in a steep descent since its February 2010 launch. After all, the bull market is entering its ninth year.However, the ETF perked up 12% on Monday, as the broader market stumbled. SQQQ regained its 50-day moving average for the first time since late September. It fell back below the support line on Tuesday, and reclaimed it Thursday.Its year-to-date return of 1.2% through Feb. 8 was ahead of the S&P 500's nearly flat advance on that date. The ETF's long-term performance track record leaves much to be desired, with average annual losses of more than 40% over the past three and five years. SQQQ bears a 0.95% expense ratio.IBD'S TAKE: Don't try to guess where the market is headed next. Read The Big Picture every day to understand the action of the major averages and leading stocks.IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) surged 24% Thursday to close near a five-month high. The $1.6 billion exchange traded note carries a 0.89% expense ratio.Other inverse plays include ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures (UVXY), and ProShares VIX Short-Term Futures (VIXY).Thursday's picks, SPDR S&P Regional Bank (KRE) and SPDR S&P Bank (KBE), both fell below their 50-day lines during the market rout.RELATED:Why The Stock Market Sold Off, And What You Should Do NowStocks Rally As Apple, Nvidia Fuel Big Gains; Is Bitcoin Back?ETFs Quake Under Volatility Spike As Credit Suisse Redeems Note

14,ETN,"For a fledgling asset class whose idiosyncrasies are understood by few, there sure is a lot of money swirling around in volatility trades.Investment strategies and products married to market swings were thrust front and center by the worst market meltdown in seven years, in which the Cboe Volatility Index surged to its highest level since 2015. VIX-related securities were halted, volatility-targeting quants blamed, and options trading in benchmarks for turbulence ballooned.Too big to ignore, it's an asset class in its own right, with the might to push around the broader market. Getting a grip on it has confounded strategists and managers alike. Even its designers are amazed by its heft.""It doesn't surprise me that it's become so big. What surprises me is that it's in some ways sapped liquidity from other parts of the market,"" said Michael Schmanske, the founder of Glenshaw Capital Management who previously worked at Barclays Capital and helped oversee the launch of some of the first VIX ETPs. ""These guys have taken volatility to the next level and believe it needs to be part of a managed portfolio.""There are two categories of securities linked to price turbulence, roughly speaking: ones tied to the VIX directly, and others that take their cue from the volatility of individual stocks. Altogether, estimates for the space are anywhere from $1.5 trillion to $2 trillion. Beyond that is the options market, which itself is an implicit bet on swings in shares.Funds that fall under this category use realized volatility as data inputs and were called out as potential culprits for exacerbating Monday's trading.Volatility is key to the investment decision of these programmatic funds often employed by pensions and insurers — a specific level is set, and leverage will be adjusted to maintain that objective depending on how much each asset class swings. Theoretically, if stocks begin to trade wildly, they may scale back their footprint. Or, in the case of Monday, they may have been selling into the downturn.Estimates from both Barclays PLC and Societe Generale SA pin the space between $400 billion and $500 billion.Risk parity often gets lumped in with vol-targeting funds because asset riskiness is a central input. However, they operate quite differently. Risk parity attempts to hold an equal amount of risk across asset classes and uses longer-term volatility inputs — it won't trade based on a few days of volatility spikes.Risk parity has been called out before as the equivalent to portfolio insurance in 1987, a hedging technique that systematically sold stock index futures as the equity market declined, creating a vicious feedback loop that caused the market to crash. Based on back-of-the-envelope math, risk-parity funds have about 1/100th of the capacity to move markets as portfolio insurance did in 1987, according to AQR Capital Management estimates.The Greenwich, Connecticut-based quantitative money manager estimates the size of risk-parity funds to be between $120 billion and $250 billion, with AQR and Bridgewater Associates LP's All Weather Fund being the largest players. Others estimate the space is larger — SocGen sees it at twice the size.The market's boogeymen, commodity-trading advisors, are related to volatility because these trend-following managers often use market swings as inputs to select the sizes of their positions. Leverage among the funds may be smaller than before the financial crisis, but they've been able to accrue more assets as momentum across markets marched forward to boost returns.AUM for them is about $250 billion, according to SocGen data through 2017. Before Monday's sell-off, they also held a near-record footprint in both equities and commodities.Products directly linked to the VIX may manage as much as $8 billion, according to SocGen estimates. Exchange-traded products, like the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX ETN, known by its ticker XIV, have been directly blamed for causing the VIX to spike Monday as they were forced to de-risk with surging volatility. Credit Suisse, with a market cap of about $46 billion, is the note's backer and has said it will buy back the ETN.Assets in the exchange-traded products have significantly shrunk in size since Monday's maelstrom: short-volatility ETPs manage $700 million, down from a record $3.7 billion in January. Including long-volatility funds, assets total more than $3 billion.As for strategies tied to the VIX — which play on the gauge with a combination of futures and options — there's between $2 billion and $4 billion behind the trades, according to SocGen.This one is the behemoth, and can take many different forms. For example, variance swaps are derivative contracts that make a bet on the magnitude of movement on the underlying asset. But effectively, any option is a bet on the volatility of the underlying asset.Over-the-counter options trading in U.S. equities reached about $2.7 trillion in notional amounts outstanding in the first half of last year, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements. For listed S&P 500 Index contracts, the 20-day average notional value traded has been about $4.2 trillion. But traders typically talk about vega, a measure of an option's sensitivity to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset. That sits at roughly $8 billion vega.

15,ETN,"Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) stock lost more than a tenth of its value Tuesday and smashed through its 50-day moving average line as trading was halted on several inverted volatility products, raising concerns about trading volume at its Chicago Board Options Exchange.X Shares in Cboe dived 10.4% to 116.94 on the stock market today, plunging through the 50-day for the first time in 10 months in its heaviest share volume in 11 months. Cboe, which found some support above its 200-day line, hadn't closed below the 50-day since late 2016.Cboe is home to the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), which is seen as a key psychological indicator on fear in the markets. It serves as a measure of the S&P 500's future volatility, and its popularity led to the launch of products which hedged against it.And while the major averages rallied off intraday lows Tuesday following the worst percentage loss (4.6%) for the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 2011, Cboe was the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 index.Cboe's plunge came as trading in VelocityShares Inverse Vix Short-Term (XIV), ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures and VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Medium-Term (ZIV) was halted. Sales restrictions were also placed on all three products.While the VIX enjoyed a record rise in the past two trading days, the forced closure of short volatility ETNs means traders do not have to hedge these trades with Cboe's VIX futures any more. Quantitative analysis trading strategies have taken advantage of volatility products, with the risk being hedged with futures contracts.It is feared the loss of this business in the future could affect Cboe's corporate profits.Swiss-multinational banking giant Credit Suisse (CS) holds a 32% stake in the VelocityShares Inverse Vix, which launched 2010, and issues its exchange-traded note.The bank said Tuesday it will terminate the product and redeem the notes, which were worth a combined $1.6 billion on Friday. The acceleration date is expected to be Feb. 21, with trading to end the day before.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.""The XIV ETN activity is reflective of today's market volatility,"" Credit Suisse VelocityShares spokeswoman Nicole Sharp said in a press release, ""There is no material impact to Credit Suisse.""The ETN acceleration was triggered as the intraday indicative value of XIV on Monday was equal to or less than 20% of the prior day's closing indicative valueCredit Suisse stock was down 2%.Meanwhile BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest asset manager and an operator of the iShares ETF fund family, Tuesday called for a regulatory classification system to label both inverse and levered exchange traded products differently than regular exchange traded funds.Blackrock also said inverse and leveraged ETPs said to deliver double or triple market returns, ""are not ETFs, and they don't perform like ETFs under stress. ... that's why iShares does not offer them.""The 50-day moving average, which measures the running average of price closes over the past 50 trading sessions, acts as a support level during an uptrend, but can also act as a resistance level during a downtrend.However if a stock breaks below the 50-day line in heavy volume for the first time in a run and cannot rally back, it is often a signal that buying demand is drying up and the stock's run is ending.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED INWhen To Sell Stocks: Big Break Below 50-Day Line Can Mark End Of A Huge RunStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Always Cut Your Losses ShortDow Suffers Worst Point Drop Ever, But Percentage Loss Not HistoricHow Do You Spot A Major Stock Market Top?

Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) leapt 10% as it extends its Tuesday rebound off the 200-day line. The cryptocurrency play is still 64% below its December peak. Bitcoin rose despite a warning from Goldman Sachs.Monday's stock market rout was ugly, but Tuesday's equally wild rebound set up some potential buy opportunities including an ETF that holds Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB) and Netflix (NFLX).But first, it's important to keep in mind that all purchases are riskier than usual with the market uptrend under pressure.First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index (FDN) breached its 50-day moving average intraday Tuesday, before staging a sharp upside reversal to close with a 2% gain. The solid move above the support line puts the ETF near the top of a potential buy zone. But another advance Wednesday pushed it just out of buy range. Shares advanced 16% from an early December bounce off the 50-day to a Jan. 29 intraday high.The $5.9 billion fund was last featured in this ETF column on Dec. 7, as shares were in buy range. It tracks the Dow Jones Internet Composite Index, which comprises companies generating 50% or more of their annual revenue from the internet. Stocks making the index must also have a three month trading history and three-month average market cap of at least $100 million.Information technology made up the biggest sector weight as of Feb. 5, at roughly 69% of assets.

18,ETN,"If there's one hot topic that Americans may remember about 2017, it's the wave of sexual harassment cases that took the corporate world by storm.X From famous actors, producers and entertainers to newscasters, big corporate figures and politicians, the Harvey Weinstein epidemic has cost many their jobs, reputations and marriages.But as the stories continue to unfold, investors must undoubtedly wonder whether the financial industry is going to follow suit when considering certain company stocks or bonds for inclusion or exclusion in their funds and portfolios.Environmental, social and governance, or ESG, investment assets grew to $8.7 trillion at the start of 2016, a 33% increase since the outset of 2014, according to the US SIF Foundation Report on US Sustainable, Responsible and Impact Investing Trends.But while 43 ETFs totaling $4.7 billion are labeled as socially conscious, 55% of those are focused on environmental issues and only five ETFs with less than $1 billion in assets combined are considered thematic socially conscious, according to data from Impact Shares and Morningstar Direct.""Everyone agrees on what a good portfolio looks like on the E side and what good corporate governance looks like on the G side, but the S is often called the messy middle, because everybody has different social priorities,"" said Ethan Powell, founder and president of Impact Shares, a not-for-profit startup that partners with leading charitable organizations to launch ETFs that carry a specific social impact theme.Understanding and communicating these social priorities to a financial intermediary and then constructing a portfolio around it is ""next to impossible,"" he noted.His company, Impact Shares, is launching the first ETF focused on women empowerment that will screen for sexual harassment. The fund will contain around 200 to 300 stocks and will track the Equileap North American Women's Empowerment Index. The index applies 19 screening criteria, which cover gender balance in leadership and workforce, equal pay, flexible work options, safety at work and freedom from violence, abuse and sexual harassment.It is due to debut in the first quarter of 2018 under the name of Impact Shares YWCA Women's Empowerment ETF, under the ticker WOMN. It is being launched in association with the not-for-profit women's organization YWCA Metropolitan Chicago, to which it will donate management fees after expenses.Two other funds that focus on women empowerment but do not screen for sexual harassment are $358 million SPDR SSGA Gender Diversity ETF (SHE) and $37 million Barclays Women in Leadership ETN (WIL).While there's currently no ESG fund that explicitly screens for sexual harassment, it wouldn't be a stretch to image that a high-profile sexual harassment or abuse case involving a CEO might trigger a flag on grounds that the case draws unacceptable controversy, says Alex Bryan, director of passive strategies research for North America at Morningstar.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.For example, $3.8 billion Vanguard FTSE Social Index (VFTSX) ""avoids stocks involved in controversies related to labor standards, human rights and environmental impact,"" writes Bryan in a recent report. ""Constituents must meet a minimum level of diversity in their leadership ranks to qualify for inclusion.""
"
19,ETN,"Vanguard FTSE Social Index is ""one of the cheapest and best-diversified U.S.-focused socially conscious funds around,"" Bryan said.Sexual harassment is not an issue that often will percolate to the top of corporate management, Bryan says. ""And when it does, an ESG manager can get into some trouble if they're owning a firm that is involved in a high-profile sexual harassment controversy,"" he said. ""There will be pressure on these managers to start to take this into account, but again, I think that's probably a little bit further out in terms of implementation, because this is not something they're talking about now.""The industry is starting to feel the public pressure and usually it takes some time for that to translate into actual changes in the way that products are being managed, he added.RELATED:Will This Hot Area Become The Next Big Trend For ESG Investors?AI, Bitcoin On Your Radar?

20,ETN,"The Nasdaq composite led another broad-based rally Friday on the back of decent buying in the semiconductor, retail internet, internet content and other technology sectors to cap a rosy start to 2018.X The tech-rich index, up nearly 0.7% at around 3 p.m. ET, also got an assist from fast growing firms in the game software space, such as Electronic Arts (EA) and Activision Blizzard (ATVI). The former, up 5% to 112.46, reclaimed both its 50- and 200-day moving averages in swift trading, a positive sign. Watch for a potential new base to finish.Meanwhile, Activision, a nice winner in 2017, is also showing nice support at the 50- and 200-day moving averages lately, but there's clear upside price resistance near the 66-67 level.Stiff gains in heavier than usual volume are a bullish trend, for it hints at a strong appetite for equities by the institutional crowd, i.e. mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, insurers and pension managers.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average were not far behind, up around 0.5% to 0.6%. The Nasdaq is poised to finish the week up more than 3%. Six of the 30 Dow Jones industrial average components rallied 1 point or more.Another Dow 30 component, DowDuPont (DWDP), is having a terrific week, rising for a fourth straight session and moving further past a 73.95 entry in a sound flat base. Shares are up 1% to 75.28 in mildly below-average turnover.Keep an eye on the chemical giant's relative strength line, drawn in blue in all IBD and MarketSmith charts. A sharply rising line means a stock is sharply beating the S&P 500. That's one key to market outperformance for your portfolio. Also, if DowDuPont's RS line stretches into new high ground, that would also be bullish.Meanwhile, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) delivered a solid rebound, rising 6% to 2,347 and snapping a ""mild"" three-day losing streak.As noted in a Stock Market Today column earlier this week, the Bitcoin-tracking ETF is not at any proper buy point. Keep watching to see if it keeps the current correction to a reasonable decline.Given that Bitcoin Investment soared more than 1,500% last year, it's totally acceptable to see a drop in the 40% to 50% range off the 3,522 all-time peak. However, the market laws of supply and demand still apply. Over time, you want to see this and any other ETF or ETN (exchange-traded note) rise in higher or above-average trade, and fall in lighter turnover.Trading exchanges CME Group (CME) and Cboe Global Markets (CBOE) could be alternatives to playing the Bitcoin trend, but keep in mind that Bitcoin futures trading activity, while increasing, is still small for both of these companies relative to their gigantic business involved with equity index, option, fixed income and commodities derivatives.CME Group, up fractionally on Friday, got a solid bounce off the 50-day moving average earlier in the week. The stock may form a new base, but for now it's well extended after clearing a 128.06 buy point in a good flat base in active turnover on Sept. 6 last year.Meanwhile, government bond investors did not ruffle their feathers following a smaller than expected increase in monthly U.S. payrolls. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond, in fact, edged up to 2.47%, meaning that bond prices fell on selling pressure. The yield is still below a 2.62% peak seen in 2017, but one could reasonably expect the yield to continue rising amid broad expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise the cost of money perhaps three more times this year.In December 2015, the Fed pushed the fed funds rate on overnight loans to big banks from a near-zero level to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%. In December last year, the U.S. central bank raised rates for a fifth time, sending the fed funds rate to a 1.25%-1.5% range.RELATED:The Bull Market Is Still Hot: What Should You Do Now?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneA Screen For Excellent Growth Stocks: Inside IBD 50How To Achieve Great Long-Term Investing Returns In Stocks: Use This Simple Routine

24,ETN,"With the stock market climbing to record highs, it's no surprise that many leveraged equity exchange traded funds have produced big returns. We ran a screen for the ETFs with the highest IBD Relative Strength Ratings and ranked them by the biggest year-to-date returns as tracked by Morningstar Direct through Sept. 19. Those making the list trade a minimum average daily volume of at least 50,000 shares. The ETFs' RS Ratings, which are updated daily, on Sept. 19 ranged from 93 to 99.IBD's RS Ratings run from 1 to 99, with 99 being the highest. ETFs with RS Ratings in the 90s are showing exceptional stock market strength.Leveraged equity funds, which use debt and other financial derivatives to amplify the performance of their underlying index, accounted for nine of the 20 ETFs in the accompanying table. Such ETFs can post strong gains when the tide is right — but can drop sharply when the tide changes. They tend to carry higher expense ratios than their nonleveraged counterparts.IBD'S TAKE: On the hunt for ETF ideas that may be worth a closer look? Check out IBD's weekly ETF Leaders column for a featured fund and a list of highly rated ETFs.The top performer, though, is nonleveraged Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC). Shares are up more than 400% this year as bitcoin prices have skyrocketed, even though they have come down sharply in recent weeks.Many of the ETFs on this list are well extended from their ideal buy points. But several leveraged equity funds are setting up potential buy opportunities or are in buy range.Direxion Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares (SOXL), which has nearly doubled in price YTD, climbed past a 113.18 buy point Tuesday. It fell below the entry Wednesday and Thursday, as chip stocks took a hit, and are now nearly 5% below the buy point. SOXL, which has attracted $338.2 million in assets, aims to provide three times the performance of the Philly semiconductor index.VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV) is building the right side of a cup base with a potential buy point at 97.01. As its name implies, XIV tries to replicate the inverse of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. The $1.5 billion exchange traded note has returned 97% YTD. ETNs are senior debt notes issued by an underwriting bank.ProShares Short VIX Short-Term Futures (SVXY), 95% YTD, also targets the inverse performance of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index. It's also working on the right side of a base, with a potential buy point of 93.53. The fund has gathered $1.3 billion in assets.In SVXY's last run-up from a breakout in July, it rose 10% from an 84.50 buy point to the top of its current base. XIV showed similar action.ProShares UltraProQQQ (TQQQ), up 82% YTD, continues to trade near a 116.45 flat-base buy point. It's also looking for support near the 50-day moving average. A solid bounce off the support line could offer a buy opportunity as well. The $1.9 billion fund seeks to provide three times the daily performance of the Nasdaq 100 Index.ProShares UltraPro Dow30 (UDOW), up 47% YTD, is near the top of a buy range from a 67.69 flat-base entry. Shares rallied 17% from a late-May breakout to the start of the most recent pattern.

And just one of those, iPath Bloomberg Copper Subindex Total Return ETN (JJC), outperformed the S&P 500 with a 14.3% return vs. 11.9% for the benchmark index.XStill, that's a vast improvement compared with negative average annual returns over the past three and five years. Copper, gold, silver and platinum were among ETPs with positive YTD gains.""Industrial metals have rallied on healthy demand and lower supply, and bellwether firms in related sectors have reported upbeat earnings and outlooks,"" Richard Turnill, BlackRock's global chief investment strategist, said in a July 31 report. ""We see stability in commodities prices but are selective in related stocks and bonds.""JJC cleared a 32.49 buy point of a shallow, five-month cup base on July 26 and is trading at its best levels in more than two years. The exchange traded note (ETN) is still in a buy zone from the entry.Like ETFs or stocks, ETNs track an index and are traded on an exchange. But ETFs are funds that hold assets, while ETNs are senior debt notes issued by an underwriting bank. Similar to other types of debt, it's a promise to pay ETN holders a return at maturity. The return is based on the performance of the ETN's benchmark.JJC has attracted $69.3 million in assets since its October 2007 launch. The underlying index reflects potential returns available via an unleveraged investment in the futures contracts on copper. The ETN carries a 0.75% expense ratio.""Industrial metals have generally outperformed their commodity peers this year, with copper prices hitting a two-year high last week,"" Turnill said. ""A big reason for the rally: Production has been falling from last year's levels.""PowerShares DB Base Metals (DBB) just lagged the S&P 500 with an 11.8% YTD gain. It remains in buy range from a 16.65 cup-with-handle entry. The $216.5 million fund tracks the DBIQ Optimum Yield Industrial Metals Index Excess Return, which is composed of futures contracts on aluminum, zinc and copper. It also has a 0.75% expense ratio.Moving down the list, iShares Gold Trust (IAU) and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) returned 10.2% and 10.1%, respectively, through Aug. 1.

30,ETN,"As a much-vaunted Trump reflation trade fizzled and the U.S. president found himself embroiled in controversy, the big market surprise in the first half was that volatility actually fell.Traders who shorted the VIX saw their bets pay off as the gauge plunged 20%, taking its quarterly average to the lowest level since 2006. The question is, how long can it last?JPMorgan Chase is warning of more market turbulence as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan begin paring their economic stimulus, while Goldman Sachs Group says net positions in exchange-traded products favor long bets on volatility over short. In other words, investors are bracing for less-stable times. These charts show how:As the CBOE Volatility Index continued to edge lower this year, investors increasingly paid up to protect against a rebound, sending the cost of calls vs. puts to the highest level since October 2015.VIX options volume has surged this year, with an average of almost 680,000 contracts changing hands on average each day. Nearly 2.7 calls traded for each put, the most since 2007. At around 4-to-1, the call-to-put ratio is at its highest since September 2014.The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures (VXX) ETN, the most popular security that gains when volatility rises, had inflows in June for a fifth month out of six this year. Investors have reduced their bets against the exchange-traded note, sending the short interest to 23% of shares outstanding from 48% in March, according to IHS Markit data.The VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX Short Term (TVIX) ETN and ProShares Ultra VIX Short-Term Futures (UVXY) ETF, two levered products, also saw inflows in June. The VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term ETN (XIV), which profits with falling volatility, had its first monthly withdrawals since February, even as it continued its advance. It's gained 76% this year.But while hedgers are putting on strategies to protect against market turmoil, the crucial question of timing remains. Low correlation has been key to subdued swings and is one of the factors that Morgan Stanley monitors to detect a shift in the volatility regime.For now, Goldman Sachs recommends being selective when buying options as a large jump in volatility is needed to offset the carry cost of purchasing contracts. While the VIX rebounded in June — the month in which the index recorded the highest number of monthly gains in the last 10 years — it's fallen in three of the past four Julys. It gained 3.2% at 10:44 a.m. in New York.

37,ETN,"Jim Cline was semiretired at 56, after an intense career as a manufacturing division head, finally able to enjoy fishing, boating, ham radio and remodeling his home.Then at the end of 2007, his former boss, Ron Kaplan, called him for help to turn around Trex (TREX), the world leader in alternatives to wood for building backyard decks. It had been run into the ground by a dysfunctional bureaucracy and was on the verge of bankruptcy.""I was attracted by the enormous challenge, a high-risk, high-reward opportunity,"" Cline told IBD. Before agreeing to take the job as CFO and right hand to Kaplan, its brand-new CEO, he visited the Winchester, Va., plant. ""I was impressed with some of the directors and middle managers, who knew the solutions, but were having a hard time getting them implemented.""Cline succeeded Kaplan, now chairman, as CEO in August 2015. Today, Trex is the global leader in the industry, and Zack Ajzenman of Griffin Securities estimates its 2016 revenues at $477.3 million, up from $440.8 million in 2015, and net income at $71.9 million vs. the prior year's $48.1 million. Since Cline and Kaplan took over, the stock has risen from 4 (adjusted for stock buybacks) to around 68.Cline, 65, grew up in Van Wert, Ohio, a farm community where his dad was a high school teacher and coach, and his mother ran a nursery in their basement. He knew he'd have to pay his own way to college and worked hard in his free time to save up. In two summers at Continental Can, a mentor showed him how to deal with factory-floor politics, which included winning friends by doing the hardest jobs and listening to the true leaders, who weren't necessarily the titled managers or shop stewards.While at Bowling Green State University, Cline cleaned the restrooms in his dorm to make ends meet, before graduating in 1973 with a degree in business accounting. His first job was as a cost accountant for a division of Eaton (ETN) in Roxboro, N.C. ""I learned a lot by being willing to do everything from payroll to inventory,"" he said.In 1976, Cline joined True Temper Hardware, which made lawn care and construction products and is now part of Griffon (GFF), and eventually he was made the director of finance. ""I went through seven ownership changes in my 18 years there and learned that new management always wants things done differently,"" said Cline, ""and to thrive you need to be very flexible and learn to adapt to new situations.""In 1994, he was recruited by Harsco (HSC) to be the vice president and controller of its GasServ division in Harrisburg, Pa., which made gas containment and control devices, including high-pressure aluminum cylinders infused with resins and Kevlar fiber to hold CNG and other gases. Kaplan was the president, and Cline says he was ""very tough and forced you to really be on your toes.""When Kaplan left in 2005, Cline took over and prepared the division for sale, which took place in 2007. Cline agreed to stay on for up to six months to help the new owners make the transition, but quickly realized that ""when you've run a division and someone else comes in and wants to do things in a dramatically new way, it's hard to stay.""Two months after the takeover, Cline received the SOS from Kaplan about Trex. They conferred by phone on some big decisions in January 2008 to help stave off bankruptcy.Cline began attending board meetings the following month, and joined as CFO in March. Over a dozen executives were let go.""Trex had excessive inventories and receivables that were not being properly managed,"" said Cline. ""Their materials requirement planning system hadn't been implemented to forecast needs. Quality control was poor and we had to grind up and recycle much of what had already been manufactured.""The most important initial change was changing the bonus system. It had been based on paying associates once a year, based on EPS, and many of them had no idea what that really was and what they could do about it. ""They hadn't been paid bonuses in several years, so we gave them $500 as a down payment towards our new monthly bonus plan, if the cost of production was lowered, while improving quality,"" said Cline. ""We invited everyone to give us their best ideas, and they have almost always earned bonuses since then.""Things had to move so fast initially to keep Trex from going out of business that Cline and Kaplan had little time to confer about the decisions each was making.In 2009, they asked research and development to come up with a better product that could last much longer and the result was Transcend, which was introduced the following year, revolutionizing the industry. Made from recycled plastic bags from retailers, and sawdust and chips from cabinet and furniture makers, its ""wood-alternative"" decks are guaranteed to be immune to termites, staining, fading, rotting, splintering and scratching for 25 years (the exact formula for creating it is a trade secret known only to a handful).  Less expensive versions are designed for different retail channels, including Lowe's (LOW), Home Depot (HD) and pro lumberyards, but carry the same warranty.Trex has won awards for having 95% of its products made from recycled materials, saving 200,000 tons of waste from going into landfills, while requiring no trees need to be cut down. Yet its appeal isn't so much the green factor, but the amount of money that a wood alternative can save compared with the expense of maintaining traditional wooden decks.Trex achieved financial stability in 2011, inventory turns have nearly doubled since then, and the company has paid off its long-term debt. In August 2015, Kaplan handed the reins to Cline and remains as chairman.Ajzenman is projecting 2017 net sales of $519 million, with net income of $82.9 million. While there doesn't appear to be much growth in new U.S. retail outlets beyond the current nearly 9,000, there is plenty of room for more profitability in market share from the ""composite wood alternative decking"" industry, with Trex having an estimated 44% vs. 30% five years ago. Its primary competitors are Advanced Environmental Recycling Technologies (AERT) and privately held Fiberon and AZEK/Timber Tech.That niche is just 16% of the total decking industry, and Cline anticipates taking increasing share from the companies making wood decks (a 1% gain would translate into $50 million in sales for Trex). Ajzenman also sees repair and remodeling spending, the source of 95% of Trex's business, growing 7.5% through the third quarter of this year, while Cline is aiming to add to its current tiny share of new homes that include its decks. He is also planning to expand overseas, especially in Europe, Latin America and Australia.Last year, the company bolstered the number of its sales reps to train retailers in the benefits of its product lines and has opened Trex University at headquarters, which both contractors and DIY consumers can attend.Trex has also diversified by acquiring and licensing other products, from substructures and outdoor furniture to stairways and lighting.""Jim motivates his colleagues with a combination of thoughtful analysis, concise communication and razor-sharp execution,"" Kaplan said. ""His quiet rectitude and humility instill respect in those in his charge. His staff would follow him anywhere.""Helped turn around Trex, which makes decking out of alternatives to wood.Overcame: The threat of corporate bankruptcy.Lesson: Listen to workers at every level.""Spending time in the field is important. You get to know who you can rely on and who's coasting.""RELATED:Is Trex On Deck To Be The Next Breakout Building Stock?It's Been All Business For Green Bay Packers' Great-Turned-ExecutiveFor Kayak Founder, Team-Building Comes First

38,ETN,"Like Fred and Ginger or wine and cheese, the oldest gold exchange traded fund and its freshly launched sibling seem to make the perfect pairing.The new SPDR Long Dollar Gold Trust (GLDW), like the $30.43 billion SDPR Gold Shares (GLD), gives investors the portfolio diversification benefits of owning gold. Unlike that older ETF, GLDW seeks to mitigate the potential hurt to gold investments from a strong dollar.That's a pain American investors have grown familiar with over the past three years. Between 2014 and 2016, as the greenback rallied, the price of gold fell 5% in terms of the U.S. dollar but it went up 25% in terms of the euro, according to State Street Global Advisors (SSGA).Gold and the U.S. dollar tend to move in opposite directions.GLDW attempts to solve the vexing problem of how to invest in gold when the dollar is strengthening. It tracks an index combining a long position in physical gold with a long position in the greenback, using swap agreements.So the new ETF offsets the impact of a rallying dollar by, in effect, owning gold with a basket of foreign currencies. This basket includes the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian dollar, Swedish krona and Swiss franc.""Together, GLDW and GLD may allow investors to enjoy the diversification benefits of holding gold in either strong or weak dollar environments,"" said Joseph Cavatoni of World Gold Council, which helped to launch the new gold ETF.The new gold ETF has a 0.50% expense ratio vs. 0.40% for its older counterpart.

39,ETN,"Exchange traded funds tracking major stock indexes fell on Monday, as investors nervously eyed the fallout from an immigration measure signed by President Donald Trump.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) gave up 0.6% on the stock market today as it trades just under a 52-week high of 229.71.Gold ETFs, which are a haven asset, rose on Monday as the new administration's action on immigration continued to draw sharp criticism at home and abroad.The measure, signed by Trump on Friday, bars refugees from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States. While ostensibly aiming at countries seen to harbor or sponsor terrorists, it has been condemned in many circles for causing chaos and as undermining American values.SDPR Gold Shares (GLD) bounced 0.4% higher on Monday.""Gold prices are slightly higher on a corrective rebound from recent selling pressure that saw prices hit a three-week low last Friday,"" wrote Kitco senior technical analyst Jim Wyckoff.Making note of the new U.S. president's immigration measure, Wyckoff added: ""This uncertainty and any related world stock market weakness is at least a mildly bullish element for the safe-haven gold market.""Although gold prices rose, VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ), offering exposure to gold stocks, surrendered early gains of nearly 2% to close lower.The defensive utility sector was the only sector of the S&P 500 to advance in Monday trading, adding 0.1%.Amid jitters in the stock market, iPath S&P 500 VIX ST Futures (VXX), an exchange traded note, spiked as much as 6.0% intraday.

44,ETN,"Anxiety may have been hard to locate in the U.S. equity market before Tuesday's downdraft. But that didn't mean it wasn't there.One measure of expected turbulence, the relative cost of options that pay when stocks decline vs. those that appreciate when they rise, jumped to the highest level ever recorded just before the S&P 500 Index buckled on Tuesday. Call it the new normal for investors conditioned to expect the worst when it comes to politics, the economy and corporate earnings.Even with Hillary Clinton taking her biggest lead in the polls since August vs. Republican Donald Trump, the relative cost of hedging a 5% decline in an exchange traded fund tracking the S&P 500 is twice the cost of betting on a gain, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. High readings in the indicator known as skew came even as the CBOE Volatility Index spent the previous three weeks trading below 14, on average.Blame it partly on the experience of investors during the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, when weeks of calm was shattered by a political event and options worked in damping the resulting plunge. The market may be seeing its smallest fluctuations in more than a year, but traders remain on alert for events that could whip up declines.""If there's a potential shock to the system when you have low volatility, that boosts skew,"" Matt Friedman, senior vice president of options trading at Convergex in New York, said by phone. ""Investors are bracing for potential downside risk, regardless of how likely it is. At the same time, you're seeing people dismiss the potential upside.""Upheavals that shatter prevailing calm in equities are becoming more frequent. Markets were shocked out of one of the longest stretches of tranquillity ever recorded last month when $600 billion was erased from the value of shares on Sept. 9. In the last two years there have been five similarly extreme shifts in volatility — as many as occurred in the prior two decades, according to data complied by Deutsche Bank AG and Bloomberg.The Deutsche Bank study examined instances of rapid mood transitions in U.S. equities, counting times when realized volatility in the S&P 500 surged from a very low level, below 10, to above 20 within six weeks. On that basis, the market has seen its prevailing calm broken five times since 2014, matching the total in the preceding 20 years — a stretch that encompasses two full-blown bear markets.At the same time, tools for hedging stocks or betting on declines are proliferating. Trading in exchange traded funds and notes tied to the VIX has gone from nothing a decade ago to hundreds of millions of shares a day. The iPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN recorded more volume on Sept. 13 than any company in the S&P 500, with a record 110 million shares changing hands.In the options market, traders are paying about twice as much for two-month contracts protecting against a 5% drop in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, relative to bullish ones, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The measure reached a record on Sept. 30, the data show.That's happened as Clinton has built about a 5-point lead on Trump in a race that includes third-party candidates, according to the RealClearPolitics poll average. The forecaster FiveThirtyEight on Tuesday gave Clinton an 83.6% change of winning in its polls-only model, approaching her high of 89.2% in mid-August.After closing the gap on Clinton during September, the Trump campaign has experienced setbacks in recent days, including a tape released on Oct. 7 of the Republican candidate making lewd comments about women. Now, less than a month before Election Day, the Republican party is erupting into open warfare, with Trump pledging to campaign unshackled from party leaders.""There's some frustration about the state of political discourse in the country, and the rancor between and even within the two sides,"" said John Carey, a Boston-based fund manager at Pioneer Investment Management, which oversees about $230 billion. ""There's concern about how we're going to possibly stitch this back into one working country again. That's weighed on peoples' nerves and weighed on their sense of security.""The high skew on the S&P 500 ETF stands in contrast to trading in VIX contracts, which show investors only expecting a post-election, single-day move of about 1.6% for the S&P 500, according to Pravit Chintawongvanich, head derivatives strategist at Macro Risk Advisors in New York. That's less than half the average following the past two presidential votes and in line with the historical average dating back to 1968.Wall Street forecasters also don't appear worried about the possibility of a major election-based decline. They foresee the S&P 500 finishing the year at 2,175, according to a survey of 19 strategists. That's 1.8% higher than the index's closing price on Tuesday.""People are concentrating so much on hedging, they might be overlooking a relief rally,"" said Friedman. ""We're up 5% on the year, yet it seems like everyone is still waiting to be sold on why we can continue higher.""

45,ETN,"It's so far been a good week for stocks on IBD's Dividend Leaders list. Prudential Financial (PRU) and Principal Financial Group (PFG) extended their multiweek advances to new highs. Invesco (IVZ) and Cummins (CMI) cleared brief consolidations and moved to new high ground.If current trading trends holds, next week may be even more promising. On IBD's current Dividend Leaders list, Toronto Dominion (TD) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) are each in the fourth week of flat consolidations. If they end this week without climbing to new highs, each will have formed a flat base.IBD'S TAKE: Use IBD's powerful research screens, based on CAN SLIM investing methodology, to quickly narrow your search for top dividend stocks.Cisco's chart is a bit more compelling than Toronto Dominion's. Cisco exited a 16-month consolidation in July, climbing to its highest mark in nine years before starting its current consolidation. The network gear maker's earnings aren't advancing in double-digit jumps like they were in 2007. But analyst consensus expects the company's revenue, which was 41% larger in fiscal 2016 than in 2007, is expected to leap 23% this year and 13% in fiscal 2018.Cisco's revenues this year are expanding as it acquires its way deeper into network security. Through August, it acquired Jasper and CliQr Technologies and CloudLock, for a total just shy of $2 billion. It is also reportedly eyeing Imperva, which analysts assess at around $1.5 billion. Cisco hoisted its dividend by 24% early this year, putting its yield at 3.3%.Earnings growth is expected to slow to 3% this fiscal year (ending in July), before rebounding to a 6% pace in 2018. Cisco plans to report its fiscal first quarter results after the market's close on Nov. 16.Toronto Dominion has been laboring in a flattish consolidation since late April. It briefly cleared a 45.84 buy point Sept. 6, then dropped 6% below that pivot. The pullback wasn't deep enough to trigger the 7% to 8% automatic sell rule. The drop below 10-week support occurred in above-average volume, but the volume increase also didn't trigger any alarms.Analysts expect that bank's earnings to fall 21% this year in a second straight decline, then bounce 6% in 2017. Revenue is projected to rise 11% and 16% in the next two quarters, accelerating to 19% growth for 2017. The bank's dividend currently yields 3.8%. The company plans to report fourth quarter results Dec. 1.Among other Dividend Leaders, Eaton (ETN) has formed a six-week flat base with 68.30 buy point. Emerson Electric (EMR) may be forming a handle on a nine-week cup base.

46,ETN,"Even though the U.S. exchange traded fund (ETF) was created 23 years ago, most financial advisors still consider this investment vehicle the new kid on the block. And many individual investors still have no idea what it is.If you're just learning about how to invest in ETFs, it will help to know what they are. Almost all ETFs are products governed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This act regulates open-end funds, closed-end funds and unit investment trusts (UITs). Most ETFs hold stocks or bonds and are structured either as open-end funds or UITs.There are other exchange traded products that get lumped in with ETFs. They have many similarities, but they are not traditional ETFs. Some hold commodities or commodity futures, such as the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). These are regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).Meanwhile, exchange traded notes (ETNs), like the iPath S&P GSCI Crude OIL TR ETN (OIL) are unsecured debt instruments issued by banks. ETNs and exchange traded commodities (ETCs) have different structures and are taxed differently than ETFs. This article will only deal with 40 Act ETFs.ETFs have many structural similarities to mutual funds, which are also open-end funds governed by the 40 Act. They both hold portfolios of securities, typically stocks or bonds. They both issue and redeem shares in their portfolios. The shares are a proportion of the assets in the portfolio.The two big differences are that the mutual fund gets a net asset value (NAV) each day after the market closes, whereas the ETF's price fluctuates intraday because it trades on an exchange when the market is open. The other difference is that the mutual fund sells and redeems its shares directly with its shareholders. Whereas the ETF sells its shares on the stock exchange, where investors trade their shares with each other.The main benefits ETFs offer over mutual funds: ETFs have greater flexibility, lower fees, increased tax efficiency and greater transparency.The largest sponsors of ETFs are BlackRock with $918.4 billion in assets under management (AUM), Vanguard with $568.6 billion AUM, State Street Global Advisors with $449.5 billion, of which $200.0 billion is just one fund, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), Invesco PowerShares with $102.3 billion, and Charles Schwab with $52.5 billion (according to ETF.com as of Sept. 15).""When people start investing with ETFs we recommend that they focus on five areas: exposure, cost, structure, liquidity and finally, price,"" said Brett Mossman, managing director and lead of BlackRock portfolio solutions. ""With liquidity, some of the things to look at are: How many dollars are traded in the instrument? How often does the instrument trade? And could you trade in size without moving the price?""When looking for ETFs, first you need to ask what kind of asset class you're looking for, said Alex Bryan, ETF analyst at Morningstar. Is it core U.S. stocks or bonds? Once you answer that, screen for ETFs in that group based on things like expense ratio, or how well-diversified the funds are, such as what percentage of the portfolio is in the top 10 holdings. A more diversified fund is a better composition of the market and a better starting place, said Bryan.""Lower-cost funds give you a better chance of meeting you investment objectives because cost is the one thing you can control. The less you pay, the more you keep,"" said Bryan.Cost is not just the explicit fee of the expense ratio, but also the tax cost and the bid/ask spread. How tax efficient is the fund? Also, what is the cost of liquidity? Does the fund trade efficiently?""The strategy is the first step and the implementation is the second step,"" said Jim Rowley, senior investment analyst at Vanguard. ""No matter what product you choose, the product is to supposed to track an index and that index's definition. So, when you think about how the manager implements it, how well does he replicate the index?""""At the end of the day, getting the right exposure matters more than anything,"" said Mossman. ""You can buy the cheapest product, but if it's not the right exposure you're not going to have a good experience.""For instance, Mossman says a lot of ETFs have ""Emerging Markets"" in their names. However, across these ETFs are different definitions of what they consider emerging markets. This can result in very different sector and country weightings. For instance, in the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index ETF (EEM), South Korea is the largest country. Meanwhile, South Korea isn't even included in the SPDR S&P Emerging Markets ETF (GMM). So, a seemingly similar name, emerging markets, can lead to a big difference in exposures.RELATED: Latest ETF News

47,ETN,"Major stock market index ETFs broke lower Friday amid renewed concerns that the Fed will raise interests rates soon.SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) plunged 1.4%, slicing under its 50-day moving average for the first time since late June.All stock market sectors were lower near midday, with SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) and Financial Services Select Sector SPDR (XLFS) down the least by 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE) was down the most, by 2.8%.Comments from Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, traditionally seen as a dovish policymaker, fueled negative sentiment. He didn't really say anything earth-shattering, other than to say he backs gradual interest-rate hikes. The Fed has three meetings left this year: Sept. 20-21, Nov. 1-2 and Dec. 13-14. Futures traders think there's a 30% chance the Fed will hike at the September meeting, but the chances rise to around 60% in December.XLFS holdings Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C) and US Bancorp (USB) were up as much as 0.7%.

It's 2% off its 52-week high. Gold tends to fall when interest rates rise and the dollar strengthens. Higher rates tend to raise the opportunity cost of holding gold, a nonyielding safe-haven asset, while boosting the dollar in which it is priced.VanEck Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) tumbled 3.5% to 26.91.

48,ETN,"It's time to position for the end of that peaceful, easy feeling that's enveloped markets this summer ahead of a month fraught with event risk, says Bank of America Merrill Lynch.""We remain 'cynically bullish' on financial asset prices,"" writes a team led by Chief Investment Strategist Michael Hartnett. ""Tactically, the 3P's (Positioning, Policy, Profits) still argue for upside; but with risk assets up 15%-20% since Feb, and Sep a big 'policy month' we once again recommend buying volatility.""Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's speech at Jackson Hole on Friday will usher in a period in which central bankers dominate headlines, with the Reserve Bank of Australia, Bank of Canada, European Central Bank, Bank of England, Bank of Japan, Bank of Mexico, and the Fed all slated to deliver interest rate announcements in September — all against the backdrop of the U.S. elections creeping closer.Hartnett concludes that investors aren't positioned for a firming macroeconomic environment coupled with a Federal Reserve that's more aggressive with rate hikes than is currently priced in. This combination could produce a ""bond shock"" that has the potential to roil equity markets, as well:Expectations for a dovish Fed are coinciding with macro strength in the U.S. (most obviously in housing and consumer spending) as well as highest level of wage inflation since January 2010. If average hourly earnings push above 3% year over year, it will be hard for bond yields to remain so low. But the biggest catalyst for higher yields would be stronger economic data in Europe and Japan, reversing the DM demand for Treasuries.In a separate note,  Head of U.S. Equity and Quantitative Strategy Savita Subramanian pointed to seasonality — that September is typically the worst month for U.S. stocks — as one of 10 reasons to expect a pullback in equities.Bank of America joins strategists at UBS Securities LLC in warning investors to prepare for a mean reversion in volatility.Volatility has had seemingly nowhere to go but up for the vast majority of the past four years, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) averaging 15.34 since 2013, relative to its long-term average of 19.75. In fact, this index hasn't risen by a full point in a single session since the U.K. referendum in June.And it's been hard to make money betting on higher volatility even when the spot levels of the VIX move higher. That's because investors aren't able to simply buy the VIX index to take a long volatility position. With the curve in relatively steep contango in the front end, the negative roll-down costs of a long position weigh heavily on the performance of exchange-traded products that hold short-term VIX futures.Macro Risk Advisors Head Derivatives Strategist Pravit Chintawongvanich observed that 57% of the decline in the iPath S&P 500 VIX short-term futures ETN from June 30 (in the wake of the Brexit vote) until Aug. 22 has been attributable to this rolldown, and less than half to the actual drop in implied volatility.

57,ETN,"Aglow with prospects for ongoing profit gains, surging volume and talk of opportunities in emerging growth areas, Acuity Brands lit up Wall Street last week after the smart-lighting specialist reported a blowout quarter that kept up a long-running hot streak.Shares of Acuity (AYI) soared more than 13% to a new high on April 6 following its fiscal-second-quarter results. The designer and maker of innovative and energy-saving lighting products turned out its seventh straight quarter of double-digit profit growth and its biggest sales gain in years.Acuity shares moved sideways after that, then advanced Wednesday to a new closing high. The stock and is up more than 50% year-over-year.""Acuity is one of the industrial stocks that offers the best growth and visibility on that growth,"" CLSA Americas analyst Jeremie Capron told IBD. ""We think Acuity is on top of the ongoing technological shift we're seeing in the lighting industry.""Capron points out that Acuity's move into LED (light-emitting-diode) illumination systems provided organic growth in excess of 40% for the company's second quarter, which ended Feb. 29. The LED business now accounts for over 50% of Acuity's total revenue, he adds, and it's the fastest growing piece of the business.Not only does Acuity benefit from a surge in demand for its LED products, it's also seeing an uptick in both nonresidential and residential construction activity and ongoing remodeling and retrofitting work. Further, the company isn't afraid to make acquisitions.Acuity's growth trajectory is expected to remain strong, based on macro and internal trends.""We remain bullish about our prospects for continued future profitable growth,"" Chief Executive Vernon Nagel said recently in a prepared statement. ""Third-party forecasts as well as key leading indicators suggest that the growth rate for the North American lighting market, which includes renovation and retrofit activity, will be in the mid- to upper-single-digit range for fiscal 2016 with expectations that overall demand in our end markets will continue to experience solid growth over the next several years.""Acuity’s revenue is split 50-50 between new construction and retrofitting and replacing existing fixtures, Cowen analyst Jeffrey Osborne told IBD. The rest of the industry generates about 30% of its revenue from new construction, with the remainder coming from retrofitting and replacing existing fixtures, he says.""That’s very important as it relates to profitability,"" said Osborne.New buildings, he adds, usually require multiple lighting installations, which result in higher profits compared to just replacing existing fixtures. The latter, Osborne says, is ""not very profitable and more competitive.""As a result, Acuity’s gross margin exceeds 40%, while most of its peers are in the 20%-30% range, said Osborne.""The nonresidential (new) construction cycle is very strong now,"" he added. ""Investors were fearful Acuity’s business would start to decline because of their concern over the economy and concerns that new construction would start slowing down. Management went to great lengths on the second-quarter conference call to say the pipeline of activity is very strong and not slowing down.""Acuity continues to take share in the North American lighting market, he says, with revenue growing more than 20%, while the industry is growing at the mid to high single digits.The company’s products include lighting systems known as luminaires, lighting and building controls, lighting components, power supplies and prismatic skylights. They also do integrated lighting systems for indoors and outdoors using a combination of light sources -- as well as software -- to manage light levels and optimize energy.Acuity sells under several brands, such as Lithonia Lighting, Holophane and Gotham. Rivals include LED light-bulb maker Cree (CREE), Eaton (ETN) and Philips (PHG).Acuity's financial picture appears luminous. The company's adjusted second-quarter earnings soared 53% to $1.80 a share, smashing views. Sales climbed 26% to $777.8 million, 17% of which came from an increase in volume, with the remaining 11% stemming from acquisitions.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year fiscal 2016 earnings to rise 46% to $7.87 a share. They project a 20% gain in 2017 and a 24% increase in 2018.One key growth driver has been acquisitions. Capron says Acuity's merger strategy has become ""more aggressive"" the past couple of years.Capron says the most interesting move on that front was Acuity's acquisition of Distech Controls in September. Distech provides building automation and energy management solutions. It also integrates lights, HVAC, closed-circuit television and other energy-efficiency systems.Capron says the acquisition marked the first time Acuity entered a segment outside its core lighting business. Owning a company in the building automation space should boost Acuity's lighting sales, he says. He sees more buys on tap for Acuity.Ask management, though, and an area where they see potential is in the so-called ""Internet of Things.""""The transition to solid-state lighting provides the opportunity for lighting to be integrated with other building automation systems to create an optimal platform for enabling the 'Internet of Things,' which will support the advancement of smart buildings, smart cities and the smart grid,"" the company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Acuity already has applications tied to the Internet of Things. The company has converted more than 12 million square feet of space for customers utilizing about 200,000 beacon-enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with usable information, CEO Nagel said on the second-quarter conference call.He explained the potential further when announcing second-quarter results.""We believe the lighting and lighting-related industry as well as building automation systems will experience solid growth over the next decade,"" he said, ""particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront, along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things.""

58,ETN,"Investors fled U.S. stocks for the safety of longer-term bond ETFs Tuesday, in the process driving up a key volatility ETN for the third straight day.The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average snapped a five-session winning streak as jittery investors digested weak Chinese trade data and await key monetary policy decisions at home and abroad.IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) popped 3.8% on the stock market today, marking its third advance in as many days.Its rally reflects renewed fears about crude oil prices, a weakening Chinese economy and global growth concerns, as well as investors’ anxiety that these problems may tip the U.S. into a recession.VXX provides access to equity market volatility through the CBOE Volatility Index ( or, simply, ""the VIX,"" a trusted gauge of fear in the markets) futures.“If you own this ETN, you are expecting that volatility will increase over the coming month relative to the current month,” Monish Shah, head of ETF trading at Mizuho Securities USA, recently told IBD.Recent gains for the VXX signal a bearish turn in sentiment after a three-week rally for major U.S. indexes.The S&P 500 index hit bottom Feb. 11 and has gained 8.3% since then. The VIX index fell 32% in the same period.Despite that decline for VXX, the ETN actually absorbed $524 million from Feb. 11 to date, including $415 million in the last week alone, according to Shah. That's more than half the assets in the $997.2 million exchange traded note.That activity may reflect investors’ concerns that the current rally doesn’t have strong legs, he added.“At the back end, a lot of savvy investors are buying protection at a cheaper level,” Shah said.Investors wanting to hang onto their positions during a market pullback can buy VXX in the hope that its gains will offset any decline in their long positions.In other signs of risk-off sentiment Tuesday, Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury (EDV) added 1.6%. Its 89 RS Rating signifies that the long government bond ETF is outperforming 89% all stocks and ETFs tracked by IBD in the past 12 months.SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) closed down 0.5% in choppy trade.

64,ETN,"Whip out the shades. Acuity Brands' (AYI) fourth quarter shined brighter than Wall Street expected, easing worries about possible dimming as the LED-lighting-fixture company looked toward future smart street lights and interconnected systems.Shares recently faced pressure after rival Eaton (ETN) said at the Citi Industrials Conference on Sept. 17 that lighting had been weak since July, recalls Cowen & Co. analyst Jeffrey Osborne. But Acuity's 29% Q4 earnings growth to $1.63 a share and 14% revenue rise to $759.5 million pleased investors Wednesday, sending shares up 3.7%. Analysts had expected $1.62 on $754.9 million in Q4.For the year, per-share earnings grew 36% to $5.39, topping views by a penny. Revenue grew 13% to $2.71 billion, slightly ahead of consensus estimates of $2.7 billion.""I think investors went into the call with lower expectations of growth rates because of industrial peer commentary,"" Stifel analyst Sven Eenmaa told IBD. But Acuity showed ""very strong execution. That is clearly a positive. It looks like not a whole lot has changed in terms of market growth. Execution remains strong. They're executing on strategy.""Sales grew across most product categories and regions, with LED-based lighting solutions accounting for more than half of total Q4 net sales. And LED product sales grew ""by almost 50%"" this last quarter, CEO Vernon Nagel told analysts.Seven Years Ago: What's LED?Contrast this to seven years ago, when Acuity ""sold virtually no LED-based fixtures."" Nagel said the company invested ""significantly"" to become the digital-lighting market leader.He also noted that the key nonresidential construction market is still about 20% off its 2008 peak, while Acuity's net sales have grown 34% over that time. Acuity's business is split fairly evenly between new construction and renovation.""Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and full year were records for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio ... a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things,"" said Nagel.Interconnectedness is growing as ""smart"" homes and commercial buildings tap into the so-called Internet of Things.Buying Distech Controls, a building-automation and energy-management firm, ""makes a lot of sense"" for Acuity, said Cowen's Osborne. Distech integrates lights, HVAC, closed-circuit television and other energy efficiency systems.""The Holy Grail is to have a platform that can be the quarterback of that system,"" he said. ""Distech is one of the building blocks.""Management expects that its acquisition of Distech, completed in September, will be ""modestly accretive"" to the company in fiscal 2016. Acuity disclosed on Monday a partnership with Silver Spring Networks to co-develop a ""networked street-light control solution"" for cities, utilities and other networks, including ""smart"" street lights that can automatically dim or brighten depending on the weather.Internet Of Things Needs TimeAnalysts say Acuity's foray into the Internet of Things is mostly strategic and has yet to affect revenue, but the company could start to see material results in few years.""It remains a largely lighting and LED story, but they're sowing the seeds to drive growth here a couple of years (out),"" said Eenmaa.Acuity is a member of IBD's Building-Construction Products/Miscellaneous industry group, which ranks No. 21 out of 197 groups. Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS), Apogee Enterprises (APOG) and Mohawk Industries (MHK) are among its publicly traded peers in the group.Aside from Eaton, Acuity's competitors in the lighting space include Hubbell (HUBB), Philips (PHG), General Electric (GE) and several smaller companies.Lower-cost LED products have helped Acuity. Conversely, the trend has weighed on LED light-bulb maker Cree (CREE), which said in June that it would restructure its LED business to reflect overcapacity and downtrending prices.Cree shares are off 20% this year. Acuity stock is up 30% to 182.69.Strength In DiversificationAnalysts wonder about the August decline of AIA's Architecture Billings Index (ABI), a nonresidential building activity indicator. The index dipped below the key 50 mark to 49.1 from July's 54.7, though AIA's chief economist, Kermit Baker, said the ""minor dip should be quickly reversed.""Acuity is well-diversified enough to withstand August's downtick, said Stifel's Eenmaa.Acuity does not provide earnings guidance, but management highlighted the improving North American economy and consensus estimates for the region's lighting industry to grow in the ""mid- to upper-single-digit range"" for the company's fiscal 2016.Nagel expects its gross profit margin to ""improve over time.""Outpacing The MarketManagement is optimistic about its growth prospects.""Further, we expect to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve by executing our strategies to focus on growing renovation and tenant improvement projects, expand into underpenetrated geographies and channels, and grow from the continued introduction of new products and lighting solutions as part of our integrated, tiered solutions strategy,"" said Nagel.

"
66,ETN,"August saw a huge jump in the VIX index, which measures equity volatility. VIX ETPs are proving popular with investors amid the stock market choppiness.IBD spoke to Nick Cherney, head of exchange traded products at Janus Capital Group, about how VIX products can be used to trade long and short, to hedge and to manage risk.Cherney founded VelocityShares in 2009. The company quickly made a mark as a developer of sophisticated solutions for managing volatility for institutional investors and traders. VelocityShares' suite of six VIX products includes VIX Short Term ETN (VIIX), which gained 15% in the past month.In 2014, this upstart firm was acquired by the Janus group, which like other mutual fund giants has sought to make inroads into the flourishing ETF industry by acquiring small, innovative ETF providers.Cherney, 34, is an avid skier and coach with the Aspen Valley Ski Club who readily admits to suffering at Crossfit.IBD: What is volatility trading? What does trading VIX futures really mean?Nick Cherney: Volatility trading is ultimately about people expressing a view on three things: one, how volatile a market will actually be (realized volatility); two, how volatile everyone else thinks that market will be (implied volatility); and three, how much other investors are willing to pay to protect against that market volatility (call that the ""fear premium"").The simplest measure of volatility is purely mathematical: it would just be a measure of how large the daily swings in the S&P 500 index were, for example, and this is realized volatility, which all investors are naturally exposed to, but is not directly tradable. By far the most popular measure of equity volatility is the VIX index, which is a measure of people's expectations about the future.The VIX is based off of option prices, and tells us about the ""implied volatility"" of the equity market. It also is not directly tradable. The most important instrument people use to actually trade equity volatility is VIX futures (and exchange traded products, or ETPs, linked to VIX futures).VIX futures returns vary from the returns of the VIX based on the amount people are willing to pay to protect against the implied volatility of the VIX. Most of the time this ""fear premium"" means that VIX futures are priced much higher than the VIX itself, and are therefore very expensive to own outright.IBD: What does the huge jump in the VIX in August tell us?Cherney: Because the VIX is a measure of how much people are generally willing to pay to buy options, it represents the price of protection, which is why it is known as the ""fear gauge.""On Aug. 24 the VIX opened above 50, a level it had never reached before (or since) the 2008 financial crisis. This severely elevated VIX level shows that there was a very significant concern in the markets about how serious the equity market turbulence could become.The volatility event which began in mid-August is certainly the most significant since the fall of 2011, and while the VIX has since moderated and generally stayed below 30 throughout September, this is still far above the levels we have become accustomed to in 2015, generally in the mid teens.To declare the event over would require the VIX to fall 20% to 30% from those levels down into the mid teens.IBD: What drove record flows into VIX ETPs last month?Cherney: Most investors who use VIX ETPs are using them quite tactically, and generally when we see such large moves, that provides more opportunities (and of course risks) for tactical trading strategies. So we generally see that periods of elevated volatility are associated with increased trading volumes in VIX ETPs. In fact the most liquid VIX ETPs now regularly trade as much or more than many blue-chip stocks.From the end of July through its peak on Aug. 24, the VIX rose over 200% and VIX futures rose over 60%, and those types of moves tend to bring a lot of traders into the market, both initiating new positions and closing out existing positions.In August, in particular, we saw that most of the money flow in VIX ETPs was actually short VIX futures.This implies that while the VIX itself was rising as many investors bought protection, there were also a significant number of investors wagering that the VIX would fall back to more normal levels, and they were doing this by either redeeming long volatility products, or investing in short volatility products.As a result, at the end of August, there was just over $4 billion invested in VIX futures ETPs with about $1.8 billion of that in products that provide short exposure to VIX futures.IBD: How can VIX ETPs be used — to trade long and short, to hedge, to manage risk etc.?Cherney: VIX-related ETPs can be used for all of the above. There are a wide range of VIX-related ETPs on the market, including pure VIX futures-linked products, that can be long, leveraged long, or inverse.Typically, investors are using long and leveraged long products for extremely short periods of time to try to capitalize on short and abrupt moves upwards in the VIX. Many investors use short volatility products not only to capture quick downward movements in the VIX, but also to capitalize on the ""fear premium"" in VIX futures; in other words, their tendency to trend downward and significantly underperform the VIX itself.In addition, there are hedged-equity products available that combine long equity positions with VIX-futures based strategies as part of a more long-term solution to manage equity risk. (Editor's note: Janus Velocity Volatility Hedged Large Cap (SPXH) is an example of such a product.)So rather than have to engage in the daily decision-making and trading process with pure VIX ETPs, investors can gain exposure to VIX futures-based strategies in a vehicle which is designed to be used as part of a long-term asset allocation.IBD: What are risks and challenges investors need to be aware of?Cherney: Pure VIX-related ETPs are intended for use by sophisticated and knowledgeable investors who have evaluated and understand their risks, not just their benefits. The prospectus for each product outlines its risks in detail and is the best place for investors to gain a thorough understanding of each product they are considering.Follow Aparna Narayanan on Twitter @IBD_ANarayanan.

158,ETN,"First, the good news for Friday. Stocks closed out a tough day at session highs and semiconductor ETFs defied a broad sell-off.Gains for exchange traded funds invested in chipmakers came amid an earnings beat for Applied Materials (AMAT), with the stock gapping up 7.1%.SPDR S&P Semiconductor (XSD) popped 1.4% on the stock market today for an all-time closing high of 50.79. Reports for Q2 earnings have given the chipmaker segment a boost. Heavyweights that have beaten expectations include Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM).The tech-heavy Nasdaq has now risen for eight consecutive weeks.However, the major index-tracking ETFs slid lower Friday with losses extending widely across stock, bond and commodity sectors. Some market watchers attributed the cautious investor sentiment to a slew of recent hawkish comments from Federal Reserve officials.Utilities led the decline in the S&P 500, falling 1.2%.

168,ETN,"What's new in November?Twelve exchange-traded funds that give investors a stake in investments ranging from cybersecurity firms to commodity futures. Here's a close look at three that have hauled in $10 million or more apiece in under a month of trading in the stock market: PureFunds ISE CyberSecurity (HACK) launched Nov. 12 and has marshaled $25 million in assets so far. It invests in 30 hardware- and software-oriented cybersecurity companies, both infrastructure providers and service firms.The fund has about 86% of its assets allocated to the U.S., 9% to Israel, 4% to Japan and 2% to the Netherlands.HACK has a 0.75% expense ratio. The top five holdings include Vasco Data Security (VDSI),Imperva (IMPV), Qualsys (QLYS), Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Splunk (SPLK).""HACK's unique portfolio offers exposure to companies that are virtually unowned by broad-based technology ETFs,"" said Christian Magoon of Magoon Capital, a consultant on the new product.The cybersecurity market has made headlines for the wrong reasons lately (cue data breaches at big banks and big-box retailers). But this niche ETF affords investors an opportunity to tactically play a segment that some see as increasingly important. Somewhat-related peers include First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index Fund (SKYY) and Nasdaq Internet Portfolio (PNQI), both of which are slightly cheaper to own, with expense ratios of 0.60%.HACK entails some concentration risk — its top 10 stocks account for 58% of portfolio weighting. Cambria Global Momentum (GMOM) is a portfolio of diversified asset classes. That means domestic and foreign stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities and currencies. A fund of funds, GMOM shifts from one asset class to another based on volatility conditions and market cycles.As such, it differs from equity-focused ETFs such as PowerShares DWA Momentum (PDP) and iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor (MTUM). Both try to beat a broad benchmark index by holding stocks displaying higher momentum characteristics.GMOM seeks to protect investors from emotional decision-making, said fund manager Meb Faber. He selects the 17 holdings out of a universe of roughly 50 ETFs.""The fund attempts to achieve better than equity-like returns, while still having strict risk control methods,"" Faber said.Since its Nov. 4 launch, GMOM has gathered $17.6 million in assets. As an actively managed fund, it has a relatively high 0.94% expense ratio. By comparison, PDP and MTUM cost 0.65% and 0.15% in fees respectively. PowerShares DB Optimum Yield Diversified Commodity Strategy (PDBC) listed Nov. 7 and has picked up $9.9 million since.Another actively managed ETF, PDBC invests in 14 heavily traded commodity futures across the energy, precious metals, industrial metals and agriculture sectors.""Broad-based commodity exposure like PDBC may help diversify a portfolio's returns and improve investors' overall risk-adjusted returns,"" said Lorraine Wang, global head of ETF research for Invesco PowerShares.PDBC expands PowerShares smart beta portfolios to a total of 82. It has a 0.59% expense ratio — less than peers such as PowerShares DB Commodity Index (DBC) and iShares GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (GSG).

Here are some ETF ideas to consider as you sort through the hawkish and dovish signals from the Fed on policy normalization.  Go shorter. With a rate hike looking ever more likely, investors should…
"
214,ETN,"The first quarter was a stock pickers' market, given the great divide between the leaders and the laggards. Coffee heated up 62% as copper was hammered 11%. Russia crashed 17% while Egypt rallied 24%.
"
215,ETN,"How should investors position their portfolios in the second quarter? We asked several professional investing strategists for their outlook on the stock market and single best ETF recommendation.
"
216,ETN,"1. Martin Kremenstein, head of U.S. ETFs at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management with $63 billion in assets under management in New York City: I think we've seen a strong indication that the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen will continue to taper its quantitative easing policy, which will naturally lead to a strong U.S. dollar vs. both developed and emerging market currencies.
"
217,ETN,"In this market environment, investors should consider hedging their non-U.S. equity investments against a strengthening U.S. dollar. Db X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity (DBEF) is designed to provide exposure to securities in developed international stock markets while at the same time mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies from 22 component countries.
"
218,ETN,"As developed markets outside of the U.S. continue to look increasingly interesting from both a valuation and recovery standpoint, the currency-hedge strategy offered by the ETF is a great investment idea for 2014. The structure of DBEF allows an investor to remain invested abroad, while still being protected against the impending rise of the U.S. dollar.
"
219,ETN,"2. Prateek Mehrotra, chief investment officer at Endowment Wealth Management with $50 million in AUM in Appleton, Wis.: Our outlook for the U.S. and global stock markets is positive for the current calendar year, albeit with a little more volatility than last year. Valuations in the U.S. are reasonable and not stretched by any parameter. Global markets are cheaper vs. the U.S. on a pure valuation basis. Equities are still cheaper relative to fixed income.
"
220,ETN,"As long as corporate America continues to churn out good earnings growth, stocks will have a tail wind, given that we still have a loose monetary-policy environment, low inflation and the global economy is continuing to grow, barring any unforeseen geopolitical event that could turn the tables.
"
221,ETN,"One area that we like as contrarians is emerging markets in general and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in particular. We generally do not recommend sector- or country-specific ETFs. However, we have strong contrarian conviction in Market Vectors India Small Caps (SCIF) and Guggenheim BRIC (EEB).
"
222,ETN,"SCIF has fallen over 19% annualized over the last three years, whereas EEB has fallen over 9% annualized. Assuming a reversion to the mean occurs, we believe that going forward, the returns could be higher than the rest of the markets. India's elections in May could spur a political party change at the top, which should bode well for the exchange rate and small caps. A new central banker at the helm of monetary affairs has already put a leash on runaway inflation.
"
223,ETN,"Obviously, the risks to this thesis lie in the unintended consequences from the Fed's tapering causing the continuation of money flows away from high current account deficit countries like India.
"
224,ETN,"3. Dick Wolfe, managing director at Saddle River Capital Management with $27 million AUM in Saddle River, N.J.: The market was expected to be up around 10% this year, but it looks like it's going to be up around 7% for 2014. That means the market is slow to get moving. For the next quarter, gross domestic product (growth) should pick up, as it didn't do that well in first quarter.
"
225,ETN,"We anticipate the market to be more positive in the second quarter. It is likely the weather had a lot to do with the slow market. Also risk is up a bit with the Ukraine situation and the unknown outcome of what Russia will eventually do or not do there.
"
226,ETN,"Going forward, we are bullish on health care ETFs, particularly the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), one of the top holdings of XLV, are undervalued. With the passing of ObamaCare, there are lots more people signing on to insurance, thus making health care companies a large beneficiary of this legislation.
"
227,ETN,"The risks are a bit lower in the health care space because they are value-style companies. XLV has outperformed so far this year and will continue to do so. It has a nice dividend yield and low-volatility companies.
"
228,ETN,"4. Tim Landolt, managing director at ETF Model Solutions in Appleton, Wis.: Our firm has a positive bias towards equities for 2014 although we expect equities may see corrective activity in 2014 after the strong gains of 2013. Equities appear a bit tired right now, and we perhaps are experiencing some of that correction activity now. A correction is healthy for longer-term investors.
"
229,ETN,"While gold has received more media attention, some of the broader agricultural commodity indexes have very quietly experienced returns of 10% or more and have been holding those gains very nicely.
"
230,ETN,"Elements Rogers International Commodity Agricultural ETN (RJA) looks attractive right now. After an approximate 10% gain in the first quarter, there has been a pause the past few weeks that has been constructive and offers the possibility that could continue to advance into the second quarter.
"
231,ETN,"A confluence of factors could prolong the move, including the ongoing drought in California, livestock numbers that are near 65-year lows, growing worldwide demand from improving global economies, the drought in Brazil and the unrest in grain-producing Ukraine.
"
232,ETN,"Of course, commodities are typically more volatile than other asset classes, and prices are driven by supply-and-demand issues that are not highly predictable. For instance, drought-ending rains or a good spring planting season in the U.S. could bring a correction as investors anticipate a bumper grain crop in the fall. There is also the underlying credit risk with any ETN that investors should consider on a case-by-case basis.
"
233,ETN,"5. J. Andre Weisbrod, CEO and chief investing officer at Starr Financial Advisors with $41 million AUM in Pittsburgh, Pa.: I think this market is struggling to retain its momentum. From a historical and common-sense perspective, it (is) reasonable to expect more than a 5% correction to keep this market honest. Without a good pullback, we risk at least a modest bubble. I think this market is due for a 10% pullback, and if that doesn't happen, a sideways trading range is the second most likely scenario.
"
234,ETN,"Some sectors' and companies' prices are approaching higher valuation ranges that increase risk. We are also concerned about continued systemic risks in the financial and government sectors. We should not underestimate the risks of extreme debt ratios, fractured leadership and geopolitical risks.
"
235,ETN,"Given such conditions, we like iShares S&P Global Infrastructure Index (IGF). It offers global diversification with only about one-third of U.S. stocks, significant positions in utilities (40%), industrials (39%) and energy (19%). IGF holdings appear to be reasonably valued to slightly undervalued. Plus it is currently paying a 3.3% dividend. The global exposure is also self-hedging against any major currency fluctuations.
"
236,ETN,"This ETF is likely to hold up better than the major indexes during 10% or greater market correction. It has been going up over the past couple weeks, while the broader indexes have faltered. And the long-term total return potential, while not extraordinary, is very healthy. This is a way to keep hitting singles and scoring well rather than relying on a grand slam to win the game.
"
237,ETN,"6. Vern Sumnicht, founder and CEO of iSectors with $150 million AUM in Appleton, Wis.: Despite the poor results of the U.S. stock market and recent volatility, I still see the U.S. stock market doing well in 2014.
"
238,ETN,"The activist nature of the Federal Reserve will prevent volatility from escalating into a more serious market downturn. I've been recommending investors overweight large-cap value with a focus on those companies that have been consistently increasing dividends over the last 10 or more years. With the Fed's accommodative protection, the nice dividend yield and liquidity these dividend-yielding stocks provide are one of the few attractive places left to put all that newly printed money from central banks around the world.
"
239,ETN,"While that money has been inflating equities and keeping interest rates artificially low, at some point the newly printed money from the Fed must slow down and stop. At that point interest rates and inflation will move higher and bonds will go lower. The fear of Federal Reserve policies causes me to direct investors' fixed-income purchases toward very short-term bonds to achieve better returns than cash and avoid losing principal when interest rates do increase.
"
240,ETN,"Over the last few weeks, events in Ukraine have opened the eyes of the world to Russian president Vladimir Putin's agenda. Putin's move on Ukraine's Crimea, without a significant U.S. response to protect them, increases free-world fear and economic uncertainty, and adds to volatility.
"
241,ETN,"Investors will continue to turn to gold as an uncorrelated investment to dampen volatility. Investors also want an investment with upside potential during periods of market volatility and economic uncertainty. Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners (GDXJ) is a satellite investment that still remains significantly undervalued and fits an increasingly volatile and uncertain market environment.
"
242,ETN,"Three years ago GDXJ was $170 a share. Today, despite moving up a bit in the first quarter it is $37 a share. This ETF holds 68 attractive gold-mining stocks; 95% are in Canada, Australia and the U.S. Investors need to remember 400% to 500% potential upside comes with risk. However, selling at book value today with increasing political uncertainty and looming inflation, I'd think there is relatively limited downside.The first quarter was a stock pickers' market, given the great divide between the leaders and the laggards. Coffee heated up 62% as copper was hammered 11%. Russia crashed 17% while Egypt rallied 24%.How should investors position their portfolios in the second quarter? We asked several professional investing strategists for their outlook on the stock market and single best ETF recommendation.1. Martin Kremenstein, head of U.S. ETFs at Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management with $63 billion in assets under management in New York City: I think we've seen a strong indication that the Federal Reserve under Janet Yellen will continue to taper its quantitative easing policy, which will naturally lead to a strong U.S. dollar vs. both developed and emerging market currencies.In this market environment, investors should consider hedging their non-U.S. equity investments against a strengthening U.S. dollar. Db X-trackers MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity (DBEF) is designed to provide exposure to securities in developed international stock markets while at the same time mitigating exposure to fluctuations between the value of the U.S. dollar and non-U.S. currencies from 22 component countries.As developed markets outside of the U.S. continue to look increasingly interesting from both a valuation and recovery standpoint, the currency-hedge strategy offered by the ETF is a great investment idea for 2014. The structure of DBEF allows an investor to remain invested abroad, while still being protected against the impending rise of the U.S. dollar.2. Prateek Mehrotra, chief investment officer at Endowment Wealth Management with $50 million in AUM in Appleton, Wis.: Our outlook for the U.S. and global stock markets is positive for the current calendar year, albeit with a little more volatility than last year. Valuations in the U.S. are reasonable and not stretched by any parameter. Global markets are cheaper vs. the U.S. on a pure valuation basis. Equities are still cheaper relative to fixed income.As long as corporate America continues to churn out good earnings growth, stocks will have a tail wind, given that we still have a loose monetary-policy environment, low inflation and the global economy is continuing to grow, barring any unforeseen geopolitical event that could turn the tables.One area that we like as contrarians is emerging markets in general and the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) in particular. We generally do not recommend sector- or country-specific ETFs. However, we have strong contrarian conviction in Market Vectors India Small Caps (SCIF) and Guggenheim BRIC (EEB).SCIF has fallen over 19% annualized over the last three years, whereas EEB has fallen over 9% annualized. Assuming a reversion to the mean occurs, we believe that going forward, the returns could be higher than the rest of the markets. India's elections in May could spur a political party change at the top, which should bode well for the exchange rate and small caps. A new central banker at the helm of monetary affairs has already put a leash on runaway inflation.Obviously, the risks to this thesis lie in the unintended consequences from the Fed's tapering causing the continuation of money flows away from high current account deficit countries like India.3. Dick Wolfe, managing director at Saddle River Capital Management with $27 million AUM in Saddle River, N.J.: The market was expected to be up around 10% this year, but it looks like it's going to be up around 7% for 2014. That means the market is slow to get moving. For the next quarter, gross domestic product (growth) should pick up, as it didn't do that well in first quarter.We anticipate the market to be more positive in the second quarter. It is likely the weather had a lot to do with the slow market. Also risk is up a bit with the Ukraine situation and the unknown outcome of what Russia will eventually do or not do there.Going forward, we are bullish on health care ETFs, particularly the Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV). Companies like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), one of the top holdings of XLV, are undervalued. With the passing of ObamaCare, there are lots more people signing on to insurance, thus making health care companies a large beneficiary of this legislation.The risks are a bit lower in the health care space because they are value-style companies. XLV has outperformed so far this year and will continue to do so. It has a nice dividend yield and low-volatility companies.4. Tim Landolt, managing director at ETF Model Solutions in Appleton, Wis.: Our firm has a positive bias towards equities for 2014 although we expect equities may see corrective activity in 2014 after the strong gains of 2013. Equities appear a bit tired right now, and we perhaps are experiencing some of that correction activity now.

265,ETN,"China's plan to build its first big passenger plane promises to reshape its fast-growing aviation market. A lot is at stake for U.S. companies.
"
266,ETN,"Boeing (BA) delivered its 800th airplane to China earlier this year. It has an order backlog of nearly $30 billion from China. So the state-owned C919 jet program poses a potential threat. Boeing also is a big customer of parts makers trying to win C919-related business.
"
267,ETN,"Several U.S. companies have signed contracts to supply parts for the C919, including General Electric (GE), Eaton (ETN), Rockwell Collins (COL), Honeywell (HON), Goodrich (GR) and Parker Hannifin (PH). ""Western (aircraft) component and system suppliers see the writing on the wall, that the Boeing/Airbus duopoly is going away,"" said Tom Boozer, an analyst at Kirkland, Wash.-based consultancy G2 Solutions. ""They recognize that the Chinese market could be a huge portion of their business.""
"
268,ETN,"China's aviation market is booming. Airline stocks, such as Hong Kong-listed Air China, China Southern (ZNH) and China Eastern (CEA), have rebounded strongly in 2010. Passenger traffic is growing 20% a year in China as domestic travel and trips abroad grow.
"
269,ETN,"The country will open 10 airports in 2010, says the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The CAAC expects 250 airports by 2020, up from 176 at year-end.
"
270,ETN,"Boeing projects that over the next two decades China will be the No. 2 aircraft buyer, behind the U.S. and ahead of the United Arab Emirates.
"
271,ETN,"With the C919, China aims to satisfy some of its domestic demand and boost exports, initially in Asia. State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac) expects to sell 2,509 C919s over 20 years. The C919 is slated to fly in 2014 and enter service in 2016.
"
272,ETN,"China aims to take a big step forward with the C919, a single-aisle passenger jet that will seat up to 190 people. Analysts say it should be a big improvement over a regional jet, the ARJ21, that Chinese companies cobbled together over the past 10 years.
"
273,ETN,"But how will the C919 compare to Boeing's next-generation 737 and the Airbus A320 family? (Canada's Bombardier also is expanding into this market.) And how much leading-edge technology will U.S. companies provide for the C919 as they compete for business with each other and European rivals?
"
274,ETN,"Comac has a strong bargaining position because of China's booming aviation market, analysts say.
"
275,ETN,"But U.S. aircraft parts makers will be cautious transferring technology to China unless it provides intellectual property guarantees and does not favor local joint ventures, says Richard Aboulafia, VP at consultancy Teal Group.
"
276,ETN,"He's not sure the C919 will get the latest and best technology.
"
277,ETN,"""It's not clear what they'll be getting,"" Aboulafia said. ""Some may be state of the art. We don't know.""
"
278,ETN,"He added: ""If you're a supplier, you're going to be wary of working with government-run factories if they're not giving you intellectual property protection. At the end of the day, it's China's government (in control) and they want to build national champions (in manufacturing). I think most companies will show up with stuff a few years behind the times.""
"
279,ETN,"Parts Makers Want A Piece
"
280,ETN,"Comac seems to be getting a world-class, fuel-efficient engine for the C919 from CFM International, jointly owned by GE and France's Safran, analysts say. In late 2009, GE formed a joint venture with Aviation Industry Corp. of China to build C919 housing and gear. In July, GE and AVIC won a deal to provide an electronics system.
"
281,ETN,"Honeywell has won C919 contracts to supply cockpit gear, braking systems and auxiliary power units. Eaton in July formed a venture with Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co., a Comac subsidiary, to develop fuel and hydraulic systems.
"
282,ETN,"Comac is expected to unveil more C919 contracts in the fall.
"
283,ETN,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says China's policies are worrisome.
"
284,ETN,"""The Chinese government's core strategy for assembling the C919 is to trade market access for technology,"" the Chamber said in July. ""No doubt the involved foreign suppliers are hoping for long-term China market access through these partnerships and technology transfers. The concern is that when Comac is able to take care of itself indigenously, the foreign aerospace firm may find themselves sidelined and competing globally against the Chinese companies they are now creating.""
"
285,ETN,"U.S. companies have no choice but to try to get in on the ground floor as China builds an aerospace industry, says Boozer.
"

"
290,ETN,"Air China, China Eastern and China Southern are expected to order the C919. Even if the C919 is successful, analysts say it'll take China a decade or more to develop bigger, twin-aisle passenger jets. Roughly half of Boeing's order backlog is for the 787 Dreamliner, which has yet to enter service.
"
291,ETN,"Corporate jet maker Gulfstream, owned by General Dynamics (GD), aims to expand sales in China. While the C919 project has been well publicized, it's not clear where China stands in developing corporate aircraft, analysts say.
"
292,ETN,"Chinese airlines, meanwhile, seem to have a lot going for them. They've been able to tap debt markets to fund fleet expansion, and a stronger yuan should help them lower fuel costs and capital outlays, analysts say.
"
293,ETN,"China's airline sector has the second highest estimated earnings growth over the next year, just behind the metals and mining industry, according to Thomson/Reuters.
"
294,ETN,"However, China is making a huge investment in high-speed rail. Rail competition could lower airline fares and slow the growth of airline traffic, wrote Singapore-based brokerage UOB Kay Hian Group and Hong Kong-based Citic Securities in separate reports.
"
295,ETN,"""It depends partly on how much government involvement there is in setting prices,"" said John Strickland, director of U.K.-based JLS Consulting. He added that China is a big country, and airplanes will still be preferred for long-distance travel and cargo delivery.China's plan to build its first big passenger plane promises to reshape its fast-growing aviation market. A lot is at stake for U.S. companies.Boeing (BA) delivered its 800th airplane to China earlier this year. It has an order backlog of nearly $30 billion from China. So the state-owned C919 jet program poses a potential threat. Boeing also is a big customer of parts makers trying to win C919-related business.Several U.S. companies have signed contracts to supply parts for the C919, including General Electric (GE), Eaton (ETN), Rockwell Collins (COL), Honeywell (HON), Goodrich (GR) and Parker Hannifin (PH). ""Western (aircraft) component and system suppliers see the writing on the wall, that the Boeing/Airbus duopoly is going away,"" said Tom Boozer, an analyst at Kirkland, Wash.-based consultancy G2 Solutions. ""They recognize that the Chinese market could be a huge portion of their business.""China's aviation market is booming. Airline stocks, such as Hong Kong-listed Air China, China Southern (ZNH) and China Eastern (CEA), have rebounded strongly in 2010. Passenger traffic is growing 20% a year in China as domestic travel and trips abroad grow.The country will open 10 airports in 2010, says the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The CAAC expects 250 airports by 2020, up from 176 at year-end.Boeing projects that over the next two decades China will be the No. 2 aircraft buyer, behind the U.S. and ahead of the United Arab Emirates.With the C919, China aims to satisfy some of its domestic demand and boost exports, initially in Asia. State-owned Commercial Aircraft Corp. of China (Comac) expects to sell 2,509 C919s over 20 years. The C919 is slated to fly in 2014 and enter service in 2016.China aims to take a big step forward with the C919, a single-aisle passenger jet that will seat up to 190 people. Analysts say it should be a big improvement over a regional jet, the ARJ21, that Chinese companies cobbled together over the past 10 years.But how will the C919 compare to Boeing's next-generation 737 and the Airbus A320 family? (Canada's Bombardier also is expanding into this market.) And how much leading-edge technology will U.S. companies provide for the C919 as they compete for business with each other and European rivals?Comac has a strong bargaining position because of China's booming aviation market, analysts say.But U.S. aircraft parts makers will be cautious transferring technology to China unless it provides intellectual property guarantees and does not favor local joint ventures, says Richard Aboulafia, VP at consultancy Teal Group.He's not sure the C919 will get the latest and best technology.""It's not clear what they'll be getting,"" Aboulafia said. ""Some may be state of the art. We don't know.""He added: ""If you're a supplier, you're going to be wary of working with government-run factories if they're not giving you intellectual property protection. At the end of the day, it's China's government (in control) and they want to build national champions (in manufacturing). I think most companies will show up with stuff a few years behind the times.""Parts Makers Want A PieceComac seems to be getting a world-class, fuel-efficient engine for the C919 from CFM International, jointly owned by GE and France's Safran, analysts say. In late 2009, GE formed a joint venture with Aviation Industry Corp. of China to build C919 housing and gear. In July, GE and AVIC won a deal to provide an electronics system.Honeywell has won C919 contracts to supply cockpit gear, braking systems and auxiliary power units. Eaton in July formed a venture with Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Co., a Comac subsidiary, to develop fuel and hydraulic systems.Comac is expected to unveil more C919 contracts in the fall.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce says China's policies are worrisome.""The Chinese government's core strategy for assembling the C919 is to trade market access for technology,"" the Chamber said in July. ""No doubt the involved foreign suppliers are hoping for long-term China market access through these partnerships and technology transfers. The concern is that when Comac is able to take care of itself indigenously, the foreign aerospace firm may find themselves sidelined and competing globally against the Chinese companies they are now creating.""U.S. companies have no choice but to try to get in on the ground floor as China builds an aerospace industry, says Boozer.""They're going to disclose IP and provide product because that's where the growth is,"" he said. ""If they don't, someone else will.""So they're putting their best foot forward, bringing engineering expertise over (for the C919). But aircraft are incredibly complex.

296,ETN,"Special Report: ETF Strategies
"
297,ETN,"Exchange traded funds have a lot to offer: low costs, a focus on countless investment niches, pricing throughout the day. But some types entail risk that unwary investors might fall prey to — such as unfamiliar terms and exotic strategies.
"
298,ETN,"Pay attention to these potential pitfalls to avoid financial injury while you invest:
"
299,ETN," Contango. People might think contango is a form of dirty dancing. Instead, it's a dirty word — at least on Wall Street, and especially for some ETFs.
"
300,ETN,"The term refers to what happens to an account when futures contracts are rolled from expiring ones to new ones when commodity prices are rising. Proceeds from the old contract buy less of the new, more expensive contract.
"
301,ETN,"The investor ends up selling low and buying high, over and over. That's different from buying the underlying commodity and profiting as it gains value.
"
302,ETN,"Some ETFs use a rolling series of contracts, locking themselves into a series of successively higher priced contracts. Each new buy destroys shareholder value.
"
303,ETN,"Solution: Check a commodity ETF's strategy before buying. Beware of funds that automatically roll into front-month contracts.
"
304,ETN,"Another option: Use a contango killer such as iShares Dow Jones-UBS Roll Select Commodity Index Trust (CMDT), which shops for contracts with the least contango.
"
305,ETN,"Third option: Look for an inverse commodity ETF that profits as forward contracts lose value — basically a form of shorting.
"
306,ETN," Backwardation. This is a flip side of contango. Each future contract for a commodity is lower in price than the preceding one.
"
307,ETN,"This happens when supplies are tight, making buyers willing to pay more at today's spot price.
"
308,ETN,"Beware: If supplies loosen, the gravy train can derail.
"
309,ETN," ETNs vs. ETFs. An exchange traded note, a cousin of the ETF, is a debt instrument. As senior, unsecured and unsubordinated, it has the credit risk of its issuer.
"
310,ETN,"Unlike an ETF, an ETN does not hold any stocks, bonds or commodities. An ETN promises to pay investors the amount equal to its index, minus fees. And an ETN has a maturity date, with many callable.
"
311,ETN,"Also, ETNs are often more expensive than ETFs. One key benefit: Since ETNs do not hold anything, they do not have any tracking error. The lack of trades makes ETNs more tax efficient. And an ETN can never be structured as a partnership, eliminating the tax hassle of filing a Form K-1.
"
312,ETN," Bid-ask spread. That spread is the difference between the amount a buyer offers — the bid — and the price a seller demands — the ask.
"
313,ETN,"The more thinly traded an ETF is, the wider its spread.
"
314,ETN,"The spread represents your potential loss if you immediately sell an ETF after buying it. You may end up paying the higher price and receiving the lower one.
"
315,ETN,"The 150 most active ETFs trade 450,000 shares or more a day. Of those, 135 have spreads below 5 cents, and 70 have spreads of 1 cent, according to S&P Capital IQ.
"
316,ETN,"The 300 least active ETFs trade fewer than 5,000 shares a day. Of those, 257 have spreads greater than 10 cents, and 186 have spreads wider than 25 cents.
"
317,ETN,"One safeguard: Check an ETF's trading volume. You can find that information at Investors.com, discount brokerage sites, Yahoo Finance and Morningstar.com.
"
318,ETN,"To cope with potentially wide spreads, use a limit order instead of a market order.
"
319,ETN," Master limited partnerships. A key appeal of MLP ETFs is that many — especially those that invest in oil and gas assets — pay high yields. Also, investing in MLPs via ETFs gives you more diversification than investing in individual MLPs. That cuts volatility.
"
320,ETN,"Another benefit is that about 75% of MLP ETF distributions are returns of capital, which reduce your cost basis. The rest is treated mainly as a qualified dividend.
"
321,ETN,"Most taxpayers pay 0% or 15% tax on them, rather than ordinary income rates. Even in the top bracket, taxpayers pay just 20%.
"
322,ETN,"Tax reporting for MLP ETFs is far less complex than it is for individual MLPs.
"
323,ETN,"A key drawback for MLP ETFs is that capital gains on underlying MLPs in an ETF are taxed heavily.
"
324,ETN,"That cuts an MLP ETF's total return by about 30% vs. the same individual MLPs and by 10% if they're held in an ETN, says Will Braman, chief investment officer of Ballentine Partners, a Waltham, Mass., wealth management firm.
"
325,ETN,"Most retail investors buy for the current pretax yield of 6%, Braman says, and they don't understand the tax impact. In today's environment, they're willing to break even on price.
"
326,ETN,"He advises clients to hold MLPs through limited partnerships or separately managed accounts.
"
327,ETN," Premium or discount to NAV. ETFs are designed to have little or no discount or premium to net asset value. Still, it has happened.
"
328,ETN,"Having unexpected premiums or discounts can largely be avoided.
"
329,ETN,"The net asset value, or NAV, of an ETF is the total value of securities in the portfolio divided by the number of shares outstanding.
"
330,ETN,"Supply and demand can make the market price per share of an ETF deviate from its NAV per share. That difference is called a premium when the market price is higher. It's a discount when the market price is lower.
"
331,ETN,"You can find the premium and discount at the fund's Web page, at many online brokerages and at Morningstar.com.
"
332,ETN,"For example, Market Vectors China (PEK) closed at 33.33 on Oct. 7, a 2.49% premium to its 32.50 NAV. The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to not begin tapering its bond buys left intact investors' appetite for equity risk, especially in markets like China, Todd says.
"
333,ETN,"Premiums and discounts tend to be smaller and less persistent for ETFs that track more liquid securities like U.S. stocks and government bonds. They're commonly larger and longer lasting for other categories, says Michael Iachini, managing director of ETF research at Charles Schwab Investment Advisory.
"
334,ETN,"A drop in a premium while you hold an ETF is akin to the fund losing an equal amount of value. Check an ETF's premium-discount track record before buying to weigh what you're getting into.
"

365,ETN,"ETF investors are typically affluent and experienced in the stock market. Given that only 3% of U.S. households own ETFs, the industry has its work cut out for it in educating retail investors about them.
"
366,ETN,"Here are some of the biggest myths and truths about ETFs that investors must understand to avoid mistakes.
"
367,ETN,"Myth No. 1: ETF liquidity doesn't matter and that only the liquidity of the underlying holdings matter. The truth is some thinly traded ETFs have very wide bid/ask spreads even if they hold very liquid stocks. The spread is the difference between the lowest price a trader is willing to sell the ETF and the highest price a buyer is willing to pay. The wider the spread, the bigger the immediate loss upon buying the ETF.
"
368,ETN,"Dodd Kittsley, head of institutional product consulting at iShares, recommends investors use limit orders to get trades executed at the midpoint between bid and ask prices.
"
369,ETN,"The analytics tool at ETF.com shows iPath Short Enhanced MSCI Emerging Markets ETN (EMSA) with less than $5 million in assets has a bid/ask spread that is nearly as big as the ETN's share price of 81.61. Most ETFs with bid/ask spreads larger than 1% of share price have less than $10 million in assets.
"
370,ETN,"""Low-volume ETFs are disasters waiting to happen and in many cases have happened,"" said Ron Rowland, founder of Capital Cities Asset Management and AllStarInvestor.com in Austin, Texas. ""Wide bid/ask spreads are just the most visible problem. The unseen problem is the inability to arbitrage the price of the ETF to its underlying NAV (net asset value).""
"
371,ETN,"ETFs shares are created and redeemed through in-kind exchanges to prevent ETFs from trading at a discount or premium to their NAV. Market makers typically create and redeem ETFs in blocks of 50,000 shares, which thereby requires healthy trading volume.
"
372,ETN,"But not all small, thinly traded ETFs have wide bid/ask spreads. IPath Inverse S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (XXV) has less than $4 million in assets but a bid/ask spread of 0.03%, which is the same as iShares Core S&P Small-Cap (IJR) with $13.5 billion in assets.
"
373,ETN,"Myth No. 2: Thinking that due to diversification, ETFs are safer than stocks and can be bought and held with little volatility. The truth is some ETFs are as volatile as individual stocks.
"
374,ETN,"""A blue Chip stock like Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) may have less market volatility compared to volatile sector ETFs like Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX) or iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology (IBB),"" Ron DeLegge, editor of ETFGuide.com said in an email. ""On the other hand, a diversified health care ETF like Health Care Select Sector SPDR (XLV) may have less volatility compared to Johnson & Johnson. In comparing volatility, it's always important to do apples-with-apples measurements.""
"
375,ETN,"Myth No. 3: All ETFs are tax efficient. The truth: ETFs that hold futures contracts will issue a K-1 tax form instead of a 1099, which can be a hassle to deal with, notes ETF Database analyst Jared Cummans.

376,ETN,"""Investors also often overlook the fact that two of the most popular funds, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Silver Trust (SLV) are taxed as collectibles,"" Cummans wrote. Capital gains on those are taxed at a maximum 28% rate instead of the ordinary 15%.
"
377,ETN,"""ETFs linked to asset classes with high taxable income like REITs or Treasury bonds are best kept in tax-deferred accounts,"" DeLegge said.
"
378,ETN,"High turnover in actively managed ETFs, which account for only 1% of all ETF assets, can potentially slap investors with capital gains distributions, said Kittsley of iShares.
"
379,ETN,"Myth No. 4: The cheapest ETFs, including those offered with no commission, are always the best. The truth is some ETFs with commission-free trading have wide bid/ask spreads and so investors end up losing the difference between the bid/ask price when they trade.

What's more, it will force companies to change how they transport, store and refine oil in addition to their investment strategies.

416,ETN,"""Essentially the report corroborated what has been postulated in the market for the past year,"" Stephen Schork, founder of ""The Schork Report,"" specializing in energy markets.
"
417,ETN,"Key Facts From The Report
"
418,ETN,"The report stated:
"
419,ETN,"1. North American oil supply is projected to grow by 3.9 million barrels per day from 2012 to 2018, accounting for more than half of the (non-OPEC) increase.
"
420,ETN,"2. Emerging markets are projected to overtake developed countries in oil product consumption by the second quarter of this year.
"
421,ETN,"3. Developing countries, which accounted for 49% of global demand in 2012, will account for more than 54% by 2018.
"
422,ETN,"4. The average cost of oil imports will fall from $109 a barrel in 2013 to $93 a barrel by 2018.
"
423,ETN,"5. Global demand will rise from 89.78 million barrels a day in 2012 to 96.68 million barrels by 2018, up nearly 8%, assuming global economic growth of 3% to 4.5% annually.
"
424,ETN,"6. Non-OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil supplies are seen rising from 59.66 million barrels a day in 2012 to 66.30 million barrels by 2018, an 11% increase.
"
425,ETN,"Here's a look at potential winners and losers in the stock market.
"
426,ETN,"Major Oil Services Firms
"
427,ETN,"The big winners of the shale boom will be major oil services and independent service operators, or ISOs, such as Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI), which have billion-dollar research and development budgets, says John Graves, author of ""Fracking, America's Alternative Energy Revolution"" and an asset manager based in Ventura, Calif.
"
428,ETN,"All three companies are heavily overweighted in iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment Index (IEZ), Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), which climbed 0.54% and 0.34%, respectively Tuesday.
"
429,ETN,"Graves is also bullish on Exxon Mobil (XOM), BP (BP), Chevron (CVX) and Statoil (STO), which he believes have ""the staying power to outlast regulatory or governmental interference.""
"
430,ETN,"IShares S&P North American Natural Resources (IGE), iShares Dow Jones U.S. Energy (IYE), Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) heavily overweight Exxon and Chevron and offer some exposure to Schlumberger and Halliburton. IGE, IYE, XLE and VDE jumped 0.96% to 1.42% Tuesday.
"
431,ETN,"North Dakota and Montana are home to the 20th largest crude oil reserve in the world, said Schork, citing data from United States Geological Survey. This calls for expertise from unconventional, shale oil and Canadian oil sands producers, such as those found in Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas (FRAK), up 1.02% Tuesday, and Sustainable North American Oil Sands (SNDS), up 0.18%.
"
432,ETN,"Master Limited Partnerships
"
433,ETN,"The North American shale oil boom not only impacts the economy and energy market but also related industries engaged in global transportation, storage and refining infrastructure, the IEA report said. U.S. midstream companies — most of which are Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs — are boosting their transport and storage capacity in the U.S. to support the rising oil and gas supplies.
"
434,ETN,"The most widely traded exchange traded product in this area is JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ), which fell 1.04% Tuesday. The drawback is that as an exchange traded note, investors have to rely on the issuer to make good on its debts and it doesn't actually hold the underlying stocks. It also currently trades at a premium to its net asset value because the issuer has limited the number of shares that can be created.
"
435,ETN,"ALPS Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), down 0.05% Tuesday, offers exposure to the underlying stocks but it is structured as a corporation, which means it has to pay taxes that take a bite out of total returns.
"
436,ETN,"Transportation And Shipping
"
437,ETN,"There will be a tremendous need for railroads to transport the oil and gas from the inland to the major ports for export, says Schork. IShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (IYT) offers more exposure to railroads than its competitor SPDR S&P Transportation (XTN), which is more heavily weighted in airlines and trucking.
"
438,ETN,"Tanker shippers, found Guggenheim Global Shipping (SEA), will be re-routed. Instead of coming to the U.S. to import oil, they will be exporting oil from the U.S. to Asia, mainly China.
"
439,ETN,"Coal
"
440,ETN,"In the U.S., natural gas has displaced a third of coal usage at electric power plants in less than a decade and this trend will likely spread internationally, says Graves. This should explain why Market Vectors Coal ETF (KOL) has lost an average 15% a year the past five years.
"
441,ETN,"Investment Risks
"
442,ETN,"An onslaught of supply will most likely depress oil prices. Oil prices will sink an average of 5.5% between now and 2018, the IEA projects.
"
443,ETN,"""As global refining capacity expansions outpace upstream supply growth, let alone demand growth, margins and utilization rates will come under pressure and higher-cost refineries will face increasingly strong competitive headwinds,"" the report said. ""European refineries are at particularly high risk of closure over the forecast period (2012 to 2018).""

Developing countries, which accounted for 49% of global demand in 2012, will account for more than 54% by 2018.4. The average cost of oil imports will fall from $109 a barrel in 2013 to $93 a barrel by 2018.5. Global demand will rise from 89.78 million barrels a day in 2012 to 96.68 million barrels by 2018, up nearly 8%, assuming global economic growth of 3% to 4.5% annually.6. Non-OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) oil supplies are seen rising from 59.66 million barrels a day in 2012 to 66.30 million barrels by 2018, an 11% increase.Here's a look at potential winners and losers in the stock market.Major Oil Services FirmsThe big winners of the shale boom will be major oil services and independent service operators, or ISOs, such as Schlumberger (SLB), Halliburton (HAL) and Baker Hughes (BHI), which have billion-dollar research and development budgets, says John Graves, author of ""Fracking, America's Alternative Energy Revolution"" and an asset manager based in Ventura, Calif.All three companies are heavily overweighted in iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil Equipment Index (IEZ), Market Vectors Oil Services ETF (OIH), which climbed 0.54% and 0.34%, respectively Tuesday.Graves is also bullish on Exxon Mobil (XOM), BP (BP), Chevron (CVX) and Statoil (STO), which he believes have ""the staying power to outlast regulatory or governmental interference.""IShares S&P North American Natural Resources (IGE), iShares Dow Jones U.S. Energy (IYE), Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) and Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) heavily overweight Exxon and Chevron and offer some exposure to Schlumberger and Halliburton. IGE, IYE, XLE and VDE jumped 0.96% to 1.42% Tuesday.North Dakota and Montana are home to the 20th largest crude oil reserve in the world, said Schork, citing data from United States Geological Survey. This calls for expertise from unconventional, shale oil and Canadian oil sands producers, such as those found in Market Vectors Unconventional Oil & Gas (FRAK), up 1.02% Tuesday, and Sustainable North American Oil Sands (SNDS), up 0.18%.Master Limited PartnershipsThe North American shale oil boom not only impacts the economy and energy market but also related industries engaged in global transportation, storage and refining infrastructure, the IEA report said. U.S. midstream companies — most of which are Master Limited Partnerships, or MLPs — are boosting their transport and storage capacity in the U.S. to support the rising oil and gas supplies.The most widely traded exchange traded product in this area is JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ), which fell 1.04% Tuesday. The drawback is that as an exchange traded note, investors have to rely on the issuer to make good on its debts and it doesn't actually hold the underlying stocks. It also currently trades at a premium to its net asset value because the issuer has limited the number of shares that can be created.ALPS Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP), down 0.05% Tuesday, offers exposure to the underlying stocks but it is structured as a corporation, which means it has to pay taxes that take a bite out of total returns.Transportation And ShippingThere will be a tremendous need for railroads to transport the oil and gas from the inland to the major ports for export, says Schork. IShares Dow Jones Transportation Average (IYT) offers more exposure to railroads than its competitor SPDR S&P Transportation (XTN), which is more heavily weighted in airlines and trucking.Tanker shippers, found Guggenheim Global Shipping (SEA), will be re-routed. Instead of coming to the U.S. to import oil, they will be exporting oil from the U.S. to Asia, mainly China.CoalIn the U.S., natural gas has displaced a third of coal usage at electric power plants in less than a decade and this trend will likely spread internationally, says Graves. This should explain why Market Vectors Coal ETF (KOL) has lost an average 15% a year the past five years.Investment RisksAn onslaught of supply will most likely depress oil prices. Oil prices will sink an average of 5.5% between now and 2018, the IEA projects.""As global refining capacity expansions outpace upstream supply growth, let alone demand growth, margins and utilization rates will come under pressure and higher-cost refineries will face increasingly strong competitive headwinds,"" the report said. ""European refineries are at particularly high risk of closure over the forecast period (2012 to 2018).""Follow Trang Ho on Twitter@TrangHoETFs.

445,ETN,"Investors without borders must be at least on their alert after the U.S. market, which slid badly Thursday, entered a correction. Most emerging-market bourses are already underwater, and can ill afford more losses.Ranking these markets from first to worst by year-to-date returns shows no emerging markets until the No. 7 slot.Nasdaq's 19.8% gain puts it at the top of the heap of the Daily World Map, which includes two U.S. indexes and 16 benchmark ETFs from around the world.Ishares MSCI Japan (EWJ) ETF places with a 16.9% improvement. Japan's stocks — and long-suffering economy — have won a huge boost from Abenomics.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is delivering on his promise for huge fiscal and monetary stimulus actions. And his party's big win last month in elections for the upper house of Parliament (the Liberal Democratic Party already had control of the lower house) paves the way for more such action.The NYSE composite shows with a TK% rise.After that you'll find benchmark ETFs from France (up 11.6%), Germany (up 8.5%) and the U.K. (up 6.1%).That brings you to the No. 7 slot, which is held by iShares MSCI Hong Kong's (EWH) 1.1% gain.Maybe this qualifies as the highest-ranked emerging market return. While Hong Kong is a mature economy, it's also the gateway to mainland China. Most of the island's best stocks are of companies doing business in China.In any event, if a 1.1% gain is the best among emerging markets, one can't be impressed.Guggenheim China Small Cap (HAO) ETF shows a 0.3% rise. After that, the listings all show year-to-date losses.Wallowing on the bottom you'll find iShares MSCI Brazil (EWZ) ETF, off 22.1%, and second-worst is  Barclays iPath India (INP) ETN. Both countries are suffering through some political agonies and angry populations.Brazilians have been protesting — by the millions — against poor government services, stupefying red tape and a weak economy.India's much-ballyhooed reforms process has stalled and the economy is stuttering.The currency has been crashing, a victim of a bleeding currency-account deficit. The central bank was recently forced to tighten credit to protect the rupee, a move which bodes ill for this struggling giant.

It's tumbled 23% year to date and nearly 18% in the past 12 months. Some 40% of nickel supply, a key ingredient in stainless steel, is being produced at a loss at current prices, according to Deutsche Bank.""Prices under $14,000 a metric ton are unsustainable for high-cost producers, meaning more production cuts are looming,"" IHS Global Insight's analysts wrote in a commodities report released Monday.""Barring a significant shock, we see nickel prices bottoming out in the third quarter and moving incrementally higher into early 2014. Surplus conditions will keep prices below $18,000 a metric ton over the next six quarters.""IPath DJ-UBS Copper ETN (JJC) was nearly flat at 38.10 — a three-week low. The ETF tracking the red metal has lost 17% year to date and 12% in the past year because of steady increases in mine production in the face of softening demand.Copper prices will likely rebound in the second half of 2013, pushing prices from $7,000 a metric ton to $7,500, according to IHS. ""Recent mine accidents and tightness in scrap markets leads us to believe the market is a bit too pessimistic,"" IHS analysts wrote.IPath Pure Beta Grains ETN (WEET), tracking soybeans, corn, wheat, soybean meal and soybean oil, plunged 5.08% to 45.35 — a three-month low. It's tumbled 10% year to date and 18% in the past 12 months.""They are moving south as it's recognized that growing conditions are good and better-than-expected crop yields are likely,"" David Hunter, chief market strategist at KCCI, a brokerage firm in Jersey City, N.J., said in an email.United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) burned off 2.59% to 18.45 — a five-month low. It's lost 2.4% year to date and 11% in the past year. Natural gas has sold off the past two weeks after a sudden spike earlier this month as a heat wave struck the Northeast, boosting energy demand from increased use of air conditioners and fans.Natgas prices will likely rise as European liquefied natural gas supplies tighten in 2014, according to IHS. ""Residential demand in Northwest Europe was 7 billion cubic meters higher than 2012 levels in the first five months of the year,"" IHS analysts wrote. ""Power sector gas demand will contract slightly to 143 BCM in 2013, before rising slowly as power demand grows and coal capacity retires.""Increased output in response to rising prices between 2008 and 2011 has been met with slow demand suggesting the global economy teeters on the edge of recession, some investing strategists say.""China's credit crisis is worse than what we faced in 2008. Japan is in uncharted waters with what it is trying to do and policymakers could lose control of the situation,"" Hunter wrote.""Europe continues very weak and the European Central Bank policy is not nearly easy enough,"" Hunter added. ""Brazil and Australia are suffering due to the manufacturing slowdown in China and that's likely to get much worse.""

"
489,ETN,"""To the extent investors are attracted to a high-dividend ETF with attractive yields, they not only need to look at the risk/return characteristics of the ETF, but how it correlates to other sectors,"" Jonathan Lewis, chief investment officer at Samson Capital Advisors with $7.1 billion in assets under management in New York, said in an email. ""An ETF can have a very high dividend, but if it is very volatile, or has the capacity for large drawdowns, an investor also has to consider their outlook for the sector.""
"
490,ETN,"Correlation, measured on a scale of -1 to +1 indicates how much the ETF moves in sync with the S&P. A -1 would be inverse correlation, or it moves exactly opposite the S&P, while +1 means perfect correlation, or it moves exactly the same as the S&P. The closer the ratio is to 0, the more independent it moves relative to the S&P.
"
491,ETN,"Beta measures how volatile the ETFs are compared with the stock market. The higher above 1, the more it swings compared with the market and greater potential for losses and gains. The lower the beta, the more steady the share price. Wild price swings and deep drawdowns could wipe away all the benefit of dividend income.

499,ETN,"BDCL is the double-leveraged version of ETRACS Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index ETN (BDCS), which pays dividends quarterly. The underlying index includes 32 companies fronted by American Capital (ACAS), Ares Capital (ARCC), Prospect Capital (PSEC) and Apollo Investment (AINV), which together account for about 40% of assets.
"
500,ETN,"Because BDCL is structured as an exchange traded note — rather than a mutual fund like most ETFs — investors must consider the issuer's credit quality. Share prices could swing because changes in the issuer's corporate outlook or credit rating. ETNs are debt notes that are artificially linked to the underlying index but don't actually hold any of the stocks. Investors risk losing all of their money if the issuer fails to pay its debts.
"
501,ETN,"Business development companies are publicly traded, private equity or venture capital firms that invest in small- and midsize companies by lending money and/or buying a controlling interest. They're structured similar to real estate investment trusts, or REITs. They pay no corporate income tax and have to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as a dividend.

502,ETN,"BDCs can thrive in a rising-rate environment because they borrow money at a fixed rate and lend it at a floating rate, says Grier Eliasek, president of Prospect Capital, a New York-based BDC with $5 billion in assets under management. Currently regulations limit a BDC's debt-to-equity ratio to 1 but legislation is pending in Congress to double that limit, which is still well below the 10 times debt-to-equity leverage limit for banks, he said in an email. The increased borrowing limits would give BDCs the potential to expand return on equity ratio and dividend payouts by borrowing more money.

546,ETN,"Follow Trang Ho on Twitter @IBD_THo.About 10,000 baby boomers are celebrating their 65th birthday everyday in the U.S., and that's expected to continue for at least two decades. With so many people retiring in an era of low interest rates, the search for income-paying assets is more crucial than ever.Here's a look at five exchange traded funds with the fattest yields that are also trading above their 200-day moving averages, confirming an uptrend.But there's no free lunch. Dividends aren't guaranteed and these ETFs charge rather high management fees. Along with each ETF's basic information, we've listed its correlation to the S&P 500, beta and maximum drawdown, or loss from peak to trough, to gauge their investment risks.""To the extent investors are attracted to a high-dividend ETF with attractive yields, they not only need to look at the risk/return characteristics of the ETF, but how it correlates to other sectors,"" Jonathan Lewis, chief investment officer at Samson Capital Advisors with $7.1 billion in assets under management in New York, said in an email. ""An ETF can have a very high dividend, but if it is very volatile, or has the capacity for large drawdowns, an investor also has to consider their outlook for the sector.""Correlation, measured on a scale of -1 to +1 indicates how much the ETF moves in sync with the S&P. A -1 would be inverse correlation, or it moves exactly opposite the S&P, while +1 means perfect correlation, or it moves exactly the same as the S&P. The closer the ratio is to 0, the more independent it moves relative to the S&P.Beta measures how volatile the ETFs are compared with the stock market. The higher above 1, the more it swings compared with the market and greater potential for losses and gains. The lower the beta, the more steady the share price. Wild price swings and deep drawdowns could wipe away all the benefit of dividend income.1. UBS E-TRACS 2x Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCL)12-month yield: 14%2013 return: 33%Expense ratio: 0.85%Correlation to SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) since inception: 0.8Beta: 1.62Maximum drawdown since inception: -45%BDCL is the double-leveraged version of ETRACS Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index ETN (BDCS), which pays dividends quarterly. The underlying index includes 32 companies fronted by American Capital (ACAS), Ares Capital (ARCC), Prospect Capital (PSEC) and Apollo Investment (AINV), which together account for about 40% of assets.Because BDCL is structured as an exchange traded note — rather than a mutual fund like most ETFs — investors must consider the issuer's credit quality. Share prices could swing because changes in the issuer's corporate outlook or credit rating. ETNs are debt notes that are artificially linked to the underlying index but don't actually hold any of the stocks. Investors risk losing all of their money if the issuer fails to pay its debts.Business development companies are publicly traded, private equity or venture capital firms that invest in small- and midsize companies by lending money and/or buying a controlling interest. They're structured similar to real estate investment trusts, or REITs. They pay no corporate income tax and have to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders as a dividend.BDCs can thrive in a rising-rate environment because they borrow money at a fixed rate and lend it at a floating rate, says Grier Eliasek, president of Prospect Capital, a New York-based BDC with $5 billion in assets under management. Currently regulations limit a BDC's debt-to-equity ratio to 1 but legislation is pending in Congress to double that limit, which is still well below the 10 times debt-to-equity leverage limit for banks, he said in an email. The increased borrowing limits would give BDCs the potential to expand return on equity ratio and dividend payouts by borrowing more money.2.

547,ETN,"After years of overabundance, a brewing global shortfall in coffee could heat up prices as much as sevenfold over the next decade.That's according to Shawn Hackett, founder of Hackett Financial Advisors in Boynton Beach, Fla., who says technicals, fundamentals and money flows suggest coffee prices have formed a long-term bottom.Hackett believes a shortage of Robusta beans, primarily grown in Vietnam, is triggering a bull market in coffee just as Brazil's Arabica shortage in 2010 sparked a yearlong uptrend. A drought in Vietnam last winter led to smaller-than-normal sized beans, which reduced the yield per tree.Some 80% of crops have been harvested since the season began in late October, while London stockpiles have nearly evaporated.""This is a sign of huge Robusta deficits and that London certified stocks have been the only means to keep the market from running out,"" Hackett wrote in the Dec. 15 issue of The Hackett Money Flow Report.As a result, buyers are being forced to switch from Robusta to Arabica, but Brazil's low-quality Arabica is also in short supply. Brazilian farmers switched to growing Robusta over the past few years, while Roya leaf rust, a deadly fungus, destroyed much of Central America's output. IntercontinentalExchange Group's (ICE) stockpile of certified coffee has started falling. Meanwhile, coffee demand climbs to new records every year.Shortage Through Spring""When I run the numbers, we are looking at a sizable Arabica deficit between now and the spring of 2014,"" Hackett wrote.Trading reports show that commercial traders — the so-called smart-money investors— started buying coffee again in November near the multiyear low.Global coffee exports in October and November, the first two months of the 2013-14 growing year, fell 11% from the year-ago period, according to the International Coffee Organization.On the stock market, IPath DJ-UBS Coffee ETN (JO) dripped 33% lower in 2013 as Arabica coffee prices fell to their lowest level in nearly seven years. They'd already plunged 55% two years prior. JO has slumped about 75% from its May 2011 peak to a November 2013 trough amid record production in Vietnam and Brazil as farmers boosted planting acreage and grew higher-yielding plants. But the ETN has shot 14% off its all-time low to a three-month high this week.Silver, down 37%, and coffee, off 31%, plunged the hardest last year among the 22 commodities tracked in the DJ-UBS Commodity Index. The index fell 10% in 2013 with only eight components posting gains.""Commodities in general and gold specifically were pressured by a government shutdown, a strengthening economy, lower-than-expected inflation and concerns over the growth in the Chinese economy,"" S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a commodities report issued Monday.Commodities prices will likely fall further in the first quarter owing to slowdown in global industrial production growth, Credit Suisse wrote in a ""Commodities Forecast"" released Tuesday.Assets invested in commodity ETFs plunged 25% in 2013, according to Morningstar. Outflow totaled $29.5 billion in 2013, a sharp reversal after absorbing $10 billion in new money in 2012. Precious metals funds accounted for $28 billion of the total outflow.

New-home sales have been stuck around 300,000 for almost three years — for good reason. Just as the overproduction led to the drop, the underproduction is slowly soaking up the inventory.

686,ETN,"Follow Trang Ho on Twitter @TrangHoETFsGold prices and Treasuries soared Friday as stocks sold off, led by homebuilders, following a weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs report that made the prospects of more quantitative easing possible.U.S. nonfarm payrolls added 69,000 jobs in May, which is much less than the 150,000 climb the market expected. The unemployment rate climbed to 8.2% from 8.1% in April, the first increase in 11 months.At midday, Market Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ) outpaced all nonleveraged ETFs, rallying 7.3%. Global X Pure Gold Miners ETF (GGGG) jumped 6.6%, and SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) rose 3.9% to a three-week high. In the futures market, near-term gold popped 4.1% to $1,625 an ounce.""Friday morning's gains in gold come on panic short covering, bargain-hunting and solid fresh safe-haven investment demand,"" said Jim Wychoff, editor of Kitco.com, which specializes in precious metals news. ""The weak U.S. jobs data combined with the very uneasy status of the European Union and a weakening Chinese economy have played right into the hands of the gold market bulls.""Gold is rising on the expectation of a weaker dollar. It's in the best interest of the central bank to print money to weaken the greenback to support a deteriorating economy, analysts say.Pimco 25+ Year Zero Coupon U.S. Treasury Index ETF  (ZROZ) soared to an all-time high as benchmark 10-year bond yields fell 0.12% to 1.46%, a new record low.""It looks to us like a full-blown panic into Treasuries with the market already fairly extended before this week's action,"" Mark Arbeter, chief technical strategist at S&P Capital IQ, wrote in his weekly report. ""So far, the drop in yields and rise in price is not being confirmed by daily momentum, a potential sign of an intermediate-term top.""On the downside, iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction (ITB) was hammered the hardest among all nonleveraged ETFs, falling 6.7%. It sports the strongest IBD Relative Strength and Accumulation-Distribution Ratings of 93 and B among nonleveraged stock ETFs.On a technical level, the sell-off suggests traders are booking profits in their winners. Fundamentally, rising unemployment dampens consumer confidence because people worrying they might lose their jobs are less likely to look for a house.

687,ETN,"UBS' family of exchange traded products, ETRACS, welcomed a new member with a familiar face Wednesday: ETRACS Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMU).It's the same as JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index ETN (AMJ), but with a slightly lower annual management fee of 0.80% vs. 0.85% for AMJ.ETRACS is picking up where JPMorgan left off. A month ago, JPMorgan announced limiting the creation of AMJ shares to 129 million. AMJ is the most popular exchange traded note with $5.1 billion in assets.Halting new creations caused AMJ to trade like a closed-end fund, which issues a finite number of shares. When demand outstripped supply, shares traded at a premium to their net asset value. AMJ shares traded as much as 2.7% above their NAV on June 29 before falling back down, according to IndexUniverse.com data.AMU's underlying index currently yields 5.87%, according to UBS. It offers exposure to 50 stocks, including Enterprise Products Partners (EPD), weighted at 15% of assets;  Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP) 10%;  Plains All American Pipeline (PAA)7%;  Energy Transfer Equity (ETE) 5% and  Magellan Midstream Partners (MMP) 4%.Market Vectors and Global X coincidentally both launched ETFs tracking preferred stock indexes this week.Market Vectors Preferred Securities ex Financials ETF (PFXF) tracks the Wells Fargo Hybrid and Preferred Securities ex Financials Index, holding preferred shares from all U.S. sectors except financials.Preferreds And ConvertiblesThe index has 68 securities, including ones that Wells Fargo deems ""functionally equivalent to preferred securities such as convertible securities, depository preferred securities and perpetual subordinated debt.""The ETF's largest sectors are real estate investment trusts or REITs, weighted 31%; electronics 26%; automakers 12%; telecom 8%; insurance 6% and energy producers 5%. The underlying index currently shows an annual yield of 6.78%. It charges a net annual expense ratio of 0.40%, which Market Vectors says is the lowest among preferred stock ETFs.Global X Super Income Preferred ETF (SPFF) tracks the S&P Enhanced Yield North American Preferred Stock Index. It targets the highest-yielding stocks traded in the U.S. and Canada that meet size, liquidity, ratings and other criteria.The 47-stock index most heavily weights financials at 74% of assets, insurance 8%, real estate 6% and energy 4%. Global X did not state how much the index yields. SPFF charges a 0.58% annual fee.PFXF and SPFF will compete with PowerShares Preferred Portfolio (PGX),  iShares S&P U.S. Preferred Stock Index Fund (PFF) and SPDR Wells Fargo Preferred Stock (PSK).

818,ETN,"Gold and silver prices lost luster Thursday as the dollar rallied and the euro tumbled on news that Spain may need as much as 62 billion euros ($78 billion) extra to bailout its troubled banks.
"
819,ETN,"In afternoon trade, SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) fell 2.6% to a three-week low. IShares Silver Trust (SLV) dropped 4.29%. The miners crashed even harder. Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX) plunged 4.29%, while Global X Silver Miners ETF (SIL) collapsed 6.08%.
"
820,ETN,"Precious metals investors were disappointed that the Fed said it would be buying longer-dated government bonds to support the economy but not outright print money, which would devalue the dollar and boost precious metals. That's while the dollar rallied against foreign currencies on safe-haven buying and risk aversion to foreign markets. PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (UUP), tracking the greenback against a basket of the major currencies, jumped 0.89%. CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE) lost 0.94%.
"
821,ETN,"GLD and SLV both hit price resistance at their 10-week moving averages. The upswing from the previous four weeks looks at best like a countertrend rally in downtrend that started in September.
"
822,ETN,"UUP rebounded strongly after pulling back to its 10-week average from a 52-week high at May's end. FXE's chart looks like UUP's upside down. It hit resistance at its 10-week average after making a countertrend rally in a multiyear downtrend.

"
831,ETN,"Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said the central bank was ready to take more action if ""appropriate.""

"
833,ETN,"Unfortunately, previous rounds of quantitative easing and efforts to keep interest rates low haven't produced the results the Fed intended, such as getting people to refinance their homes and borrow more money to spur growth. Many homeowners can't refinance because their homes are underwater and therefore aren't able to take advantage of lower rates.

863,ETN,"UBS, Emerging Global Advisors and iShares all unveiled a batch of new ETFs and an ETN this week. Here's an overview.
"
864,ETN,"Super-Sized Mortgage REITs
"
865,ETN,"UBS has rolled out a new exchange traded note designed to double the returns and dividends of the Market Vectors Mortgage REITs Income ETF (MORT). The ETRACS Monthly Pay 2xLeveraged Mortgage REIT ETN (MORL) debuted Oct. 17, boasting a fat 24.82% annual dividend yield.
"
866,ETN,"The underlying index is most heavily weighted in Annaly Capital Management (NLY) at 19% of assets, American Capital Agency (AGNC) 15%, Two Harbors Investment (TWO) 5%, MFA Financial (MFA) 5% and Hatteras Financial (HTS) 5%.
"
867,ETN,"It charges a low annual fee of 0.40% of assets — far less than the 1% usually charged by leveraged ETFs.
"
868,ETN,"Mortgage real estate investment trusts raise money by getting short-term loans to issue mortgages and buy longer-termed, higher-yielding mortgage-backed securities. They make money on the difference between their short-term borrowing costs and the yield on their longer-term investments. As REITs, they must distribute at least 90% of their income each year to investors in the form of dividends.
"
869,ETN,"MORT has appreciated 25% year to date and 33% in the past 12 months. It now yields 9.43%.
"
870,ETN,"As an ETN, MORL's value is subject to UBS' credit quality and a ratings downgrade of the company may affect share prices regardless of the underlying stocks. ETN holders could lose their money if UBS goes bankrupt or is unable to pay its debts.
"
871,ETN,"Broader Emerging Market ETF
"
872,ETN,"Emerging Global Advisors, specializing in emerging market ETFs, has released a new fund it says offers more accurate exposure to developing countries than existing ETFs.
"
873,ETN,"EGShares Emerging Markets Core ETF (EMCR), tracking the S&P Emerging Markets Core Index, holds stocks from China, South Africa, India, Brazil, Russia, Chile, Malaysia and Mexico. It excludes Korea and Taiwan because EGA doesn't consider those countries developing markets due to their big tech industries and economic wealth. Korea and Taiwan are included in bellwether iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM).
"
874,ETN,"EMCR holds 108 stocks and is most heavily weighted in consumer staples at 18% of assets, consumer discretionary 17%, financials 16%, industrials 10%, utilities 7%, info tech 7%, energy 7%, health care 6%, basic materials 6% and telecom 5%.
"
875,ETN,"EGA says it offers more balanced exposure to developing countries than major emerging market ETFs, which overweight financials and energy stocks that are dependent on global growth. EMCR's overweighting in consumer stocks offers more exposure to internal growth and demand.
"
876,ETN,"EMCR charges an annual management fee of 0.7% of assets.
"
877,ETN,"iShares New Core ETFs
"
878,ETN,"IShares — the world's biggest ETF provider — unveiled a new Core family of ETFs by rolling out some new funds and renaming existing funds. Most got new tickers and fees were cut on six funds.

"
950,ETN,"The stock market sell-off that started in September has spared very few stocks or ETFs. But there are a few defying the swoon that are also paying juicy dividends, rewarding investors to sit on their hands.Here's an overview of five ETFs yielding 7% or more that are also trading above their 200-day moving averages, unlike some of the major indexes.1. Peritus High Yield ETF (HYLD) 12-month yield: 8.37%. Annual expenses: 1.35%.HYLD has returned 11.85% year to date vs. 4.31% for the benchmark Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond index, putting it No. 1 in its Morningstar category.Actively managed by Peritus I Asset Management, the fund buys noninvestment grade bonds — commonly referred to as junk bonds — that are trading below face value. This allows for potential price appreciation on top of the yield income.Peritus says it shuns credit ratings from the rating agencies in favor of its own research. It prefers buying bonds issued by companies that offer an ""essential product or service,"" generate free cash flow and have hard assets not priced into the bonds.2. UBS E-TRACS Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCS) 12-month yield: 7.08%. Annual expenses: 0.85%.BDCS has surged 27.30% year to date vs. 12.57% for the S&P 500. This exchange traded note tracks an index of 28 companies engaged in lending to small and midsized companies at high interest rates while also buying stakes in the companies. They may also get involved in managing the company.The top holdings in Wells Fargo Business Development Company Index and their respective index weightings:1. Ares Capital (ARCC) 10.16%.2. Prospect Capital (PSEC) 9.86%.3. American Capital (ACAS) 8.74%.4. Apollo Investment (AINV) 8.07%.5. Fifth Street Finance (FSC) 6.68%.6. Solar Capital (SLRC) 6.60%.7. BlackRock Kelso Capital (BKCC) 5.52%.8. PennantPark Investment (PNNT) 4.57%.9. Main Street Capital (MAIN) 4.33%.10. Triangle Capital (TCAP) 3.97%.As an exchange traded note, BDCS is an unsecured debt obligation issued by UBS. Its value may be affected by changes in UBS' credit worthiness. If UBS defaults, investors could lose all of their money.3. UBS E-TRACS 2X Wells Fargo Business Development Company ETN (BDCL) 12-month yield: 13.22%. Annual expenses: 0.85%.BDCL doubles the daily price movements and pays twice the yield of BDCS.4. SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond (JNK) 12-month yield: 6.89%. Annual expenses: 0.40%.JNK has returned 10.45% year to date. High-yield bonds make higher interest payments because the issuing companies have low credit quality or they're highly leveraged or indebted, which increases the risk of default or bankruptcy. But an ETF with 279 holdings minimizes the impact of defaults.The default rate in 2009 was about 13% and fell to 3.3% by the end of 2010. On a trailing 12-month basis the current high-yield default rate was only 2.2% as of July 2012, according to Morningstar.""Disruptions in the bond markets have caused this fund to experience significant swings in the premium and discounts to its net asset value (NAV),"" Timothy Strauts, an analyst at Morningstar wrote. ""While we believe that the problems actually lie in the markets of the underlying securities, investors should be aware of the premium or discount to NAV before purchasing this fund and be prepared to handle the gyrations.""JNK's correction during the recent sell-off has been very mild compared with the market. It's now trading only 1% below its 52-week high, while the market has fallen 6% off its multiyear peak.Investors have piled into bonds in search of dividend income as interest rates hover at record lows. Should rates rise, bond prices will fall. Prices and yields move in opposite directions.A major risk is that in bear markets, high-yield bonds can collapse just as badly as stocks. High-yield bond prices and spreads fluctuate with the market's expectations of high-yield issuers defaulting.5. iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond (HYG) 12-month yield: 6.78%. Annual expenses: 0.50%.HYG holds an index of junk bonds just like JNK. Its portfolio is nearly three times bigger with more than 600 bonds.
"
951,ETN,"2013: A Look Back And AheadWe asked investment strategists to share their top commodity ETFs bets for the New Year. Their picks: Viktoria Palushaj, market analyst at CitrinGroup in Birmingham, Mich., with $60 million in assets under management: iPath Dow Jones UBS Copper Total Return Sub-Index ETN (JJC).Copper prices reached near a two-month high of $8,140 a ton on Dec. 10, following news that industrial production in China — the world's top consumer of the industrial metal — grew strongly at an annual rate of 10.1% in November.While China's export-dependent economy continues to struggle with weak demand from key Western markets, its manufacturing sector has avoided contracting in the past few months as a result of the $157 billion infrastructure spending bill passed in September.China consumes about 40% of global copper output. So the government's commitment to construction and manufacturing will support copper prices next year. Also, g lobal copper demand in 2013 is expected to grow 3.4% over 2012 to 20.85 million tons. It's estimated that China alone will use 8.1 million tons.Beyond China, strong demand is expected from Japan and Brazil. Japan continues to rebuild from last year's natural disasters, passing a fiscal stimulus bill this year to be partly used on public works projects, while Brazil plans to invest more than $30 billion over the next five years to improve its roads and railways.With significant efforts and resources dedicated to infrastructure improvements, copper consumption should outstrip supply next year.One limitation to copper's appreciation may be on the supply side. China — the world's leading producer of refined copper — is expected to expand its mining capacity in the second half of 2013, which may lead to an oversupply. Still, demand growth combined with expected continued Federal Reserve easing are likely to support metals such as copper all year. Ron Fernandes, CEO of Avatar Investment Management in Stamford, Conn., with $800 million in assets under management: Market Vectors Coal ETF (KOL).Coal is an under-loved commodity within the energy sector. Low natural gas prices and a slowdown in China reduced demand and drove valuations down in 2012.However, natural gas prices are rebounding, China has stabilized, India is showing signs of life. Commodities are powering up and emerging markets are poised for continued solid growth in 2013.Four countries — China, India, Australia and Indonesia — generate more than 60% of the total world output. China alone produces 40%. The U.S., perceived by many as a leading producer, comes in at roughly 15% of total production.Global demand is expected to grow at 5% annualized over the next decade, more than offsetting the cut in U.S.-based demand. That steady growth will make both China and India — the first- and second-largest global populations — net importers of coal and provide an opportunity for U.S.-headquartered producers to build a lucrative export-driven model. KOL has little downside risk with potential to deliver a 25% return in 2013. Nick Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities in London, with $29.5 billion in assets under management: ETFS White Metals Basket Trust (WITE), tracking platinum, palladium and silver.White precious metals like platinum, palladium and silver, which have significant industrial usage, could benefit even as ongoing economic uncertainty is exacerbated by potential policy mistakes from global governments.Nearly 60% of the combined demand for platinum and palladium is from the auto sector. Platinum group metals (PGMs) are crucial components for autocatalyst production. PGM prices have been buoyed by improvement in U.S. and Chinese growth and ongoing mining strikes and unrest in South Africa, which accounts for about three-quarters of global output.Palladium has outperformed platinum recently, with eurozone weakness weighing on platinum's European diesel auto demand prospects. Palladium has the potential to further outperform given its more direct gearing to rising U.S. and China auto demand — though futures positioning appears quite stretched and needs to be watched carefully.While silver has returned 12% over 2012, its subdued performance in recent weeks appears to have more to do with its continued strong links to gold than its demand profile for 2013. Like gold, silver has historically been used as a currency. As the ongoing flood of liquidity from central banks threatens to erode the value of global reserve currencies, silver can provide a potential alternative investment. With over half of its demand coming from industry, mainly electronics, silver has significant upside potential if the nascent rebound in global growth continues. Adrian Day, president of Adrian Day Asset Management in Annapolis, Md. , with $170 million in assets under management: SPDR Gold Trust (GLD).The primary driver of gold has been easy monetary policy, which is positive for gold. The Federal Reserve is both ""printing"" money and keeping interest rates low. The recent QE4 (fourth round of quantitative easing) of buying $85 billion in bonds each month has increased the pace of money growth. Monetary policy in fact is easy around the world and likely to stay so.In Japan, the new government is committed to a more accommodative policy and the new governor of the Bank of England has indicated he wants an even easier policy. In Europe, the stage is set for the European Central Bank to begin buying sovereign bonds with newly created money.At the same time, global interest rates remain low. In a majority of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, real rates are negative. Short-term rates are lower than forecasted inflation. That is positive for gold.The major risk for gold would be tightening monetary policy, including significantly higher rates, which seems unlikely for the foreseeable future.In China, investment demand slipped marginally in mid-year after a strong first quarter as the economy slowed. But anecdotal evidence of record exports of gold from Hong Kong to the mainland suggest gold exports are rising.China's demand represents between 15% and 20% of world investment demand. Jewelry demand continues to increase as the economy and middle class grow. Last year, 516 tons of gold jewelry were sold in China, up from 400 the year before. India's jewelry demand has dropped from 746 tons in 2010 to just 516 last year, and this year is likely to have dropped below China's. It is unlikely there will be any significant increase in supply, absent any unexpected sales from U.S. stockpiles or other major stockpiles at the IMF (International Monetary Fund), Germany or France. Supply is expected to grow a modest 1% to 1.5% in 2013. Global gold production still remains below the levels of the early 2000s, at the beginning of this bull market.

952,ETN,"India's HDFC Bank (HDB) can boast solid annual earnings growth and an attractive chart. But perhaps its greatest plus these days is that it's based in India.HDFC Bank is shaping a flat base with a buy point at 39.42. The correction within the base is a remarkably shallow 8%. Volume appears mostly tame.This pattern is HDB's third base this year. The first two didn't go anywhere — either way. Thus, the latest pattern is a first-stage base, which is of lesser risk.More importantly, the last two bases were far more attractive than the first, a cup-with-handle that ran 33% deep.Also impressively, HDFC Bank's current flat base is appearing while the broad market is in a correction. This counter-trend stability is reflected by a rising Relative Strength line.HDFC Bank's earnings do not stand out as a typical superstar's record. The past four quarters saw EPS gains of 10%, 13%, 29% and 19%.Full-year estimates are running at a 24% increase for fiscal 2013 earnings and a 27% increase in 2014. Its years end in March.The company issues a small dividend, which amounts to a 0.6% yield on an annualized basis.The big story in India is the new effort by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to loosen some controls in this highly regulated and closed-to-outsiders economy.Most of Singh's moves need no approvals from Parliament, but some face lots of resistance from entrenched domestic interests.The first move was to raise diesel prices — heavily subsidized and regulated — by 12%. That was followed by lowering the barriers to foreign investment in some industries, including domestic airlines, power, retail and finance.The bulk of Singh's bold move was announced Sept. 14. The Bombay Stock Exchange's benchmark Sensitive index has climbed 3.6% since the close of Sept. 13. To compare, the S&P 500 has fallen 5.5%.Barclays iPath India (INP) ETN shows a 21.4% year-to-date gain. That puts it in first place on IBD's Daily World Map. On a 12-month-return basis, Barclays iPath India shows just a 1% gain and stands in 14th place.India's surge the past few months has been almost meteoric, compared to other major markets.IBD's foreign banks industry group holds a poor 98th place out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD, as of Monday's edition.But note that the group is rising. It stood in 154th place just eight weeks ago. Its climb since then has been steady if unspectacular.HDFC Bank holds the No. 2 slot within the group by Composite Rating. Another India name, Icici Bank (IBN), is in fourth place.

1002,ETN,"Spain outpaced global markets Friday as the government pushed to have European rescue funds go directly to its battered banks instead of through the government so that they wouldn't be added to the country's mounting debt.
"
1003,ETN,"Under current rules of the proposed 100 billion euro bailout ($125 billion), the public would be on the hook if the banks don't repay their loans and thereby burden the country with new debt.
"
1004,ETN,"IShares MSCI Spain Index (EWP) rallied 4.14%. EWP has been rising for three weeks straight, surging 14% from its nine-year low. That's not enough to meet the 20% jump off a bottom that to some technical analysts signals a fresh bull market. The rise, thus far, is viewed as a countertrend rally in a long downtrend.
"
1005,ETN,"The proposed bailout increases the risk of investing in Spain rather than reducing it because it would add to the public's debt burden, says Komal S. Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at TCW. Spain's public debt-to-gross domestic product ratio was 67% at the end of 2011. The bailout, when completed, would push the ratio up as much as 15 percentage points to more than 80%.

"
1015,ETN,"SPY, QQQ and DIA all dropped below key-price support at their 50-day moving averages the prior session with more than 90% trading volume to the downside. The sell-off prompted Simon Maierhofer, co-founder of ETFGuide.com, to close his long positions and go short, to profit from falling prices.

Arbeter, chief technical strategist at S&P Capital IQ. Crude oil and copper may have found a bottom and their rebound could push stocks higher, he wrote in his weekly technical report.
"
1018,ETN,"Traders' sentiment in crude is the most bearish it's been in three years. The Commitment of Traders report shows that producers or the so-called ""smart money"" are net long oil while the speculators or so-called ""dumb money"" have cut their exposures, suggesting that oil prices are due for a bounce, he says.

1054,ETN,"Follow Trang Ho on Twitter @TrangHoETFs.Spain outpaced global markets Friday as the government pushed to have European rescue funds go directly to its battered banks instead of through the government so that they wouldn't be added to the country's mounting debt.Under current rules of the proposed 100 billion euro bailout ($125 billion), the public would be on the hook if the banks don't repay their loans and thereby burden the country with new debt.IShares MSCI Spain Index (EWP) rallied 4.14%. EWP has been rising for three weeks straight, surging 14% from its nine-year low. That's not enough to meet the 20% jump off a bottom that to some technical analysts signals a fresh bull market. The rise, thus far, is viewed as a countertrend rally in a long downtrend.The proposed bailout increases the risk of investing in Spain rather than reducing it because it would add to the public's debt burden, says Komal S. Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at TCW. Spain's public debt-to-gross domestic product ratio was 67% at the end of 2011. The bailout, when completed, would push the ratio up as much as 15 percentage points to more than 80%.Spain's banking crisis has morphed into a vicious cycle in which weakness in its financial system entices depositors to pull their savings out and store their money in German or U.K. banks, compounding the weakness in Spanish banks.""The pressure on Spanish and Italian banking systems will increase. In turn, that would likely prompt additional capital flight,"" Sri-Kumar wrote.Market OverviewIn afternoon trade the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) rose 0.63% to 133.26.SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (DIA) climbed 0.55%.PowerShares QQQ (QQQ), a basket of the 100 largest nonfinancial stocks on the Nasdaq, increased 0.73%.IShares MSCI EAFE Index (EFA), tracking developed foreign markets, advanced 0.80%.IShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index (EEM) added 0.40%. Both EFA and EEM plummeted nearly 5% the prior session.Technical OverviewSPY, QQQ and DIA all dropped below key-price support at their 50-day moving averages the prior session with more than 90% trading volume to the downside. The sell-off prompted Simon Maierhofer, co-founder of ETFGuide.com, to close his long positions and go short, to profit from falling prices.""This may be the shakeout decline — leading to higher prices — but the odds suggest this may be the real deal next leg down,"" Maierhofer wrote in this daily technical forecast.The S&P 500 is trapped in a trading range between 1200 and 1400, or $120 to $140 for the SPY, potentially for the rest of the year, says Mark D. Arbeter, chief technical strategist at S&P Capital IQ. Crude oil and copper may have found a bottom and their rebound could push stocks higher, he wrote in his weekly technical report.Traders' sentiment in crude is the most bearish it's been in three years. The Commitment of Traders report shows that producers or the so-called ""smart money"" are net long oil while the speculators or so-called ""dumb money"" have cut their exposures, suggesting that oil prices are due for a bounce, he says.Fund FlowsETF and mutual fund flows show that investors expect a new round of quantitative easing and are opting for risk assets in the face of all the troubling news globally, including slowing growth in China and Germany, Spain's banking crisis, U.S. corporate profit warnings and weak economic data in the U.S., EPFR Global said.It reported in its weekly fund flow release for the week ending June 20:1. Stock funds overall posted back-to-back weekly inflow for the first time since mid-March.2. Redemptions from U.S. investment grade bonds hit a 13-week high.3. Mortgage-backed-bonds took in fresh money for the 67th straight week.4. Emerging-markets stock funds saw outflow for the sixth time in seven weeks as concerns about Asia offset optimism that European and U.S. policymakers will take more steps to stimulate their economies in the second half of 2012.5. Canada, U.S., Japan and Germany stock funds all recorded inflow in excess of $650 million.6. Europe stock funds saw their fifth straight week of outflow. But the total was offset by $869 million going into Germany stock funds.7. Global stock funds had their biggest inflow year to date as they extended their current winning streak to four straight weeks.8. Gold and precious metals fund inflow hit a 20-week high and accounted for all the inflow recorded by commodities-sector funds.9. Europe bond funds saw ouflow of $886 million.10.

And they previously have cited regulations and laws like ObamaCare as obstacles.Now comes the fiscal cliff, which was scarcely mentioned by firms last quarter but looks to grow more menacing as the year continues.Some companies, like Caterpillar (CAT), NetApp (NTAP), and Parker Hannifin (PH), are optimistic that lawmakers will act in time to at least moderate the tax hikes and spending cuts. But other executives expressed caution or alarm, according to conference call transcripts from Seeking Alpha.Richard Heckmann, CEO of Heckmann (HEK), was defiant earlier this month when he said his oilfield services firm is slashing capital expenditures for the second half of the year.""I don't know a CEO out there that isn't telling you that they're getting very careful about what happens in the second half...""And if (lawmakers) want to drive off the cliff, let them. But they're just not going to take us with them.""UPS (UPS) CEO D. Scott Davis pointed last month to weak retail sales and manufacturing activity as evidence the fiscal cliff is dragging on the economy.He added that forecasts for second-half economic growth are too optimistic and will likely be closer to 1%.Companies aren't just pulling back to minimize potential risks. They're also doing it because their customers are staying on the sidelines to see what happens.Eaton (ETN), a maker of industrial power management systems, is hearing concerns from customers in different markets.""In our talking with dealers and key fleets, they're looking at the fiscal cliff at year-end and they're saying, 'I'll wait and I want to see how that's going to sort out,'"" said Eaton CEO Alexander Cutler last month.He added later, ""It's not hard for someone to take six months off and then start up again.""Defense contractors have warned about potential layoffs if the Pentagon budget is slashed further, and companies that provide consulting services to the government are keeping new hiring in check.Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) said ""virtually all"" its clients are telling it to hold back. So the firm is being conservative about hiring until work is assured.Companies as disparate as retailer Target (TGT) and hard disk maker Seagate (STX) said they will take a conservative approach to inventories, due in part to the fiscal cliff.But others see opportunities as the cliff approaches. Real estate investment trust Kimco Realty (KIM) noted that ordinary dividends from REITs won't be affected by the tax hikes. It is also ready to buy property from owners worried about an increase in the capital gains tax.""There are sellers who are very worried where tax rates will be next year,"" said Kimco Chairman Milton Cooper. ""And they feel this is the last shot that they have at the lower capital gains.""

Only South Korea suffered a matching blow.But a closer look shows that Asia had already taken some hits Thursday, presaging the U.S. nose dive.It may be more useful to look at the combined two-day losses for those markets.South Korea's Kospi fell 3%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng ceded 2.7%, Australia's All Ordinaries lost 2% and Taiwan's weighted dropped 1.5%.Western Europe, meanwhile, took most of its losses Friday, although those markets also lost ground Thursday.The German DAX-30-share index fell 0.8% Thursday and 1.3% Friday.

1443,ETN,"Countries, like stocks, are either leaders or laggards. Results from the first quarter shed light on where the best opportunities have appeared among the Daily World Map's 18 markets.First, let's bear in mind the broad picture: A disaster in Europe has been narrowly averted, for the moment. With a recession in Europe, slowing growth in China and an unreliable rebound in the U.S., many are wondering where the world's growth engine will be found.The answer, perhaps, may lie in not one but dozens of central banks around the world. After a year of fighting inflation with higher interest rates, restricting credit and other tightening moves, the trend now is for easier policies to avoid a hard landing.Now rates are falling, liquidity-pumping is rising and loans are easier to find. The easy money has boosted foreign indexes and exchange traded funds.For instance, iPath India ETN (INP) shows an 21.1% quarterly gain, putting it in a tie for best performer on the Daily World Map. That's in stark contrast to its 12-month move, which shows a 24% loss (the Map's third-worst by that gauge).India shares the top spot with iShares MSCI Germany ETF (EWG). Its big advance may be puzzling to those transfixed by the grim headlines we see from Europe.The specter of higher taxes and budget cuts hangs over Germany, as it does over most of Europe. The Continent already has slipped back into recession.So where does the Germany ETF's strength come from? It could be the European Central Bank's recent move to easier monetary policy, including a sort of back-door to quantitative easing. (It had promised for years that it would not conduct such a move).Also remember that the Germany ETF had taken a drubbing during last year's Greek crisis. That damage can still be seen when looking at its 12-month return, which shows an 11% loss. By that gauge, it ranks 10th out of the Daily World Map's 18 markets.The No. 3 performer on the Daily World Map also is the  Nasdaq, with an 18.7% return. Maybe you don't really have to go too far to find big winners.Are you thinking that the Nasdaq's results may be lifted by some well-performing ADRs such as NetEase (NTES) and MercadoLibre (MELI)? Maybe, but a scan of Nasdaq's market leaders shows few foreign companies. It's been years since Chinese ADRs held seven of the IBD 50's top 10 slots. Those were the days.Rounding out the Map's top five you'll find iShares MSCI Mexico (EWW) (up 16.3%) and Market Vectors TR Russia (RSX) (up 15.9%).A surprise may be found in the Daily World Map's basement, where you'll find iShares FTSE China 25 (FXI) ETF, with a quarterly climb of just 5.1%.China's growth is the Map's biggest, and the central bank has been easing since October after a full year of credit-tightening measures.So why is China lagging so badly? Growth is probably slowing from last year's 9.2% pace. Austerity budgets in Europe are anathema to export-driven economies, and China's is the biggest.Perhaps, too, fund managers are avoiding Chinese companies, worried that they simply can't trust the numbers.Too many Chinese companies lied about customers, sales and cash on hand. Evidence appeared recently that local governments encouraged this behavior.

"
1448,ETN,"Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP): Ever since Congress created the Investment Company Act of 1940, the investing public has come to associate mutual funds, and now ETFs, as investment vehicles that are ""pass-through"" structures from an income tax standpoint. In other words, investors believe that funds themselves do not incur or pay any taxes. Any and all tax obligations are ""passed through"" to the shareholders. AMLP changed that.
"
1449,ETN,"There are more than 1,100 ETFs and ETNs listed for trading in the U.S. today. Of those, AMLP is the only one structured as a C-corporation. Because it is the first of its kind, investors are not aware of the outrageous expenses that come with this structure.
"
1450,ETN,"As a C-corp, it has to pay 35% federal income tax on all capital gains (price appreciation) as well as various state tax liabilities. This burden is of course ultimately borne by the shareholders.
"
1451,ETN,"Since AMLP does not know who or how many shareholders it will have when its tax bill becomes due, it must accrue this on a daily basis. AMLP accomplishes this by reducing the daily price change by 37.5%, leaving shareholders with the other 62.5%.
"
1452,ETN,"According to data from AMLP's website, since its launch on Aug. 25, 2010, through the end of 2010, AMLP shareholders only received 65% of the total return generated by the underlying benchmark index (8.7% vs. 13.5%). That is the equivalent of a 35% expense ratio.
"
1453,ETN,"The 35% entity-level tax obligation is before and in addition to the shareholder's tax obligations. If you bought AMLP in a taxable account when it was launched and sold on Dec. 31, you now owe taxes on your 8.7% return. Depending on your tax rate, this might reduce your return by another 20% to 40% of the remainder. It's essentially the compounding of taxes, or double taxation.
"
1454,ETN,"AMLP likes to counter this argument, saying that their distributions are tax-deferred. However, tax-deferred is not the same as tax-free, and having the fund pay 35% corporate taxes seems to defeat the whole purpose. MLPs are one of the most tax-efficient vehicles available to investors. However, AMLP is the least tax-efficient ETF that I'm aware of.

1457,ETN,"RBS U.S. Large Cap Trendpilot ETN (TRND): Trend following has become a very popular investment strategy, so a trend-following exchange traded product seems like it might be a big hit. The RBS U.S. Large Cap Trendpilot ETN is a relatively simple product. When the S&P 500 is above its 200-day moving average, investors get exposure to equities. When the S&P 500 dips below its 200-day, exposure is shifted to low-risk Treasuries.
"
1458,ETN,"But TRND is full of faults, and just doesn't make much sense for investors. For starters, the fees charged by this product are just plain ridiculous. When the strategy is invested in the S&P 500, expenses accrue at an annual rate of 1.0%. That's almost 17 times the fees charged by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). When invested in Treasuries, expenses accrue at 0.50%, or 41 basis points more than PIMCO 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index ETF (TUZ). There's nothing proprietary or complex about the underlying strategy, so going the do-it-yourself route could save you quite a bit in fees.
"
1459,ETN,"Then there's the potential ""strategy lag"" that results from TRND's methodology. Most investors implementing a trend-following strategy shift exposure as soon as a specified price point (such as the 200-day moving average) is crossed. But TRND implements a bastardized version of trend following; in order to shift into equity exposure, the S&P 500 must be above its moving average for five consecutive trading days. Conversely, it takes five straight days below to get into cash. That puts TRND behind the trend-following curve, potentially leaving some money on the table.
"
1460,ETN,"To top it off, TRND is a debt security issued by a financial institution that not long ago needed a $75 billion bailout just to stay afloat. Not exactly a recipe for investing success.

1462,ETN,"United States Natural Gas (UNG): UNG invests in near-month natural gas futures contracts. As each month draws to a close, UNG rolls its position forward by selling the near-month position and buying a contract further from expiration. This helps the fund avoid taking physical delivery of natural gas.
"
1463,ETN,"When prices of the longer-dated futures contracts exceed the price of the front-month contract — i.e., an upward sloping forward price curve, also called contango — the fund loses money each time it rolls its position.
"
1464,ETN,"UNG currently has two strikes against it. One is the oversupply of natural gas. The other is the price structure of the forward curve.
"
1465,ETN,"Weak industrial demand, coupled with excess supplies resulting from investments made in recent years, has caused inventories of natural gas to swell. The U. S. Energy Information Administration states that working gas in storage tallied 2,959 billion cubic feet as of Jan. 7, 2011. As such, gas inventories are 161 bcf above their five-year average of 2,798 bcf.
"
1466,ETN,"Looking at the price structure, natural gas for February delivery is currently changing hands at $4.42 per MMBtu. The prices for delivery further out are higher. Prices for deliveries three months, six months and one year out are $4.47, $4.62, and $5.19, respectively. In other words, the natural gas forward price curve is in contango, a situation that is detrimental to the performance of UNG.
"
1467,ETN,"If one expects economic recovery to gain further traction in 2011, it is reasonable to assume that industrial demand for natural gas will pick up and enable the price of natural gas to increase in 2011.
"
1468,ETN,"A better way to profit from the rise in price of natural gas is through natural gas stocks, either via direct ownership of stocks of natural gas producers or natural gas ETFs such as First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas (FCG) or such natural gas mutual funds as Fidelity's Select Natural Gas .
"
1469,ETN,"The negative roll yield that will result from natural gas' contango price structure will be a drag on the performance of UNG. UNG should be avoided at least until the natural gas price structure takes on a downward slope, i.e., backwardation, and the positive roll yield will become a tail wind.

We asked several ETF strategists to tell us which they think are the worst ETFs and why. Ron Rowland, founder, All Star Investor and Capital Cities Asset Management, Austin, Texas.Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP): Ever since Congress created the Investment Company Act of 1940, the investing public has come to associate mutual funds, and now ETFs, as investment vehicles that are ""pass-through"" structures from an income tax standpoint. In other words, investors believe that funds themselves do not incur or pay any taxes. Any and all tax obligations are ""passed through"" to the shareholders. AMLP changed that.There are more than 1,100 ETFs and ETNs listed for trading in the U.S. today. Of those, AMLP is the only one structured as a C-corporation. Because it is the first of its kind, investors are not aware of the outrageous expenses that come with this structure.As a C-corp, it has to pay 35% federal income tax on all capital gains (price appreciation) as well as various state tax liabilities. This burden is of course ultimately borne by the shareholders.Since AMLP does not know who or how many shareholders it will have when its tax bill becomes due, it must accrue this on a daily basis. AMLP accomplishes this by reducing the daily price change by 37.5%, leaving shareholders with the other 62.5%.According to data from AMLP's website, since its launch on Aug. 25, 2010, through the end of 2010, AMLP shareholders only received 65% of the total return generated by the underlying benchmark index (8.7% vs. 13.5%). That is the equivalent of a 35% expense ratio.The 35% entity-level tax obligation is before and in addition to the shareholder's tax obligations. If you bought AMLP in a taxable account when it was launched and sold on Dec. 31, you now owe taxes on your 8.7% return. Depending on your tax rate, this might reduce your return by another 20% to 40% of the remainder. It's essentially the compounding of taxes, or double taxation.AMLP likes to counter this argument, saying that their distributions are tax-deferred. However, tax-deferred is not the same as tax-free, and having the fund pay 35% corporate taxes seems to defeat the whole purpose. MLPs are one of the most tax-efficient vehicles available to investors. However, AMLP is the least tax-efficient ETF that I'm aware of.I don't claim to be a tax specialist, but no one has indicated that my analysis is incorrect. Investors should consult their own tax adviser about their particular situation. Michael Johnston, senior ETF analyst, ETF Database, Chicago.RBS U.S. Large Cap Trendpilot ETN (TRND): Trend following has become a very popular investment strategy, so a trend-following exchange traded product seems like it might be a big hit. The RBS U.S. Large Cap Trendpilot ETN is a relatively simple product. When the S&P 500 is above its 200-day moving average, investors get exposure to equities. When the S&P 500 dips below its 200-day, exposure is shifted to low-risk Treasuries.But TRND is full of faults, and just doesn't make much sense for investors. For starters, the fees charged by this product are just plain ridiculous. When the strategy is invested in the S&P 500, expenses accrue at an annual rate of 1.0%. That's almost 17 times the fees charged by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). When invested in Treasuries, expenses accrue at 0.50%, or 41 basis points more than PIMCO 1-3 Year U.S. Treasury Index ETF (TUZ). There's nothing proprietary or complex about the underlying strategy, so going the do-it-yourself route could save you quite a bit in fees.Then there's the potential ""strategy lag"" that results from TRND's methodology. Most investors implementing a trend-following strategy shift exposure as soon as a specified price point (such as the 200-day moving average) is crossed. But TRND implements a bastardized version of trend following; in order to shift into equity exposure, the S&P 500 must be above its moving average for five consecutive trading days. Conversely, it takes five straight days below to get into cash. That puts TRND behind the trend-following curve, potentially leaving some money on the table.To top it off, TRND is a debt security issued by a financial institution that not long ago needed a $75 billion bailout just to stay afloat. Not exactly a recipe for investing success. Sam Subramanian, editor of AlphaProfit Investment Newsletter, Sugar Land, Texas.United States Natural Gas (UNG): UNG invests in near-month natural gas futures contracts. As each month draws to a close, UNG rolls its position forward by selling the near-month position and buying a contract further from expiration. This helps the fund avoid taking physical delivery of natural gas.When prices of the longer-dated futures contracts exceed the price of the front-month contract — i.e., an upward sloping forward price curve, also called contango — the fund loses money each time it rolls its position.UNG currently has two strikes against it. One is the oversupply of natural gas. The other is the price structure of the forward curve.Weak industrial demand, coupled with excess supplies resulting from investments made in recent years, has caused inventories of natural gas to swell. The U. S. Energy Information Administration states that working gas in storage tallied 2,959 billion cubic feet as of Jan. 7, 2011. As such, gas inventories are 161 bcf above their five-year average of 2,798 bcf.Looking at the price structure, natural gas for February delivery is currently changing hands at $4.42 per MMBtu. The prices for delivery further out are higher. Prices for deliveries three months, six months and one year out are $4.47, $4.62, and $5.19, respectively. In other words, the natural gas forward price curve is in contango, a situation that is detrimental to the performance of UNG.If one expects economic recovery to gain further traction in 2011, it is reasonable to assume that industrial demand for natural gas will pick up and enable the price of natural gas to increase in 2011.A better way to profit from the rise in price of natural gas is through natural gas stocks, either via direct ownership of stocks of natural gas producers or natural gas ETFs such as First Trust ISE-Revere Natural Gas (FCG) or such natural gas mutual funds as Fidelity's Select Natural Gas .The negative roll yield that will result from natural gas' contango price structure will be a drag on the performance of UNG. UNG should be avoided at least until the natural gas price structure takes on a downward slope, i.e., backwardation, and the positive roll yield will become a tail wind. Matt Hougan, president of ETF Analytics, San Francisco.IPath S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) and iPath S&P 500 VIX Mid-Term Futures ETN (VXZ): It is tempting to play volatility here. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) is trading at its lowest level since before Lehman Bros.' collapse, and products like VXX and VXZ look cheap. Don't be seduced. These products actually track volatility futures, not the VIX itself, and that little difference makes all the difference in the world.You know how the United States Oil (USO) has trailed spot oil prices for the past year because of contango? The same situation exists in volatility, except it's 10 times worse. VXX lost about 70% of its value in the past year. Given the current shape of the volatility roll curve, it is set to continue its triumphant march towards zero in 2011. Could it spike in the interim? Of course it could, big time. But for long-term investors, VXX is a miss.

""What is the alternative, to let the banks fail and every politician in Europe to be disgraced and thrown out of office?""If Europe doesn't print money, it, the U.S. and Japan will go into a major, decades-long depression with massive foreclosures and unemployment like the 1930s, Guild added.CurrencyShares Euro Trust (FXE) gapped down 2% to a one-month low as it fell below its 10-week average. On the flip side, PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish (UUP) shot up 1.7% to a one-month high and gapped above its 10-week moving average.""Safety is everyone's No. 1 priority, and the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen are the most attractive plays,"" wrote Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT.""It may be too late for Italy to restore confidence, but if European policymakers do not step in with some type of response, we could be looking at months of less credit, balance-sheet deleveraging and uncertainty, which would not bode well for currencies,"" Lien added.

1684,ETN,"Some of tech's biggest companies are plugging into the smart-building field.
"
1685,ETN,"This market, also called building IT, isn't about installing solar panels or thermal windows. Rather, the goal is to make buildings smarter by applying information technology hardware, software and services to analyze and improve systems that provide a building's utilities, says Michael LoCascio, an analyst with Lux Research.

"
1687,ETN,"""There's a lot of innovation going on,"" in building IT, LoCascio said. ""These technologies provide valuable new information to energy users.""
"
1688,ETN,"Buildings with intelligent sensors, which analyze and control heat, light and more, can cut energy consumption by 20% on average, and lighting use by up to 60%, says a new Lux study.
"

"
1695,ETN,"Now, tech vendors are adding analytics programs and computer dashboards to better parse the data. Such systems can spot wasteful consumption of electricity, lighting, heat, water and more. The systems can send out problem alerts to maintenance workers or adjust building settings on the fly.

"
1697,ETN,"Current power consumption creates 6 billion metric tons of global carbon emissions per year, Lux says. The cost of electricity and natural gas consumed by buildings in the developed world comes to about $1.26 trillion a year, it says.
"
1698,ETN,"Yet, just 7% of commercial buildings in both the U.S. and the developed world have installed any smart controls at all, says LoCascio.

1710,ETN,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) yesterday announced that it has successfully completed $810-million buyout of Tools and Test Equipment business of Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report). The buyout, originally announced on Apr 18, will fortify Emerson’s position in the global professional tools market.Rockford, IL-based Tools & Test primarily engages in manufacturing instruments related to test and measurement and diagnostics. It also produces utility and electrical tools. Prime tool brands offered by Tools & Test include Klauke and Greenlee. Tools & Test operates 11 manufacturing facilities globally and has a workforce of 2,300 people. It generated roughly $470 million in revenues in 2017. Details of BuyoutAs noted, the acquired assets of Tools & Test will be integrated with Ridge Tool business of Emerson. Ridge Tool is part of the company’s Tools & Home Products business — one of the two businesses comprising the company’s Commercial & Residential Solutions segment.The combined business of Tools & Test, and Ridge Tool — anticipated to be worth more than $1 billion — will strengthen Emerson’s existing product offerings to electrical, plumbing and mechanical contractors. Moreover, it will fortify the company’s presence in European markets.Furthermore, Emerson anticipates this buyout to boost cash flow immediately while predicts earnings accretion in fiscal 2019 (ending September 2019). Snapshot of Emerson’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Emerson’s policy of acquiring meaningful businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to this buyout, in May 2018, Emerson signed an agreement to acquire Aventics — a Germany-based leader in pneumatics technologies. The buyout will cost the company €527 million and will be completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 (ending September 2018). In January 2018, the company completed the buyout of ProSys Inc., thereby adding new technologies to its Operational Certainty initiative while the buyout of Cooper-Atkins has been strengthening its portfolio of cold chain technology.It’s worth mentioning here that acquisitions/divestitures have a positive impact of 8% on sales growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 (ended March 2018). Zacks Rank & Other Key PicksWith a market capitalization of nearly $43.8 billion, Emerson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1713,ETN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Eaton Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 14.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 19.8x. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Eaton Corporation’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 20.5. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Eaton Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 14.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Eaton Corporation stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Eaton Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, ETN is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Eaton Corporation currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Eaton Corporation a solid choice for value investors.What About the Stock Overall?Though Eaton Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of D and a Momentum Score of D. This gives ETN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen four estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to three lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight up in the same time period.This has had just a small impact on the consensus estimate though as the current quarter consensus estimate has inched down by 0.8% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has increased 1.2%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Haemonetics Corporation Price and Consensus   Haemonetics Corporation Price and Consensus | Haemonetics Corporation QuoteThis somewhat mixed trend is why the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEaton Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Further, a strong industry rank (among Top 25% of more than 250 industries) instills investor confidence. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>
"
1714,ETN,"We continue to see a relative lack of earnings estimate revisions, both positive and negative.
"
1715,ETN,"A total of 1,574 full-year profit forecasts were revised upward as of Tuesday evening, versus 1,477 a week ago. As far as negative revisions, 3,253 were revised downward, versus 2,825 a week ago. Even though the number of negative revisions did increase, the change was proportionately small.
"
1716,ETN,"The bigger problem is the revisions ratio, which calculates the proportion of positive to negative earnings estimate revisions. For the entire Zacks Rank universe, the revisions ratio sits at 0.48. If the Financial and Retail sectors are excluded, the ratio jumps to 0.68. This is still much lower than we would like, but about even with what we saw for all sectors this time last year.
"
1717,ETN,"Obviously, looking at the markets without factoring in the financials is bit like trying to predict the forthcoming Florida primary while excluding everything south of West Palm Beach. One just does not come up with a reliable prediction. On the other hand, the numbers for the financial companies are skewed.
"
1718,ETN,"Let's take Citigroup (C  -  Free Report) for instance. The financial conglomerate (and Zacks #5 Rank (""strong sell"") stock) generated a fourth-quarter loss of $1.99 per share. The company wrote down $18.1 billion in bad debt.
"
1719,ETN,"Fast forward to Q408 when brokerage analysts projecting C to earn 86 cents per share. Considering that full-year forecasts have dropped by 37 cents per share, to $3.23, in just the past seven days, the fourth-quarter forecast is not to reliable right now. This said, it seems likely that the financial conglomerate will post some type of profit in the fourth quarter, resulting in spectacular year-over-year growth.
"
1720,ETN,"The same type of comparison could be made with many of Citigroup's peers, including Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report), which reported yesterday. BAC posted profits of five cents per share for Q407. Speed ahead four quarters and analysts project profits of $1.14 per share. Again, the Q408 numbers are not reliable right now, especially given the ongoing cuts to full-year 2008 earnings estimates.
"
1721,ETN,"The retail sector is a tougher call because we don't know if a recession will actually occur, and if it does, how severe it will be. Target (TGT  -  Free Report) announced yesterday that January same-store sales would be at the low end of its guidance, between a 1% decline and a 1% increase. We do know that consumers are curtailing their spending and that credit card defaults are rising. Add in mortgage rate resets and higher energy costs, and it is little wonder that consumers are watching their money more closely.
"
1722,ETN,"For most other sectors, brokerage analysts are waiting to see fourth-quarter numbers. This is not surprising, especially since we saw the same thing occur last January. At the same point in 2007, the number of estimate revisions (both positive and negative) totaled 3,890, compared to 6,078 now. (To put these numbers in perspective, in about four weeks, we should see more than 12,000 estimate revisions.)
"
1723,ETN,"Notably, the revisions ratio last January was 0.63 - and the economy grew just fine.
"
1724,ETN,"To be fair, it is different this time from a year ago. Twelve months ago, there was a legitimate concern about a liquidity bubble. Now, there is a legitimate concern about a liquidity crunch. Housing was in a bubble. Housing is now in a freefall. Oil was expensive; now, oil is [insert preferred expletive] expensive.
"
1725,ETN,"The biggest difference, however, is the questionable rate of growth. Based on the currently available data, the economy has slowed considerably. We don't know if growth has slowed enough to put us into a recession, but there is a definitive fear. (In last week's Philadelphia Fed survey, 27% of respondents predicted business would contract over the next six months.)
"
1726,ETN,"It is the fear of what could happen that has caused the global equity markets to plunge this month. This fear currently has an element of irrationality to it, when one looks at forecasts. S&P 500 earnings are currently projected to reach $94.80 this year - about 4% more than last year. Though this forecast has been adversely affected by the problems in the financial sector, it also masks growth in areas other sectors.
"
1727,ETN,"For example, consider yesterday's earnings reports from DuPont (DD) and Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) - two companies that should be hurt by a recession.
"
1728,ETN,"Chemical maker DuPont reported adjusted fourth-quarter profits of 57 cents per share yesterday, an increase of nearly 27% over year-prior levels. The company also reaffirmed its 2008 guidance for profits between $3.35 and $3.55 per share. Brokerage analysts had been expecting 2008 earnings to total $3.41 per share. DD is classified in Chemicals-Diversified.
"
1729,ETN,"Electrical system and component maker Eaton earned $1.79 per share, versus $1.66 per share. Sales increased 10% and a portion of the growth was organic (meaning not from acquisitions or favorable currency rates). For 2008, the company expects 2%-3% growth in its U.S. markets and 5%-6% growth in its international groups. As a result, ETN is guiding for full-year operating profits of $7.75 to $8.25 per share. Brokerage analysts had predicted 2008 earnings to total $7.66 per share. ETN is classified in Machinery-General Industrial.
"
1730,ETN,"Hopefully, we should have a better sense of where earnings are headed in a few weeks, as brokerage analysts react to fourth-quarter earnings and updated 2008 guidance. Nearly a quarter of the S&P 500 is reporting this week. Over the next couple of weeks, we will also see reports from multiple mid-cap and small-cap companies. Though growth is likely to be less than in quarters past, it is very possible that the slowdown in growth and the negative estimate revisions will not be anywhere as bad as the markets are currently pricing in.
"
1731,ETN,"To be clear, this is not a forecast for sunny skies. We are seeing earnings forecasts being reigned in; however, the current level of fear is worse than the actual economic problem.

"
1734,ETN,"The industrial sector has been a bit of a mixed bag over the past few months. Residential construction equipment has been weak, as would be expected. Sales of truck-related equipment has also been lackluster, a reflection of the impact of new environmental regulations that went into effect at the beginning of the year. On the other hand, electrical equipment has sold well thanks to ongoing demand from utilities. Hydraulics and fluid control systems also remain in demand, particularly for use in aerospace and energy. Internationally, especially in economies that are growing faster than the U.S., demand for many industrial products is strong.
"
1735,ETN,"Although not ideal, this backdrop has provided enough strength to help several Machinery-General Industrial companies exceed second-quarter expectations, including Cooper Industries (CBE) and Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report). 
"
1736,ETN,"CBE earned 78 cents per share from continuing operations in the second quarter, a penny ahead of estimates and 22% above year ago levels. Revenues rose 14% and reached $1.46 billion. Sales of electrical products increased 15%, reflecting higher demand from both utility and industrial customers and well as the positive impact of acquisitions. Tool segment revenues were materially helped by the weak dollar, though aerospace helped to offset weakness in the motor vehicle market. Approximately two-thirds of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year forecasts following the report, sending the consensus estimate up by three cents to $3.11 per share.
"
1737,ETN,"ETN surpassed expectations by 24 cents with operating earnings of $1.70 per share; profits were up 1% from a year prior. Revenues rose 4% to $3.25 billion. Sales were boosted by electrical and fluid power products, acquisitions and the weak dollar; offsetting these positives was a 23% decline in the truck segment. CEO Alexander Cutler believes demand for electrical products will strengthen somewhat in the second half of the year. Based on this expectation, and the impact of continued cost-cutting initiatives, Cutler raised his full-year profit guidance by 30 cents to between $6.75 and $6.95 per share. Nearly all of the covering brokerage analysts adjusted their forecasts in response, sending the consensus estimate up to $6.78 per share.
"
1738,ETN,"CBE is a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) stock and ETN is a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) stock. Three other Zacks #2 Rank stocks within Machinery-General Industrial also recently exceeded earnings: Danaher (DHR  -  Free Report), Illinois Toolworks (ITW  -  Free Report) and Grainger (GWW  -  Free Report). 
"
1739,ETN,"Ongoing strength within the aerospace sector also helped Honeywell (HON  -  Free Report) and Textron (TXT  -  Free Report).
"
1740,ETN,"HON earned 78 cents in the second-quarter, two cents above expectations and 24% above year prior levels. Revenues rose 8% to $8.5 billion. Aerospace sales were 13% higher, boosted by strong demand from the commercial sector. Margins for this segment were higher as well. The conglomerate also realized a double-digit increase in its automation and control solutions business unit. Looking forward, HON expects to earn between $3.10 and $3.16 per share this year; previously, the company had forecast profits of $3.00 to $3.10 per share. The majority of the covering brokerage analysts raised their full-year projections in response, pushing the consensus estimate up five cents to $3.14 per share.
"
1741,ETN,"TXT reported adjusted second-quarter profits of $1.94 per share versus $1.34 a year prior; the consensus estimate had called for earnings of $1.45 per share. Revenues rose 15% to $3.2 billion. Growth was primarily driven by Cessna, which enjoyed both higher volume and improved pricing. Commercial helicopter sales and profits were also higher. The company believes the strong momentum in the commercial sector will continue and raised its forecast as a result. TXT now expects full-year continuing operation earnings to come in a range of $6.35 to $6.55 per share; previously, the company had forecast profits between $6.10 and $6.30 per share. All eight of the covering brokerage analysts revised their projections in response, causing the consensus estimate to jump by 27 cents to $6.56 per share.
"
1742,ETN,"HON is a Zacks #2 Rank stock and TXT is a Zacks #1 Rank stock. Both stocks are classified in Diversified Operations. 
"
1743,ETN,"Several banks reported last week. As expected, weakness in the housing market led to an increase in bad loan reserves. Another factor at play was net interest spreads, which some banks observed were compressed. The problem facing banks is that depositors are seeking higher rates at the same time lending standards are tightening. This scenario makes it harder for banks to achieve profitability. Smaller, regional banks, which lack the broader portfolio of products that the large national banks can rely on to help boost overall margins, were particularly affected by the combination of higher bad loan reserves and narrowing net interest spreads.

1748,ETN,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported first-quarter 2018 earnings per share of 60 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents. The company continues its earnings beat streak of 25 straight quarters, which it broke once when it reported in-line earnings in second-quarter 2017.The figure improved 18% from the year-ago quarter’s tally. The upside mainly came on the back of robust sales growth. However, higher steel prices and inflationary pressure on freight and other costs dampened earnings growth to some extent.Inside the HeadlinesThe company generated record sales in the quarter which rose 6.5% year over year to $788 million. However, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $793 million by a whisker. A thriving water heater industry in the United States, strong demand for Lochinvar branded boilers and robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 3% year over year to $501.7 million. Higher volumes of commercial water heaters, strong sales of boilers and pricing actions related to elevated steel costs proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. Water treatment products contributed about $8 million to revenues and boosted the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings inched up 2% year over year to $106 million. The segment’s profit was favorably influenced by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers and pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by flared up steel and other costs. Consequently, adjusted operating margin expanded 110 basis points (bps) to 22.5% on a year-over-year basis.Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (including China, India and Europe) were up 13% year over year to $293.8 million. The improvement came on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s gas tankless water-heating and water-treatment products. Also, favorable pricing actions added to the top line. However, a significant decline in air purification product sales in China dampened growth to some extent.Operating earnings at the segment climbed 11% year over year to $36.1 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in China, along with favorable pricing actions, was partially offset by escalating steel costs and selling and engineering expenses. Operating margin contracted 20 bps to 12.3% year over year.A. O. Smith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  A. O. Smith Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | A. O. Smith Corporation QuoteShare RepurchasesDuring the quarter, A.O. Smith repurchased around 520,000 common shares for $33 million. At the end of the quarter, the company has approximately 1.9 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase authority.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Mar 31, 2018, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $241.9 million compared with $293.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Cash generated from operations during the year came in at $43.2 million, compared to cash used in operations of $11.5 million last year, as the quarter’s cash flow benefited from higher adjusted net earnings and smaller increases in working capital.At the end of the reported quarter, long-term debt was $285.5 million compared with $402.9 million witnessed at the end of Dec 31, 2017.Other DevelopmentsRecently, A. O. Smith announced that it was chosen as the primary supplier of water treatment products to all Lowe's home improvement stores in the United States. The company expects sales of roughly $15 million, along with start-up and transition costs, from the new business in 2018.The new relationship is likely to accelerate growth of the company’s North American water treatment product line.GuidanceConcurrent with the first-quarter results, the company raised guidance for 2018. A.O. Smith expects adjusted earnings between $2.55 and $2.61, up from the previous range of $2.50-$2.58. The mid-point of the range reflects impressive year-over-year growth of 19%.Additionally, the company expects to register revenue growth of 10-10.75% in 2018, supported by stable water heater replacement demand.Our TakeA.O. Smith started 2018 with good momentum, delivering strong sales growth driven by consistent demand for its consumer products in China and positive end markets for the company’s water heaters and boilers in North America. The company’s continued sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight its underlying strength.We believe that stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth in the near future. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water-heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets, is likely to stoke growth for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company.However, over the past few quarters, A.O. Smith’s SG&A expenses in China (including elevated steel costs and higher fees paid to installers) have been quite high, which is creating pressure on the company’s operating margins.Other Stocks to ConsiderA few other top-ranked stocks in the same space worth a look include Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report), II-VI Incorporated (IIVI  -  Free Report) and Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

1761,ETN," OVERVIEWback to topFirst quarter earnings season kicked off last week with Alcoa being the first S&P 500 company to report results for the quarter ended March 31, 2005. At Zacks, we actually started the clock ticking for first quarter earnings before Alcoas earnings release. We include companies that have released results for the quarter ended February 28, 2005 in our first quarter calculations. Therefore, there have already been 30 companies in the S&P 500 that have announced first quarter 2005 results.Based on the relatively positive preannouncement season, we expect 80-85% of the companies in the S&P 500 to once again meet or exceed their consensus earnings estimate. Further support for this can be seen in the first thirty S&P 500 companies that have released first quarter 2005 results. Of those thirty companies, 85% have matched or exceeded their earnings estimate, with an average earnings increase of 25% versus last years first quarter. We stress that these early reporters are an excellent gauge of how the overall results will shape up. Therefore, it should be of no major surprise that first quarter 2005 earnings should be very good.The Materials and Oil-Energy sectors are expected to post the largest year-over-year earnings gains during the first quarter. The lowest first quarter earnings expectations, among the consensus, are in the Consumer Discretionary and Financial sectors.Even though it is great when a company exceeds its consensus estimate, we really do not care all that much about what a company says about it first quarter earnings at this point in time.  We are more concerned about the guidance a company gives after reporting earnings.  Remember, the stock market is forward looking. Current stock prices usually reflect all pertinent information on a company that is anticipated to occur within the next 6-12 months. Therefore, it will be the guidance and the subsequent changes to second half 2005 earnings estimates that will determine the direction of the stock market over the next several weeks.There will be a noticeable increase in the number of companies releasing earnings results this week. We expect roughly 400 companies to report. Of which, 45 of those companies will be in the S&P 500.Zacks industry rankings are provided toward the back of this report. The rankings are based on a quantitative model developed by Zacks that focuses on past earnings trends and forward earnings revisions from Wall Street analysts. The model has an excellent track record of outperforming the market. Therefore, the Zacks industry rankings should provide a great starting point for your equity research. Companies in the spotlight
"
1762,ETN,"In this section, we focus on two stocks that our independent equity analysts feel you should be buying or selling. Our analysts start with the quantitative Zacks model and build their final buy/sell decision by performing additional fundamental analysis on the company. To view the entire report on each of these spotlight companies or to gain access to our detailed analysis on over 1,300 companies, log on to: www.zacks.com. Buy  Eaton Corporation (Ticker: ETN)Eaton Corporation is a global diversified industrial manufacturer of fluid power systems; electrical power quality, distribution and control systems; automotive engine air management and fuel economy systems, and intelligent drivetrain systems for fuel economy and safety in trucks. The company's primary markets for its fluid power, automotive, and truck products are original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and aftermarket customers of aerospace products and systems, off-highway agricultural and construction vehicles, industrial equipment, passenger cars and heavy, medium and light-duty trucks. The principal markets for the companys industrial and commercial controls products are industrial, construction, commercial, automotive, and government customers. The company operates through four segments via Fluid Power, Electrical, Automotive and Truck.Fluid Power segment: Fluid power accounts for 32% of Eatons revenues. This business is in turn divided into mobile hydraulics, aerospace, and fluid connectors. Products include hydraulic pumps, brakes, electric drives, and cockpit controls.Electrical segment: This segment manufactures switches and power controls used in the commercial, residential, and industrial end markets. After acquiring Powerware, the electrical segment is now the second largest business of Eaton with revenue contribution of 31% during 2004.Automotive segment: This segment accounts for 19% of Eatons sales. It produces superchargers, engine valves, and actuators for passenger cars and trucks.Truck segment: The truck unit produces drivetrain systems for medium and heavy-duty commercial vehicles. Products include traction control systems, transmissions, shafts, gears and clutches. It also provides aftermarket sales and support services to both medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles. This segment accounts for 18% of total sales.Given our assessment for an improved end market outlook and Eatons ability to gain market share, we reiterate our Buy recommendation the stock. We believe that fourth-quarter results were an indicator of  Eatons earnings power amid strong end-market demand.The companys fluid power and truck businesses are exhibiting positive growth dynamics, driven by strong demand conditions prevailing across end-markets for mobile hydraulics, industrial hydraulics, and heavy-duty trucks. While we expect the fluid power business to grow by 9% during 2005, the truck business is poised to grow by 10% to 15% over the next two to three years, as truck operators will need to replace aging fleets. With truck operators needing to replace aging fleets, this factor should boost the demand for heavy-duty trucks. We estimate NAFTA heavy duty truck production to increase from 262,000 units in 2004 to 310,000 units in 2005--a growth rate of over 18% year-over-year (y-o-y).We also expect end-markets such as commercial construction and aerospace to recover strongly during 2005, after a tepid performance in 2004. The commercial aerospace business is on the cusp of recovery and is likely to grow at a double-digit rate in 2005. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the aerospace market grew at its fastest rate in over two years. On the other hand, the non-residential construction market grew by just 1% during the fourth quarter. However, management expects this market to grow by between 6% to 7% in 2005, with most of this growth coming in the back half of 2005. We also expect acquired businesses, such as Powerware, to make postive contributions to Eatons earnings. The company believes that Powerware has excellent growth prospects and a wide array of products that are well-received by the marketplace. Given its low net debt-to-capital ratio of 29%, we believe that Eaton will have nearly $1 billion in free cash flow during 2005, which can be used for acquisitions.Eaton has also implemented price increases and has undertaken restructuring initiatives. We expect these measures to translate into higher margins during 2005. In its conference call, management mentioned that the company lost nearly $70 million from higher raw material cost during 2004 (net of price increases); however, the reverse will occur in 2005 with the realization of announced price increases. Also, we expect metal prices to ease in the second half of 2005 that should further aid margins. Sell  Hayes Lemmerz International, Inc. (Ticker: HAYZ)Hayes Lemmerz International, Inc. is a producer of aluminum and steel wheels, catering mainly to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in North America and Europe. The company manufactures automotive and commercial highway wheels, brakes, power train, suspension, structural, and other lightweight components. Its operations are segregated into three segments:  Automotive Wheels, Components, and Other. The Other category includes commercial highway products, and is also involved in corporate activities. Hayes has a global footprint with 44 facilities located in 14 countries around the world. It sells products to every major North American, Japanese, and European manufacturer of passenger cars and light trucks, as well as more than 300 commercial highway vehicle customers throughout the world.Dwindling auto sales and oversupply in the industry are affecting Hayes top-line growth. In its post-bankruptcy scenario, Hayes has been facing a weak sales outlook, as well as margin erosion. Although sales improved in the third quarter of 2004, due to favorable currency effects, weakness in the North American automotive market is likely to keep a lid on top-line growth. The current glut in the industry has prompted Ford and General Motors (GM) to announce consecutive production cuts. GM has slashed production by 70,000 units in the first quarter of 2005. Together, the Big Three automakers (Ford, GM, and DaimlerChrysler) in the U.S. account for almost half of HAYZs total revenue.Moreover, warning bells have been sounded throughout the industry, in view of eroding sales and earnings in recent months, as parts manufacturers wrestle with surging steel and commodity prices. The situation has worsened as Hayes, along with other automotive suppliers, continue to succumb to the demands of pricing concessions from OEM customers. As poor car sales wreak havoc with the OEMs profitability, the OEMs exert pressure on their suppliers to reduce costs. Given the weak North American automotive market, a significant departure from this trend is unlikely in the near future.Pricing pressure comes at a time of upwardly spiraling steel prices. Global steel prices rose throughout 2003 and 2004, led by a burgeoning demand for steel in China, and higher input costs. This trend, which is likely to continue, is expected to keep earnings under-pressure. Soaring steel prices are likely to wipe out approximately $20 million from Hayes earnings in the current year, $5-10 million more than originally anticipated.We do not foresee any meaningful improvement in the companys future performance, despite new business wins (worth over $300 million), as most of these are back-end loaded. With Big Three production cuts already in place, and steel prices showing no signs of abatement, contribution from new business will have some impact on margins only in the long term.In view of the production cuts by Ford and GM, as well as the margin pressure, due to lower selling prices and high steel costs, we take a negative stance on HAYZ. 4Q 2004 Earnings Scorecard  S&P 50066% (of the companies) exceeded estimates

1765,ETN,"Market optimism about the European situation refuses to die down despite the delay in the agreement on a comprehensive plan out of the weekend summit meeting. The expectation now is that the plan will be unveiled at another summit meeting on Wednesday. We also have a number of key economic reports on the domestic front coming out this week, with the first read on the third quarter GDP report as the most significant.
"
1766,ETN,"Euro-zone leadership appears to be coming around to the realization that the current unsettled situation carries serious risks to their economic outlook in general and their banking sector in particular. The resultant uncertainty is feeding into the broader economy and starting to weigh on consumer and business confidence. This morning's weak PMI reading is a reflection of this reality.
"
1767,ETN,"The market's optimism about the deal is a vote of confidence of sorts in the nature of the plan currently under discussion between the countries involved, particularly Germany and France. The plan will reportedly provide for bank recapitalizations, further strengthening of the rescue fund, and a major restructuring of Greek debt. The market has long been a looking for a simultaneous tackling of all these inter-related aspects of the problem and appears to be reassured that the leaders are finally coming around to doing that. It is far from clear at this stage if we will have the comprehensive plan on Wednesday. But judging by the market's reaction thus far, it is particularly disappointed by the delay.
"
1768,ETN,"In economic reports this week, we get the first look at the third quarter GDP report on Thursday, Durable Goods on Wednesday, and the Personal Income and Outlays reading on Friday. Recent positive economic readings have helped bring down recessionary fears and the GDP report may bring growth numbers as high as in the 2.5% to 3% range. This would be a significant improvement over how the economy performed in the first half of the year.
"
1769,ETN,"On the earnings front, with almost a quarter of the reports already in, we are seeing a fairly reassuring picture. The growth rates and extent of positive surprises are comparable to what we saw in the last quarter. There is still some tentativeness with respect to estimates for next year, but this will likely improve as the reporting cycle matures.  
"
1770,ETN,"Of the key earnings reports this morning, we have a solid earnings and revenue beat from Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report). Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) came inline with earnings expectations on modestly better than expected revenue, but the company lowered the high end of its earnings guidance. Roper Industries (ROP  -  Free Report) also came out an earnings and revenue surprise and raised guidance. Lorillard (LO), the cigarette maker, missed expectations.
"
1771,ETN,"With some of the more exaggerated fears about the domestic economy easing and the earnings season unfolding in a reassuring enough fashion, all eyes are now on Europe. A prompt conclusion to the current round of discussion and the unveiling of a plan will go some way towards lifting market uncertainties.RELATED ARTICLESGood - Not Great - Earnings SeasonSound Earnings.

"
1772,ETN,"Key Points:Third quarter reports starting to flood in. So far 126, or 25.2%, of S&P 500 reported. Total reported earnings growth of 12.1%. Ex-Financials, growth is 12.5% year over year. Total revenue growth 8.37%, 8.83% ex-Financials. Median earnings surprise 2.78% and median sales surprise 1.12%.For the vast majority (374) yet to report 12.3% growth expected, 12.0% ex-Financials. Down from growth of 17.3%, 18.0% ex-Financials growth in the second quarter. For Revenues, 6.23% expected and 10.00% ex-Financials.Second quarter earnings beats top misses by 2.65 ratio, sales beats top misses by 2.00 ratio, 65.1% of firms report earnings beats, 66.7% beat on revenues. Growing earnings firms outpaced declining earnings by 2.65 ratio, Revenues 3.67 growth ratio.Full-year total earnings for the S&P 500 jumps 46.0% in 2010, expected to rise 14.3% further in 2011. Growth to continue in 2012 with total net income expected to rise 11.9%. Financials major earnings driver in 2010. Excluding Financials, growth was 27.9% in 2010, and expected to be 17.8% in 2011 and 9.4% in 2012.Total revenues for the S&P 500 rise 7.89% in 2010, expected to be up 5.48% in 2011, and 5.52% in 2012. Excluding Financials, revenues up 9.28% in 2010, expected to rise 9.28% in 2011 and 5.71% in 2012.Annual Net Margins marching higher, from 5.88% in 2008 to 6.33% in 2009 to 8.57% for 2010, 9.28% expected for 2011 and 9.84% in 2012. Margin expansion major source of earnings growth. Net margins ex-Financials 7.79% in 2008, 6.99% in 2009, 8.18% for 2010, 8.82% expected in 2011 and 9.12% in 2012.Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 at 0.61 for 2011, at 0.36 for 2012 (both very bearish). Ratio of firms with rising to falling mean estimates at 0.54 for 2011, 0.36 (both also very bearish) for 2012. Total revisions activity past lows and rising fast. S&P 500 earned $543.4 billion in 2009, rising to $793.4 billion in 2010, expected to climb to $907.0 billion in 2011. In 2012, the 500 are collectively expected to earn $1.015 Trillion.S&P 500 earned $56.98 in 2009: $83.25 in 2010 and $95.10 in 2011 expected bottom up. For 2012, $106.43 expected. Puts P/E’s at 14.60x for 2010, and 12.78x for 2011 and 11.42x for 2012, very attractive relative to 10-year T-note rate of 2.19%. Top-down estimates: $96.66 for 2011 and $105.34 for 2012.The Earnings Picture
"
1773,ETN,"Third quarter earnings results are pouring in.  So far I would characterize the season as good, but not great. We have 126, or 25.2%, of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far. That sort of understates things a bit, since those 25.2% of firms represent 39% of all expected earnings for the quarter (provided that the remaining 374 firms all report exactly in line with expectations).
"
1774,ETN,"The year-over-year growth rate for the S&P 500 is 12.13%. That is actually well above the 3.33% growth that those same 126 firms posted in the second quarter. However, the second quarter was distorted by some big hits to the financial sector, most notably Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report). This time it reported better-than-expected earnings and did not have the big “write off it did in the second quarter. That resulted in a $12 billion swing in total net income between the second and third quarters.
"
1775,ETN,"If we exclude the financial sector, the year-over-year growth rate is just a bit higher at 13.51%, but it represents a far bigger slowdown from the second quarter, when growth was 22.71%. The remaining 374 stocks are expected to growth their earnings 12.33% over last year, down from 22.71% growth in the second quarter. If we exclude the financials, the remaining growth in the third quarter is expected to slow to 11.99% year over year from 17.99%. Then again, at the beginning of earnings second quarter season, growth of 9.7% was expected; 12.2% ex-financials.
"
1776,ETN,"We will need another season where positive earnings surprises far outpace disappointments if we are going to match the second quarter growth rate. If we combine the already reported results with the expectations, it now looks like the final growth will come in at 12.25%.Better than Expected
"
1777,ETN,"Relative to expectations, both earnings and revenues are doing better than expected. Then again, having far more companies report positive surprises than disappointments is entirely normal. The current ratio of 2.65 (for the 126) is actually well below the average experience of the last five years or so. The median surprise is 2.78% and that is also below normal. Still, it is far more positive surprises than disappointments.
"
1778,ETN,"Top-line surprises started off extremely strong, but faded over the last week. The surprise ratio is now 2.00 for revenues with a 1.12 median surprise. Not bad, but not terrific either. Top line growth so far has been 8.37%, and 8.83% ex-financials. The remaining 374 firms are collectively expected to grow their top lines by 7.20%, or by 10.28% if we exclude the financials.
"
1779,ETN,"Expanding net margins have been one of the keys to earnings growth. That is still the case, with reported net margins of 13.40% so far, up from 12.95% a year ago, and 12.27% in the second quarter (for those 126 firms). However, the mix of firms that have reported so far is skewed towards higher-margin firms, and the BAC effect is very big as far as the increase relative to the second quarter is concerned. Excluding financials, net margins have come in at 9.99% up from 9.58% a year ago, but down from 10.45% in the second quarter.
"
1780,ETN,"Looking ahead, overall net margins are expected to be down only slightly from the second quarter at 7.97% versus 8.00% in the second quarter, but up from 7.61% a year ago. Excluding the financials, though, it looks like the expanding net margin party might be coming to an end, with only 7.17% expected, down from both the 7.94% level of the second quarter, and 7.59% a year ago.
"
1781,ETN,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward.  In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.33% in 2009. They hit 8.57% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.28% in 2011 and 9.84% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 6.99% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.18% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.82% in 2011 and 9.12% in 2012.
"
1782,ETN,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $793.6 billion in 2010, up from $543.4 billion in 2009.  In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $907.0 billion, or increases of 46.0% and 14.3%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.015 Trillion, for growth of 11.9%.S&P ""EPS"" to Surpass $100
"
1783,ETN,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.43. That is up from $56.98 for 2009, $83.25 for 2010, and $95.10 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 2.19%, a P/E of 14.6x based on 2010 and 12.8x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is just 11.4x.
"
1784,ETN,"Estimate revisions activity is starting to rise again. We have seen a little bit of a bounce in the ratio of upwards to downwards revisions, especially for this year, but it is still far from turning positive. To some extent, there is a mechanical reason for upwards revisions to this year. After all, the third quarter is part of the full year, so if a company beats by, say, a nickel, and the analysts don’t increase their estimates for the firms by at least that much, they are implicitly cutting their numbers for the fourth quarter. With more than five positive surprises for every disappointment, one should expect more upwards revisions than cuts.
"
1785,ETN,"Even so, the ratio is still deep in negative territory at just 0.61, although that figure still includes a lot of estimate changes that were made before the earnings reports came in (we track a four week moving total). There is no mechanical effect when it comes to the revisions for next year, and those remain even further in negative territory at just 0.36, or almost three cuts for every increase.
"
1786,ETN,"The net cuts are very widespread. For this year only five of 16 sectors are seeing more positive than negative revisions, and eight sectors have more than two cuts for every increase. For next year, every single sector has more cuts than increases, and cuts out number increases by more than three to one in nine sectors. As the principal argument in the bulls favor is the high level of corporate earnings, and the low valuations relative to them, this trend needs to reverse -- and soon.
"
1787,ETN,"I would look for those companies with solid dividends and for which the analysts are still raising their estimates for next year, and which are rated either #1 or #2 on the Zacks Rank.  Some of the names that meet those criteria are DuPont (DD), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report).
"
1788,ETN," Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseJust 126 firms, or 25.2%, of the S&P 500 have reported third quarter results. Total growth at 12.13%. We have a 2.65 surprise ratio, and 2.78% median surprise, both slightly below normal. Positive surprises for 65.1% of all firms reporting.Positive year-over-year growth for 90, falling EPS for 34 firms, 2.65 ratio, 71.4% of all firms reporting have higher EPS than last year.Bigger firms have reported early, 39.0% of all earnings in (provided remaining firms report exactly in line with expectations.Pay close attention to the % reported column in assessing the significance of sector level data.
"
1789,ETN,"Historically, a “normal"" earnings season will have a surprise ratio of about 3:1 and a median surprise of about 3.0%. Thus in the early going, we are doing much better than average on the median front, and about average on the ratio front. Early on, the ratios and medians can be very volatile, but it looks like an OK start to things.

1794,ETN,"Eaton Corporation (ETN  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 financial results, before the market opens, on May 1. The power management company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.20% in the last quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderEaton expects first-quarter earnings in the range of $1.00-$1.10 per share and organic revenues to expand 4%. The company expects that negative revenue impact from JV will wipe out gains derived from currency movement.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $5,089 million for the quarter reflects a 2.4% drop sequentially. Electric Products segment is a major contributor to Eaton’s total revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,789 million for this segment’s revenues projects a drop of 1.8% sequentially.Eaton is expected to gain from its restructuring initiatives and share repurchases, completed in the last two years. Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Eaton is likely to beat estimates this quarter, as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here as you will see below.Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Eaton Corporation, PLC QuoteZacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.82%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of $1.05 is a penny lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 per share.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Eaton’s Zacks Rank #2, when combined with a negative Earnings ESP makes a beat unlikely this quarter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Stocks With Favorable CombinationEaton does not have the right mix, but one can consider some companies from the Zacks Industrial Products sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Timken Company (TKR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.79% and a Zacks Rank #2. It is expected to report first-quarter 2018 earnings on May 1.

1795,ETN,"On Apr 10, we issued an updated research report on industrial goods manufacturer, Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report).Over the years, Regal Beloit has consolidated its product lines and streamlined brands to evolve as a dynamic enterprise. In order to drive continuous improvement, the company has strictly followed ‘Compass Operating System’ that encompasses a common set of business processes, disciplines and lean Six Sigma tools. Backed by an “open-door” management style, this has helped Regal Beloit gain a competitive advantage and reach more people in diverse markets around the world.In addition, the company has continually focused on prudent investment decisions for a disciplined capital allocation, strong and flexible balance sheet position and cash flow enhancement to support dividend growth. We believe that such moves, along with a robust operating platform and an efficient management team will help in the execution of its strategic priorities and drive net asset value in the future. The company’s strong free cash generation is another positive, providing it an opportunity to pursue accretive acquisitions and unlock additional value.Furthermore, Regal Beloit continues to focus on simplification initiatives to lower operating costs and improve margins. The company expects organic growth in 2018 to be in low single digits with modest demand trends. Its long-term strategy involves organic growth through innovative products, broadening customer base, exploration of new opportunities and tactical investments in emerging markets. The company has also expanded technologically and geographically on the back of its aggressive acquisition policy. Management further indicated that it plans to continue seeking accretive acquisitions as part of its overall growth strategy. Regal Beloit remains confident of generating robust operating cash flow to fund its organic and inorganic growth as well as return significant capital to its shareholders.Despite core strengths, Regal Beloit has underperformed the industry with an average loss of 10.4% in the last six months compared with a decline of 3.4% for the latter. The electric motor manufacturing space is a highly competitive and fragmented. With the rise in competition within the industry, the company is witnessing a decline in its product prices, which is detrimental to its overall margins. It has to continually invest heavily in R&D to introduce newer value-added products that provide hedge against competition.Moreover, Regal Beloit faces increased concentration risks as a significant amount of its revenues is obtained from a handful of customers. The loss of any one of these customers could adversely affect the company’s top line. Adverse foreign currency translation, soft oil & gas markets and a challenging economy of China remain headwinds. Also, the cyclical business is dependent on industrial and consumer spending and continues to be affected by macroeconomic industrial cycles both in domestic and international markets. In addition, Regal Beloit’s earnings are susceptible to exchange rate volatility, which further undermines its growth potential.Nevertheless, we remain impressed with the inherent growth potential of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Some better-ranked stocks in the industry worth considering are Eaton Corporation plc (ETN  -  Free Report), Energous Corporation (WATT  -  Free Report) and Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Eaton has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.9%. It topped estimates twice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3%.Energous has topped estimates thrice in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 3.6%.Rexnord has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 12.5%. It surpassed estimates in each of the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 12.6%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

1798,ETN,"On Jul 9, we issued an updated research report on Enersys (ENS  -  Free Report).In the past six months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has yielded a return of 10.3% against the industry’s decline of 10.8%.Existing ScenarioEnerSys’ long-term growth drivers include higher demand for premium products, lean initiatives, robust prospects in Asia and strategic product launches. Currently, EnerSys is experiencing healthy demand for batteries from energy-storage products, commercial trucks, and aerospace, and defense applications. Also, the company has an interesting lineup of product launches, which it believes, will stoke growth in the upcoming quarters. In fact, rise in the sale of premium products have significantly boosted top-line performance in the recent quarters.Of late, both the company’s segments — Motive Power and Reserve Power — have been witnessing solid performance. For Motive Power business, the company believes that China will provide the much-needed growth impetus. Also, strong sales of thin plate pure lead, IRONCLAD, gel, high-frequency chargers and battery management systems in key end markets including Europe, Middle East and Africa are also adding to the strength of this segment. Further, the company’s Reserve Power business is also faring well. It believes that India’s market will act as the strongest catalyst for the Reserve Power Business.Further, the company’s business streamlining initiatives, aimed at transforming the organization into a leaner one, bode well. Presently, EnerSys is focusing on reducing costs of goods sold permanently by a minimum of 2% or $35 million by the end of fiscal 2019. These savings are expected to be driven by eliminating waste, increasing productivity and reducing costs.However, EnerSys is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, especially that of lead. The continuous increase in the price of lead and other raw materials including steel, plastic and copper is a formidable headwind. Rising cost of raw materials are expected to inflate the cost of goods sold, thus eroding profitability.This apart, a significant portion of EnerSys’ revenues and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies, which renders it vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies may hurt the company’s revenues and operating margins. Going forward, EnerSys expects currency fluctuations to weigh on top-line growth and hamper its flexibility in adjusting costs, thereby putting pressure on margins. Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks from the same space are A.

The power management company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 0.79% in the last quarter. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this earnings season.Factors to ConsiderEaton expects natural disasters to have an adverse impact of 3 cents on its earnings in the fourth quarter. The company also expects implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to result in a one-time tax expense of between $90 million and $110 million and affect fourth-quarter earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $5,090 million in the quarter reflects a 2.3% drop sequentially.  Electric Products segment is a major contributor to Eaton’s total revenues.

1800,ETN,"The cyclical nature of industrial machinery demand is benefiting from the synchronized global growth backdrop. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) recently raised its outlook for the global economy, with the financial institution anticipating the world economy to grow 3.6% in 2017. It expects 2.2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.7% in 2018, including 2% growth for advanced nations and 4.9% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that continuous advancements in technologies applied in agriculture and mining industries keep demand strong for farming and mining machinery. Moreover, healthy growth in demand for packaged foods and beverages across nations, especially in emerging countries, are significantly increasing the use of highly sophisticated food processing and packaging equipment. Further, need for better infrastructure and residential and non-residential spaces require heavy construction machineries.Machinery stocks are broadly grouped under Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The sector has performed well, yielding a solid return of 18.3% year to date. This outpaces growth of 16.9% recorded by the S&P 500 and roughly 13.2% by the NYSE Composite.Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers since the beginning of the year include Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corp., PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial Machinery: DescriptionIndustrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial machinery stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.The United States: The country’s industrial production increased2.9% year over year in October driven by impressive growth in mining, manufacturing and utilities output. In September, industrial production increased 1.6% year over year.In addition, a few indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. Per the U.S. Census Bureau report,new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 6.4% in the first nine months of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries.Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 261,000 new job additions in October. Average of new job additions in the last three months was 162,000 (accounting for hurricane affects). The unemployment rate dropped 10 basis points (bps) to 4.1%. Also, the country’s GDP has advanced 3% in the July-September quarter.We believe that implementation of the Trump government’s growth policies, especially the proposed $1 trillion spending on infrastructure improvement, will be a boon for industrial machinery stocks. Other tailwinds are the strengthening housing and commercial construction markets in the country. To continue supporting the growing economy, the Federal Reserve has hiked its interest rates twice this year while another one might be expected in December.The IMF projects the U.S. economy to grow 2.2% in 2017 and 2.3% in 2018. These estimates represent increase of 10 bps from the previous projection for 2017 and 20 bps for 2018.Japan: The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, an aging population and huge public debt.Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in April 2014.However, strengthening exports driven by rise in automobile and electronic shipments have supported the country’s annualized GDP growth of 1.4% in the third quarter compared with the previous quarter. In addition, we believe that initiatives to improve wages are likely to spur domestic demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months)increased 4.7% in third-quarter 2017. However, the same is predicted to be quite different in the fourth quarter, with total machinery orders likely to decline 1.9%. Core orders are expected to fall 3.5%, orders from manufacturing clients will likely drop 9.4% and that from government clients might decline 3.3%.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 20 bps to 1.5% for 2017 and by 10 bps to 0.7% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.8% from the year-earlier period in the third quarter. However, this improvement was slightly below 6.9% registered in the previous quarter as a rise in retail sales and higher exports were partially offset by weak expansion in infrastructure investments.The country’s industrial production improved 6.6% year over year in September on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in October grew 6.2%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. We believe that implementation of the government’s plan to spend more than $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020 will boost the economy and spur demand for industrial machinery.The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.8% in 2017 and 6.5% in 2018, up roughly 10 bps from the respective previous estimates.India: The country is currently witnessing the after-effects of some major reforms —demonetization and goods and services tax — implemented in the trailing 12 months. These economic decisions along with other strategies to make the country a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world are expected to drive its economic growth going forward.A favorable domestic job market, low interest rates allowing easy accessibility to cheap loans, infrastructure investments, healthy export demand and better monsoon conditions are additional factors that can make the country a favorable investment destination.The country’s industrial production decelerated to 3.8% in September 2017, having expanded 4.5% in the previous month. Production suffered from weakness in mining and electricity outputs. In the first half of fiscal 2017 (ended September), industrial production expanded 2.5% year over year.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 7.4% in 2018, down roughly 50 bps and 30 bps from the respective previous estimates.Brazil: One of the major road blocks for the Brazilian economy are the political uncertainties which have gripped the nation, somewhat jeopardizing its growth opportunities. Corruption charges against its president are believed to be one of the reasons behind the country’s poor investment grade ratings. Moreover, low private investments, inadequate infrastructure and still a high unemployment rate of 12.4% are other major hurdles.Partially negating the impact of these aspects, growth in export demand and efforts to implement a new pension reform targeting the curbing of public debt are currently strengthening hopes of a turnaround in the Brazilian economy. Also, falling inflation have prompted the countries’ Central Bank to ease interest rates. Notably, the interest rate has been lowered by 75 bps in October, this being its ninth consecutive rate cut since October 2016.In addition, the country’s industrial production has been encouraging since the beginning of the year. Per the latest data, industrial production in September grew 2.6% from the year-ago comparable month.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.7% in 2017, reflecting a 40 bps increase from the previous forecast. Also, growth projection for 2018 has been increased by 20 bps to 1.5%.Eurozone: The region, amidst all the political uncertainties, is showing slight improvement in export demand and labor markets. The region’s GDP has improved 2.5% year over year in third-quarter 2017 while industrial production has improved 3.3% year over year in September. The unemployment rate at September end was 8.9% versus 9% at the end of the previous month.The region’s GDP when compared with the previous quarter inched up 0.6% versus 0.7% recorded in the second quarter. Industrial production, on a month-on-month basis, fell 0.6% in September.The IMF increased output growth estimates by 20 bps both for 2017 and 2018 to 2.1% and 1.9%, respectively.Sector and Industry RankingOf the 16 Zacks sector, Industrial Products is currently in the top 25%, holding the fourth position. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one-week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank)The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipment (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rankof 17), construction and mining equipment (ranked 5), industrial electronics (ranked 186), electrical products (ranked 115), thermal products (ranked 28), material handling products (ranked 28), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 115), industrial tools and providing related services (ranked 20) and companies serving general industrial purposes are ranked 62.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries, except for one, fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Zacks Earnings Trends report dated Nov 16, roughly 470 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the July-September quarter, with 72.3% beating earnings estimates and 66.5% surpassing revenue projections.Of the Industrial Products stocks, roughly 95.8% reported results til Nov 16. Earnings grew 16.7% year over year, with roughly 65.2% companies beating estimates. Revenues improved 2.9%, with a sales beat of 69.6%.In the quarter, the S&P 500 companies collectively are projected to deliver earnings growth of 6.5% and sales growth of 5.8%. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging. Earnings for industrial stocks are projected to grow 18.7% while sales to increase 4.5%.Our TakeIt will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR  -  Free Report) and Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.In the S&P 500 group, a major machinery company is Caterpillar. It has a market capitalization of $82.7 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the next three to five years, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 10.3%.Earnings for Deere & Company are predicted to grow 8%. It currently has $48 billion market capitalization and Zacks Rank of #1.The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.Internal requirements as well as export orders play a key role in determining the demand for industrial machineries in any country. We believe that efforts to improve trade relations across nations will be a boon for machinery companies. Also, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand will help in accelerating growth.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

1804,ETN,"Eaton Corporation (ETN  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 financial results before the market opens on Aug 1. The power management company reported a positive earnings surprise in three out of the last four quarters, resulting in an average surprise of 3.26%.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Eaton Corporation is likely to beat estimates because it has the right combination of two key ingredients. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) to be able to beat estimates and Eaton Corporation has the right mix.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is +1.72%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $1.18, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16. This is a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise.Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and EPS Surprise   Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Eaton Corporation, PLC QuoteZacks Rank: Eaton currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. The combination of Eaton’s favorable Zacks Rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive surprise this season.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderEaton expects its earnings per share to be between $1.05 and $1.15 in second-quarter 2017. Segment margins are expected in the range of 15.2–15.6%, including restructuring costs.To cope with the challenging environment, the company had planned a restructuring program. Eaton will continue the program and reap its benefits in the second quarter and throughout 2017.Eaton continues to invest in research and development (R&D) activities to churn out new products and upgrade the existing ones to facilitate effective and easy power management. In addition, the improvement in its end market will result in organic growth and boost earnings.However, foreign exchange is expected to have a negative impact on earnings in the second quarter.Other Stocks to ConsiderApart from Eaton Corporation, one can consider a few other companies from the Sector that have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and a Zacks Rank #1.

1805,ETN,"One the world's top investment banks today lowered their forecasts for global GDP by 30 basis points and 70 basis points for this year and next, respectively. Here are Morgan Stanleys revisions to prior projections:
"
1806,ETN,"2011: Global GDP forecast of 3.9%, down from 4.2%2012: Global GDP forecast of 3.8%, down from 4.5%
"
1807,ETN,"This is exactly what I have been saying to expect since July 29 when we got final -- and abysmal -- GDP revisions for the US economy for the previous three quarters. When the first half clocked in at a dismal 0.8% growth, I said stocks would go lower as large investors priced in a probable recession even before they could prove it was coming.
"
1808,ETN,"What proof were they looking for? Visibility on corporate earnings and domestic demand, which is essentially GDP since 45% of the S&P 500 earnings are from abroad and a large part of this is not part of the domestic math.
"
1809,ETN,"Proof was needed because of these new concerns:
"
1810,ETN,"China trying to cool its red-hot pace of growth
"
1811,ETN,"Europe on the verge a systemic banking crisis
"
1812,ETN,"Weak manufacturing and consumer data in the US
"
1813,ETN,"Philly Fed Drops a Bomb
"
1814,ETN,"And the other dose of data we got Thursday that can be put in the ""confirms a coming recession"" camp was the Philly Fed Survey. How serious is it that this one came in at -30.7 when the market was looking for something closer to zero?
"
1815,ETN,"The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Survey of business conditions tracks sentiment and trends among industrial manufacturers in that district, including data for orders, shipments, employment, and prices. Its correlation to the national industrial production data is strong and it is considered a relatively solid leading indicator for the rest of the country.
"
1816,ETN,"There was concern in June when the Philly Fed dropped below the zero line to a minus 7.7 reading. July saw it peek its head back above zero, so it looked like we could have a repeat of last August to October in this data, where a sub-zero mark was quickly erased by a surge above 40.
"
1817,ETN,"But given the other ""slowdown is here"" data and the tone of the Federal Reserve after both its June and August FOMC meetings, manufacturers may have begun pricing in the recession just as quickly.
"
1818,ETN,"The significance of the -30 reading is that it brings us right back to where we were during the 2008-09 recession when industrial production measures were hitting anywhere from -2% to -4%. That's scary territory for stocks.
"
1819,ETN,"Are the Philly Fed district manufacturers right? Is the slowdown more severe than most investors had imagined? We shall have to wait for more data to know for sure. Meanwhile, the stock market ecology remains unstable...
"
1820,ETN,"Sell First, Investigate Later
"
1821,ETN,"The month of August so far has been a classic example of ""shoot first and ask questions later."" In this case, good stocks are being shot while the recession gets discounted.
"
1822,ETN,"Morgan Stanley will not be the last investment or research house to downgrade growth. We still await the Fed to revise its GDP projections as I wrote about in these two articles...
"
1823,ETN,"QE3 and the Probability of Recession, August 10Bernanke: I See Unemployed People, August 9
"
1824,ETN,"Where it will get really interesting is when we get specific calls on US GDP. Surely, many strategists are at work formulating their revisions based on an overall analysis of the global economy since Emerging Markets are such a driver of US economic growth.
"
1825,ETN,"Does Philly Fed in Recession Territory Make it a Done Deal?
"
1826,ETN,"Thursday's market meltdown is driven as much by the fears in Europe and Morgan Stanley's downcast view as by the depressing Philadelphia Fed survey.
"
1827,ETN,"This puts Federal Reserve leaders in new light, especially with three dissenters on the last FOMC vote and dovish Dudley out there already this week explaining the necessity of continued extraordinary monetary accommodation.
"
1828,ETN,"Even though I said on Bloomberg TV Thursday that I had moved my recession probability from 40% to 50% based on Philly Fed, I still wait for more confirming data. I hope this doesn't become a self-fulfilling recession as I wrote about last week.
"
1829,ETN,"And I trust that monetary accommodation can beat the threat of deflation. In the meantime, I won't be afraid to take positions in my favorite stocks on these fear-driven sell-off days.
"
1830,ETN,"Plus, in addition to my thesis from Wednesday that there is extreme fundamental value in the S&P 500 around 1,100, I saw two barometers of risk appetite holding up well on Thursday: copper and the euro.
"
1831,ETN,"If the recession were a done deal, copper would be selling off more dramatically. It continues to stay close to $4. I still like my current long holding in Southern Copper (SCCO  -  Free Report) here, especially near its 52-week lows and kicking out an 8% dividend yield.
"
1832,ETN,"And if Europe's banking system were going to implode, the euro would not be holding on above $1.43 so well. The crude oil market, conversely, is definitely taking it on the chin, so I have reasons to worry about my energy stocks like Suncor (SU  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report), as well as my industrial names like Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) and Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report).
"
1833,ETN,"But I also don't think Philly Fed spells a certain recession. And I look forward to seeing what opportunities the next few weeks bring.

1835,ETN,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report), a provider of safety and security products, is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results, before the opening bell on Jul 27.In the last reported quarter, the company had delivered a positive 5.8% earnings surprise. Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in only two of the last four quarters, resulting in an average earnings beat of 2.01%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayA look at estimate revisions lends us an idea of analyst expectations right before a company’s earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings per share increased by 1 cent in the past 60 days to $1.00. This reflects a year-over-year increase of 1.3%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of $613.4 million for the said quarter, reflecting a 4.9% increase from a year ago.Allegion continues to benefit from its acquisition drive. The company broadens its product portfolio as well as geographic footprint and enhances its position in strategic market segments through buyouts. Recently acquired McKenzie-based Republic Doors & Frames is expected to expand its product line, improve operating efficiency and expand its distribution footprint. This addition is expected to boost sales in the to-be-reported quarterThe company’s Americas segment has been performing well, accounting for 74.3% of total revenue in the first quarter. Overall 8% organic growth in the first quarter was driven by strong performance in the Americas segment, reflecting continued strength in the region’s channel initiatives, synergies from new product introductions, electronics growth and strong demand in both non-residential and residential businesses. We expect this trend to continue in the to-be-reported quarter.However, we are concerned about economic slowdown in certain pockets of the world where Allegion has considerable presence. Moreover, owing to the company’s substantial international presence, volatile currency translations could prove to be a significant headwind.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Allegion is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here as you will see below.Zacks ESP:  Allegion has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. That is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.00 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Allegion PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Allegion PLC QuoteZacks Rank: Allegion has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP.

1836,ETN,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 26.With a string of earnings beats over the past 22 quarters, the company’s surprise history is quite spectacular. Last quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of 6.4%. The stock boasts an average positive surprise of 4.9% over the past four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement and whether A. O. Smith is set to add yet another earnings beat to its winning streak.Factors to ConsiderA.O. Smith’s thriving residential and commercial boiler businesses have consistently raised the top and bottom line over the past several quarters. We believe the stellar demand for its products in China and boilers and commercial water heaters in the U.S. will prove conducive to its sales performance. Factors, including an increasing number of households, thriving replacement market, geographic expansion and improved product mix are likely to act as tailwinds for China.A.O. Smith’s sales of residential and commercial boilers are largely driven by innovation by Lochinvar. Lochinvar-branded products have benefited from the transition from lower-efficiency to higher-efficiency boilers, new product introduction and market share gain. During first-quarter 2017, Lochinvar-branded products grew 5%, led by strong demand for water heater and modest growth in boilers. This trend is likely to continue for the second quarter as well.This apart, we believe the Aquasana buyout, which was completed last year, has helped A.O. Smith to cross-sell water treatment products in China. As a matter of fact, for full-year 2017, the company anticipates Aquasana sales to lie within the band of $55–60 million, proving accretive to earnings growth.Despite these positives, the company has been witnessing a rise in overall operating expenses over the past few quarters. High selling and administrative expenses to support the development of innovative products and quality improvement are expected to hurt second-quarter margins.Moreover, escalating capital expenditures, in relation to capacity expansion in China and ERP implementation initiatives, are likely to remain an overhang. Also, currency headwinds that have been eroding A.O. Smith’s sales of late, are a concern.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that A. O. Smith will beat on earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for the company is 0.00%.

1837,ETN,"Snap-on Incorporated (SNA  -  Free Report) maintained its impressive earnings beat streak, posting second-quarter 2017 net earnings of $2.60 per share. Earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 by 1.6%. The bottom line also reflected an increase of 10.2% from the year-ago figure of $2.36.The bottom line benefited from Snap-on’s robust business model and focus on value-creation processes. Also, organic top-line growth proved conducive to the earnings performance.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter increased 5.6% year over year to $921.4 million, but missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $922 million by a whisker. Excluding acquisition-related expenses and unfavorable foreign currency translation effect, organic sales rose 2.7% year over year.Solid sales growth at Snap-on Repair Systems & Information and Commercial & Industrial Group drove the top line. However, unfavorable foreign currency translation restricted revenue growth to some extent.Segment wise, Commercial & Industrial Group sales rose 8.5% to $310 million. Organic sales were up 4.7% primarily owing to strong performance in the European-based hand tools business. Also, higher sales to customers in critical industries, including military, drove the top line at this segment. Unfavorable foreign currency translation had a $4.9-million impact on sales, thereby offsetting organic growth to an extent.Snap-on’s Tools Group revenues edged down 0.7% year over year to $413.8 million. Organic sales at the segment recorded a minor improvement of 0.5%, but unfavorable foreign currency translation impact of $5 million more than offset the same.Repair Systems & Information continued to display strength, as revenues climbed 14.5% year over year to $338.1 million. Meanwhile, organic sales at the segment improved 8.3%. Higher sales of diagnostics and repair information products to independent repair shop owners and managers, OEM dealerships and undercar equipments drove strong organic growth at the segment.On the other hand, the Financial Services business reported revenues of $77.7 million compared with $69.3 million recorded in the year-ago quarter.Operating earnings before financial services in the quarter came in at $183.7 million, up 10.4% from $166.4 million in the prior-year quarter.Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Snap-On Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Snap-On Incorporated QuoteLiquidityAt the end of the reported quarter, Snap-on’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $89 million compared with $77.6 million at the end of 2016. The company’s long-term debt came in at $755.6 million at quarter end, up from $708.8 million at the end of 2016.Other ActivitiesDuring the reported quarter, Snap-on acquired Norbar Torque Tools, along with its U.S. and Chinese joint ventures, for roughly $72 million. Norbar is a leading European manufacturer which boasts a complete range of torque products and also enjoys a robust foothold in critical industries, like power generation, oil & gas, mining and railroad. Norbar will complement and expand Snap-on’s existing torque portfolio, and help it to cater to critical industries, particularly in powered torque products.Earlier, in fourth-quarter 2016, Snap-on purchased Sweden-based firm – Car-O-Liner – to reinforce the Repair Systems & Information Group’s position, and fortify its hold in the auto and heavy duty markets. The company anticipates this acquisition and favorable industry trends to strengthen its relationship with repair shop owners and managers.Snap-on also acquired torque wrench marker – Sturtevant Richmont — which is engaged in the designing, manufacturing, and distributing of mechanical and electronic torque wrenches. Snap-on believes that this strategic buyout will improve its critical mechanical performance by addressing critical torque requirements.To ConcludeDespite industry headwinds, Snap-on continues to perform impressively. The company’s overarching business model, which aims to maximize value-creation by focusing on areas like safety, quality of service, customer satisfaction and innovation, has emerged as a tried and tested growth driver. Snap-on is committed to its rapid continuous improvement program, designed to enhance organizational effectiveness and minimize costs.Moving ahead, Snap-on announced plans to enhance the franchise network, expand ties with repair shop owners and managers, and foray into critical industries to strengthen its hold in emerging markets. Solid prospects across business segments, accretive acquisitions and impressive traction of the recently launched products continue to add to the strength of this company.However, in recent times, oil market sluggishness and currency fluctuations have been eroding the profitability of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Further, persistent contraction in capital expenditure by auto dealers and intensifying used car asset quality pressure are formidable headwinds for the company. The ongoing softness in industrial markets are impacting client spending, which, in turn, is adding to the company’s woes, primarily affecting its industrial business. These factors remain substantial risks for Snap-On in the times to come.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader sector include A.O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report), Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report). All three stocks hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1838,ETN,"ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report) reported operational earnings per share of 30 cents, down 14.3% year over year, but beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents by 3.4%. Steady revenues and diligent cost-saving initiatives helped maintain earnings. However, this was more than offset by tough macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions which ultimately affected revenues.Investors were disappointed with the year-over-year earnings contraction and ABB’s shares were down 3.7% at one point in pre-market trading.Quarterly revenues were up 1% year over year and came in at $8,454 million. Individually, revenues witnessed growth in two of the four segments of the company, with growth in Electrification Products and Robotics and Motion, more than offsetting flat Power Grids growth and contraction in Industrial Automation revenues. However, revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,593 million.Revenue in SegmentsElectrification Products (up 2% year over year in comparable terms to $2,509 million): Orders were down 1% year over year to $2,512 million, as positive orders in Europe were more than offset by a decline in the Americas and AMEA.Robotics and Motion (up 5% to $2,087 million): Sales grew steadily on strong demand trends in robotics and the light industry. Orders of this segment moved up 14% year over year to $2,219 million on a year-over-year basis, driven by continued strong demand patterns in robotics and light industry.Industrial Automation (down 7% to $1,608 million): Revenues remained on a downtrend in this segment, particularly due to declines in discretionary spending in oil & gas, and related sectors. Orders reversed the recent negative trend, rising 8% year over year to $1,499 million, owing to selective capital expenditure investments in oil & gas and in mining. Lower capital spending in process industries and constrained discretionary spending in process industries continue to harm this segment.Power Grids (flat at $2,647 million): Steady execution of a healthy order backlog and solid project execution kept revenues steady. However, orders declined 6% to $2,484 million mainly due to the timing of large contract awards.Total orders were flat year over year at $8,349 million and increased 3% on a comparable basis, as the noteworthy increase in Robotics and Motion and Industrial Automation more than offset the decline in Electrification Products and Power Grids. A stronger U.S. dollar resulted in a negative currency translation impact of 3%. Base orders grew 3% on a year-over-year basis, while large orders grew 5%. The order backlog at quarter end amounted to $23.6 billion (down 1% year over year).On a geographic basis, demand was positive in the European countries, with moderate overall growth and good timing of large capital investments. Orders displayed sound growth in the Americas as well, driven by increased demand for automation and energy efficient solutions. The U.S. grew 7% in total orders, offsetting decline in Canada. The Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) witnessed mixed performance, with substantial order growth in India, Saudi Arabia and South Africa, which were offset by order declines in China.Book-to-bill ratio at the end of the second quarter was 0.99, up from 0.96 in the comparable quarter a year ago.Operational earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (“Operational EBITA”) in the quarter under review fell 5% year over year in comparable terms to $1,042 million. The figure was hurt by commodity price increases and overcapacity in some businesses.Next Level Strategy: Stage 3In third-quarter 2016, ABB had launched the third stage of the revamped version of its “Next Level Strategy” which focuses on three areas, namely profitable growth, relentless execution and business-led collaboration. This stage calls for restructuring the company’s divisions into four market-leading entrepreneurial businesses, unlocking its full digital potential, increasing momentum in operational excellence and enhancing the company’s brand.ABB restructured its business into four segments: Electrification Products, Robotics and Motion, Industrial Automation and Power Grids, effective from Jan 1, 2017. This restructuring will help in increasing its focus on higher growth segments, strengthening its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio. Further, in order to unlock its digital capabilities, ABB had announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report), to shore up its capabilities in the industrial internet market, by combining cloud technology with industrial digital technology. Together, the companies will develop next-generation digital solutions on an integrated open cloud platform.During the reported quarter, ABB continued the implementation of this strategy by shifting its core operations to higher growth segments, boosting its competitiveness and de-risking the portfolio.Moreover, ABB is optimistic about the White-Collar Productivity savings program, which has surpassed expectations since its launch. The company is on track to achieve the cost-reduction target under the program of $1.3 billion within the decided timeframe. Also, ABB now expects to incur about $200 million lower combined restructuring program and implementation costs than initially expected. The company is currently implementing its regular cost-savings programs to achieve savings equivalent to 3–5% of cost of sales each year.ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise ABB Ltd Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | ABB Ltd QuoteLiquidity & Cash FlowsABB’s cash and cash equivalents as of Jun 30, 2017 were $5,018 million compared with $3,644 million as of Dec 31, 2016. Total long-term debt rose to $6,909 million at the quarter end from $5,800 million as of Dec 31, 2016.ABB’s cash flow from operating activities came in at just $467 million for the second quarter compared with $1,082 million in second-quarter 2016. The decline reflected the delay of short-term incentive payments, timing of tax payments and delays in payment from the Middle Eastern customers.Divestitures and PartnershipsDuring third-quarter 2016, ABB decided to sell its global high-voltage cable system business to NKT Cables in a deal worth $934 million. ABB and NKT Cables also signed an agreement for a long-term strategic partnership, under which they will work together on future projects, in areas like sub-sea interconnections and direct current transmission links.ABB considered the offloaded unit as a niche business, which had been improving in recent times. However, the company is facing what will likely be the end to Europe's offshore wind-power boom years, as the industry grapples with shrinking investments and uncertainty over future subsidies. At the heart of it, the cables deal is part of ABB’s active portfolio management and will make the core power grids business simpler, stronger, and more focused.Alongside, ABB also announced two important partnerships. The company signed a partnership deal with engineering and construction firm, Fluor Corporation (FLR  -  Free Report). Through the strategic partnership, ABB and Fluor will execute large turnkey engineering, procurement, construction (“EPC”) electrical substation projects. Further, ABB formed an agreement to partner with Aibel to deliver offshore wind integration solutions.Per ABB, the two new alliances, in addition to greater focus on higher-margin consultancy services and software, will help elevate the Power Grids unit’s margin target to 10–14% (up from a previous target of 8–12%).On Jul 6, ABB closed its acquisition of B&R — an independent provider dealing in product- and software-based, open-architecture solutions for machine and factory automation globally. This buyout will bridge the gap in machine and factory automation which ABB has been facing, and will create an exclusive, comprehensive automation portfolio for clients across the world. ABB expects this acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first year.Further, on Jul 3, ABB announced that it has agreed to acquire data transmission business of the KEYMILE Group. This buyout will enable the company to expand its communication networks business footprint in the industrial, transportation and infrastructure domains. It will add reliable communications technology offerings to ABB’s diverse portfolio, helping it fortify its foothold in digital electrical grids.These buyouts will help accelerate ABB’s operational momentum.Share RepurchaseAt the end of third-quarter 2016, ABB declared the completion of the $4-billion share buyback program introduced in Sep 2014. Under the program, the company repurchased approximately 171.3 million shares for about $3.5 billion. Consequently, ABB had announced a new share buyback program of up to $3 billion from 2017 through 2019, highlighting consistent strength in cash generation and financial position. The company also cancelled 46.6 million shares this month, which will be reflected in the third quarter.To ConcludeABB is facing a mixed macroeconomic and geopolitical climate, as the U.S. and China remain buoyant amid modest global growth and heightened uncertainties. Lower capital spending for the company’s key upstream energy end-markets and foreign exchange volatility will likely continue to hurt its financials. The company is vulnerable to increased uncertainty, stemming from the Brexit decision, as well as geopolitical tensions elsewhere in the world, which are overshadowing global markets.Despite the negatives, we believe that the company’s long-term prospects are stable. The company’s three major customers in utilities, industry, and transport & infrastructure are likely to drive growth. Apart from this, positive development in electricity value chain, rapid progress of Internet of things, services and people and a surge in energy-efficient transport and infrastructure bode well.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderABB currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked company in the same space as ABB is Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

1839,ETN,"Dividends have been in the news recently with Apple deciding to finally use some of its cash to reward shareholders with a dividend. 
"
1840,ETN,"But some companies have to be asking: ""what took you so long, Apple?""
"
1841,ETN,"There are a select group of S&P 500 companies that have been paying dividends consistently for decades. For some, it has been even longer. Some companies have been paying a dividend for over 100 years.

The Dividend Superstar
"
1844,ETN,"Some companies have NEVER stopped paying them. No matter what happens.
"
1845,ETN,"Others have also not only paid them consistently, but have also raised those dividends year after year, for decades.
"
1846,ETN,"These companies are the ""Dividend Superstars.""
"
1847,ETN,"While the only guarantees in life may be death and taxes, the dividend on these companies comes pretty close.
"
1848,ETN,"But what if you could invest in a Dividend Superstar which also is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy)? That is a powerful combination for those looking for income and growth.3 Dividend Superstars Which Are Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) Stocks

1860,ETN,"One the world's top investment banks today lowered their forecasts for global GDP by 30 basis points and 70 basis points for this year and next, respectively. Here are Morgan Stanleys revisions to prior projections:
"
1861,ETN,"2011: Global GDP forecast of 3.9%, down from 4.2%2012: Global GDP forecast of 3.8%, down from 4.5%
"
1862,ETN,"This is exactly what I have been saying to expect since July 29 when we got final -- and abysmal -- GDP revisions for the US economy for the previous three quarters. When the first half clocked in at a dismal 0.8% growth, I said stocks would go lower as large investors priced in a probable recession even before they could prove it was coming.
"
1863,ETN,"What proof were they looking for? Visibility on corporate earnings and domestic demand, which is essentially GDP since 45% of the S&P 500 earnings are from abroad and a large part of this is not part of the domestic math.
"
1864,ETN,"Proof was needed because of these new concerns:
"
1865,ETN,"China trying to cool its red-hot pace of growth
"
1866,ETN,"Europe on the verge a systemic banking crisis
"
1867,ETN,"Weak manufacturing and consumer data in the US
"
1868,ETN,"Philly Fed Drops a Bomb
"
1869,ETN,"And the other dose of data we got Thursday that can be put in the ""confirms a coming recession"" camp was the Philly Fed Survey. How serious is it that this one came in at -30.7 when the market was looking for something closer to zero?
"
1870,ETN,"The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Survey of business conditions tracks sentiment and trends among industrial manufacturers in that district, including data for orders, shipments, employment, and prices. Its correlation to the national industrial production data is strong and it is considered a relatively solid leading indicator for the rest of the country.
"
1871,ETN,"There was concern in June when the Philly Fed dropped below the zero line to a minus 7.7 reading. July saw it peek its head back above zero, so it looked like we could have a repeat of last August to October in this data, where a sub-zero mark was quickly erased by a surge above 40.
"
1872,ETN,"But given the other ""slowdown is here"" data and the tone of the Federal Reserve after both its June and August FOMC meetings, manufacturers may have begun pricing in the recession just as quickly.
"
1873,ETN,"The significance of the -30 reading is that it brings us right back to where we were during the 2008-09 recession when industrial production measures were hitting anywhere from -2% to -4%. That's scary territory for stocks.
"
1874,ETN,"Are the Philly Fed district manufacturers right? Is the slowdown more severe than most investors had imagined? We shall have to wait for more data to know for sure. Meanwhile, the stock market ecology remains unstable...
"
1875,ETN,"Sell First, Investigate Later
"
1876,ETN,"The month of August so far has been a classic example of ""shoot first and ask questions later."" In this case, good stocks are being shot while the recession gets discounted.
"
1877,ETN,"Morgan Stanley will not be the last investment or research house to downgrade growth. We still await the Fed to revise its GDP projections as I wrote about in these two articles...
"
1878,ETN,"QE3 and the Probability of Recession, August 10Bernanke: I See Unemployed People, August 9
"
1879,ETN,"Where it will get really interesting is when we get specific calls on US GDP. Surely, many strategists are at work formulating their revisions based on an overall analysis of the global economy since Emerging Markets are such a driver of US economic growth.
"
1880,ETN,"Does Philly Fed in Recession Territory Make it a Done Deal?
"
1881,ETN,"Thursday's market meltdown is driven as much by the fears in Europe and Morgan Stanley's downcast view as by the depressing Philadelphia Fed survey.
"
1882,ETN,"This puts Federal Reserve leaders in new light, especially with three dissenters on the last FOMC vote and dovish Dudley out there already this week explaining the necessity of continued extraordinary monetary accommodation.
"
1883,ETN,"Even though I said on Bloomberg TV Thursday that I had moved my recession probability from 40% to 50% based on Philly Fed, I still wait for more confirming data. I hope this doesn't become a self-fulfilling recession as I wrote about last week.
"
1884,ETN,"And I trust that monetary accommodation can beat the threat of deflation. In the meantime, I won't be afraid to take positions in my favorite stocks on these fear-driven sell-off days.
"
1885,ETN,"Plus, in addition to my thesis from Wednesday that there is extreme fundamental value in the S&P 500 around 1,100, I saw two barometers of risk appetite holding up well on Thursday: copper and the euro.
"
1886,ETN,"If the recession were a done deal, copper would be selling off more dramatically. It continues to stay close to $4. I still like my current long holding in Southern Copper (SCCO  -  Free Report) here, especially near its 52-week lows and kicking out an 8% dividend yield.
"
1887,ETN,"And if Europe's banking system were going to implode, the euro would not be holding on above $1.43 so well. The crude oil market, conversely, is definitely taking it on the chin, so I have reasons to worry about my energy stocks like Suncor (SU  -  Free Report) and National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report), as well as my industrial names like Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) and Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report).
"
1888,ETN,"But I also don't think Philly Fed spells a certain recession. And I look forward to seeing what opportunities the next few weeks bring.
"
1889,ETN,"To see why I think the market is getting very close to a screaming buy again, just like the correction of 2010, see ""S&P 1,100: Extreme Value Area?""Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist for Zacks.com

1890,ETN,"In the spring of 2010, I appeared on CNBC and Bloomberg TV and spoke about the revelations for markets concerning French bank exposure to the Greek debt crisis. I was one of the first to say that Europe's sovereign debt worries were then growing from a mere government problem to a systemic banking crisis very similar to the US one.
"
1891,ETN,"At the time, it was considered a fairly big deal that France's top three commercial banks owned such a large majority of Greece's public debt totaling over $80 billion. This month, as the fortunes of Italy and Spain tremble, we have learned French banks own debt of theirs totaling hundreds of billions.
"
1892,ETN,"This is why, of course, European officials stepped into markets Thursday with a ban on short-selling of banks and other financial institutions. Will it stem the tide of losses and erosion of capital ratios?
"
1893,ETN,"Probably not any better than it worked here in 2008. But the more interesting questions Ive been pondering are, ""If it was so bad, why weren't these banks in free-fall months ago and why is the euro currency still holding up so well above $1.40?""
"
1894,ETN,"Will the Euro Survive?
"
1895,ETN,"I wrote a piece reviewing some of these questions in June (linked above). Based on how well Europe's banking system had weathered the mud of its PIIGS for 18 months up to that point, I thought their crisis would have little effect on our economy.
"
1896,ETN,"And maybe that's what lots of other big investors and strategists thought too. Here's what I wrote in June...
"
1897,ETN,"""And you have to consider that from crisis, often comes a new equilibrium. When you accept that Europe has its own unique problems, just like the US and its burgeoning municipal debt crisis, it's hard to say how things will resolve.
"
1898,ETN,"Who predicted the near collapse of the US financial system? And who predicted its amazing recovery from the abyss? Not many.
"
1899,ETN,"As Moody's Investor Service warned last week, three of France's top banks could be in for a credit downgrade as they continue to use cheap US dollar funding to roll their large exposure to Greek debt.

"
1903,ETN,"Here's a summary of their declines before the short-sale ban (priced in euros) since July 1, when two of the three were close to their 52-week highs and the third, Soc Gen, was still within 20%.

"
1909,ETN,"""EU policy makers dont seem to understand the law of unintended consequences. The vast majority of short-selling financial shares is by other financial institutions, hedging their counterparty risks, not speculators. The interbank lending market froze up completely in October to December 2008 -- after the short-selling bans."" 
"
1910,ETN,"This is exactly what we learned back then. I was working for a large options market maker in Chicago and the ""unintended consequences"" were numerous and obvious to us, especially as market makers were at first not exempt from the ban, eliminating their ability to hedge and provide liquidity to markets in both options and stocks.
"
1911,ETN,"The Europeans got the market maker part right this time, but volatility may still rise because hedge funds who normally try to strike some balance between long and short positions will be leaving the market, the Bloomberg story goes on to explain.

1912,ETN,"A Moby Dick of Fears, Besides GDP
"
1913,ETN,"So, while I have been writing for two weeks about this sell-off being mostly a function of lowered growth expectations since the awful GDP revisions of July 29, I should consider that the banking crisis finally unfolding in Europe has been a big catalyst too.
"
1914,ETN,"Like a sea monster you can""t see under the surface, the vaguely familiar unknowns trouble institutional investors who remember 2008, even if our economy and banking system are much more sound.
"
1915,ETN,"We grew accustomed to Europe's debt crisis, as if it were unfolding in slow motion. Just another part of the daily headlines, it didn't bother us as much. And as with all crises of confidence, especially those involving banking, they don't really matter until they do and things implode. In other words, until the creature bumps into your boat and makes its presence very real and known.
"
1916,ETN,"The Big Question Now for the US Economy
"
1917,ETN,"If Europe's crisis does devolve into a wholesale systemic crisis that freezes their markets and economies, what impact will that have on a US economy at stall speed?
"
1918,ETN,"Everyone talks about the impact of fear on the American consumer, as if we can collectively talk ourselves into a recession with negative headlines that weaken and dispel confidence -- and spending. But I think the American consumer has proven amazingly resilient since our crisis. His and her expectations about jobs and credit and growth are much more reasonable and realistic, if subdued. That's good right now.
"
1919,ETN,"I am more worried about the impact of fear on these two groups of spenders: institutional investors, primarily equity portfolio managers, and CEOs and their purchasing managers. If these people are uncertain about the future and lack confidence in growth prospects, this will become a self-fulfilling feedback loop that can cause recession.
"
1920,ETN,"Earlier this week, I wrote  ""QE3 and the Probability of Recession"" in which I shared a chart of the Federal Reserve's last growth forecast from June. And while I look forward to their update since they got it wrong -- and got the bad news to prove it on July 29 -- I am even more eager to see and hear the projections and concerns of money managers and heads of industry.
"
1921,ETN,"Since the S&P derives 45% of its earnings from abroad, and Europe's contribution is easily one-third of that, a fallen EU is a big blow to the US economy. Viewing the current 15% correction in equities (I'm using the drop in the S&P 500 from roughly 1,350 to 1,150 to get 15%) as an extremely quick discounting of the increased ""probability of recession,"" I still expect the market to trade sideways for the next few weeks until we get more information.
"
1922,ETN,"Pricing in Blah
"
1923,ETN,"Here are some numbers to keep in mind until we start to get lower growth forecasts and downward earnings estimate revisions after Labor Day:
"
1924,ETN,"Estimates as of August 1 were for the S&P 500 to earn about $98 per share in 2011. Let's say that realistically the best we could expect now is $95 EPS. At an index level of 1,200, that's a ""working"" P/E of 12.6.
"
1925,ETN,"If you bump EPS down to $85, at 1,200 the S&P still looks cheap at 14 times. The catch is that if earnings and GDP are still declining, then money managers and CEOs will continue to price in lower expectations. Right now we wait for more data.
"
1926,ETN,"In ""How Long Will the Correction Last?"" from August 5, I wrote the following about where we stand...
"
1927,ETN,"""I think the highest-probability scenario is a 'wait and see' by institutional investors. That means to me that the S&P will range trade between 1150 and 1250 for the next 2-3 months, in waves of pessimism and optimism, until more visibility on GDP, jobs, cap ex, manufacturing, and corporate earnings rolls in. 
"
1928,ETN,"What are the chances that this advance 'pricing-in of the recession' heats up and we dip below S&P 1,100? I'll say about 40%, right around where I think the probability is for an actual recession.
"
1929,ETN,"Use my probabilities as a rough guide and trade your own view accordingly. Many strategists from major investment houses, managing trillions of dollars in aggregate, have similar projections. 
"
1930,ETN,"The hard part is that on big sell-off days, they look like they are more scared than they really are.""
"
1931,ETN,"Investing Without Certainty
"
1932,ETN,"During this tumultuous two weeks, I've done many interviews with financial media, both TV and print. When asked by AARP what I thought senior investors should be doing with their money, I became very cautious, thinking of my own parents and their retirement concerns.
"
1933,ETN,"But then I just stepped back and framed the question as any investor should by moving away from emotion and just thinking rationally about time horizon. Here's what I said on Monday...
"
1934,ETN,"""If one has ten years left in the market, it's a no-brainer to be putting money to work in stocks. There are lots of buying opportunities to take advantage of right now in stocks like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report), and National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report).
"
1935,ETN,"If you have five years left for your money to work for you, there are still stocks and sectors like energy, technology, and materials that one should be accumulating at these levels. But for those who need their money in the next two years, it's a good time to just sit back and see how this unfolds into October earnings season.
"

1973,ETN,"If you bump EPS down to $85, at 1,200 the S&P still looks cheap at 14 times. The catch is that if earnings and GDP are still declining, then money managers and CEOs will continue to price in lower expectations. Right now we wait for more data.
"
1974,ETN,"In ""How Long Will the Correction Last?"" from August 5, I wrote the following about where we stand...
"
1975,ETN,"""I think the highest-probability scenario is a 'wait and see' by institutional investors. That means to me that the S&P will range trade between 1150 and 1250 for the next 2-3 months, in waves of pessimism and optimism, until more visibility on GDP, jobs, cap ex, manufacturing, and corporate earnings rolls in. 
"
1976,ETN,"What are the chances that this advance 'pricing-in of the recession' heats up and we dip below S&P 1,100? I'll say about 40%, right around where I think the probability is for an actual recession.
"
1977,ETN,"Use my probabilities as a rough guide and trade your own view accordingly. Many strategists from major investment houses, managing trillions of dollars in aggregate, have similar projections. 
"
1978,ETN,"The hard part is that on big sell-off days, they look like they are more scared than they really are.""
"
1979,ETN,"Investing Without Certainty
"
1980,ETN,"During this tumultuous two weeks, I've done many interviews with financial media, both TV and print. When asked by AARP what I thought senior investors should be doing with their money, I became very cautious, thinking of my own parents and their retirement concerns.
"
1981,ETN,"But then I just stepped back and framed the question as any investor should by moving away from emotion and just thinking rationally about time horizon. Here's what I said on Monday...
"
1982,ETN,"""If one has ten years left in the market, it's a no-brainer to be putting money to work in stocks. There are lots of buying opportunities to take advantage of right now in stocks like Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report), and National Oilwell Varco (NOV  -  Free Report).
"
1983,ETN,"If you have five years left for your money to work for you, there are still stocks and sectors like energy, technology, and materials that one should be accumulating at these levels. But for those who need their money in the next two years, it's a good time to just sit back and see how this unfolds into October earnings season.
"
1984,ETN,"Given a 40% chance we slip into recession, institutional investors -- who move the market in aggregate with the trillions of dollars they manage -- will be waiting for more bloodwork on the economy and earnings before they return to the business of investing.""

"
1986,ETN,"Friday's dismal GDP data -- particularly the downward revisions to prior quarters -- has even the most bullish of market strategists (myself included) starting to wonder about the increased probability of a double-dip into recession territory.
"
1987,ETN,"Normally, to check my biases, I try to ask myself tough questions that assume I could be wrong about the continued strength of the recovery. Last month, I laid out very simple and clear arguments for said continuation in ""The Seven C's of Recovery Optimism.""
"
1988,ETN,"Then, just when I needed it most, a very pointed question came across my radar this morning that is a good counterpoint to my optimism and that must be addressed. Writing on SeekingAlpha Sunday, G.C. Mays proposed that ""The Relationship Between Corporate Profits and U.S. GDP Growth Appears to Have Ended.""The Global Economy's Changing Dynamics
"
1989,ETN,"Mays draws on the last ten years of data to paint the picture of a divergence he calls ""astonishing."" Here is his summary of that picture:
"
1990,ETN,"""Between the first Quarter of 2001 and 2006, a simple correlation showed that corporate profits explained 98.4 percent of domestic GDP growth. However, the most recent five years beginning with the first quarter of 2006 the correlation between corporate profits and domestic GDP growth breaks down as corporate profits only explain 10.1 percent of domestic GDP growth."" 
"
1991,ETN,"Mays seems to understand well the not-so-mysterious force behind this evolving disconnect. He explains that with over 45% of S&P 500 company sales coming from outside the US, lots of corporate profits are not entering into the GDP calculation.
"
1992,ETN,"""This is due primarily to the growing middle class in emerging and developing markets,"" he says. Exactly what I have been preaching as blessing for the past two years.
"
1993,ETN,"One Man's Bearish Data Is Another Man's...
"
1994,ETN,"So while I was at first alarmed by his thesis -- and thinking there was some terrible structural problem with our economy, similar to the credit bubble of the last decade -- I was relieved to find that what Mays finds to be a problem, I welcome as an unstoppable reality of the global economy that, while not perfect, is fueling growth and opportunity for billions of people.
"
1995,ETN,"What's wrong with Emerging Markets fueling growth? According to Mays it's that American companies are essentially creating jobs and demand in these economies via a cheaper labor source. And he believes this is ultimately bad for the US economy and its work force.
"
1996,ETN,"I'm not smart enough to know whether or not he's right about that. I just accept the reality that if manufacturers like Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report), Deere (DE  -  Free Report), and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) can find opportunity in countries that want to grow their cities and economies -- and that have billions of people clamoring for the fruits and lifestyles of the developed world -- then who am I to say it's not right?
"
1997,ETN,"Progress is certainly still profitable and if we can make money following a historic mega-trend that benefits billions of people searching for a better life, I'm all about that. The opportunities will only grow for the rest of this decade as the world's population surges to 9 billion by 2050.

2003,ETN,"Key Points:
"
2004,ETN,"•    Earnings Surprise Ratio (#beat/#miss) at 5.47, almost double normal
"
2005,ETN,"•    Median Earnings Surprise  7.11%, very strong
"
2006,ETN,"•    Year over year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Pos Growth/# Neg Growth) at 0.77
"
2007,ETN,"•    Sales Surprise Ratio at 1.37
"
2008,ETN,"•    Sales Growth Ratio at just 0.40
"
2009,ETN,"•    Total Net Income for S&P 500 reported so far is 11.6% below what those same 444 firms reported a year ago, 11.8% above what they earned in the 2Q09 
"
2010,ETN,"•    Total S&P 500 Revenues reported so far down 13.4% year over year, up 2.0% from 2Q09
"
2011,ETN,"•    2009 Earnings Revisions ratio for full S&P 500 up to 3.05, up from 2.48 last week
"
2012,ETN,"•    2010 ratio at 2.14, down slightly from 2.17 last week
"
2013,ETN,"•    S&P500 expected to earn $570.6 billion in 2008, $706.8 billion in 2010
"
2014,ETN,"•    Bottom Up estimates:  $61.62 for 2009, $76.70 for 2010
"
2015,ETN,"•    Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
2016,ETN,"It’s almost time to close the books on a fantastic earnings season. With almost 90% of reports in, there have been 339 that have exceeded expectations while only 62 have fallen short -- a ratio of 5.47. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
2017,ETN,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed their earnings estimates. The median surprise is a very high 7.11%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal. Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season.
"
2018,ETN,"For most companies, their earnings are still below year ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 193 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth, versus 251 that have fallen short of year-ago levels -- a ratio of 0.77.
"
2019,ETN,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 9.25. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.49. A similar situation, but not quite as extreme, is true for Materials. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
2020,ETN,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far (relative to expectations), but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly  The total revenues of the 444 firms that have already reported are 13.4% below year-ago levels. A total of 241 firms have reported higher-than-expected revenues, versus 176 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.37. On the other hand, only 127 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 314 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.40. Put another way, only 28.6% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
2021,ETN,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings and earnings surprises. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the government's macro statistics. The economy is growing due to increases in productivity. Higher GDP with fewer workers.
"
2022,ETN,"However, the strategy seems to be working, as earnings are coming in much better than expected and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with five sectors seeing more than five increases for each cut. No sector is seeing more cuts than increases.
"
2023,ETN,"For the S&P 500 as a whole, the revisions ratio now stands at 3.26, its highest level in over a year and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point. The better-than-expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.15 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
2032,ETN,"•    Massive positive surprises in cyclical Construction, Industrial and Discretionary sectors
"
2033,ETN,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind; for some sectors, the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
2034,ETN,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseIncome SurprisesYr/Yr

2096,ETN,"Analysts are responding to better-than-expected 3Q earnings by raising 2009 estimates almost across the board.

Total revisions activity has picked up dramatically, and will continue to do so over the next week or two, but we are getting towards peak activity.
"
2097,ETN,"The broad increases in earnings estimates seems to reflect a much better short-term outlook for the economy. Note that some of the most cyclical areas such as Retailers, Materials and Autos are seeing a large preponderance of upward over downward earnings revisions, and that most of the firms in those sectors are seeing their consensus estimates increase.

2141,ETN,"Friday's dismal GDP data -- particularly the downward revisions to prior quarters -- has even the most bullish of market strategists (myself included) starting to wonder about the increased probability of a double-dip into recession territory.  
"
2142,ETN,"Normally, to check my biases, I try to ask myself tough questions that assume I could be wrong about the continued strength of the recovery. Last month, I laid out very simple and clear arguments for said continuation in ""The Seven C's of Recovery Optimism.""
"
2143,ETN,"Then, just when I needed it most, a very pointed question came across my radar this morning that is a good counterpoint to my optimism and that must be addressed. Writing on SeekingAlpha Sunday, G.C. Mays proposed that ""The Relationship Between Corporate Profits and U.S. GDP Growth Appears to Have Ended.""The Global Economy's Changing Dynamics 
"
2144,ETN,"Mays draws on the last ten years of data to paint the picture of a divergence he calls ""astonishing."" Here is his summary of that picture:  
"
2145,ETN,"""Between the first Quarter of 2001 and 2006, a simple correlation showed that corporate profits explained 98.4 percent of domestic GDP growth. However, the most recent five years beginning with the first quarter of 2006 the correlation between corporate profits and domestic GDP growth breaks down as corporate profits only explain 10.1 percent of domestic GDP growth."" 
"
2146,ETN,"Mays seems to understand well the not-so-mysterious force behind this evolving disconnect. He explains that with over 45% of S&P 500 company sales coming from outside the US, lots of corporate profits are not entering into the GDP calculation.  
"
2147,ETN,"""This is due primarily to the growing middle class in emerging and developing markets,"" he says. Exactly what I have been preaching as blessing for the past two years. One Man's Bearish Data Is Another Man's...
"
2148,ETN,"So while I was at first alarmed by his thesis -- and thinking there was some terrible structural problem with our economy, similar to the credit bubble of the last decade -- I was relieved to find that what Mays finds to be a problem, I welcome as an unstoppable reality of the global economy that, while not perfect, is fueling growth and opportunity for billions of people.  
"
2149,ETN,"What's wrong with Emerging Markets fueling growth? According to Mays it's that American companies are essentially creating jobs and demand in these economies via a cheaper labor source. And he believes this is ultimately bad for the US economy and its work force.  
"
2150,ETN,"I'm not smart enough to know whether or not he's right about that. I just accept the reality that if manufacturers like Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report), Deer (DE  -  Free Report), and Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report) can find opportunity in countries that want to grow their cities and economies -- and that have billions of people clamoring for the fruits and lifestyles of the developed world -- then who am I to say it's not right?  
"
2151,ETN,"Progress is certainly still profitable and if we can make money following a historic mega-trend that benefits billions of people searching for a better life, I'm all about that. The opportunities will only grow for the rest of this decade as the world's population surges to 9 billion by 2050. Disclosure: I am short puts on Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report).

2153,ETN,"Allegion plc (ALLE  -  Free Report) recently completed two acquisitions through its subsidiaries, including Door and Access Systems business of GWA Group Limited, and ISONAS Security Systems Inc. While the Door and Access Systems buyout is worth AUD 107 million — funded through cash in hands and funds available through revolving credit facility, the financial terms of the ISONAS buyout was not disclosed by the company.The deal to acquire GWA Group’s Door and Access Systems business was originally announced in May 2018 while that of ISONAS was communicated in June. Detail of BuyoutsThe buyout of the Door and Access Systems business of GWA Group has added two leading Australian brands — API Locksmiths and Gainsborough — to Allegion’s product portfolio. API Locksmiths branded products are used in commercial markets while Gainsborough products are meant for use in the residential market.This buyout will strengthen Allegion’s foothold in Australia, thereby expanding the company’s presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Also, it will boost the company’s revenue generation capabilities, evident from AUD 95-million sales recorded in 2017.In 2018, Allegion anticipates slight accretion to adjusted earnings per share from the acquired Door and Access Systems business.Additionally, Allegion has completed acquiring ISONAS. The edge-computing technology provided by ISONAS serves non-residential end markets by providing access control solutions. The Boulder, CO-based firm has a wide customer base, and a strong network of certified committed distributors and integrators. In 2017, ISONAS generated $6 million revenues.The ISONAS buyout will reinforce Allegion’s existing technology portfolio and go together with its channel initiatives. The acquired assets will operate as one of Allegion’s Americas businesses.Snapshot of Allegion’s Inorganic InitiativesWe believe that the above-mentioned transaction is consistent with Allegion’s policy of acquiring businesses to gain access to new customers, regions and product lines.Prior to the above-mentioned buyouts, in March 2018, Allegion acquired the manufacturer of high-performance interior and healthcare door systems — Aurora Systems, Inc. (AD Systems). In February 2018, the company purchased Qatar Metal Industries — Middle East-based manufacturer of commercial steel, and wooden doors and frames. In January, the company acquired Technical Glass Products or TGP — North America-based manufacturer of the advanced fire-rated entrance and wall systems — as well as added Hammond Enterprises to its portfolio.It’s worth mentioning here that acquisitions/divestitures had a positive impact of 4.7% on sales growth in first-quarter 2018. On a geographical basis, acquired assets or divestitures lifted sales in the Americas and EMEIA region by 4.7% and 5.6%, respectively.Zacks Rank & Key PicksDespite efforts on improving its business portfolio via acquisitions; labor shortage and ongoing constraint across the construction supply chain are adversely influencing Allegion’s results. With a market capitalization of nearly $7.4 billion, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).In the past three months, Allegion’s shares have declined 9.4%, worse than 1.3% fall of the industry.Also, the company’s Zacks Consensus Estimate remained stable at $4.48 for 2018 while declined 0.2% to $4.95 for 2019 from the 60-day-ago tally.Allegion PLC Price and Consensus  Allegion PLC Price and Consensus | Allegion PLC QuoteSome better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Industrial Products sector are Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report), ForeScout Technologies, Inc. (FSCT  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation plc (ETN  -  Free Report). While Regal Beloit sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), both ForeScout Technologies and Eaton carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the past 60 days, the bottom-line estimates for these stocks have improved for the current year.

2154,ETN,"Investors looking for stocks in the Manufacturing - Electronics sector might want to consider either Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) or A.O. Smith (AOS  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Both Eaton and A.O. Smith have a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that both of these stocks have an improving earnings outlook since the Zacks Rank favors companies that have witnessed positive analyst estimate revisions. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.ETN currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.36, while AOS has a forward P/E of 22.75. We also note that ETN has a PEG ratio of 1.45. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. AOS currently has a PEG ratio of 1.88.Another notable valuation metric for ETN is its P/B ratio of 1.89. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, AOS has a P/B of 6.59.These metrics, and several others, help ETN earn a Value grade of B, while AOS has been given a Value grade of C.Both ETN and AOS are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that ETN is the superior value option right now.

2156,ETN,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings of 76 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71 cents by 7%.Favorable global market conditions and strong top-line growth boosted the company’s bottom line, which was offset by high cost of sales and administrative expenses.Inside the HeadlinesThe company continued with its growth momentum in the fiscal second quarter as both the Automation Solutions and Commercial & Residential Solutions platforms delivered a rise in net sales. The metric grew 18.9% year over year to $4,248 million and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4,200 million.Emerson Electric Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Emerson Electric Co. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Co. QuoteWhile underlying sales growth for the quarter was 8%, acquisitions and divestitures contributed 8% to growth, and currency translation favorably impacted the top line by 3%. Persistent improving conditions in the energy related, chemical, life sciences and discrete markets drove sales.In the fiscal second quarter, the company’s Automation Solutions platform reported an impressive 30.9% year-over-year growth in net sales to $2,771 million. Underlying sales was up 10% driven by strong MRO demand as well as small and mid-sized projects focused on expansion and optimization of existing facilities.Underlying sales in North America recorded an increase of 16%, courtesy of energy related, chemical as well as life sciences markets. The metric was up 7% in Asia, while the same in China grew 20% on continued solid demand across process, hybrid as well as discrete markets. Also, underlying sales in Middle East/Africa were up an impressive 29%. However, the same in Europe and Latin America were down 1% and 10%, respectively.Margins expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year to 15.7%. Excluding the dilutive impact of the Valves & Controls acquisition, the same expanded 240 bps to 17.9% driven by leverage on higher sales and restructuring benefits.Net Sales in the Commercial & Residential Solutions increased 1.6% to $1,483 million. Underlying sales for the segment recorded an increase of 4%. The same metric in North America rose 1% on account of solid demand for professional tools, which was partially offset by lower-than-expected demand for air conditioning.Asia witnessed strong growth once again as the underlying sales rose 17% year over year backed by solid demand for refrigeration and air conditioning in China. Underlying sales in Europe was up 5%, courtesy of strong demand in air conditioning and construction related markets.Under the platform, the Climate Technologies business grew 6.6% year over year to $1,128 million, while the Tools & Home Products unit declined 11.7% from the year-ago quarter to $355 million.Margins contracted 10 bps to 23.6% compared with the prior-year quarter.Other DevelopmentsDuring the reported quarter, the company signed an agreement to acquire the Tools and Test Equipment business of Textron for approximately $810 million. Tools & Test, when combined with Emerson’s Ridge Tool Company, will enable Emerson to extend its markets and add major capabilities to meet needs of its customers.Moreover, the company completed the acquisition of ProSys, a global supplier of software and services that facilitates increased production and safety for chemical, pulp & paper, oil & gas as well as refining industries. ProSys’ unique technologies and proficiency are expected to enable Emerson to aid customers in improving plant performance, safety and profitability by optimizing human as well as automation resources.Also, the company completed the buyout of Cooper-Atkins, a leading technology company in foodservice markets. This buyout is anticipated to improve Emerson’s ability to cater to the needs of its cold chain customers, offering safe control of food as well as other temperature-sensitive products.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the second quarter, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion and long-term debt of about $3.4 billion.GuidanceIn light of the strong global demand trends, Emerson raised its outlook for fiscal 2018. It now expects net sales for the year to grow about 13%, with underlying sales to be up about 7%. These figures compare favorably with the prior projections of an increase of 11-13% and underlying sales increase of 5-7%.Our Take Over the past few quarters, Emerson’s growth momentum is being driven by favorable trends in energy-related, hybrid and general industrial markets as well as strong demand in the HVAC and refrigeration markets.Also, the company is well-positioned to benefit from global infrastructure growth. This is because its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending.However, of late, Emerson’s operations have suffered as a result of slow spending in general industrial markets. This, in turn, has affected the company’s order rates across the related segments.Emerson carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks in the same space include A. O.

This represents better growth projections from the previous quarter — courtesy of a corporate tax overhaul and relatively healthy job data.Given the ongoing healthy scenario, it is quite natural that most sectors should deliver an impressive performance. In fact, per the above report, 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors are projected to end the first quarter with double-digit earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. Only the Autos are expected to end the quarter with bottom line decline.One of these well-performing sectors is Industrial Products sector. According to the latest report, total first-quarter earnings of the sector participants are likely to increase 35.4% from the same period last year on 15.4% higher revenues.Currently, the sector seems to have regained its momentum after struggling with reduced investment in the energy sector, soft commodity prices as well as poor economic conditions in some developed and developing nations over the last few years. The rebound can be attributed to increased infrastructure spending as well as rise in manufacturing and mining activity.Given this backdrop, it will be interesting to wait and see how some of the Industrial stocks fare when the companies release their results on May 1.Emerson Electric Co.

"
2183,ETN,"The U.S. economy is continuing to recover, and one of the sectors which has been the real engine of that growth is business investment in equipment and software.  While such investment in the fourth quarter accounted for less than 7.6% of the overall economy, it accounted for 18.3% of the overall growth in the fourth quarter, and that was down from an astounding 62.2% in the third quarter and 33.8% of the growth in the second quarter.  
"
2184,ETN,"Today I am focusing on the equipment side of that, and more specifically investments in machinery.  The strong macro performance of the sector is showing in upward estimate revisions and positive earnings surprises, and those in turn at reflected in the Zacks Rank.Zacks Industry Classifications
"
2185,ETN,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 258 different industries tracked.  It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well; a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts.  
"
2186,ETN,"It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list.  The same holds true for the bottom of the list.  The definition of size that matters here is not the total sales or market capitalization but the number of companies in the “industry.”  4 Machinery Groups Working Well
"
2187,ETN,"There are four Machinery “industries” that are showing up very well on the Zacks Rank.  The strongest three of which are about median sized “industries,” with seven or eight firms in them.  The “weakest” of the four is by far the largest, General Industrial Machinery, with 37 firms in it.  It still shows up pretty well, coming in 44th place, a drop of five slots from last week.  Its average Zacks Rank is 2.57, up slightly from 2.54 last week.  
"
2188,ETN,"The strongest of the Groups is Machine Tools, with eight firms in it.  It is currently the fifth strongest “industry” with an average Zacks Rank of 1.88, down from 2.00 last week.  In Between we have the Construction and Mining Machinery “industry” in 19th place (up one from last week, and an average Zacks Rank of 2.38, unchanged from last week), and The Farm Machinery “industry,” a seven member group in 23rd place, slipping one spot from last week on an unchanged average of 2.43.
"
2189,ETN,"If the Zacks Ranks were distributed randomly, one would expect that only 5% of the members of the firms would earn the coveted Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy).  Instead, of the total of 13 firms in these four groups, 21.7%, have earned that distinction.  If it were random, only 15% would hold Zacks #2 Ranks (Buy) but actually 10 (16.7%) hold it.  Go Big or Go Small   
"
2190,ETN,"There is a huge range of market capitalizations from which to choose from on these lists, from very large down to micro cap.  While the growth rate from this year to next is not shown directly, you can get a sense of it from looking at the change in the P/E ratio from this year to next.  Most of these firms are looking at very respectable growth rates, at least in the short term.
"
2191,ETN,"Of course, Machinery is a quintessentially cyclical part of the market, so it is NOT a good idea to extrapolate those growth rates too far into the future.  It does, however, indicate that we are in the middle of a cyclical upswing. Valuations on these stocks -- particularly if you are willing to look out to FY2 (mostly 2013) earnings -- are quite reasonable.  While most of the smaller cap names do not pay dividends, some of the large and mid-cap cap names do provide a nice payout.Number 1 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est ""%Ch CurrFiscal Yr Est - 4 wks"" ""%Ch NextFiscal Yr Est - 4 wks"" ""CurrentPrice"" Div YieldCaterpillar Inc CAT $58,661  12.86 9.76 1.69% 3.36% $90.99  2.02%Lincoln Electrc LECO $2,639  12.95 10.94 12.37% 9.97% $31.28  1.98%Robbins & Myers RBN $1,987  18.6 14.36 0.00% 0.00% $43.48  0.41%Middleby Corp MIDD $1,434  16.58 13.95 0.00% 0.00% $76.50  0.00%Actuant Corp ATU $1,377  12.24 10.26 0.00% 0.00% $20.06  0.20%Barnes Grp B $1,191  15.37 12.61 5.29% 3.58% $21.87  1.46%Lindsay Corp LNN $692  18.55 17.45 0.00% 0.00% $55.08  0.62%Sun Hydraulics SNHY $647  17.2 14.7 0.08% 0.06% $25.25  1.43%H&E Equip Svcs HEES $355  N/A 12.32 -226.32% 0.00% $10.14  0.00%Dxp Enterprises DXPE $322  11.66 9.81 4.45% 4.10% $22.81  0.00%Hurco Cos Inc HURC $168  18.11 12.98 0.00% 0.00% $26.08  0.00%Flow Intl Corp FLOW $146  19.87 11.41 0.00% 0.00% $3.08  0.00%Manitex Int Inc MNTX $48  16.96 8.48 0.00% 0.00% $4.24  0.00%Number 2 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est ""%Ch CurrFiscal Yr Est - 4 wks"" ""%Ch NextFiscal Yr Est - 4 wks"" ""CurrentPrice"" Div YieldDeere & Co DE $30,496  11.34 9.68 0.33% 0.01% $72.66  2.26%Sandvik Ab SDVKY $16,062  11.88 9.47 -8.80% -8.33% $13.54  2.86%Eaton Corp ETN $14,450  10.51 8.88 2.60% 2.62% $42.35  3.21%Kubota Corp Adr KUB $10,827  15.37 14.14 0.00% 0.00% $42.57  1.74%Metso Corp -Adr MXCYY $5,765  13.64 10.66 -5.20% -4.74% $38.53  4.86%Idex Corp IEX $3,128  15.33 13.17 1.69% 2.14% $37.74  1.80%Nordson Corp NDSN $2,944  12.65 11.61 0.13% 0.13% $43.13  0.97%Terex Corp TEX $2,016  35.81 8.55 -29.53% -8.27% $18.39  0.00%Astec Inds Inc ASTE $730  16.19 12.77 13.95% 8.92% $32.22  0.00%Graham Corp GHM $178  17.07 13.16 4.64% 1.99% $17.98  0.44%

2192,ETN,"The deluge of this morning’s favorable economic and earnings reports should help stocks sustain Wednesday’s Fed-inspired gains. We got positive weekly Initial Jobless Claims numbers and a better-than-expected Durable Goods Orders reading. On the earnings front, Caterpillar’s (CAT  -  Free Report) blowout results will likely ease some of the lingering concerns about weakness in China and other emerging markets.
"
2193,ETN,"Of this morning’s economic releases, the most important number was the roughly in-line Jobless Claims reading, showing a gain of 21K to 377K. Please recall that we saw an unusually big drop last week, likely resulting from complications in seasonally adjusting the data at this time of the year. Today’s reading goes some way towards correcting that. The four-week average, which smooths out the week-to-week fluctuation, dropped by 2.5K to 377.5K, maintaining its downtrend of recent weeks.
"
2194,ETN,"In other economic releases, the December Durable Goods Orders report came in better than expected, highlighting that corporate capital expenditures will remain a growth driver for the economy despite the expiration of accelerated depreciation expense. Headline Durable Goods Orders increased 3% in December, above the 2% consensus expectation, while the November headline gain of 3.9% was revised upwards to 4.3%.
"
2195,ETN,"The ‘core’ Durable Goods Orders reading -- which strips out defense and aircraft orders given their inherent ‘lumpiness’ on a month-to-month basis -- also came in better than expected at a gain of 2.1%. This compares to the weak ‘core’ reading in November of a 1.2% drop.
"
2196,ETN,"On the earnings front, Caterpillar beat big, blowing past expectations and coming out with Apple-like numbers. Driving Caterpillar’s record quarterly results was continued resilient demand for the company’s products in international markets, which should help ease some of the concerns about slowing demand in key emerging markets.
"
2197,ETN,"Importantly, the company guided higher, both for revenue as well earnings, which should help cause positive estimate revisions in the coming days. 3M (MMM  -  Free Report) beat on EPS and revenue, with strong demand in industrial and transportation end-markets offsetting weakness in consumer electronics. Eaton Corp (ETN  -  Free Report), another diversified industrial operator, missed both EPS and revenue expectations.AT&T (T  -  Free Report) missed consensus EPS by a penny, though its revenue came out ahead of expectations. The company had a number of one-off items, including termination fees for the failed T-Mobile deal. The EPS miss notwithstanding, the company had an overall good report in terms of new smart-phone subscribers, cash flows, and share buyback plans. Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) came out ahead of expectations after the close on Wednesday as the company was able to reverse the impact of its recent mis-steps by making strong subscriber gains. Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) reports after the close today.RELATED ARTICLESDurable Goods Better Than ExpectedInitial Claims Rise by 21,000Parsing the Fed Statement
"
2198,ETN,"The market just completed its first losing week in a month, which may represent the beginning of a several week correction and digestion period. The end of 2003 and beginning of 2004 produced significant returns on the expectations of strong economic growth and earnings growth that would remain impressive in spite of a slight slowdown. In spite of Expert Advice to tighten stops and protect recent profits, they remain of the opinion that the US economy will continue to reassert its primacy and a global boom is underway. Understand why right now may be the time to sell a few positions and prepare for a correction to create entry points for the securities you want to own as the market and economy boom.Correction in the Offing?
"
2199,ETN,"The earnings picture in 2003 and expectation for rapid acceleration in the economy drove stocks higher last year. Comparisons over 2002 were very easy and demand was materializing. Yet, most investment strategists expect earnings growth to slow in 2004 as interest rates move higher. As first quarter earnings come in and guidance is issued for the rest of the year, there is likely to be a good bit of profit taking in order to lock in gains. The ""buy on rumor, sell on news"" tendency of the market could be accelerated by diminished expectations for 2003.
"
2200,ETN,"Ben Zacks, editor of the Zacks Advisor, thinks the market would be overdue for a correction, save for a couple of reasons. Zacks thinks the market has run a significant length since in a very short period of time. However, recent economic data has put a lid on the concern that the economy is in the midst of overheating and creating runaway inflation. Zacks thinks the interest rate reckoning day has been delayed, which creates more optimism in stock prices at every level and in every business line. 
"
2201,ETN,"The historically low levels of interest rates will face upward pressure due to the resurgent economy and loose monetary policy of the last couple of years. Additionally, the Federal Reserve may feel the need to increase interest rates in order to stem a severe slide in the dollar. When that occurs companies will have more trouble raising capital and consumers will see their debt burdens rise. Such a scenario could slow down the economy and earnings, to a degree, and part of the correction Zacks expects at some point is the market pricing in these eventualities. Yet, at the moment, he thinks that the lack of job growth and the non-existent inflation as measured by the Consumer and Producer Price Indices will delay the point at which interest rates truly begin their ascent.
"
2202,ETN,"From a technical perspective, though, one Expert feels the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX forecasted the current bull-run and now points to a short-term top. In a recent Daily Journal article, Price Headley, editor of the BigTrends NetLetter , charted the VIX with its upper and lower BollingerBands (the piece can be seen at: https://www.zacks.com/experts/journal/entry.php?id=313). Headley says that spikes in the VIX are indicative of bottoms when the market is in the midst of a down-channel, and that the VIX's move below and sustained run under 20 foretold the market rally that carried us through last week. However, the recent drop in the VIX to its lower BollingerBand, and beyond to multi-year lows could be evidence of a top, and Headley counsels tightening stops, or a short-term market exit for aggressive timers.Industrial Stocks to Own
"
2203,ETN,"Ben Zacks' investment strategy is currently to overweight industrial and manufacturing stocks. Zacks feels that the economic expansion thesis is compelling and expects the American economy to continue to grow and create attractive opportunities. Zacks does have some exposure to the consumer, but he feels the consumer is mostly tapped out from several years of adding to their debt load due to spending created by a mortgage refinancing boom and no interest incentives for big-ticket purchases. He does have exposure to retail and the consumer, but he is focused on the specialty names and some of the smaller market cap companies. For instance, he just replaced Federated Department Stores (NYSE: FD ) with Costco Stores (NYSE: (COST  -  Free Report) ).
"
2204,ETN,"Eaton Corp. (NYSE: (ETN  -  Free Report) ) is one of the leaders in fluid power systems, electrical power quality and controls, automotive air management and fuel economy, and intelligent truck components for fuel economy and safety. The company is expected to achieve 25% earnings growth in 2004 as economic growth expands domestically and internationally. ETN offers a dividend yield of 1.69% and has a Return on Equity of 13.7%.
"
2205,ETN,"Zacks also added Molex Inc. (NYSE: MOLX ) to his Focus List. The company beat its revenue and earnings estimates, partly due to currency benefits from a weak dollar. All the earnings estimates are for strong improvement for the world's #2 manufacturer of electrical connectors, which offers exposure to the resurgent networking sector. Demand, especially in consumer electronics, is showing resurgent strength, and with low inventories and growing backlog, the company should have several strong quarters ahead of it this year.Synchronized Global Economic Boom
"
2206,ETN,"Donald Rowe, editor of Wall Street Digest , is an eternal optimist who predicted the current economic boom would be created by Greenspan's efforts to stimulate the economy with low interest rates and accommodating monetary policy. Rowe currently believes that the slide in the dollar will continue to be a boon to American GDP growth. Already, it can be seen in the earnings statements of multi-national corporations, as translating revenues earned in other countries back into dollars creates more money at the bottom line.
"
2207,ETN,"A weaker currency makes exports cheaper in other countries, and Rowe feels that America will continue to widen its primacy over Western European nations as the Euro continues to appreciate. The EU's unwillingness to cut interest rates in order to stimulate demand due to their focus on inflation will continue to drive their currency up. Rowe feels that the European Central Bank will be forced to lower interest rates in order to restore the competitive posture of many of its exporting companies.
"
2208,ETN,"Rowe also believes that US success will be synchronized with the economic success of Asian nations. He feels that the current furor over the Chinese economy will ultimately prove to be misplaced due to a number of factors. Rowe expects the G-7 nations to force China to let the market determine the value of the Yuan just after the election. The result of that should be a 40-50% appreciation in the Chinese currency, which could reverse some of outsourcing trends of manufacturing processes to China sending jobs back home and to India, Latin and South America. 
"
2209,ETN,"When that occurs, Rowe feels that the earnings of many Chinese companies will be exposed as frauds made possible by a Communist system. The banking system in China is arguably unsound, and the government there has dumped a great deal of money into them to ensure solvency of late. George Soros remarked in Davos, Switzerland to the World Economic Forum that China is currently in the midst of asset bubble inflation, and Rowe agrees, especially given that he deeply mistrusts the accounting of Chinese companies.Three Point Strategy for '04-05
"
2210,ETN,"Rowe is obviously optimistic on the American economy, and does not fear an interest rate-reckoning day as Soros and Ben Zacks do. His strategy incorporates three axes of investment: i) Own the top twenty small and mid- cap and technology companies with soaring sales and earnings growth; ii) own the top five performing Fidelity Sector funds, and iii) own the top performing ProFunds UltraSector Index Mutual funds. In 2003, Rowe's Fidelity Select portfolio was up 70.3%, in his ProFunds Index up 108.5%. 
"
2211,ETN,"As far as stocks go, Rowe thinks that earnings over the next twelve months will surprise to the upside. Rowe expects the S&P 500 to earn $62.50/share in 2004, $68 in 2005 and $72 in 2006. Rowe feels that the cost-cutting binge will end this year as managers begin to focus on growth again and earnings rise along with successful new sales strategies. Rowe expects 12% earnings throughout 2004, with the potential for upside surprise, which he feels would send the market charging further. He currently recommends adding the following stocks to your portfolio:
"

"
2224,ETN,"The last time Eaton missed the estimate was in September 2007. That's an impressive track record considering it covers the time period during the financial crisis.

"
2231,ETN,"Eaton is extremely bullish on the full year and raised the 2011 guidance by 15 cents to a range of $3.86 to $4.06.
"
2232,ETN,"""The year is shaping up to be better than we forecasted in April,"" said Alexander M. Cutler, Eaton chairman and CEO.

"
2239,ETN,"That is a yield of 2.6%. Still a Value Stock
"
2240,ETN,"After a big run up in the shares off the 2009 lows, and hitting a 10-year high, shares haven't done much in 2011.
"
2241,ETN,"But the solid valuation is still there.

"
2246,ETN,"Crude may be soaring, but some of the energy stocks are cheap. VAALCO Energy, Inc. (EGY) is an E&P which is trading at just 8.6x forward estimates. This Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) is also expected to generate double digit earnings growth in 2011. Read the full article.
"
2247,ETN,"With gold prices soaring, it's not surprising that the estimates on the gold miners are also moving higher. Gold Fields Limited (GFI) is expected to grow its earnings by 134% in 2011.

2248,ETN,"There is no slowdown in agriculture. CNH Global N.V. (CNH) recently blew by the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter as agriculture equipment sales jumped 22%. Yet even as agriculture remains hot, this Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) is a value stock with a forward P/E of just 13.7. Read the full article.
"
2249,ETN,"Can you name five boring industrial stocks that handed investors triple-digit gains in the past two years or less?  If you guessed Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report), you'd have one of them. I included CAT the last time I wrote about ""earnings machines,"" right before Apple (AAPL) blew away the quarter last week.
"
2250,ETN,"That list of five companies with envious earnings momentum that returned doubles, triples, and five-baggers to investors also included Netflix (NFLX), Chipotle (CMG), and priceline.com (PCLN). Today, I give you four other industrial giants besides CAT, and I will add the Chinese web search dominator Baidu to round out the list.
"
2251,ETN,"The point of this exercise is to show you how a system that focuses on earnings momentum, as predicted by analyst estimate revisions, can keep you on the right side of powerful trends for long enough to realize those triple-digit gains.
"
2252,ETN,"Why You Should Still Buy the Dips in These Names
"
2253,ETN,"Here's more proof of the power of earnings estimate revisions, with four industrial stocks that are generally much sleepier -- and have value-oriented P/E's -- versus the technology and Internet names...
"
2254,ETN,"Deere (DE  -  Free Report): Since August 2009, $50 to $100
"
2255,ETN,"Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report): Since September 2009, $25 to $55
"
2256,ETN,"Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report): Since October 2009, $45 to $105
"
2257,ETN,"CNH Global (CNH): Since December 2009, $25 to $50
"
2258,ETN,"Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report): Since April 2010, $60 to $160
"
2259,ETN,"I include Baidu because I like doing these ""backtests"" in groups of 5 -- and they just reported blow-out earnings again this quarter. Read my report ""Baidu's Persistent Search for Growth""  for the details.
"
2260,ETN,"My ""backtest"" criteria for entering a long position in the month shown for each name was this: when the stock first became a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) after having been a Rank #4 (sell) -- plus it had to have never looked back down again below a Rank #3 (hold).
"
2261,ETN,"As with the first group of five mentioned above, all these stocks experienced many weeks and months flipping between a Rank #1 (strong buy) and Rank #2. Here's how I explained it last week...
"
2262,ETN,"""What we have found is that very strong stocks tend to gravitate between Rank #1 and #2 for long periods over several months or quarters. Since the Zacks Rank focuses on analyst data only from the past 60 days, it highlights recent estimate revisions and is intended to alert you to near-term momentum.
"
2263,ETN,"But even a stock that tends to hang out in the #1 and #2 Ranks will sometimes slip down to a #3 hold simply because old data has dropped off, no new estimates have come in, and earnings appear to have flat lined. But this is really just a temporary lull, more so in analyst activity than in the companys real earnings power.
"
2264,ETN,"The five stocks I mentioned with triple digit returns in the past 2 years or so since the recession -- AAPL, CMG, NFLX, PCLN, and CAT -- all spent significant periods as #1 or #2 Rank stocks, often flipping back and forth as analysts moved estimates and other stocks competed for a spot on the top 220.""
"
2265,ETN,"EM and EER
"
2266,ETN,"Why would you still put money into the four industrial stocks in my list even after the doubling most of them have experienced? Two reasons: Emerging Markets (EM) and Earnings Estimate Revisions (EER).
"
2267,ETN,"EM is the driving force of their profits as billions of citizens and their governments clamor for the lifestyles of the West. I have written extensively about the massive push toward urbanization in China, India, Brazil and dozens of other countries that is driving demand for the equipment and technology of these firms to build infrastructure. See my ""Industrial Strength Power"" for the most recent view on some of these names.
"
2268,ETN,"EER are the core of the model we use at Zacks to define those stocks with the highest return potential based on earnings momentum. Heres how I explained the power of this system last week:
"
2269,ETN,"""The primary achievement of this focus on earnings estimate revisions (EER) is that it precedes, and thus predicts, what institutional money managers -- the elephants of financial markets -- will do with their cash.
"
2270,ETN,"How? Because they have valuation models that tell them what they are willing to pay for a stock today based on its earnings tomorrow. 
"
2271,ETN,"And what do they plug into their valuation models to give them that answer? Forward-looking earnings estimates that are produced by hundreds of quantitative minds in the investment community. 
"
2272,ETN,"Valuation Models and the Price of Tomorrow's Profits
"
2273,ETN,"""Why? Because professional stock investors -- portfolio managers for pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds -- are forward-looking by nature. They don't care about the trailing P/E. They are focused on the forward P/E which only comes from analyst earnings estimates. 
"
2274,ETN,"And if estimates of futures earnings are rising in both agreement and magnitude among the analysts, then the fair value price that the valuation models of institutional investors spits out will be rising. In other words, higher estimates today equal higher stock prices tomorrow. 
"
2275,ETN,"Are the analysts always right? Hardly, but in aggregate, the Zacks Rank stock rating system is able to crunch and quantify their inputs every night into a single very valuable and historically predictive number through a proprietary formula that sorts a universe of 4,400 stocks into five ratings. 
"
2276,ETN,"The system alerts you immediately to earnings momentum and this gives you time to buy (or sell) a stock ahead of the elephants who usually take several weeks, and layers of committee approvals, to accumulate new positions.""

2278,ETN,"The four industrial stocks above -- ETN, CMI, DE, and CNH -- are still either a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) or #2 (buy) based on their earnings momentum. And they all have something else in common: a forward P/E multiple very close to 13, which is about the market average.
"
2279,ETN,"But not all 500 stocks in the S&P index have this kind of earnings power. And that's why all four of these names will still be on the buy lists of fund managers, because a forward P/E of 13 times looks cheap when the momentum is still up. Think of the pauses that you see in buying as ""continuation patterns"" on a price chart. 
"
2280,ETN,"The institutions sometimes take a break from buying, especially if stock slips back to a #3 Rank because there's just not enough new analyst data. But as soon as the new estimates roll in, the patterns of earnings momentum and price appreciation tend to continue.
"
2281,ETN,"Long-Term or Short, Bet Aggressively on EER
"
2282,ETN,"In a two year period of earnings momentum like these ten stocks have experienced, how do you know to stay with them when they drop occasionally to a #3 Rank? How do you know the rapid recovery isn't over and they are headed to a Rank #4 next as the earnings estimate revisions begin to turn downward?
"
2283,ETN,"Investors who believed in these stocks for the slightly longer run than one or two quarters' earnings events could have easily hung on with a rule that asked ""Why sell a strong earnings machine if the story and trend seem bound to continue?"" After all, a body in motion... 
"
2284,ETN,"In this way, you are thinking long-term, yet being aggressive with stocks that are experiencing both rapid earnings momentum and institutional support. Now, the reality is that very few investors buy these stocks and reap a full triple-digit gain. Most get in too late, or out too early.
"
2285,ETN,"But even capturing a 25-50% move in a quarter or two will do amazing things for your long-term portfolio results. And this is simple enough to do when you put the low-risk, high-reward dynamics of EER on your side.

I included CAT the last time I wrote about ""earnings machines"" right before Apple (AAPL) blew away the quarter last week.
"
2288,ETN,"That list of five companies with envious earnings momentum that returned doubles, triples, and five-baggers also included Netflix (NFLX), Chipotle (CMG), and priceline.com (PCLN). Today, I give you four other industrial giants besides CAT, and I will add the Chinese web search dominator Baidu to round out the list.
"
2289,ETN,"The point of this exercise is to show you how a system that focuses on earnings momentum, as predicted by analyst estimate revisions, can keep you on the right side of powerful trends for long enough to realize those triple-digit gains.
"
2290,ETN,"Why You Should Still Buy the Dips in These Names
"
2291,ETN,"Here's more proof of the power of earnings estimate revisions, with four industrial stocks that are generally much sleepier -- and have value-oriented P/E's -- versus the technology and internet names...
"
2292,ETN,"Deere (DE  -  Free Report): Since August 2009, $50 to $100
"
2293,ETN,"Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report): Since September 2009, $25 to $55
"
2294,ETN,"Cummins (CMI  -  Free Report): Since October 2009, $45 to $105
"
2295,ETN,"CNH Global (CNH): December 2009, $25 to $50
"
2296,ETN,"Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report): April 2010, $60 to $160
"
2297,ETN,"I include Baidu because I like doing these ""backtests"" in groups of 5 -- and they just reported blow-out earnings again this quarter. Read my report ""Baidu's Persistent Search for Growth""  for the details.
"
2298,ETN,"My ""backtest"" criteria for entering a long position in the month shown for each name was this: when the stock first became a Zacks #2 Rank (buy) after having been a Rank #4 (sell) -- plus it had to have never looked back down again below a Rank #3 (hold).
"
2299,ETN,"As with the first group of five mentioned above, all these stocks experienced many weeks and months flipping between a Rank #1 (strong buy) and Rank #2. Heres how I explained it last week...
"
2300,ETN,"""What we have found is that very strong stocks tend to gravitate between Rank #1 and #2 for long periods over several months or quarters. Since the Zacks Rank focuses on analyst data only from the past 60 days, it highlights recent estimate revisions and is intended to alert you to near-term momentum.
"
2301,ETN,"But even a stock that tends to hang out in the #1 and #2 Ranks will sometimes slip down to a #3 hold simply because old data has dropped off, no new estimates have come in, and earnings appear to have flat lined. But this is really just a temporary lull, more so in analyst activity than in the companys real earnings power.
"
2302,ETN,"The five stocks I mentioned with triple digit returns in the past 2 years or so since the recession -- AAPL, CMG, NFLX, PCLN, and CAT -- all spent significant periods as #1 or #2 Rank stocks, often flipping back and forth as analysts moved estimates and other stocks competed for a spot on the top 220.""
"
2303,ETN,"EM and EER
"
2304,ETN,"Why would you still put money into the four industrial stocks in my list even after the doubling most of them have experienced? Two reasons: Emerging Markets (EM) and Earnings Estimate Revisions (EER).
"
2305,ETN,"EM is the driving force of their profits as billions of citizens and their governments clamor for the lifestyles of the West. I have written extensively about the massive push toward urbanization in China, India, Brazil and dozens of other countries that is driving demand for the equipment and technology of these firms to build infrastructure. See my ""Industrial Strength Power"" for the most recent view on some of these names.
"
2306,ETN,"EER are the core of the model we use at Zacks to define those stocks with the highest return potential based on earnings momentum. Heres how I explained the power of this system last week:
"
2307,ETN,"""The primary achievement of this focus on earnings estimate revisions (EER) is that it precedes, and thus predicts, what institutional money managers -- the elephants of financial markets -- will do with their cash.
"
2308,ETN,"How? Because they have valuation models that tell them what they are willing to pay for a stock today based on its earnings tomorrow. 
"
2309,ETN,"And what do they plug into their valuation models to give them that answer? Forward-looking earnings estimates that are produced by hundreds of quantitative minds in the investment community. 
"
2310,ETN,"Valuation Models and the Price of Tomorrow's Profits
"
2311,ETN,"""Why? Because professional stock investors -- portfolio managers for pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies, and hedge funds -- are forward-looking by nature. They don't care about the trailing P/E. They are focused on the forward P/E which only comes from analyst earnings estimates. 
"
2312,ETN,"And if estimates of futures earnings are rising in both agreement and magnitude among the analysts, then the fair value price that the valuation models of institutional investors spits out will be rising. In other words, higher estimates today equal higher stock prices tomorrow. 
"
2313,ETN,"Are the analysts always right? Hardly, but in aggregate, the Zacks Rank stock rating system is able to crunch and quantify their inputs every night into a single very valuable and historically predictive number through a proprietary formula that sorts a universe of 4,400 stocks into five ratings. 
"
2314,ETN,"The system alerts you immediately to earnings momentum and this gives you time to buy (or sell) a stock ahead of the elephants who usually take several weeks, and layers of committee approvals, to accumulate new positions.""
"
2315,ETN,"Continuation of Institutional Support
"
2316,ETN,"The four industrial stocks above -- ETN, CMI, DE, and CNH -- are still either a Zacks #1 Rank (strong buy) or #2 (buy) based on their earnings momentum. And they all have something else in common: a forward P/E multiple very close to 13, which is about the market average.

And that's why all four of these names will still be on the buy lists of fund managers, because a forward P/E of 13 times looks cheap when the momentum is still up.

2337,ETN,"Meanwhile, income before taxes surged 72% as the company was able to leverage its fixed expenses.
"
2338,ETN,"Guidance Raised
"
2339,ETN,"Following the solid quarter, management gave guidance for 2011. The company expects to earn between $7.00 and $7.60 per share on 12% revenue growth.
"
2340,ETN,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate is within guidance at $7.40, up from $7.03 just 30 days ago. This represents 32% growth over 2010 EPS. The 2012 estimate is currently $8.73, up from $8.16 last month. This equates to 18% growth over 2011 EPS.
"
2341,ETN,"Estimates have been surging over the last several months as the global economy continues to improve. This can be seen in the company's Price & Consensus chart:
"
2342,ETN,"It is a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy) stock.
"
2343,ETN,"Fundamentals
"
2344,ETN,"The stock has soared 57% since September 1.
"
2345,ETN,"Valuation remains in check, however, because of the corresponding rise in earnings estimates. Shares trade at 14.6x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 20.1x. Its PEG ratio is a reasonable 1.4.
"
2346,ETN,"Eaton also recently announced that it is raising its quarterly dividend by 17%. It currently yields 2.2%. Since 2000, the company has raised its dividend at a compound annual rate of 10.2%.

"
2349,ETN,"Eaton Corporation (ETN  -  Free Report) has a lot to be thankful for this holiday season.   
"
2350,ETN,"You see, the company got beat up pretty good during the Great Recession, which is to be expected for a diversified industrial manufacturer during one of the worst downturns in modern history. However, the economy is slowly but surely improving from the dark days of 2009, and the company has already been benefiting.   
"
2351,ETN,"As if that's not enough to be thankful about, we here at Zacks have decided to come along for the ride.  
"
2352,ETN,"ETN was added to the Growth & Income portfolio on Nov 11. The company had a strong third-quarter performance in late October that included substantial gains in EPS and revenue, as well as an enhanced outlook for the full year. Analysts pulled earnings estimates higher in response, giving the company a Zacks #1 Rank ('strong buy').  
"
2353,ETN,"In fact, the third-quarter performance and outlook was so impressive that we recently upgraded Eaton to an ""Outperform"" recommendation.  
"
2354,ETN,"Eaton is a diversified power management company that sells products to customers in more than 150 countries. It is a global technology leader in electrical components and systems for power quality, distribution and control; hydraulics components, systems and services for industrial and mobile equipment; aerospace fuel, hydraulics and pneumatic systems for commercial and military use; and truck and automotive drivetrain and powertrain systems for performance, fuel economy and safety. Third Quarter Report 
"
2355,ETN,"As you can see from the chart above, Eaton was able to put together positive surprises even during the worst of the downturn, which is good. It's that deep, cavernous decline in overall estimates that was the problem though. Beating estimates that are already moving lower is not exactly a sign of encouragement.  
"
2356,ETN,"But you can see that the company is well on its way to recovery, as it has been capitalizing on a continuing rebound in its end markets. Excluding items, third-quarter earnings per share of $1.60 bettered last year's $1.21 while also topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by nearly 16%.   
"
2357,ETN,"Sales jumped 18% to approximately $3.6 billion, compared to $3.03 billion last year. This increase was attributed to core sales as its end markets advanced 14% in the quarter.  
"
2358,ETN,"Eaton also raised its earnings guidance for the full year by 10%, now expecting earnings per share between $5.30 and $5.40 (operating EPS between $5.45 and $5.55).

2359,ETN,"For more on this quarter, read: Eaton Outdoes Estimates and Earnings Scorecard: Eaton Corp.Earnings Estimates for Eaton Corp. 
"
2360,ETN,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is now $5.55 per share. The only movement in the past 30 days was a single downward revision out of 15 total estimates. However, you can clearly see the sharp advance that came after the quarter's announcement, which leaves the consensus 7.8% higher than 2 months ago.  
"
2361,ETN,"But 2011 is taking on a whole new importance now that 2010 is almost done, and there's been much more activity of late for next year. The past 30 days have seen 4 upward revisions out of 21 total estimates, sending the Zacks Consensus Estimate up by 2% in that time to $6.98 per share. That outlook has also increased 13.3% from 60 days ago and suggests year-over-year profit growth of nearly 26%.

This Dublin, Ireland-based company has presence across the globe.Eaton’s continuous focus on strategic acquisitions and debt reduction initiatives backed by stable cash generating capacity, geographically-diversified operations, and systematic investments in research and development activities to launch new products will likely boost its future performance.However, owing to the nature of this industry, Eaton’s operation depends on numerous suppliers of raw materials.

2363,ETN,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Eaton Corporation plc (ETN  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Eaton Corporation has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 18.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.8. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Eaton Corporation’s current PE level puts it above its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE compares favorably with the Zacks Industrial Products sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 23.7. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Eaton Corporation has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 17.1, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Eaton Corporation stock in the near term too.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Eaton Corporation has a P/S ratio of about 1.8. This is much lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Eaton Corporation currently has a Value Score of B, putting it into the top 40% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Eaton Corporation a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Eaton Corporation is just 1.9, a level that is lower than the industry average of 2.1. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 12.4, which is better than the industry average of 13.9. Clearly, ETN is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Eaton Corporation might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of c and a Momentum Score of F. This gives ETN a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of C. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been mixed at best. The current quarter has seen three estimates go higher in the past sixty days compared to five lower, while the full year estimate has seen two upward and five downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a slight negative impact on the consensus estimate, as the full year estimate has dipped 0.4% in the past two months, while the current quarter estimate has remained unchanged. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and Consensus  Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and Consensus | Eaton Corporation, PLC QuoteGiven these trends, the stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which is why we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineEaton Corporation is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. However, with a sluggish Zacks Industry Rank (among Bottom 35% of more than 250 industries) and a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall.So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and the broader factors to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2364,ETN,"Eaton Corporation Plc. (ETN  -  Free Report) announced that its four facilities have resumed operation in Puerto Rico following the damage and disruption caused by the hurricanes. The facilities suffered modest damages and some of the plants are nearing pre-hurricane production levels. Eaton’s facilities in Puerto Rico manufacture low- and medium-voltage circuit protection components.Eaton expects that hurricanes Maria, Irma and Harvey, as well as the earthquake in Mexico City will have an adverse impact of 3 cents on its third-quarter projected earnings per share guidance of $1.20 to $1.30.Eaton operates in nearly 175 countries and has manufacturing facilities worldwide. This enhances the revenue stream of the company but at the same time exposes it to disruptions due to natural disaster and geo-political hazards.Eaton’s Long-Term Strategy The impact of hurricanes is no doubt a short-term headwind for Eaton.

2367,ETN,"Spending by businesses on Equipment and Software has been one of the strongest forces driving the recovery so far.  The U.S. seems to be experiencing a bit of a manufacturing Renaissance, but still has a very long way to go before manufacturing is anywhere near as big a part of output and employment as it was 30 years ago.  
"
2368,ETN,"Most of the improvement is probably just cyclical, but the pick up in this cycle has been much stronger for manufacturing than it had been in the previous two recoveries.  The domestic economy is gaining steam, with just 0.4% growth in the first quarter, 1.3% in the second, and 1.8% in the third.  The consensus is that growth accelerated to over 2.5% in the fourth quarter.  The Machinery Industry is a natural beneficiary of this.    Zacks Industry Classifications
"
2369,ETN,"The Zacks industry classifications are very fine, with 258 different industries tracked.  It is not particularly noteworthy if a single small industry shows up doing well, a single firm with good news can propel a one or two firm industry to the top (or bottom) of the charts.  
"
2370,ETN,"It is interesting when you see a cluster of similar industries at the top of the list.  The same holds true for the bottom of the list.  The definition of size that matters here is not the total sales or market capitalization but the number of companies in the “industry.”  Where Machinery Is Working
"
2371,ETN,"There are five separate Machinery “industries” that make the top 40.  The best performing of them is the smallest by number of companies: The Industrial Automation/Robotics Industry, in 13th place -- representing an improvement of 8 spots since last week.  Its average Zacks Rank is 2.25, down (a good thing) from 2.50 last week.  
"
2372,ETN,"The next best is the Machine Tools Industry, with seven members and in 20th place -- slipping six spots from last week as its average rank rose to 2.43 from 2.29.  The Far Machinery Industry also has seven members in it, and come in 30th place, a four spot improvement.  Its average rank was unchanged at 2.57.  
"
2373,ETN,"The largest of the five groups by far is the General Industrial Machinery group with 38 firms in it.  It is in 38th place, an 18-spot deterioration as the average rank increased to 2.61 from 2.45.  Filling out the group is Construction and Mining Machinery, an eight member group in 40th place, a huge improvement of 128 spots as the average rank plunged to 2.63 from 3.13.
"
2374,ETN,"If the Zacks Ranks were distributed randomly, one would expect that only 5% of the members of these “industries” would earn the coveted Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy).  Instead, 11 of the 64 (17.3%) have earned that distinction.  If it were random, only 15% would hold Zacks #2 Ranks (Buy) but actually 10, or 15.6%, hold it.
"
2375,ETN,"Some of the names on the lists below are large will know household names, such as Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and Deere (DE  -  Free Report), but there are also some very small firms as well.
"
2376,ETN,"The valuations are for the most part reasonable, and while I don’t show the FY2 over FY1 growth on the tables, you can get a good idea of it by looking at how much lower the P/E for next year is relative to the P/E for this year.  Most are expecting solid, but not spectacular growth, and you are paying a reasonable price for those earnings.  Not rock bottom for the most part, but very reasonable.  
"
2377,ETN,"Most are seeing big increases in their estimates for both this year and next.  However, just as a word of warning, the smaller firms tend to be thinly covered, so an individual analyst raising his or her numbers for the firm has a much bigger impact on the mean estimate than is the case with the big well-covered companies.  Many of the firms pay at least some dividend, but most of the yields are relatively low.Number 1 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Current FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est %Ch Curr FY Est - 4 wks %Ch Next FY Est - 4 wks ""CurrentPrice"" Div YieldCaterpillar Inc CAT $58,661  12.86 9.76 1.69% 3.36% $90.99  2.02%Eaton Corp ETN $14,450  10.51 8.88 2.60% 2.62% $42.35  3.21%Gardner Denver GDI $3,820  13.66 11.69 9.27% 10.29% $73.07  0.27%Agco Corp AGCO $3,768  9.67 8.56 5.71% 2.31% $39.74  0.00%Lincoln Electrc LECO $2,639  12.95 10.94 12.37% 9.97% $31.28  1.98%Barnes Grp B $1,191  15.37 12.61 5.29% 3.58% $21.87  1.46%Colfax Corp CFX $1,079  19.55 15.85 5.23% 7.56% $24.80  0.00%Kaman Corp  A KAMN $856  16.52 13.56 -0.44% 0.00% $32.60  1.72%Dxp Enterprises DXPE $322  11.66 9.81 4.45% 4.10% $22.81  0.00%Hollysys Automt HOLI $315  6.17 5.54 2.28% -3.70% $5.76  0.00%Flow Intl Corp FLOW $146  19.87 11.41 0.00% 0.00% $3.08  0.00%Number 2 Ranked FirmsCompany Ticker Market Cap ($ mil) P/E Using Curr FY Est P/E Using Next FY Est ""%Ch CurrFiscal Yr Est - 4 wks"" ""%Ch NextFiscal Yr Est - 4 wks"" ""CurrentPrice"" Div YieldDeere & Co DE $30,496  11.34 9.68 0.33% 0.01% $72.66  2.26%Kubota Corp Adr KUB $10,827  15.37 14.14 0.00% 0.00% $42.57  1.74%Robbins & Myers RBN $1,987  18.6 14.36 0.00% 0.00% $43.48  0.41%Actuant Corp ATU $1,377  12.24 10.26 0.00% 0.00% $20.06  0.20%Irobot Corp IRBT $734  25.08 20.42 7.96% 3.83% $27.67  0.00%Stratasys Inc SSYS $530  29.29 22.53 -7.36% -8.06% $25.07  0.00%H&E Equip Svcs HEES $355  N/A 12.32 -226.32% 0.00% $10.14  0.00%Kadant Inc KAI $264  9.75 8.24 0.30% 0.65% $21.42  0.00%Graham Corp GHM $178  17.07 13.16 4.64% 1.99% $17.98  0.44%Tri-Tech Holdng TRIT $46  3.71 3.4 0.00% 0.00% $5.67  0.00%

2378,ETN,"In evaluating the Zacks Industry Ranks, you want to see two things: a good overall score (low, meaning more Zacks #1 and #2 Ranked stocks than #4 or #5 Ranked stocks) and some improvement the relative position from the prior week. It is also helpful to understand exactly what the Zacks Industry Rank is.
"
2379,ETN,"The Zacks Industry Rank is the un-weighted average of the individual Zacks ranks of the firms in that industry. It does not matter if the stock is the 800 lb gorilla that dominates the industry or some very small niche player in the industry -- they have the same influence on the industry rank.
"
2380,ETN,"Also, that means that the bigger the industry in terms of number of firms, the less influence any given company has on the industry rank. It also implies that small industries, with just two or three firms, should be the ones found at either the top or the bottom of the list. After all, if there are only two firms in the industry, it is relatively easy to get a Zacks rank of 2.00 (i.e. one with a Zacks Rank of #1 and the other with a #3). Right now, that industry rank would be tied for 6th place among the 255 industries tracked.
"
2381,ETN,"The same obviously goes for the bottom of the list as well. If there are 50 firms in the industry, and it ends up at one of the extremes, that means there has to be something pretty significant going on. Thus, I do not always focus on the very highest rated industries, but on the highest rated ones in which there are a large number of firms.

2383,ETN,"Eaton Corp. (ETN  -  Free Report) recently jumped past some short-term resistance to hit a new multi-year high at $96.30. But in spite of the gains, the stochastic below the chart is signaling that shares are trading safely away from over-bought territory. Look for support from the recent trend line and short-term low on any weakness, take a look below.
"
2384,ETN,"Icici Bank Ltd. (IBN  -  Free Report) has been a bit weak lately, spending the last few weeks trending lower after hitting a new multi-year high in early November at $58.22. Fortunately, some short-term support is close at hand at the short-term low of $49 and the longer-term trend line that began in early July. The stochastic below the chart is signaling that shares are over sold at this level, take a look below.
"
2385,ETN,"Two weeks ago, I recommended looking for buying opportunities in Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) after the stock had found support at $100. Ahead of its earnings, reported yesterday, I said be prepared to buy it on the breakout above $135, or on any dip back toward $110.
"
2386,ETN,"Even if you bought the first breakout above the 50 and 200-day moving averages at $135 and suffered the pullback to $120 last week, you still did very well as the stock surges above $140 today on the back of its strong Q3 report, hitting a high of $147.68.
"
2387,ETN,"Why Buy Baidu?
"
2388,ETN,"One year ago this week, I made the techno-fundamental case for buying the stock around $110. As Google (GOOG) exited China, Baidu would only clean up. Writing for TheStreet.com, here was my rationale...
"
2389,ETN,"""Apparently, institutional growth and technology investors love the BIDU story. And though the earnings are modest now, they are growing rapidly. 2011 estimates could see $2.50, which would bring this $100 stock down to a more comfortable 40x multiple. But it seems the real appeal of BIDU might be in futures earnings not even visible yet.
"
2390,ETN,"As the dominant Chinese search engine and web portal, investors see the potential for BIDU to capitalize on the largest fast-growing middle class population in the world. I have written often in the past year about the Chinese emerging markets story fueling the growth of American industrial companies like Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) and Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report).
"
2391,ETN,"But I haven't paid much attention to the consumer side of China's ascendancy. Obviously, young, educated, and ambitious Chinese citizens will use the web more and more to learn, acquire, and do business. And however American consumer companies gain access to Chinese markets, they may end up adding profits to BIDU's business model too, whether partnering, paying an information or transaction toll of some kind, or merely through advertising.""
"
2392,ETN,"Keep Buying Dips in Baidu
"
2393,ETN,"What's changed since I wrote that one year ago? Nada. Well, except that they are on pace to earn nearly $2.90 this year. And beating the 3rd quarter estimates yesterday by a penny helped the cause.
"
2394,ETN,"But what was more impressive was the sales growth. Here's the story from Pete Barlas, writing for Investor's Business Daily today...
"
2395,ETN,"Revenue jumped 94% to $654.7 million. Analysts had expected $619.3 million. Part of the big gain, though, was from Baidu including for the first time results from its travel search unit, Qunar. Baidu didn't say how much that added to its top line.
"
2396,ETN,"For the current quarter, Baidu said it expects revenue of $691.4 million to $711 million. The midpoint, $701.2 million, would be up 89% from Q4 2010. Analysts had forecast $649.4 million.
"
2397,ETN,"This kind of growth will probably lead to rising EPS estimates, keeping the forward P/E below 50. I am not as optimistic as most analysts with price targets near $200. But I think we can see $175 in the next three months and I will buy the dips with call options.
"
2398,ETN,"Disclosure: No positions at this time.
"
2399,ETN,"Kevin Cook is a Senior Stock Strategist with Zacks.com
"
2400,ETN,"Third quarter earnings results are pouring in.  So far I would characterize the season as good, but not great. We have 126, or 25.2%, of the S&P 500 firms reporting so far. That sort of understates things a bit, since those 25.2% of firms represent 39% of all expected earnings for the quarter (provided that the remaining 374 firms all report exactly in line with expectations).
"
2401,ETN,"The year-over-year growth rate for the S&P 500 is 12.13%. That is actually well above the 3.33% growth that those same 126 firms posted in the second quarter. However, the second quarter was distorted by some big hits to the financial sector, most notably Bank of America (BAC  -  Free Report). This time it reported better-than-expected earnings and did not have the big “write off it did in the second quarter. That resulted in a $12 billion swing in total net income between the second and third quarters.
"
2402,ETN,"If we exclude the financial sector, the year-over-year growth rate is just a bit higher at 13.51%, but it represents a far bigger slowdown from the second quarter, when growth was 22.71%. The remaining 374 stocks are expected to growth their earnings 12.33% over last year, down from 22.71% growth in the second quarter. If we exclude the financials, the remaining growth in the third quarter is expected to slow to 11.99% year over year from 17.99%. Then again, at the beginning of earnings second quarter season, growth of 9.7% was expected; 12.2% ex-financials.
"
2403,ETN,"We will need another season where positive earnings surprises far outpace disappointments if we are going to match the second quarter growth rate. If we combine the already reported results with the expectations, it now looks like the final growth will come in at 12.25%.
"
2404,ETN,"Better than Expected
"
2405,ETN,"Relative to expectations, both earnings and revenues are doing better than expected. Then again, having far more companies report positive surprises than disappointments is entirely normal. The current ratio of 2.65 (for the 126) is actually well below the average experience of the last five years or so. The median surprise is 2.78% and that is also below normal. Still, it is far more positive surprises than disappointments.
"
2406,ETN,"Top-line surprises started off extremely strong, but faded over the last week. The surprise ratio is now 2.00 for revenues with a 1.12 median surprise. Not bad, but not terrific either. Top line growth so far has been 8.37%, and 8.83% ex-financials. The remaining 374 firms are collectively expected to grow their top lines by 7.20%, or by 10.28% if we exclude the financials.
"
2407,ETN,"Expanding net margins have been one of the keys to earnings growth. That is still the case, with reported net margins of 13.40% so far, up from 12.95% a year ago, and 12.27% in the second quarter (for those 126 firms). However, the mix of firms that have reported so far is skewed towards higher-margin firms, and the BAC effect is very big as far as the increase relative to the second quarter is concerned. Excluding financials, net margins have come in at 9.99% up from 9.58% a year ago, but down from 10.45% in the second quarter.
"
2408,ETN,"Looking ahead, overall net margins are expected to be down only slightly from the second quarter at 7.97% versus 8.00% in the second quarter, but up from 7.61% a year ago. Excluding the financials, though, it looks like the expanding net margin party might be coming to an end, with only 7.17% expected, down from both the 7.94% level of the second quarter, and 7.59% a year ago.
"
2409,ETN,"On an annual basis, net margins continue to march northward.  In 2008, overall net margins were just 5.88%, rising to 6.33% in 2009. They hit 8.57% in 2010 and are expected to continue climbing to 9.28% in 2011 and 9.84% in 2012. The pattern is a bit different, particularly during the recession, if the financials are excluded, as margins fell from 7.78% in 2008 to 6.99% in 2009, but have started a robust recovery and rose to 8.18% in 2010. They are expected to rise to 8.82% in 2011 and 9.12% in 2012.
"
2410,ETN,"The expectations for the full year are very healthy, with total net income for 2010 rising to $793.6 billion in 2010, up from $543.4 billion in 2009.  In 2011, the total net income for the S&P 500 should be $907.0 billion, or increases of 46.0% and 14.3%, respectively. The expectation is for 2012 to have total net income passing the $1 Trillion mark to $1.015 Trillion, for growth of 11.9%.
"
2411,ETN,"S&P ""EPS"" to Surpass $100
"
2412,ETN,"That will also put the “EPS for the S&P 500 over the $100 “per share level for the first time at $106.43. That is up from $56.98 for 2009, $83.25 for 2010, and $95.10 for 2011. In an environment where the 10-year T-note is yielding 2.19%, a P/E of 14.6x based on 2010 and 12.8x based on 2011 earnings looks attractive. The P/E based on 2012 earnings is just 11.4x.
"
2413,ETN,"Estimate revisions activity is starting to rise again. We have seen a little bit of a bounce in the ratio of upwards to downwards revisions, especially for this year, but it is still far from turning positive. To some extent, there is a mechanical reason for upwards revisions to this year. After all, the third quarter is part of the full year, so if a company beats by, say, a nickel, and the analysts don’t increase their estimates for the firms by at least that much, they are implicitly cutting their numbers for the fourth quarter. With more than five positive surprises for every disappointment, one should expect more upwards revisions than cuts.
"
2414,ETN,"Even so, the ratio is still deep in negative territory at just 0.61, although that figure still includes a lot of estimate changes that were made before the earnings reports came in (we track a four week moving total). There is no mechanical effect when it comes to the revisions for next year, and those remain even further in negative territory at just 0.36, or almost three cuts for every increase.
"
2415,ETN,"The net cuts are very widespread. For this year only five of 16 sectors are seeing more positive than negative revisions, and eight sectors have more than two cuts for every increase. For next year, every single sector has more cuts than increases, and cuts out number increases by more than three to one in nine sectors. As the principal argument in the bulls favor is the high level of corporate earnings, and the low valuations relative to them, this trend needs to reverse -- and soon.
"
2416,ETN,"I would look for those companies with solid dividends and for which the analysts are still raising their estimates for next year, and which are rated either #1 or #2 on the Zacks Rank.  Some of the names that meet those criteria are DuPont (DD), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report) and PPG Industries (PPG  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (MO  -  Free Report).RELATED ARTICLESMarket Remains OptimisticBulls Own Rest of 2011Initial Jobless Claims Edge Down

2417,ETN,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Eaton Corporation plc (ETN  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Eaton Corporation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ETN in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.18 per share for ETN, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ETN, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.72% heading into earnings season.Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Eaton Corporation, PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Eaton Corporation, PLC QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that ETN has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Eaton Corporation, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaries,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2418,ETN,"Emerson Electric Co. (EMR  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2017 results before the opening bell on Aug 1.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings were in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Emerson has an average positive surprise of 4.3% over the trailing four quarters, with two beats, one miss and one in-line earnings. We expect Emerson to score an earnings beat in the about-to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows an earnings beat for Emerson as it possesses the key components.Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP for Emerson is +2.94% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at 70 cents, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents. A positive Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise.  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise  Emerson Electric Company Price and EPS Surprise | Emerson Electric Company QuoteZacks Rank: Emerson has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.The favorable combination of Emerson's Zacks Rank #3 and +2.94% ESP makes us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Growth Factors this Past FactorEmerson continues to benefit from global infrastructure growth. Its core businesses hold dominant positions in markets tied to energy efficiency and infrastructure spending. Particularly, the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment is expected to act as a major catalyst for the soon-to-be-reported quarter, fueled by improving trends in the U.S. and Asian construction markets.Favorable trends in power, life sciences and improving MRO spending by oil and gas are expected to raise the top line for the quarter under review. Also, Emerson’s restructuring efforts, undertaken over the past few quarters, are likely to boost upcoming results. During the fiscal year, Emerson has offloaded three of its businesses – Network Power, Leroy-Somer and Control Techniques – and generated $5.2 billion in proceeds.These restructuring actions better equips Emerson to cross-leverage its remaining portfolio and navigate between businesses. We believe the streamlined business structure will be conducive to earnings and margin expansion during the fiscal third quarter. During the previous quarter, Emerson’s total segment and EBIT margin increased 40 basis points (bps) and 30 bps, respectively, on a year-over-year basis, on the back of restructuring actions.This apart, the company is likely to see inorganic growth on the recent Pentair Valves & Controls buyout. Other acquisitions including Locus Traxx, PakSense and Blending & Transfer Systems business of FMC Technologies are expected to drive third-quarter fiscal sales as well.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some other companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +5.32% and a Zacks Rank #1.

2419,ETN,"A. O. Smith Corporation (AOS  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings per share of 53 cents, which came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thereby breaking its earnings beat streak which lasted for 22 straight quarters.The earnings figure improved 8.2% from the year-ago tally of 49 cents. The bottom-line improvement mainly came on the back of robust sales growth.Inside the HeadlinesNet sales in the quarter were up an impressive 10.7% year over year to $738.2 million. It also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $728 million. A thriving water heater industry in the U.S., as well as robust consumer product demand in China fueled the top-line growth.Talking about segments, A.O. Smith’s sales in the North America segment (comprising U.S. and Canadian water heaters and boilers) grew 8.8% year over year to $470.7 million. Higher volumes of residential and commercial water heaters in the U.S. proved conducive to the sales performance of this region. In addition, the previously completed acquisition of residential water treatment company – Aquasana – contributed $13 million to revenues, thus supplementing the segment’s growth.Segmental operating earnings rose 4.8% year over year to $109.2 million. The segment’s profit was favorably impacted by higher sales of commercial water heaters and boilers, and the Aug 2016 pricing actions. However, the benefit was partially offset by elevated steel costs. However, operating margin contracted 90 bps to 23.2% on a year-over-year basis, due to higher steel prices. Lower operating margin of the acquired Aquasana business also contributed to the decline.Quarterly sales at the Rest of the World segment (China, India and Europe) rose 13.8% year over year to $272.8 million. The improvement came largely on the back of consistent solid customer demand for A.O. Smith’s premium water heating and water treatment products, particularly in China (up 20%, excluding impacts of the U.S. dollar). While water treatment sales in China grew over 40%, air purification sales quadrupled year over year.Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Smith (A.O.) Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Smith (A.O.) Corporation QuoteOperating earnings at the segment edged down 1.5% year over year to $32.5 million in the quarter. The favorable impact of excellent sales in China was more than offset by multiple headwinds, including higher steel costs, higher selling and advertising costs, less profitable sales mix in China and currency headwinds. Operating margin contracted 190 bps to 11.9% year over year.Share RepurchasesDuring the first half of 2017, A.O. Smith repurchased around 1.3 million common shares for $66.2 million. At the end of the quarter, the company has approximately 3.6 million shares remaining under the existing discretionary repurchase.Liquidity & Cash FlowExiting the quarter on Jun 30, 2017, A.O. Smith’s cash and cash equivalents were $306.6 million compared with $330.4 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016.At the end of the quarter, long-term debt was $367.7 million compared with $316.4 million at the end of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceConcurrent with the second-quarter results, the company raised its full-year earnings guidance once again. For full-year 2017, the company expects revenues to grow in the range of 10—11% now, as opposed to the earlier guided range of 9–10%.Further, A.O. Smith now anticipates 2017 earnings to lie in the range of $2.07–$2.11 per share compared to the earlier guided range of $2.03–$2.09. The upward guidance revision is primarily attributable to outstanding top- and bottom-line performances in the reported quarter.Our TakeA.O. Smith’s consistent sales and earnings growth over the past several quarters highlight the company’s underlying strength. We believe stellar prospects in China and the U.S. end markets will continue to accelerate growth, going forward. Also, dominant foothold in the North American water heater market, along with thriving prospects in the residential and commercial boiler markets are likely to stoke growth.This apart, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s solid financial health, strategic capital expenditures to fortify its market position and overall positive trends bode well for long-term growth.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other similarly-ranked stocks in the same space include Barnes Group Inc. (B  -  Free Report), Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report) and Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC  -  Free Report). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Barnes Group has a solid earnings surprise history for the trailing four quarters, having beaten estimates each time for an average of 8.9%.Eaton also has a decent earnings surprise history, with an average beat of 3.3% over the trailing four quarters, beating estimates thrice.Regal Beloit generated two beats over the trailing four quarters, for an average positive surprise of 1.5%.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

2420,ETN,"The U.S. market showed strength subsequent to the election of President Trump, primarily factoring in his promised pro-growth policies. However, the momentum has stalled following uncertainties looming over policy enactment and implementation.As far the Industrial Products companies are concerned, the Trump government’s infrastructure improvement plan, if implemented, will boost demand. Also, the sector is seeing improving export demand for its products from foreign nations.Since the beginning of the year, industrial products stocks have been strong performers, with the sector gaining roughly 9.4%. Among the S&P 500 members, the top five industrial machinery gainers include Roper Technologies, Inc. (ROP  -  Free Report), Deere & Company (DE  -  Free Report), Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (SWK  -  Free Report), Caterpillar, Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation Inc. (ROK  -  Free Report). The poor performers include Flowserve Corp. (FLS  -  Free Report), Emerson Electric Company (EMR  -  Free Report) and Eaton Corporation, PLC (ETN  -  Free Report).Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for the industrial stocks. It measures the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country. A brief discussion on the machinery industry in different nations is given below.Industrial Machinery - Nation-Wise DescriptionThe United States: The country’s industrial production increased at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities.Per the U.S. Census Bureau report, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 5.7% in the first half of 2017 led by growth in orders for construction, mining, industrial, material handling and other machineries. Also, the job market showed strength, with the recent data indicating 209,000 new job additions in July. In second-quarter 2017, new job additions averaged 194,333 per month. Unemployment rate declined from 4.4% in June to 4.3% in July.Citing improvement in economic activities, the Federal Reserve raised its interest rates in June and indicated further rate hikes ahead. This, in turn, will make capital investments more expensive and hence might weigh on businesses for industrial products makers.     Per its Jul 2017 report, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) trimmed its growth projections for the U.S. economy by 20 basis points (bps) to 2.1% for 2017 and 40 bps to 2.1% for 2018 primarily on account of uncertainties surrounding the implementation of governmental policies.Japan: According to the report from Japan’s Cabinet Office, core machinery orders (an indicator of capital spending by companies in the next six to nine months) decreased 1.4% in first-quarter 2017 while fell nearly 3.1% in April and 3.6% in May.  In second-quarter 2017, total machinery order will likely decline 0.9% while core orders are expected to fall 5.9%. Orders from manufacturing clients will likely fall 1.1% while that from government clients might decline 13.6%.The country’s economy is struggling with internal issues including low investment levels, unfavorable exchange rates, aging population and a huge public debt. Also, the consumption level has failed to revive to a satisfactory standard since it suffered from a 3% rise in national sales tax in Apr 2015.In addition, the country is facing weak economic conditions externally. However, efforts to improve wages and hence, demand as well as steps to increase investments domestically might work in the country’s favor in the quarters ahead.The IMF increased its growth projection for the country by 10 bps to 1.3% for 2017 while it remained stable at 0.6% for 2018.China: China’s GDP grew 6.9% from the year-earlier period in the second quarter, coming in better than expected. Improvements in infrastructure investment, retail sales and higher exports due to healthy global economy have worked in its favor. In March, the government announced its plan to spend $2 trillion for the development of infrastructure and transportation by 2020. However, tiff with the U.S. economy over trade relationships might dent its growth momentum.The country’s industrial production increased 7.6% year over year in June on the back of improvement in manufacturing and utilities sectors, offset by weakness in the mining sector. Industrial production in both May and April grew 6.5%.For 2017, the Chinese government anticipates economy to grow roughly 6.5%. The IMF projects the Chinese economy to grow 6.7% in 2017 and 6.4% in 2018.India: The country’s industrial production decelerated to 1.7% in May 2017, having expanded 2.8% in the previous month. Production suffered from lower rise in manufacturing output and contractions in mining and quarrying outputs.Expectations of a strong demand, improved policies and better monsoon conditions are the factors that will influence the country’s growth, going forward. The government is making concerted efforts to turn the country into a prime manufacturing hub for all nations across the world. Apart from boosting the foreign capital inflow in the country, these strategies will improve the domestic job market as well as demand for industrial products. The recent interest rate cut by the central bank, driven by prevailing low inflation rate in the country, will allow accessibility to cheap loans.According to the IMF, the country is projected to grow 7.2% in 2017 and 7.7% in 2018.Brazil: Political uncertainties continue to loom large over Brazil’s economy and are mainly responsible for the countries’ below investment grade ratings. Private investments are low while inadequate infrastructure and still high unemployment rate are making the economy more lackluster.Strong efforts are being made to revive the economy. In July this year, interest rate was trimmed 100 bps by the countries’ Central Bank, this being its seventh consecutive rate cut since Oct 2016. Also, inflation has eased over the past few months. Per the data available, industrial production in the country was flat in Jun 2017 compared with the previous month while showed expansion of 1.2% in May and 1.3% in April.The IMF expects the country’s output to grow 0.3% in 2017, reflecting a 10 bps increase from the previous forecast. However, growth projection for 2018 has been cut 40 bps to 1.3%.Eurozone: Per the available data, industrial production in the Eurozone improved 1.3% in May from the prior month and rose 4% year over year. In April, industrial production inched up 0.3% from the previous month. The unemployment rate was 9.1% in June versus 9.2% in the previous month.The IMF predicts output growth in Euro Area to be 1.9% in 2017, up 20 bps from the previous forecasts and grow 1.7% in 2018.Industry RankingMachinery stocks are broadly grouped under the Industrial Products, one of the 16 broad Zacks sectors. The Zacks sectors comprise 265 industries that are ranked on the basis of earnings outlook of constituent companies in each industry. As a rule, we put our X industries (all 265 of them) into two groups: the top half (i.e., industries with the best average Zacks Rank) and the bottom half (the industries with the worst average Zacks Rank).Over the last 10 years, using a one week rebalance, the top half beat the bottom half by a factor of more than two to one. (To learn more visit: About Zacks Industry Rank).The machinery industry comprises stocks that primarily deals with manufacturing and supplying farm equipments (currently such stocks collectively carry Zacks Industry Rank of 19), construction and mining equipment (ranked 19), industrial electronics (ranked 96), electrical products (ranked 117), thermal products (ranked 53), material handling products (ranked 53), printing equipment for industrial use (ranked 117) and industrial tools and equipment, and providing related services are collectively ranked 117.Going by the Zacks rule, we see that machinery sub-industries fall in the top half. These sub-industries can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the machinery industry.Performance and Earnings Trend of the SectorPer the Earnings Preview dated Aug 4, the earnings season has unfolded well. As of that date, roughly 420 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the April-June quarter, with 74.3% beating earnings estimates and 68.3% surpassing revenue projections.Of Industrial Products stocks, roughly 91.7% reported results til Aug 4. Earnings beat recorded as of that date was 68.2% while revenue beat was 54.5%.In the quarter, the market is anticipated to perform well, witnessing earnings and sales growth of 10% and 5.1%, respectively over the year-ago quarter. Seeing the results so far and the favorable operating conditions, we believe that the overall performance of the Industrial Products sector will be encouraging.   ConclusionThe IMF anticipates the world economy to grow 3.5% in 2017. It expects 2% rise in advanced economies and 4.6% growth in emerging nations. Global output is projected to increase 3.6% in 2018, including 1.9% growth for advanced nations and 4.8% improvement for emerging countries.We believe that policies encouraging better trade relations, increase in infrastructural investments, job creation and high consumer-end demand might accelerate growth in the U.S. economy. This, in turn, will prove beneficial for industrial machinery stocks. It will be interesting to watch the activities of companies, with at least $20 billion market capitalization, including Caterpillar, Inc., ABB Ltd. (ABB  -  Free Report), Illinois Tool Works Inc (ITW  -  Free Report), Parker-Hannifin Corp. (PH  -  Free Report), Ingersoll-Rand PLC (IR  -  Free Report) and Rockwell Automation.In the S&P 500 group, a major machinery company is Caterpillar. It has a market capitalization of $67.58 billion and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). In the next three to five years, the company’s earnings are predicted to grow 9.50%.Earnings of Deere & Company are predicted to grow 9.17%. It currently has $41.50 billion market capitalization and Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s long-term growth prospects seem bright on the back of increasing population, rising living standards, investments in new products and expansion in unexplored geographies.

2421,ETN,"Eaton Corporation plc’s (ETN  -  Free Report) second-quarter 2017 operating earnings per share of $1.15 lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.16 by a penny.The reported earnings were at the upper end of the management’s guidance range of $1.05–$1.15 per share. The bottom line was up 7.5% from the year-ago quarter level.RevenuesIn the quarter under review, Eaton’s total revenue came in at $5.13 billion, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.14 billion by 0.2%. Total revenue was 1% higher than the year-ago level.The year-over-year sales increase consists of 2% growth in organic sales, partially offset by 1% decline from negative currency translations.Total revenue improved primarily due to a higher contribution from Electric Products, Vehicle and Hydraulics segments, offset marginally by lower contribution from Aerospace, and Electrical Systems and Services segments. Eaton Corporation, PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Eaton Corporation, PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Eaton Corporation, PLC Quote Quarterly HighlightsCost of products sold in the reported quarter was $3,450 million, up 0.9% from the prior-year period.Selling and administrative expenses increased 0.6% to $902 million from $897 million a year ago.In the second quarter of 2017, the company’s research and development expenses were $150 million, up 0.7% from $149 million in the prior-year quarter.Interest expenses of $60 million were up 5.3% from the prior-year quarter figure.Financial UpdateEaton’s cash and short-term investments were $312 million as of Jun 30, 2017 compared with $543 million as of Dec 31, 2016.As of Jun 30, 2017, long-term debt was $6,264 million compared with $6,711 million as of Dec 31, 2016.GuidanceThird-quarter 2017 earnings per share are expected to be between $1.20 and $1.30.The company narrowed the lower and upper end of its earnings guidance for 2017 by 5%. Post revision new expectation for 2017 will be $4.50–$4.70 per share, down from the prior guidance of $4.55–$4.75 per share.A Peer ReleaseABB Ltd (ABB  -  Free Report) reported second-quarter 2017 earnings of 30 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 29 cents by 3.4%.Upcoming ReleasesSPX FLOW Inc. (FLOW  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter earnings on Aug 2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 34 cents.CUI Global Inc. (CUI  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 earnings on Aug 9. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at a loss of 12 cents.Our ViewEaton failed to beat second-quarter earnings and total revenue estimates, but has continued to increase shareholders value through share buybacks.Organic revenue growth is expected in the range of 15.5–16.1% in 2017, primarily due to improvements in the end markets of Eaton.We believe growth in orders from most of Eaton’s operating segments and benefits from restructuring activities will drive its performance in the coming quarters.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?                                     Here's another stock idea to consider.

2422,ETN,"This week, I'm going to focus on one of my favorite valuation metrics for determining a company's under or overvaluation.  
"
2423,ETN,"Let's first start with a definition.  
"
2424,ETN,"The Price to Sales ratio is simply: Price divided Sales
"
2425,ETN,"If the Price to Sales ratio is 1, then that means you're paying $1 for every $1 of sales the company makes.  
"
2426,ETN,"A price to sales ratio of 2 means you're paying $2 for every $1 of sales the company makes.  
"
2427,ETN,"As you might have guessed, the lower the Price the Sales ratio, the better.  
"
2428,ETN,"A price to Sales ratio of .5 means you're paying 50 cents for every $1 of sales the company makes.
"
2429,ETN,"And paying less than a dollar for a dollar's worth of something is a good bargain.  
"
2430,ETN,"One of the reasons I like the Price to Sales ratio is because it looks at sales rather than earnings like the P/E ratio does.  
"
2431,ETN,"And sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement than earnings.  
"
2432,ETN,"Secondly, I'd be hard pressed to find a screen where adding the Price to Sales ratio didn't improve it.  
"
2433,ETN,"For me, I prefer to look for stocks with a Price to Sales ratio under 1. Although, I'm willing to go up to 4, depending on the industry. But I've found that the best way to use it is to find stocks with a Price to Sales ratio below the median for its Industry.  
"
2434,ETN,"And that's what we'll be focusing on in this week's screen.  
"
2435,ETN,"Let's first start with: Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2
"
2436,ETN,"(Only stocks with a Zacks Rank of a Strong Buy or Buy get through.) Projected Growth Rate greater than or equal to Projected Growth Rate for the S&P
"
2437,ETN,"(Above market growth rates.) Last Earnings Surprise greater than 0
"
2438,ETN,"(Positive EPS Surprise) Last Sales Surprise greater than 0
"
2439,ETN,"(Positive Sales Surprise) Price to Sales less than or equal to Median Price to Sales for its Industry
"
2440,ETN,"(Valuations that are lower than their Industry.)Price greater than or equal to $5Avg. 20 Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000

2444,ETN,"Industrial products stocks have been strong performers since the beginning of second-quarter 2017 with the industry gaining roughly 5.80%, outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 3.09%. We believe that the outperformance was driven by growth-friendly policies of the government and expectation of increased infrastructure spending.In addition, several economic indicators point toward healthy operating conditions in the industry. For example, Industrial production – a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country – grew at an annual rate of 4.7% in the second quarter, driven by impressive growth in mining and utilities. Also, new orders for U.S.-manufactured machinery increased 4.6% in the first five months of 2017, primarily for the construction, mining and oil and gas field machinery.Per the Earnings Preview dated Jul 21, the earnings season is unfolding well. As of that date, roughly 97 of S&P 500 companies reported results for the April-June quarter, with 78.4% beating earnings estimates and 72.2% surpassing revenue projections.In the quarter, the market is anticipated to perform well, witnessing earnings and sales growth of 8.6% and 4.7%, respectively over the year-ago quarter. Industrial products stocks, accounting for 2% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization, are likely to see earnings growth of 14.2% and sales growth of 12.9%.   Guide to Selecting the Right StocksStocks with high investment rankings can be of interest to investors seeking exposure in the industrial products industry. But it is advisable to choose stocks that have the combination of a favorable Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP (the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate). The combination of the dual factors indicates high probability of stocks surprising estimates in the quarter.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Below we have listed five industrial products stocks, with the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in the second quarter:AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report): The company, with a $5.7 billion market capitalization, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of agricultural equipment and related replacement parts.The company, with a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.89%, seems a suitable pick for investors seeking exposure in this industry.

"
2445,ETN,"Tuesday's surge certainly entertains the idea that the pullback is indeed over. The trend of economic fundamentals support the bullishness, with strong data in manufacturing, jobs, housing, banking, and consumer spending and confidence.
"
2446,ETN,"And the earnings report cards so far have been encouraging, confirming some degree of first quarter strength in stock prices. But we've heard from barely 100 companies in the S&P 500, so the corporate profits jury is still out, especially as earnings may have grown only 1%, or less, in the first quarter.
"
2447,ETN,"It's quite possible that the market has gotten ahead of earnings that will get more momentum in the second half. We have yet to hear from enough multinational companies about the impacts they see on their businesses this year from Europe and China. In this regard, I look forward to reports and guidance from IBM (IBM  -  Free Report), Eaton (ETN  -  Free Report), and Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report).
"
2448,ETN,"So while the market has been easily able to shake off Euro-debt worries that resurfaced when Spain's borrowing costs topped 6% again, and China's slow-down looks smooth and soft, I don't think the pullback is over for two reasons:
"
2449,ETN,"1) Institutional investors want to see earnings and hear guidance from more companies over the next 2 weeks before they can confirm that a real profits slow-down isn't about to unfold as S&P 500 full year estimates have slipped from $110 to below $103 in the past six months. Many are also busy revising their GDP forecasts upwards above 2.5%, and they await April 27 for the first look at 1Q growth to see if they got it right.
"
2450,ETN,"2) Technical price damage to indexes and sectors needs to be worked through so that the weak hands are flushed out and the strong bulls can put a stake in the ground at new value levels for the next leg higher. This sideways consolidation trade is actually very good for the long-term health of this bull market. 
"
2451,ETN,"Let's go to the chart and see what we are up against and where the big opportunities will be...
"
2452,ETN,"Having found some support below S&P 1,370, a key level all by itself, today's surge would be very encouraging to mark a close above 1,390, the site of repeated support in March. The importance of 1,370 lies in the fact it was roughly the top in 2011 and the 50-day moving average just recently conquered 1,370-75 in the past week.
"
2453,ETN,"1,350, though not marked on the chart, is also a key level for me because it was the main pivot where prices spent a lot of time in the head and shoulders top of 2011. So the fact that the market found plenty of buyers without even touching 1,350 is significant.
"
2454,ETN,"But it's also a function of the fact that many money managers got left behind when the bull train left the station at 1,300. And it doesn't mean we can't test 1,350 more meaningfully. In fact, I was surprised we cut through it so quickly in February. To test it further would be very constructive for this bull market.
"
2455,ETN,"And the March lows at 1,340 would be nice to see hold when doing so. But if 1,340 falls, it means fear has accelerated about earnings and the economy. ""Did the market get way ahead of the fundamentals? Oh no! Sell everything!""
"
2456,ETN,"This will be a buying opportunity if it happens. I would have a shopping list of strong stocks to buy at 1,340 and 1,320, and even 1,300 if we get that lucky. On December 20th, I proposed that we were getting our last look at S&P 1,250 for a long time. I'm sticking with that prediction.
"
2457,ETN,"How Healthy and Strong is the Bull?
"
2458,ETN,"Some strategists think the recovery is fueled primarily by the Fed's easy money policy and that the leveling off in the earnings picture means we are due for a much more severe correction. I disagree. The economy has gained its own footing and is still poised for upside surprises. The menace of deflation must be soundly beaten before you can worry about inflation in a mature and complex economy like the US.
"
2459,ETN,"We've come a long way in this economic recovery and bull market. And it's not over. But just as markets rush to price in extremes to the downside, they also do so up top, especially as investors get left behind. So this consolidation phase after a 30% run off the last bottom is very healthy indeed for the bull's strength.
"
2460,ETN,"The bull is well alive indeed. So be ready to buy the next steep pullback when it comes. Plan to scale into it at the levels I've talked about. And if it doesn't come and we overtake S&P 1,400 again before May, then look to buy inevitable tests back to 1,375-90.
"
2461,ETN,"If the global economy can handle the debt crises and deleveraging of the past five years, which incidentally have not derailed the emerging markets bulls, we should see S&P 1,500 this year.

"
2495,ETN,"• Bottom Up estimates: $58.79 for 2009, $77.45 for 2010, $92.81 for 2011
"
2496,ETN,"• Top Down estimates: $57.45 for 2009, $76.05 for 2010, $88.22 for 2011We now focus our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together.  In addition, we are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. We use the convention of referring to the next full fiscal year to be completed as 2010, even though not all firms are on December fiscal years. This can cause discontinuities in the data, particularly around this time of year. The data is based on FY1, not based on 2010, even though I may call it 2010 in the report.Finally last week, the market took notice of just how strong this earnings season has been. With 96.6%, or 483) of the S&P 500 reports in, the year-over-year earnings growth has simply been fabulous at 106.6%. However, much of that growth is due to a single firm and its massive year-ago losses.By any normal standard, AIG's (AIG) losses were enormous this year as well, but last year was not a normal standard. It is not like the $7.2 billion AIG lost in this year’s fourth quarter is chicken feed, but it is a huge improvement on the $37.9 billion it lost a year ago.AIG was, of course, not alone among the financials in reporting epic losses a year ago, but if losses are epic poems, then AIG last year was the Iliad and the Odyssey rolled into one. If just AIG is excluded, the growth rate drops to 45.2%, and if all the financials are excluded, the growth rate is just 14.2%. Still, firms with positive EPS growth outnumber those with falling EPS by a ratio of 1.78:1 and 64.0% of all firms reported positive EPS growth.Expectations Were Good & Earnings Still BeatEven set against the expectations coming into earnings season it has been an extremely good one. For every two earnings disappointments there have been almost nine positive surprises. In all, 73.9% of all firms reporting have come in with better-than-expected earnings. Half of all the surprises (including the disappointments) have been more than 5.38%.Even on the top line, things are coming in both better than last year and better than expected. Total revenues are 5.86% higher than a year ago among the 483 S&P 500 firms that have already reported, and positive revenue surprises are beating revenue disappointments by a margin of 2.34:1. Put another way 66.9% of all firms have reported better than expected revenues. Overall, 56.5% of all firms have reported higher revenues than a year ago. In the third quarter, that figure was below 30%.While the dramatic growth in earnings is largely due to turnarounds in a handful of very large firms moving from big losses a year ago to profits this year, that is not the full story. Most of those big turnarounds were in the Financial sector. The Financial companies that have reported so far have earned $8.56 billion this year, while those same firms lost a total of $55.34 billion a year ago.The Financials have also been the key driver behind revenue growth for the quarter, as a year ago we had the unusual situation where some of them were reporting negative revenues. If the Financials are excluded, the year-over-year revenue growth falls to 2.12%.With or without the Financials, Earnings growth is dramatically higher than revenue growth, which means we are seeing a huge increase in net margins. That margin expansion is expected to continue, not only in 2010 but into 2011 as well. Earlier in 2009, margins were plunging. For the year as a whole, the decline in revenues is almost identical to the decline in net income.Looking Toward the 1st QuarterTurning our attention to the first quarter expectations, total earnings are expected to rise by 21.8%, which sounds like a big slowdown from the 106% rate in the 4Q. However, if the Financials are excluded, we actually see an acceleration in year-over-year earnings growth to 23.6%.Autos and Construction both lost money in last year’s first quarter and are expected to be profitable this year, which means their percentage growth rates are not meaningful. Replacing the outsized gains from Finance will be extremely strong year-over-year growth from Materials, Tech, Industrials and Energy, all of which are expected to post year-over-year growth in excess of 40%.Looking at full-year earnings, total net income is expected to be lower than that of 2008, but just by 10.2%, a much smaller decline than the 23.0% plunge in 2008 (Financials are the big swing factor). This year will be one of earnings recovery, with growth of 31.2% expected, but note that that would still leave earnings below 2007 levels. Further growth of 20.0% is expected for total earnings in 2011. As for the top line, after a 7.3% plunge in 2009, revenues are expected to grow by 3.3% in 2010, followed by 6.6% growth in 2011.In 2010, the percentage growth numbers will be not really meaningful for the Auto and Construction sectors. While the 2009 numbers will be positive, they are so close to break-even that big percentage gains in 2010 are not to really be taken seriously. Among the larger sectors,  Materials and the Financials are expected to be the growth leaders for the year. Energy is also expected to see a large rebound in its total profits.The revisions ratios for both 2010 and 2011 are strong, and should give us confidence that those growth rates will actually be achieved, if not exceeded. Every sector but Utilities and Transportation has seen more estimates raised for 2010 than cut, and the revisions ratio for 2010 stands at an extremely strong 1.58 (although it has been slipping a bit in recent weeks). For 2011, the revisions ratio is at 1.66.The ratio of firms with rising mean estimates is also well above one for both years, but at 1.34 and 1.24 quite a bit loser than the revisions ratios. In other words, the positive earnings revisions are concentrated among relatively few firms.The earnings yields on the S&P 500 continue to look very attractive relative to the 10-year bond yield. A P/E ratio of 14.5x based on 2010 earnings translates into an earnings yield of 6.90%, and based on 2011 earnings the S&P has a P/E ratio of 12.1x, or an earnings yield of 8.26%. That is comfortably above 2x the yield on the 10-year T-note of 3.69%. Stocks look very attractive, at least relative to bonds.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

2502,ETN,"•    Year-over-year Earnings Growth Ratio (# Positive Growth/# Negative Growth) at 1.78, a big improvement over recent quarters. 64.0% report positive growthIn evaluating the data presented here, keep the percentage reported in mind. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.With 96.6% of the reports in, this has been a very strong earnings season. Yes, we had easy comps from a year ago, but 106.6% year-over-year growth is nothing to sneeze at. While most of that eye- popping growth is due to a handful of firms, mostly in the financials, even if the financials are excluded earnings growth is still 14.2%.A majority of firms are reporting higher earnings than a year ago. Earnings are coming in much better than expected, with 74.2% of all firms reporting coming in with better-than-expected earnings, only 16.4% disappointing.While all sectors have seen more positive surprises than disappointments, Tech has put on an absolutely stunning performance. With 98.6% of its results in, there have been 63 positive surprises and just a single disappointment. Autos have far fewer firms, but with all of its results in, it has a perfect record, and a stunning 82.15% median surprise.Conglomerates also has a perfect record of 8 and 0. Retail Business Service and Discretionary have hugely positive surprise ratios (10 or more). Disappointments are concentrated in the Financials, as the sector is responsible for 29.5% of all firms falling short of expectations.Scorecard & Earnings SurpriseIncome Surprises Yr/Yr

Excluding Financials, total revenues are up just 2.12%. However, nine of the sectors have reported higher revenues than a year ago.In distinct contrast to the third quarter, when less than one third of all firms reported rising year-over-year sales, this quarter rising revenue firms out number decliners by 1.29:1. The fact that earnings have risen far more than have revenues means that we are seeing an explosion in net margins (or more precisely we are recovering from the collapse in net margins a year ago).Sales SurprisesSales Surprises Yr/Yr

However, if one strips out the Financials the growth rate actually shows a big acceleration to 23.6% from 14.5%.Autos and Construction will be doing the negative to positive thing again, so the percentage gains really are not meaningful for those sectors. Among the sectors that actually earned money in last year’s first quarter, growth will be led by the Materials sector where earnings are expected to more than double.However the biggest impact on total earnings will come from the Tech sector (it is much bigger than materials) where earnings are expected to soar 55.1% over year-ago levels. Industrials, Energy and Transport will also show very strong earnings gains.• The bulk of the earnings growth for the S&P 500 as a whole has come from the Financial sector where the firms that have reported collectively lost $55.53 billion a year ago, but have earned $8.56 billion this year
"

2616,ETN,"The Table below shows the S&P 500 firms with the biggest increases in their FY1 (mostly 2010) mean estimate over the last 4 weeks. To qualify, the current mean estimate has to be greater than $0.50 and there must be more than 3 estimates for FY1. In addition to the change in the mean estimate, the net percentage of estimates being raised is shown for both FY1 and FY2, as well as the P/E ratios based on each year’s earnings.
"
2617,ETN,"Note that estimate momentum and value are not mutually exclusive, and that seven of the firms with the biggest positive estimate momentum have single digit P/Es based on FY2 earnings. The most interesting of these firms will be where the net revisions percentage (#up-#dn/Tot) is more than 0.50 but less than 1.00.Big mean estimate changes based on a handful of individual revisions are suspect. On the other hand, if all the analysts have raised their estimates already, the mean estimate is less likely to rise again over the next month.Biggest FY1 RevisionsCompany Ticker %Ch Curr Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks %Ch Next Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks # Up-Dn/Tot Curr Fiscal Est Yr - 4 wks # Up-Dn/Tot Next Fiscal Yr Est - 4 wks P/E using Curr FY Est P/E using Next FY Est Harman Intl IndHAR193.92%31.64%1149.4621.91Nvidia CorpNVDA52.31%47.88%0.690.4318.2816.31Broadcom Corp-ABRCM35.11%13.98%0.730.3923.8720.42Cliffs NaturalCLF33.29%22.60%0.690.513.319.86Tyson Foods ATSN32.89%26.07%0.85112.5811.92Sandisk CorpSNDK29.01%41.60%0.80.7113.8312.19Deere & CoDE26.65%13.26%0.960.8118.6914.73Wynn Resrts LtdWYNN20.80%0.15%0.12-0.3689.7661.11Analog DevicesADI17.24%10.26%0.910.7614.9313.74Agilent TechA15.61%12.82%10.719.6917.01Novellus SysNVLS15.52%17.39%0.750.313.1910.08Starwood HotelsHOT14.14%17.35%0.890.4463.540.81Salesforce.ComCRM13.26%18.73%-0.060.1678.1855.09Whole Foods MktWFMI12.88%14.20%10.8229.0525.71Sears Hldg CpSHLD12.88%-7.17%0.630.1438.3834.27Newmont MiningNEM12.22%20.70%0.390.2515.2514.21Chesapeake EngyCHK12.18%8.44%0.570.399.068.85Hasbro IncHAS11.98%6.07%0.690.6415.6712.61Autodesk IncADSK11.48%2.81%0.730.434.6125.4Appld Matls IncAMAT11.19%10.15%0.480.4117.7611Sara LeeSLE11.11%6.85%10.8213.1712.58Southwest AirLUV10.97%0.75%0.140.124.7218.78Rowan Cos IncRDC10.94%6.48%0.630.3212.0614.29Macys IncM10.61%10.76%0.880.212.6311.01Data in this report, unless stated otherwise, is through the close on Thursday 3/4/2010.Dirk van Dijk, CFA is the Chief Equity Strategist for Zacks.com.

"
2630,ETN,"•    Top Down estimates: $54.38 for 2009, $70.05 for 2010Welcome to the new Earnings Trends. We have decided to start focusing our analysis of the S&P 500 based on Zacks' own sector groupings rather than the S&P GICS sectors. There are 16 Zacks sectors and only 10 GICS sectors, so the new groupings will result in better granularity of the data. The old way simply grouped too many very different companies together. In addition, we for the first time are presenting top-line as well as bottom-line expectations and surprise information. This is very much a work in progress, and we will be adding additional information, tables and perhaps even some graphs over the next few months.
"
2631,ETN,"It’s almost time to close the books on a fantastic earnings season. With over 90% of reports in, there have been 353 which have exceeded expectations while only 66 have fallen short, a ratio of 5.35. While it is true that most companies will normally try to under-promise and over-deliver, this quarter the beats are beating the misses by about twice the normal margin of 3:1.
"
2632,ETN,"Nor have all the surprises only been by a penny or two, but there have been lots of companies that simply crushed the earnings estimates.  The median surprise is a very high 7.11%. Over the last five years, a median surprise of about 3.0% has been normal.
"
2633,ETN,"Part of the reason is that expectations were set very low going into the earnings season. For most companies, their earnings are still below year-ago levels, just not as far down as people thought they would be. Only 202 firms have posted positive year-over-year growth versus 259 which have fallen short of year-ago levels -- a ratio of 0.78.
"
2634,ETN,"The disparity between firms beating estimates but having negative year-over-year earnings growth is particularly noticeable in Tech, where the earnings surprise ratio is an awesome 8.50. However, the growth ratio (# of firms with positive growth/# of firms with negative growth) is just 0.60. Energy’s surprise ratio is not quite as high, at 3.38, but the disparity to its growth ratio, at just 0.05, is extreme. Staples and Medical have been both growing earnings and beating expectations.
"
2635,ETN,"On the top line, it has also been a successful season so far relative to expectations, but in terms of actual year-over-year growth it has been downright ugly. The total revenues of the 462 firms that have already reported are 11.2% below year-ago levels. A total of 253 firms have reported higher than expected revenues, versus 182 that have disappointed, for a ratio of 1.39. On the other hand, only 135 actually had higher sales than a year ago, versus 326 with lower revenues, a ratio of 0.41. Put another way, only 29.2% of all firms reporting so far have had higher sales than a year ago.
"
2636,ETN,"In other words, cost-cutting has been the major force driving earnings, and earnings surprise. However, the costs to one company are either the revenues of another company, or someone’s paycheck, which is then spent to create revenues for firms. The bottom-up data coming out of all these individual firms seems to confirm what we have been getting from the macro statistics from the government. The economy is growing due to increases in productivity: higher GDP with fewer workers.
"
2637,ETN,"However, the strategy seems to be working as earnings are coming in much better than expected, and analysts have responded by increasing earnings estimates for 2009. The estimate increases are widespread across sectors, with five sectors seeing more than five increases for each cut. No sector is seeing more cuts than increases. For the S&P 500 as a whole the revisions ratio now stands at 3.25, its highest level in a long time and in distinct contrast to earlier in the year when it fell below 0.15 at one point.  The better than expected earnings are translating into estimate increases for 2010 as well as 2009, with a revisions ratio of 2.09 for next year.Scorecard & Earnings Surprise

"
2647,ETN,"In evaluating the data presented here, keep the % reported in mind, for some sectors the sample size is extremely small. The move to the 16 Zacks sectors means that even when all reports are in, some of the sectors will still have relatively few firms in them. For firms with only a few reports in, the median surprise will be very volatile as new firms are added to the sample.
"
2648,ETN,"Overall, two small sectors, Conglomerates and Business Services, appear to have the most impressive performance so far this quarter on the surprise front. Among the larger sectors, strong arguments could be made for Staples having the best surprise profile, although Industrials are also in contention.  Scorecard & Earnings Surprise Income Surprises Yr/YrGrowth %Reported SurpriseMedian EPSSurpPos EPSSurpNeg #GrowPos #GrowNegConsumer Staples 1.03% 84.09% 10.87 34 3 25 12Consumer Discretionary -14.07% 100.00% 12.10 22 5 8 22Retail/Wholesale 2.54% 75.56% 5.41 27 5 19 15Medical 3.32% 93.18% 6.09 35 1 32 9Auto -16.45% 100.00% 1.54 3 2 2 4Basic Materials -47.72% 100.00% 6.73 14 4 4 16Industrial Products -25.90% 90.91% 13.92 19 1 9 11Construction 66.67% 81.82% 28.57 6 2 4 5Conglomerates -21.64% 100.00% 16.41 8 0 1 8Computer and Tech -10.93% 87.95% 7.69 51 6 27 45Aerospace -59.63% 100.00% 6.74 8 2 4 6Oils and Energy -62.76% 97.56% 5.20 29 9 2 38Finance 416.90% 100.00% 5.41 56 16 39 39Utilities 5.56% 100.00% 5.63 27 8 23 14Transportation -36.21% 100.00% 3.09 7 2 1 9Business Service 6.73% 88.89% 11.80 7 0 2 6S&P -11.42% 92.40% 7.11 353 66 202 259Sales Surprises

"
2703,ETN,"Eaton Corp (ETN  -  Free Report) is your stereotypical cyclical stock. In good economic times, the company does great. In bad times, however, the company does awful.
"
2704,ETN,"In 2007, for instance, when the global economy was humming along, Eaton earned $6.38 per share. In 2009, when the sky was falling, the company earned just $2.28. The global economy is looking healthy again, however, and earnings are expected to more than double in 2010.
"
2705,ETN,"Eaton Corp was added to the Growth & Income portfolio on November 11. Estimates have been shooting higher since the company reported a solid third quarter.
"
2706,ETN,"Third Quarter Results
"
2707,ETN,"Eaton reported its third quarter results on October 20. Earnings per share came in at $1.60, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 16%. It was a 32% increase over the same quarter in 2009.
"
2708,ETN,"Total sales increased 17.9% year-over-year. Sales growth was solid in nearly every business segment, but the hydraulics division was particularly strong, gaining nearly 40% over the same quarter in 2009.
"
2709,ETN,"Meanwhile, the gross margin improved from 28.1% of sales to 30.6%.
"
2710,ETN,"Outlook
"
2711,ETN,"Management expects the growth patterns experienced in its end markets this year to continue. As a result, the company raised its full year guidance and now expects to earn between $5.44 and $5.54 per share.
"
2712,ETN,"Analysts promptly raised their earnings estimates higher after the solid quarter and revised guidance, as seen in the company's Price & Consensus chart:
"
2713,ETN,"The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is $5.57, equating to a whopping 115% EPS increase over 2009. The 2011 estimate is $6.98, which represents 25% EPS growth.
"
2714,ETN,"Fundamentals
"
2715,ETN,"The stock has a dividend yield of 2.5%. It has increased its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10% since 2000.
"
2716,ETN,"Eaton is also reasonably priced, trading at 16.7x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 18.3x. Its price to book ratio of 2.2 is in-line with its peers.
"
2717,ETN,"Eaton Corp is a global diversified industrial manufacturer. It is based in Cleveland, Ohio and has a market cap of $15.7 billion.
"
2718,ETN,"Todd Bunton is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.
"
2719,ETN,"Think about the last time you stayed in a hotel. How much did you pay? How much did it actually cost the hotel to have you stay there that night?
"
2720,ETN,"Sure, it cost a lot of money to build and furnish the room, but the company has already incurred those expenses. The actual incremental costs are low. You might use some additional water and electricity - and they'll have to pay someone to clean up your mess afterward - but unless you're Charlie Sheen that shouldn't take much.
"
2721,ETN,"In other words, your stay there is almost pure profit for the hotel company. The reason: operating leverage.
"
2722,ETN,"A Small Change Can Make a Big Difference
"
2723,ETN,"Companies with high operating leverage tend to be capital-intensive businesses with a lot of fixed assets, or overhead. Fixed expenses like property, plant, and equipment generally won't fluctuate with sales volume. Thus, a modest increase in sales can mean huge growth in profits, as each additional dollar of revenue falls almost straight to the bottom line.
"
2724,ETN,"Take XYZ Corp for example. The company sells widgets that require expensive machinery inside of expensive plants to manufacture. Their variable costs are relatively low. In Year 1, the company makes $2 million in sales and has $200,000 in net income. In Year 2, demand picks up a bit and there is a modest 5% increase in sales. Operating income, however, grows by a whopping 40%.
"
2725,ETN,"In contrast, companies with variable cost structures will have low operating leverage. These tend to be labor-intensive businesses or retailers that can adjust the bulk of their expenses as demand changes. These businesses can weather economic downturns easier by cutting staff or reducing inventory, but when things turn around they will have less upside potential.
"
2726,ETN,"High Volatility
"
2727,ETN,"The profits of high-leverage companies tend to be amplified as demand fluctuates with the business cycle. Hence, their share price will be highly volatile. These companies will experience low or negative profits and a falling share price when times are bad (like in 2008-early 2009), but explosive profit growth and rapidly rising share prices when things turn around (late 2009-???).
"
2728,ETN,"As the global economic recovery gains traction, these high-leverage businesses are expected to see excellent profit growth.Eaton Corp (ETN  -  Free Report) is your typical cyclical stock. The company is an industrial conglomerate operating in capital-intensive areas like electrical components, hydraulics, aerospace, and trucking/automotive.
"
2729,ETN,"In 2009, when the global economy was suffering, the company saw a 23% drop in sales. Due to its high leverage, operating income plunged 65%. Things have been turning around for Eaton, however. For the third quarter of 2010, the company saw a healthy 18% increase in sales over the same quarter in 2009 and an impressive 70% increase in operating income.
"
2730,ETN,"Analysts have been raising estimates following the strong quarter, sending the stock to a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for 115% EPS growth in 2010 and 26% growth in 2011.
"
2731,ETN,"The stock tends to fluctuate with the business cycle, as seen in its 5-year chart:
"
2732,ETN,"The stock is up over 50% year-to-date, but valuation looks attractive. Shares trade at 16.6x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 18.3x. Its price to book ratio of 2.2 is in-line with its peers. The stock also offers a 2.5% dividend yield.
"
2733,ETN,"Honda Motor (HMC  -  Free Report) is another company with high operating leverage. The Japanese company is famous for its automobiles, but also manufactures motorcycles, ATVs, generators, and lawn mowers, among other things.
"
2734,ETN,"In fiscal year 2009, sales were down 17% while operating income fell 80%. For the second quarter of 2011, sales were up 9% while operating income grew an incredible 149%.
"
2735,ETN,"Analysts have revised their estimates much higher for 2011, sending the stock to a Zacks #2 Rank (Buy). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 calls for 311% EPS growth over 2010.
"
2736,ETN,"Shares for Honda have been slightly less volatile over the last 5 years:
"
2737,ETN,"The stock is up about 10% year-to-date, and valuation looks very attractive. Shares trade at 11.1x forward earnings, a discount to the industry average of 16.4x. Its PEG ratio is a mere 0.3.
"
2738,ETN,"CSX Corp (CSX  -  Free Report) also carries a lot of fixed assets and has relatively low variable costs. The southeastern railroad company serves as a bellwether to the overall economy.
"
2739,ETN,"The company was relatively successful in managing its costs during the downturn in 2009, but shares still plunged over 65% from May 2008 to their nadir in March 2009. In the third quarter of 2010, CSX reported a 16% increase in revenue and a stellar 39% increase in operating income. 
"
2740,ETN,"Analysts have also been raising their earnings estimates significantly higher for CSX. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for 40% EPS growth in 2010 and 17% growth in 2011. It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
2741,ETN,"Shares of CSX are near their pre-recession levels:
"
2742,ETN,"The stock is up over 20% year-to-date, but valuation is quite reasonable. The stock trades at 15.0x forward earnings, well below the peer group multiple of 19.5x. It has a PEG ratio of 1.3. The stock offers a dividend yield of 1.7%.
"
2743,ETN,"Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) is another company that will tend to struggle during economic contraction and thrive during recovery and expansion. The company makes large earth-moving equipment and recently announced it will be acquiring mining equipment maker Bucryus for $8.6 billion.
"
2744,ETN,"In 2009, CAT saw a 37% decrease in revenue and an 88% drop in operating income. Things have begun to turn around though. For the third quarter of 2010, CAT saw a 53% increase in sales and a 329% jump in operating profit.
"
2745,ETN,"Analysts have been raising their estimates significantly higher off the strong quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for 83% EPS growth in 2010 and 44% growth in 2011. It is a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stock.
"
2746,ETN,"Caterpillar's stock has also moved in tandem with the business cycle:
"
2747,ETN,"It has risen more than 40% so far this year, but valuation is still reasonable. Shares trade at 20.4x times forward earnings, a slight premium to the industry average of 18.3x. Its PEG ratio is 1.5. CAT has a dividend yield of 2.2%.
"
2748,ETN,"Proceed with Caution
"
2749,ETN,"Keep in mind that if the economic recovery stalls and we slip back into another recession, these companies will be left with high expenses and little demand for their products. That will spell trouble for their share price.
"
2750,ETN,"In other words, leverage is a two-edged sword.
"
2751,ETN,"Todd Bunton is the Growth & Income Stock Strategist for Zacks.com.
"
2752,ETN,"After making some impressive gains over the last two months from the late-August lows, the market hasn't really been doing much lately. It made a new high for the year earlier this month by moving past its late-April 2010 peak, but has since been losing ground. In a sense, the market seems to have lost its mojo of the last two months and appears to be in a drift.   
"
2753,ETN,"This may come as a surprise to many who were expecting more positive momentum following favorable conclusions to two major events earlier this month: the Fed announcement of further quantitative easing and the mid-term elections. But I am not surprised at all.   
"
2754,ETN,"My sense is that further upside from current levels over the next few months is limited. In fact, it is quite likely that in the absence of positive domestic catalysts, concerns about some of the still-lingering international issues may pull the markets lower. On balance though, I don't envision much fireworks in these waning weeks of the year. The Positives Are Known 
"
2755,ETN,"The late August turnaround in the market neatly coincided with the Fed indicating its intention to embark on another round of bond purchases. It also helped that readings for the broader economy turned to the better as the summer ended. Reports about the health of the manufacturing sector, consumer confidence, retail spending and even the labor market started sparked signs of life. Further evidence of this improvement came in the third-quarter GDP report and the October nonfarm payrolls numbers.   
"
2756,ETN,"We shouldn't forget the solid third-quarter earnings season either. Roughly 72% of companies in the S&P 500 reported better-than-expected results, with year-over-year earnings gains of around 26%. And the gains are not just restricted to the bottom-line. More than 57% of firms beat top-line expectations as well, with revenues growing a robust 8.3% from the year-earlier level.  
"
2757,ETN,"With just one more quarter to go, full-year 2010 earnings remain on track to top 42%. Current expectations are for further earnings growth of around 14% in 2011. Gains on the earnings front have been a hallmark of this recovery, which has left the corporate sector in excellent financial health.  
"
2758,ETN,"And then we got the actual Fed announcement about the size, scope and duration of the $600 billion bond-purchase program. Around the same time, the GOP made significant gains in the mid-term elections, thereby improving the odds for market-friendly regulatory and fiscal changes. But Don't Overlook the Potential Negatives 
"
2759,ETN,"The extent of regulatory and fiscal issues facing the country following the Great Recession calls for the legislative and executive branches to work as team. But that may be too much to ask. Potential partisan gridlock in Washington following the mid-term polls, long considered a net positive for the market, may not turn out to be so favorable this time around.  
"
2760,ETN,"Beyond U.S. shores, issues from abroad could potentially cloud the horizon. As recent newsflow about Ireland indicates, the European sovereign debt crisis is far from over. While unlikely to spread beyond Europe, these fears have a way of seeping into corporate and consumer psychology given the well known fiscal imbalances in the U.S. 
"
2761,ETN,"We shouldn't discount the whining by trading partners on the impact of the Fed's quantitative easing program on the dollar's exchange value. The onset of beggar-thy-neighbor policies, while not expected at this stage, will be extremely destabilizing for the fragile global economic system.  
"
2762,ETN,"And then there is the issue of potential monetary and fiscal tightening policies in key emerging markets, particularly China. Recent data indicates that inflationary trends are in the opposite direction to what the U.S. is dealing with. It is far from certain that China's growth momentum will remain in place in the face of higher domestic interest rates and tighter fiscal policies. Key Takeaways 
"
2763,ETN,"As I have mentioned here a number of times in the last few weeks, all the positives have been known and digested in the market at this stage. What the market needs to move higher from here are new catalysts. One such catalyst could be a turnaround on the payrolls front. Recent reports have been positive  the October report was very good and the weekly initial claims reports are moving in the right direction.   
"
2764,ETN,"If this trend in the labor market persists and takes hold, then there is room for significant gains in the market. Otherwise, get ready for near-term market drift. Portfolio Update 
"
2765,ETN,"We made five changes to the two portfolios last week  adding four stocks and deleting one. Of the additions, three were to the Focus List and one to the Growth & Income portfolio. The sole deletion was from the Focus List. There were changes to the Timely Buys list as well.   
"
2766,ETN,"We added the $4.7 billion electronic components distributor Avnet (AVT  -  Free Report) to reflect the company's solid earnings momentum. AVT had the fifth consecutive positive earnings surprise in its latest quarter and estimates are trending up. While the stock has made impressive gains lately, we still see upside from current levels. Lithia Motors (LAD  -  Free Report), a $350 million car dealer, is a small-cap play on the positive outlook for auto sales. In the third quarter, new car sales were up 8% and used car sales increased 20%, helping Lithia generate its third consecutive quarterly earnings surprise. Unlike many small caps, Lithia offers an attractive dividend of around 1.5%.  
"
2767,ETN,"We added the $79 billion Brazilian bank Banco Bradesco S.A. (BBD  -  Free Report) to gain exposure to this key emerging market. Brazil recently completed a smooth presidential election that promises continuation of the growth-friendly policies of the outgoing administration. Banco Bradesco is one of the largest banks in Brazil, with a solid growth profile. Eaton Corp. (ETN  -  Free Report), the $16 billion industrial operator, is a play on the global cyclical recovery story. The company had a solid earnings surprise in the third quarter, and the outlook for the coming quarters is very good with estimates on the rise.  It also pays an attractive dividend, currently yielding 2.5%.  
"
2768,ETN,"We deleted Cisco Systems (CSCO  -  Free Report), as it dropped to a Zacks #4 Rank ('sell') following its third-quarter earnings miss. Management had indicated a slowing business-spending environment that had prompted major negative estimate revisions.  
"
