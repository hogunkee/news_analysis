42,MAA,"In the recently-issued operating update for the first quarter of 2018, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report) stated that it expects total rental revenues for established communities to be up 2.3–2.4% year over year.Notably, in the prior quarter, the company had reported 2.2% growth in total revenues for established communities. Results indicated increase in average rental rates and economic occupancy. Specifically, for fourth-quarter 2017, average rental rates were up 2.1% year over year, while economic occupancy inched up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.AvalonBay has high quality assets located in some of the premium markets of the country, which enable the company to generate steady rental revenues. In fact, the company delivered the seventh consecutive year of above-sector average core funds from operations (FFO) per share growth, which is encouraging. Based on its strong fundamentals, we expect this uptrend to continue. Increasing consumer confidence on the back of job growth, rising wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for AvalonBay.However, new apartment deliveries are anticipated to remain elevated in the near term and this has emerged as a pressing concern for the residential REITs, including AvalonBay, Equity Residential (EQR  -  Free Report), Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Particularly, for AvalonBay, considering the regions, deliveries are projected to increase in both Southern California and the Pacific Northwest. Additionally, supply continues to be most noticeable in the urban submarkets. This high supply in a number of the company’s markets is likely to put pressure on rental rates. Hence, growth in its stabilized portfolio might remain modest in the upcoming period. Furthermore, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Currently, AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

43,MAA,"Residential real estate investment trust (REIT) Essex Property Trust Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report) delivered an in-line performance for fourth-quarter 2017. The company reported core funds from operations (FFO) per share of $3.01 for the quarter, meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Core FFO per share improved 7.1% from the year-ago quarter figure of $2.81.Results reflect solid growth in net operating income (NOI) and high occupancy level.Total revenues of $345.1 million in the quarter grew 4.9% year over year. However, the figure narrowly missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $346.5 million.In 2018, management expects housing demand to surpass supply in coastal markets of California and Washington. This is likely to result in growth in market rent close to long-term averages. Specifically, West Coast is anticipated to outdo the nation both in terms of rent growth as well as job growth in the year.For full-year 2017, core FFO per share came in at $11.91, 7.9% ahead of the prior-year tally of $11.04. This was backed by 5.4% year-over-year growth in total revenues to $1.4 billion.Following the earnings release on Feb 7, shares of Essex Property rallied 4.7% and closed at $227.94 on Feb 9.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Essex Property’s same-property gross revenues grew 3.0% from the prior-year quarter, while same-property net operating income (NOI) improved 3.4% year over year. Financial occupancies of 96.8% expanded 20 basis points (bps) year over year.Further, the company sold two communities for a total contract price of $160.3 million during the quarter. On the other hand, the company acquired one community for a total contract price of $59.0 million.LiquidityEssex Property exited year-end 2017 with cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $61.1 million, down from $170.3 million at the end of 2016.Notably, in January 2018, the company made an amendment to its unsecured line of credit facility, thereby enhancing the maximum amount available for borrowing from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion as well as lengthening the maturity to December 2021. As of Feb 2, 2018, the company had around $891.0 million in undrawn capacity on its unsecured credit facilities.During the fourth quarter, the company issued 33,571 shares of common stock at an average price of $261.19 through its equity distribution program for net proceeds of $8.7 million. For full year 2017, the company issued 345,444 shares of common stock at an average price of $260.38. This helped generate net proceeds of $89.1 million.OutlookEssex Property provided its guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2018. For the full year, the company projects core FFO per share in the range of $12.24- $12.64. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $12.42.The full-year 2018 projection is backed by expectations for same-property revenue growth in the band of 2.0-3.0% and same-property NOI increase in the range of 1.6-3.4%.For first-quarter 2018, the company projects core FFO per share in the $2.99-$3.09 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $3.05.ConclusionWe are encouraged with the better-than-expected performance in terms of FFO per share of Essex Property in the reported quarter but slightly disappointed with the revenue miss. With a strong property base and solid balance sheet, Essex Property is likely to leverage on favorable demographic trends in its markets. The company’s substantial exposure to the West Coast market, which is home to several innovation and technology companies, offers ample scope to boost its top line over the long term. However, elevated apartment deliveries remain a concern. Also, rate hike add to its woes.Essex Property currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

44,MAA,"Ushering in good news for CubeSmart’s (CUBE  -  Free Report) shareholders, Moody's Investors Service recently affirmed the company’s senior unsecured rating at Baa2, with a stable outlook.Per the rating agency, the move is backed by CubeSmart’s premium portfolio of self-storage properties that are concentrated in markets enjoying comparatively lower levels of supply than the national average on a historic basis.

46,MAA,"Ushering in good news for shareholders, data-center REIT CoreSite Realty Corporation (COR  -  Free Report) announced a hike of 8.9% in its quarterly cash dividend. The company will now pay a dividend of 98 cents per share for the fourth quarter, up from 90 cents paid in the prior quarter.It also marks a 22.5% increase from the dividend rate set in December 2016. The raised dividend will be paid on Jan 16, 2018, to shareholders of record as on Dec 29, 2017.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.92 a share, resulting in a yield of about 3.4%, considering CoreSite’s closing price of $115.08 on Dec 7. Moreover, the company’s dividend per share has witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 35% since 2011 through 2017. This reflects its continued efforts to boost shareholders’ wealth.Also, per the company’s CFO, Jeff Finnin, the company is “targeting the amount and timing” of its dividend hikes “to ensure dividend growth is closely aligned with performance and cash flow generation.”CoreSite has robust fundamentals to back dividend hikes. Per management, this data-center REIT has been chosen by more than 1,200 of the world’s leading enterprises, network operators, cloud providers, and supporting service providers for connecting, protecting and optimizing the firms’ performance-sensitive data, applications and computing workloads.In fact, the company has been a decent performer, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the past four trailing quarters on funds from operations (FFO) per share basis, with an average positive surprise of 3.91%.

As such, demand is outpacing supply in top-tier data-center markets, and these are absorbing new construction at a faster pace despite enjoying high occupancy. Also, data-center REITs pulled in their capital and scored well on the return book in the first 11 months of 2017, registering total returns of 30.9%.However, its valuation looks stretched when compared with the industry. CoreSite currently has a trailing 12-month price-to-FFO ratio of 26.2, which compares unfavorably with 16.2 witnessed by the industry.

Furthermore, Agree Realty’s current cash flow growth is significantly higher than the industry average.

49,MAA,"As we tread into another busy week of the current reporting cycle, a lot of activity can be noticed in the real estate investment trust (REIT) space. The Q3 earnings line-up for this week includes Digital Realty Trust, Inc. (DLR  -  Free Report), Duke Realty Corp. (DRE  -  Free Report), Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report).Improvement in the macroeconomic scenario has fueled demand amongst several asset classes in third-quarter 2017.Data-center REITs thrived amid growth in cloud computing, Internet of Things and big data, and an increasing number of companies opting for third-party IT infrastructure.As giant e-commerce chains continue to invade market share from physical retailers, greater inventory build-up and increasing focus on supply-chain efficiencies spiked demand for logistics infrastructure and warehouse facilities. This has driven the industrial real estate market’s growth during the quarter.Further, recovery in the economy and labor markets has resulted in increased manufacturing activities. This has helped warehouses and distribution centers enjoy higher occupancy and demand.    However, rising popularity of e-retail has become a key cause of concern for retail REITs. The increasing number of retailers jumping on the dot-com bandwagon is putting pressure on the top-line figure for these REITs. Subsequently, the significant drop in mall footfall has compelled a number of retailers to opt for store closures and file for bankruptcy.Residential REITs enjoyed high occupancy rates and stable rent growth in the third quarter. Let us take a look at how the following REITs are placed ahead of their quarterly releases on Oct 25.Amid escalating demand for data centers, Digital Realty’s focus on offering upgraded technology to lure clients is likely to bolster its revenue stream in the to-be-reported quarter.  In addition to this, the company is anticipated to ride on its growth curve backed by strategic acquisitions. We expect such diligent efforts to drive the company’s top line in the quarter to be reported.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $593.2 million indicates a year-over-year increase of 8.6%.Currently, the Earnings ESP for Digital Realty is -0.26%. Although the stock’s Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.

Price and EPS Surprise  Digital Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Digital Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteCommercial REIT Duke Realty has been putting in diligent efforts to lower its suburban office assets and turn the company into a leading domestic pure-play industrial REIT. Subsequently, in the second quarter, it sold its medical office building (MOB) portfolio for $2.8 billion. Part of the transactional proceeds will likely be reflected in the third quarter results.Amid an e-commerce boom, the company has made sound efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. While such streamlining efforts are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact is expected to mar the company’s quarterly results.At present, Duke Realty has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -3.93%. Though the company has a favorable Zacks Rank, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.

The company has been purchasing premium assets in key U.S. markets and carrying out joint-venture buyouts.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of $294.8 million indicates growth of around 5.6% year over year.As part of its portfolio-upgrade strategy, Kimco is aggressively disposing non-core assets. While these efforts are encouraging for the longer run, the earnings dilution led by high-disposition activity cannot be averted in the near term. Therefore, these moves are expected to hurt the company’s growth momentum in the quarter to be reported.At present, Kimco has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

50,MAA,"Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly referred as MAA, is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, after the market closes.Last quarter, the Memphis, TN-based residential real estate investment trust (REIT) delivered a positive surprise with respect to funds from operations (FFO) per share of 1.39%. The quarterly results reflected growth in same-store portfolio net operating income (NOI) and rise in average effective rent per unit for the same-store portfolio.Over the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and met estimate in another, with an average beat of around 1.03%. The graph below depicts this surprise history:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for MAA prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMAA enjoys a diverse and balanced portfolio with a presence in around 39 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). The portfolio is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets, product types and price points. Also, this apartment REIT resorts to opportunistic investments in order to maintain the right product mix and augment the number of apartment communities in vibrant markets.In the second quarter, the company’s performance is anticipated to be driven by healthy demand across its markets amid job market gains. Resident retention is likely to remain high. Moreover, MAA made concerted efforts on Post Properties merger integration, and the company is likely to experience improved operating efficiency and progress in NOI margin.However, increased level of new supply is expected to have a dampening impact on the company’s performance. In fact, new lease pricing is anticipated to remain challenged in the quarter to be reported.For the second quarter, MAA projects FFO per share in the range of $1.36–$1.46 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is currently pegged at $1.45.However, MAA’s activities during the quarter failed to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that MAA will likely beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for MAA is 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.45. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:  MAA’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we also need to have a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this quarter:Liberty Property Trust (LPT  -  Free Report), slated to release second-quarter results on Jul 25, has an Earnings ESP of +1.61% and a Zacks Rank #2.

51,MAA,"Investors have lately been unnerved by Fed-centric anxieties. However, they should look forward to an added boost from the solid fundamentals in certain asset types that REITs own and operate.REIT Fundamentals Remains Stable
"
52,MAA,"In fact, a look at the fundamentals of REITs confirms stability and strength. According to a recent study by the commercial real estate services’ firm CBRE Group Inc. (CBG), demand for U.S. commercial real estate was healthy in Q4, with a decline in vacancy rates across property types like the office, industrial and retail sectors amid steady absorption and a comparatively limited supply level.
"
53,MAA,"The CBRE Group study revealed that the vacancy rate in the office sector declined 20 basis points (bps) sequentially to 13.2% in the fourth quarter. Notably, the national office vacancy rate has not gone up in the last 23 quarters. Going forward, U.S. office expansion is expected to continue in a solid domestic job market and amid improved economic fundamentals.
"
54,MAA,"Further, the industrial market is on its lengthiest stretch of recovery with industrial availability rates also not showing a rise for 23 consecutive quarters. Last quarter saw a decline of 20 bps in industrial availability rates from the prior quarter to 9.4%.
"
55,MAA,"Industrial REITs are in fact capitalizing on an e-commerce boom and heightened urbanization. With a larger customer base, companies are opting for supply-chain consolidation. This is leading to greater demand for logistics infrastructure and efficient distribution networks, creating scope for industrial REITs.
"
56,MAA,"Apart from these, the retail availability rate fell 10 bps sequentially to 11.2%. Cheap gasoline, low interest rates and an improving labor market keep hope alive for growth in retail spending. No doubt, a rise in online retail sales remains an overhang on the retail real estate sector. But retail REITs have shown a stoic determination in the face of this e-commerce boom.
"
57,MAA,"Companies like Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report) and General Growth Properties, Inc. (GGP) keep on aiming higher customer satisfaction and a greater footfall at their malls by emphasizing omni-channel retailing, same-day delivery, and one-stop shopping, dining and entertaining options. Kimco Realty Corporation (KIM) on the other hand, is targeting a broader small-shop portfolio. These shops comprise service-based industries such as saloons and spas, personal fitness, and medical practices which enjoy frequent customer traffic and are Internet-resistant.
"
58,MAA,"Apartment demand also remained solid in the fourth quarter. According to early numbers from Axiometrics’ apartment market research, the annual effective rent growth was 4.7% in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 7 bps increase from the year-ago figure. Occupancy of 95.0% was the highest fourth-quarter rate since the end of 2000.
"
59,MAA,"Importantly, household formation is increasing but housing starts are failing to keep pace, leading to greater demand for apartments. Also, home ownership cost is on the rise in several markets. Millennials are moving out from their parents’ dwelling early and are renting their own pads. But since they are paying off student debt, getting married later and are spending a huge share of their monthly income on rents, they end up struggling for a mortgage, thus keeping demand for residential units strong.
"
60,MAA,"Moreover, economic improvement, migration for jobs and living in comparatively smaller apartments near cities is driving up demand for storage REITs.
"
61,MAA,"Opportunities in other spaces exist as well. Rate issues might have a short-term adverse impact on health care REITs for their long-term leased assets’ exposure.

(MAA  -  Free Report), commonly referred as MAA, reported fourth-quarter 2017 funds from operations (FFO) of $1.50 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48.

This was backed by 35.9% year-over-year growth in rental and other property revenues to $1.5 billion.Quarter in DetailDuring the reported quarter, combined adjusted same-store NOI increased 2.2% compared with the prior-year quarter. This reflected 1.8% growth in revenues and 1.3% rise in operating expenses.In the large market, 1.6% growth in revenues and a 1.3% increase in expenses resulted in the company’s NOI to be up 1.7%. Again, in the secondary market, a 2.6% rise in revenues and 1.1% increase in expenses led to 3.6% growth in NOI.The quarter witnessed 1.7% year-over-year increase in average effective rent per unit. Further, during the quarter, average physical occupancy for the same-store portfolio was 96.2%, reflecting an expansion of 20 basis points from the year-earlier quarter.As of Dec 31, 2017, MAA held cash and cash equivalents of nearly $10.8 million, down from $33.5 million as of Dec 31, 2016.

68,MAA,"We are in the heart of the Q4 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is buzzing with activity. In fact, there are a number of Q4 earnings releases queued for this week, of which AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), Simon Property Group, Inc. (SPG  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) and Duke Realty Corporation (DRE  -  Free Report) will release quarterly numbers on Jan 31.No doubt, the December rate hike and possibilities of further increases in rates this year have kept investors in the REIT space worried to some extent. However, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a crucial role in determining the performance of REITs, not all players in the space have equal chances to excel or fall behind.Going by numbers, per a study by the commercial real estate services’ firm — CBRE Group Inc.  — the overall U.S. office vacancy rate expanded 10 basis points (bps) to 13.0% during fourth-quarter 2017 amid an uptick in supply. Nevertheless, the national office vacancy rate still hovers near its post-recession low and vacancy continues to drop in majority of the U.S. office markets. Moreover, solid demand, recovering economy and job market, strengthening e-commerce market and healthy manufacturing environment are helping the industrial asset category to grab attention.Further, per a study by the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the U.S. apartment market reported moderate rent growth for the calendar year 2017 and seasonal pricing cuts in the fourth quarter. While U.S. apartment rents increased at a modest rate of 2.5% in 2017, effective rents for new leases edged down 0.9% during the quarter. However, national apartment occupancy came in at 95.1% at the end of the quarter, remaining stable year over year.Finally, mall traffic has been severely affected and retail landlords have consequently felt the heat due to consumers’ preferences inclining more and more toward online retail. However, retail REITs are putting in every effort to boost productivity of malls, by trying to grab attention from new and productive tenants, and disposing the non-productive ones. Retail REITs have been avoiding heavy dependence on apparel and accessories, but expanding dining options, opening movie theaters and offering recreational facilities to boost traffic. However, the upfront costs associated with such efforts are likely to limit near term margin improvement.Per our latest Earnings Preview, overall earnings for the Finance sector, of which REITs are part, are expected to be up 8.4% year over year on 2.4% higher revenues. This represents the Q4 earnings and revenue expectations for the sector as a whole — i.e. after combining the reported actual results with the still-to-come estimates.Therefore, surprises might be in store for some REITs, while others might disappoint this earnings season. So let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ fourth-quarter results.Residential REIT — AvalonBay Communities — is well poised to grow on the back of rising demand from household formation and favorable demographics. Also, increasing consumer confidence backed by job growth, higher wages and a healthier balance sheet promise bright prospects for this Arlington, VA-based REIT.In fact, the company is also likely to continue experiencing high occupancy. Although the pace of rental growth has slowed down from the prior years, it is now likely to achieve stability. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $555.2 million, denoting an expected increase of 7.1% year over year. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for funds from operations (FFO) per share in the soon-to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $2.24, indicating a 5.7% increase year over year.However, the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. Moreover, there is presence of elevated supply in quite a few of the company’s markets. In addition, there is high concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern. (Read more: AvalonBay to Post Q4 Earnings: What's in the Offing?)AvalonBay has a Zacks Rank # 3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of -0.07%. Though the Zacks Rank is favorable, the negative ESP lowers chances of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Notably, in the preceding four quarters, the company surpassed estimates on one occasion and missed in the other three, as shown in the chart below:AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  AvalonBay Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | AvalonBay Communities, Inc. QuoteIndianapolis, IN-based retail real estate investment trust (REIT) — Simon Property Group — has been undertaking various initiatives, of late, to strengthen its relationship with customers. In addition, it is focusing on omni-channel strategies to gain popularity among retailers. Further, in the fourth quarter, the company initiated various programs and events to steer mall traffic.Nevertheless, with more and more consumers shifting to online purchases, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed. This has resulted in an increasing number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. Also, retailers are reconsidering their footprint and opting for store closures. While Simon Property is making efforts to beat these retail blues through various initiatives, implementation of such measures requires a decent upfront cost. Consequently, this might impede any robust growth in the company’s profit margins in the quarter under review.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter 2017 revenues is currently pegged at $1.4 billion — indicating projected growth of around 0.5% year over year. Moreover, The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter FFO per share is currently pegged at $3.12. (Read more: Will E-Retail Boom Mar Simon Property's Q4 Earnings?)Currently, the Earnings ESP for Simon Property is -0.10%. Also, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further decreases the predictive power of ESP.Nonetheless, over the last four quarters, the company exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three occasions and missed in the other.

Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $386.3 million, denoting projected growth of 25.8% year over year.However, it should be noted that the fourth quarter is seasonally sluggish. In addition, supply of new units increased in a number of markets, including Dallas and Austin. Hence, any robust growth in its same-store portfolio is likely to remain restricted in the quarter to be reported. Also, high concession activity amid higher supply adds to its woes.As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share for the quarter is pegged at $1.48, projecting a 1.3% decrease year over year. (Read more: What to Expect From Mid-America Apartment Q4 Earnings?)Mid-America Apartment Communities carries a Zacks Rank of 3. Despite this favorable rank, the Earnings ESP of -2.31% lowers chances of an earnings beat.However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, which is depicted in the graph below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. QuoteIn recent years, Indianapolis, IN-based Duke Realty has made concerted efforts to enhance its industrial portfolio. This augurs well because the industrial-asset category has been grabbing attention as it is experiencing high demand, with the economy and job market displaying signs of recovery and the manufacturing environment remaining healthy.Moreover, to simplify the company’s business model and turn it into a leading domestic pure play industrial REIT, Duke Realty has made rigorous efforts to lower its suburban office assets. Subsequently, in May 2017, the company inked a deal to sell its medical office buildings (MOB) portfolio for a price of $2.8 billion.While such streamlining measures are a strategic fit for the long term, the near-term dilutive effect cannot be bypassed. In fact, such short-term impact will likely drag the company’s quarterly results. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $175 million, indicating a decline of 14.3% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter FFO per share of 30 cents denote a projected descend of 3.2% from a year ago.

Quarterly results reflected growth in same-store property net operating income (NOI) and rise in average effective rent per unit for same-store portfolio.The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 1.71%. The graph below depicts this surprise history: Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderPer the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking slightly and rent growth slowing down. Nevertheless, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy.MAA maintains a well-balanced portfolio with a solid presence in around 37 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $385 million, denoting projected growth of 1.6% year over year.However, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of the company. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.Furthermore, MAA’s activities during the quarter under review were inadequate to gain analysts’ confidence. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate witnessed a marginal decline over the last 30 days. It is currently pegged at $1.46, which indicates no movement on a year-over-year basis.For the quarter under review, MAA projects FFO per share in the range of $1.38-$1.48.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: MAA has an Earnings ESP of +0.78%, representing the percentage difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Zacks Rank: MAA has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which decreases the predictive power of ESP.Moreover, we caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 or #5 (Strong Sell) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are a few stocks in the REIT space that you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to report a positive surprise this time around:Amanda Hoffer Properties (AHH  -  Free Report), slated to release first-quarter results on May 1, has an Earnings ESP of +0.88% and a Zacks Rank of 3.

72,MAA,"On Jan 15, we issued an updated research report on Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly known as MAA. The company has a well-balanced portfolio and its focus on making strategic investments augur well. Further, growing demand for residential units in its footprint and balance sheet strength should keep its growth momentum alive.However, concentration of operations in certain markets is a concern for MAA. Also, competition with other players and hike in interest rates add to its woes.MAA maintains a well-balanced, diverse portfolio with presence in around 39 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), located in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. The portfolio is diversified in terms of markets, submarkets, product types and price points. This shields the company from economic downturn in any particular market, choppiness in any product-type or assets belonging to specific price points.Moreover, strong job growth in the core markets has kept demand for MAA’s portfolio alive. Over the long run, positive demographic trends, supported by the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration, as well as migration of population to the Southeast and Southwest, are likely to give a boost to apartment rental demand in its markets.The company has been experiencing strong demand for apartments since 2016 and expects a further boost in 2018. This is evident from higher occupancy and effective rent per unit. Management also noted that job growth in the company’s operating markets of Austin and Dallas for 2017 compared favorably with the national average.Driven by such initiatives, analysts are optimistic about the prospects of the company. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 funds from operations (FFO) per share going up marginally over the last 60 days. Also, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock gained 2.7% in 2017 compared with 2.5% rise for the industry.On the flip side, MAA’s operations are largely concentrated on the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. In fact, as of Dec 31, 2016, around 40% of the total portfolio of the company was located in the top five markets of Atlanta, Dallas, Austin, Charlotte and Tampa. Therefore, performance of the company has a high chance of being affected by the general economic conditions of these regions.Further, there is stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like single-family housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and new and existing home markets. This curtails the company’s power to raise rent or increase occupancy.Stocks That Warrant a LookRexford Industrial Realty (REXR  -  Free Report) has witnessed an upward earnings estimate revision of nearly 1% for 2018 in the last 60 days. Also, its shares have gained 19.8% in the past 12 months. It carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

73,MAA,"Ushering in good news for its shareholders, office REIT Boston Properties (BXP  -  Free Report) announced a 6.7% hike in the company's quarterly cash dividend rate to 80 cents per share from 75 cents paid earlier. It will pay the raised dividend for the fourth quarter on Jan 30, 2018, to shareholders on record as of Dec 29, 2017.Reflecting positive sentiments of investors, the shares inched up 1.2% during Monday’s regular trading session to $130.96.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $3.20 per share, up from the prior annual rate of $3.00 per share, leading to an annualized yield of 2.4%, considering Boston Properties' closing price on Dec 18.Solid dividend payouts remain arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors and Boston Properties remains committed toward boosting shareholders’ wealth. The company has registered a five-year annual dividend growth rate of 4.87%. Prior to this dividend hike, in December 2016, Boston Properties had announced a 15.4% hike in its quarterly dividend rate.Boston Properties also has solid fundamentals to back dividend hikes. The company concentrates on a few select high-rent, high barrier-to-entry geographic markets that usually fare better in an uncertain economy. Moreover, growth in demand for office space continues to be fueled by technology and life science businesses.The company has achieved an annual compounded revenue growth rate of 8.17% over the last five years. Given the company’s improving core operations, we anticipate this trend to continue, in the near future. In addition, the company is likely to experience solid contribution in 2018 from its non-same-property portfolio, mainly driven by development deliveries.Also, with economic improvement and recovery in the job market, we expect healthy growth in demand for office spaces. This is because, as the economy revives, business grows and therefore, corporate sectors seek expansion, renting more space to accommodate the increased workforce.Additionally, the company remains focused on maintaining strong balance sheet with conservative leverage position. It enjoys substantial liquidity of around $2.5 billion and solid access to debt markets. Also, reflecting optimal utilization of equity, the company’s ROE is 6.43%, higher than the industry average of 5.78%.However, there is growth in supply of office space in the market and this remains a concern because higher supply usually leads to lesser absorption and also curtails the landlord’s capability to demand more rents. There is also a trend of increased concessions in some of the markets.Shares of Boston Properties have outperformed the industry it belongs to in the past three months. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 9.5%, while the industry has increased 1.3% during the same time period. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Apart from Boston Properties, a number of REITs have announced dividend hikes in recent times. Notable among them are Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), Ventas, Inc. (VTR  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report).Mid-America Apartment Communities approved a 6% hike to its common dividend rate for fiscal 2018. Ventas raised the fourth-quarter 2017 dividend by 2% to 79 cents per share. Further, SL Green announced a 4.8% increase in its fourth-quarter dividend and will now pay a dividend of 81.25 cents per share.Zacks Editor-in-Chief Goes ""All In"" on This StockFull disclosure, Kevin Matras now has more of his own money in one particular stock than in any other.

74,MAA,"Investors in the REIT space need not be disappointed by the FOMC meeting outcome and rate hike moves. This is because a number of REITs like Host Hotels & Resorts (HST  -  Free Report), Piedmont Office Realty Trust (PDM  -  Free Report) and Weingarten Realty Investors (WRI  -  Free Report) have announced their special dividends, which is definitely good news for income-seeking investors.Specifically, Host Hotels & Resorts has announced a special dividend of 5 cents per share. This is in addition to the fourth-quarter cash dividend of 20 cents per share, reaching the total dividend figure for the year to 85 cents. The dividend will be paid on Jan 15, 2018, to stockholders of record on Dec 29, 2017.Also, Piedmont Office Realty Trust’s board of directors recently announced a special cash dividend of 50 cents per common share, giving investors another reason to rejoice. The special dividend distribution was primarily due to taxable gains that the company realized on asset dispositions of around $396 million in 2017. This dividend will be paid on Jan 9, 2018, to shareholders of record on Dec 26, 2017.Usually, special dividends are paid by REITs on capital gains from the sale of assets to avoid paying taxes. Solid dividend payouts remain the biggest attraction for REIT investors as the U.S. law requires these companies to distribute 90% of the annual taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders.The other REIT — Weingarten Realty Investors — announced a special cash dividend of 75 cents per share, which is payable on Dec 29, 2017, to shareholders of record as of Dec 26, 2017. According to the company, this dividend will consist mainly of gains on property dispositions.Earlier, Duke Realty (DRE  -  Free Report) had announced a special cash dividend of 85 cents per share. This primarily resulted from the sale of around $2.85 billion of assets through Sep 30, 2017. This dividend was paid on Dec 12, 2017, to shareholders of record on Dec 1.Moreover, bringing in more good news for investors, particularly the income seeking ones, recently a number of REITs announced their dividend hikes. Among them are Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) and SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG  -  Free Report), which announced 6% and 4.8% hikes in dividend payouts, respectively.Currently, Host Hotels & Resorts, Piedmont Office Realty Trust, Weingarten Realty Investors and Duke Realty carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

75,MAA,"If solid job growth in recent months indicates more household formations and raises expectations for a robust revival of the apartment market fundamentals, then we should perhaps think twice.This is because the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — states that the national apartment market indeed moderated in first-quarter 2018, with occupancy shrinking and rent growth slowing down. And there seems to be no respite from this choppy environment any time soon, with aggressive deliveries anticipated to continue through early next year too.Of course, the first quarter marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of households and limits growth in demand. However, a whole lot of new supply is the ultimate culprit, fueling competition and curbing landlords’ pricing power.Going by statistics, the annual rent growth pace shrunk to 2.3% in Q1. This not only marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017 but, in fact, denoted the slowest growth since third-quarter 2010. Notably, the market had achieved an annual price increase of 5.3% in the third quarter of 2015, which represented this economic cycle’s highest rent growth.Also, occupancy level of 94.5% this March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%, with metros having subdued construction activity faring well and recording the strongest occupancy. Although the overall occupancy level is still healthy, the deceleration suggests that a competitive leasing environment is fast building up, and any robust upturn in occupancy seems elusive in the near term.This is quite obvious when so much of new supply is likely to come on course. According to the RealPage report, during the last half of 2017, across the nation’s 150 largest metros “annual pace of completions” climbed above the 300,000-unit level. Further, through early 2019, “scheduled new supply” will keep adding on to the flow at about the same annual pace.Admittedly, the performance of residential REITs in recent quarters has been affected by elevated supply of new units in the market. The anticipation of continued stress in the environment might impact landlords’ ability to command higher rents and fill up vacant spaces. So, pressure on new lease rates, occupancy as well as retention would persist, while concession activity to lure renters is expected to remain high.Now it’s time for investors to consider portfolio reshuffling and discard some stocks from the said sector, which are unlikely to bounce back in the near term. Among these are:AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB  -  Free Report), a residential REIT, which owned or held direct or indirect ownership stake in 288 apartment communities as of Dec 31, 2017. The company’s shares have underperformed its industry, in the past three months. During this time period, shares of the company have lost 4.8%, whereas the industry incurred a 2.8% loss. Additionally, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 funds from operations (FFO) per share being revised 1.3% and 1.6% downward in two months’ time, reflecting bearish analyst sentiment.Apartment Investment & Management Co. (AIV  -  Free Report), better known as Aimco, has ownership stakes in 182 communities across 22 states and the District of Columbia. The company’s shares have declined 3.8% and underperformed the industry it belongs to, in three months’ time. Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 and 2019 FFO per share have both been revised 0.8% downward in a month’s time.Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report) — commonly referred as MAA — enjoyed ownership stake in 100,489 apartment units as of Dec 31, 2017. The company’s shares have underperformed the industry it belongs to over the past three months, with a 4.1% decline. Moreover, the stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both 2018 and 2019 FFO per share being revised 0.8% downward in the last month.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

76,MAA,"Retail REIT Realty Income Corporation (O  -  Free Report) recently announced a hike in its common stock monthly cash dividend, giving shareholders another reason to rejoice. This marks the company’s 94th dividend increase since its NYSE listing in 1994. The company will now pay 21.25 cents per share against 21.20 cents paid earlier.Realty Income will pay the increased dividend on Jan 12, 2018, to shareholders of record as of Jan 2, 2018. The latest dividend rate depicts an annualized amount of $2.55 per share versus the prior rate of $2.544 per share.Realty Income remains committed to increasing shareholders’ wealth. The company enjoys a trademark on the phrase “The Monthly Dividend Company” and the January 2018 dividend payment not only marks its 570 consecutive monthly dividend payouts throughout its 48-year operating history, but also 81 consecutive quarterly increases.In fact, the company has generated a compound average annual dividend growth of around 4.6% since its listing on the NYSE. Given its financial position and lower debt-to-equity ratio compared to that of the industry, this dividend rate is likely to be sustainable.Realty Income’s portfolio comprised 5,062 properties, situated in 49 states and Puerto Rico as of Sep 30, 2017, containing more than 86.4 million leasable square feet of space. These properties are leased to 251 different commercial tenants, belonging to 47 separate industries. The company leases its properties under long-term, net lease agreements.Notably, shrinking footfall at malls amid shift of consumers toward online channels, store closures and bankruptcy of retailers has emerged as a pressing concern, of late, for most retail REITs. However, not all are equally facing the brunt, with some of these companies managing to book gains even in the tepid scenario, thanks to the business models.In fact, this freestanding retail REIT — Realty Income — derives more than 90% of its annualized retail rental revenues from tenants belonging to service, non-discretionary and low-price retail business. Such businesses are less susceptible to economic recessions and competition from Internet retailing.In addition to the above, Realty Income’s solid underlying real estate quality and prudent underwriting at acquisition have helped the company maintain high occupancy levels consistently. In fact, since 1996, the company’s occupancy level has never been below 96%. Additionally, its same-store rent growth displayed limited operational volatility.The company also continues to maintain a conservative capital structure. It has modest leverage, robust liquidity, and continued access to attractively priced equity and debt capital. In addition, it has a well-laddered debt maturity schedule.However, Realty Income’s substantial exposure to single-tenant assets raises its risks associated with tenant default. Further, generation of notable rental revenues from assets leased to drug stores and rate hike add to its woes.Shares of Realty Income have underperformed the industry it belongs to, in a month’s time. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have descended 2.1%, while the industry recorded growth of 0.3% during this time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Notably, solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticement for REIT investors. Some other REITs which announced dividend hikes recently include Alexandria Real Estate Equities (ARE  -  Free Report), SL Green Realty (SLG  -  Free Report) and Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA  -  Free Report).Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

77,MAA,"Mid-America Apartment Communities (MAA  -  Free Report), commonly known as MAA, is expected to witness high demand for its properties, stemming from robust job growth in the core markets. However, the company’s portfolio is concentrated in the Southeast and Southwest regions of the United States. This exposes it to economic and political doldrums prevailing in the area.This Sunbelt-focused apartment real estate investment trust (REIT) opts for opportunistic investments to maintain the right product mix and raise the number of apartment communities in dynamic markets. In fact in December 2016, the company merged with Post Properties that created a combined entity with a larger presence in targeted markets. MAA’s strong balance sheet with lower leverage and well-laddered debt maturities, offer scope for further expansion.The company is set to witness increased demand, supported by the growth of prime age groups for rentals and immigration. This, along with a solid portfolio, positions the company to enjoy higher occupancy and effective rent per unit.    MAA reported better-than-expected results in third-quarter 2017 with regard to funds from operations (FFO). It witnessed robust revenue growth in large as well as secondary markets. Subsequently, the company lifted full-year FFO per share outlook, revising it from the previous range of $5.77-$5.97 to $5.84-$5.94.Moreover, shares of MAA have outperformed the industry it belongs to, year to date. MAA’s shares gained 6.8% compared with 4.7% growth recorded by the industry. Nonetheless, new supply of residential properties in a number of markets, specifically in high priced-point and urban locations continue to hamper MAA’s leasing activities. This high supply adversely impacts the landlord’s capability to demand more rent and results in lesser absorption.Also, stiff competition in the residential real estate market with various housing alternatives like single-family housing, manufactured housing, condominiums and the new and existing home markets might dent any near-term revenue growth prospects. Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for full year FFO was revised downward by a cent over a month, reflecting analysts’ bearish sentiments.MAA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the REIT space are Extra Space Storage (EXR  -  Free Report), DCT Industrial Trust (DCT  -  Free Report) and Paramount Group (PGRE  -  Free Report). All three stocks carry a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Extra Space Storage’s FFO per share estimates for 2017 was revised upward to $4.31 over a month.

However, excluding the expenses related to hurricanes, combined adjusted same-store NOI was up 1.8% compared with the year-ago quarter.In the large market, 1.4% growth in revenues and a 2.6% increase in expenses resulted in the company’s NOI to be up 0.7%. Again, in the secondary market, a 2.4% rise in revenues and 4.8% increase in expenses led to 1% growth in NOI.The quarter witnessed 2.1% year-over-year increase in average effective rent per unit.

86,MAA,"We are in the heart of the Q1 reporting cycle and the real estate investment trust (REIT) space is bustling with activity as there is a deluge of Q1 earnings releases lined up for this week, including Essex Property Trust, Inc. (ESS  -  Free Report), Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA  -  Free Report), The Macerich Company (MAC  -  Free Report), Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT  -  Free Report), Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (HST  -  Free Report) and Equinix, Inc. (EQIX  -  Free Report). These companies are slated to release their quarterly numbers on May 2.Per our latest Earnings Preview, total Finance Sector earnings, of which REITs are a part, for the Jan-Mar quarter are expected to increase 27% based on 4.7% increase in revenues, as compared with the prior-year quarter.Particularly, with underlying asset categories and the location of properties playing a vital role in determining REITs’ performance, not all the companies in this space are equally poised to excel or fall behind, this season.Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact the above-mentioned REITs’ first-quarter results.Mid-America Apartment Communities — commonly known as MAA — maintains a well-balanced portfolio in the Southeast and the Southwest regions of the United States. Further, favorable demographics and strong job growth in target markets are anticipated to drive demand for MAA’s properties. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter total revenues is currently pegged at $385 million, denoting projected growth of 1.6% year over year.Notably, per the latest report from the real estate technology and analytics firm — RealPage, Inc. (RP  -  Free Report) — the national apartment market remained moderated in first-quarter 2018. Annual rent growth slipped to 2.3% in Q1 which marked moderation from the 2.6-2.9% growth rate experienced throughout 2017. Occupancy level of 94.5% in March edged down from the prior-year tally of 95%. Nevertheless, the overall occupancy level is still healthy and the first quarter usually marks a slow leasing period, thanks to the cold weather that inhibits shift of householdsFurther, there is an increasing apartment supply in a number of markets of MAA. This high supply is likely to put pressure on rental rates in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, there is high-concession activity amid elevated supply, which remains a concern.The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.46, which indicates no movement on a year-over-year basis. (Read more: Mid-America Apartment Q1 Earnings: What's in Store?)Our proven model does not conclusively show that MAA is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here, as you will see below.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although the company has an Earnings ESP of +0.78%, an unfavorable Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) makes it difficult for our proven model to conclusively predict a likely earnings beat this season.However, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, which is depicted in the graph below:Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc.

It reflects 3.7% growth from the prior-year quarter. (Read more: What's in the Offing for Essex Property Q1 Earnings?)Also, chances of Essex Property beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the quarter are high.

We anticipate the company to have enjoyed a stable source of rent in the to-be-reported quarter from its tenants that include several well-capitalized retailers.Although the company is resorting to different strategies, mall traffic continues to remain considerably depressed with consumers increasingly opting for online purchases. This has led to rising number of retailers joining the dot-com bandwagon. In fact, the first few months of the year witnessed several preeminent retail bankruptcy filings and record-high defaults by retail corporates.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter minimum rental revenues is currently pegged at $142 million. This indicates a sequential decline of 6%.

This is due to tough comparisons, resulting from inauguration and Women's March in D.C. last year as well as the Easter weekend, beginning on Mar 30 this year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $1.32 billion, indicating an expected decline of 1.9% year over year.
