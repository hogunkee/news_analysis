0,SEE,"Learning how to read stock charts helps you get in early on winning stocks like Nvidia (NVDA) and Netflix (NFLX). Charts also help you spot the right time to sell and take your profits.In part 1 of this series on chart reading for beginners, we answered two basic questions: Why use charts? What's in a stock chart?In this second installment, we'll go over three telltale clues to look for in a stock chart to help you know when it's time to buy, sell or hold. Once you know how to spot these signals and understand the concepts behind them, you'll be ready to capture solid gains with the three most profitable chart patterns.TIP: Watch our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's easy to overcomplicate chart reading. But as we saw in part 1 of this series, charts simply tell you a story. And to understand what tale is being told, you really just need to answer the three basic questions discussed below.So keep it simple. You'll be surprised by how much you can learn about the health and potential of a stock just from these three clues.Editor's Note: If you come across terms or concepts you're not familiar with, check out part 1 of this series for more details.The first question to ask when looking at a stock chart is, ""What's the trend?"" There are basically three possibilities: uptrend, sideways, downtrend.As simple as that concept may sound, it's also quite important. You want to buy stocks when they're going in the right direction — up.Why buy a stock that is clearly heading south? Yes, it may eventually find a bottom and reverse that trend. But why jump in when it's headed the wrong way? Wait until it shows clear signs of renewed strength and begins moving in the right direction.When a stock is moving sideways, there's no clearly defined trend. You don't know if the stock will jump higher or take a nosedive. Again, why take the risk at this stage? You're better off waiting for the stock to show signs of a new uptrend.Charts tell a story. They show you if a stock is being heavily bought or aggressively sold by large investors. But the only way to decipher that story is to look at the changes in share price together with the changes in volume (i.e., the number of shares traded that day or week).Share prices fluctuate daily, up or down. To see if the buying or selling is serious — and to see if the underlying trend is changing — you need to check the volume.For example, say a stock normally trades 1 million shares a day. If the share price rises or falls a bit one day and volume is around 1 million shares, that's nothing unusual. But if the stock suddenly trades 3 million shares one day as it gains 5%, you know something is up. You want to pay particular attention to those kinds of unusually heavy-volume days or weeks.Let's look at some different scenarios and what they mean.Price GAIN In Unusually Heavy Volume: Look at the weekly chart for Netflix below. The video streaming giant's share price has been rising sharply since the end of 2016. And as indicated by the arrows in the chart, there were several weeks where Netflix's share price rose sharply and volume also spiked.What story does such behavior reveal? That mutual fund managers and other large investors are aggressively scooping up shares. This so-called ""institutional demand"" is exactly what you want to see, since it's these large investors that provide the fuel a stock needs to make a sustained climb.Nvidia, which rose over 650% after being highlighted in the IBD 50, offers another example of strong institutional demand. In the daily chart below, look how the stock was trading in a tight range right along its 50-day line in April and May of 2017 (1). The stock then gapped up on May 10 in volume 268% higher than normal (2). And note how volume continued to come in well above average as the stock moved higher in the days that followed (3). Large investors were clearly in buying mode. The stock spiked again in heavy volume on June (4).Price DROP In Unusually Heavy Volume: This is the exact opposite of the scenario above. A large drop in price accompanied by a big spike in volume shows large investors are aggressively dumping shares. In other words, the selling is serious. As the example of 3D printing stock 3D Systems (DDD) shows below, it's especially worrisome if the stock is crashing below the 50-day or 10-week moving average line when that happens.Look how volume rose sharply as the stock crashed right through its 50-day line (1). And the same thing happened as the stock failed to find support at the 200-day line (2). These were both signs that after a big run prior to 2014, 3D Systems' trend had changed.Price GAIN In Unusually Light Volume: If the share price is rising significantly, but volume is normal or below average, what does that tell you? That, at least for now, large investors are not buying aggressively. In other words, there's not a lot of conviction for the move.Such moves can turn out to be a head fake, which was the case for Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) in the chart below. The stock broke out from a base, but volume was well below average (1). On the day of a breakout, you want to see a 40% or larger spike in earnings to show strong demand. Old Dominion fell well short of that.In the days that followed, note how volume rose sharply as the stock fell (2, 3). So a light-volume breakout attempt turned into a heavy-volume sell-off. Such behavior is a clear sign that large investors are in selling, not buying, mode.Price DROP In Unusually Light Volume: When a stock falls but the number of shares traded is much lower than normal, it tells you large investors are not selling aggressively. This is an important clue that can help you sit tight and hold on for bigger gains down the road.The example of Ollie's Bargain Outlet (OLLI) below proves that point. While Ollie's was building a new flat base, note how volume on down weeks was below average (1). It was also finding support at the 10-week line. As the arrows in the chart indicate, the stock broke out of that base in heavy volume and showed several heavy-volume up weeks as the stock climbed higher for months. It's a clear example of how you can see what fund managers are up to by looking for unusual spikes in price and volume in a stock chart.Last but not least, see if your stock is finding support or running into resistance at key lines like the 50-day and 10-week moving averages. Also look for support or resistance at important price areas, such as new or recent buy points in a chart pattern.How your stock performs at these testing grounds reveals a great deal about its strength. Why? Because many fund managers and other large investors closely follow these benchmarks.If these big players still favor the stock, they'll often step in to pick up more shares and protect their positions when it pulls back to the 50-day or 10-week line. Their buying will keep the stock above those benchmarks. But if the stock crashes below the moving average in heavy volume, it's a sign that large investors have shifted into selling mode.Take Alarm.com (ALRM) as an example. As it was making a nice run in 2017, the stock consistently found support at its 10-week moving average (1, 2, 3). It was in a clear uptrend, and there were several heavy-volume up weeks — a sign of institutional demand.But note how that trend changed toward the end of that year. The stock failed to find support at the 10-week line and crashed below it in heavy volume (4). After that, note how the 10-week moving average changed from an area of support to a line of resistance (5, 6).Lines Of Defense: You can think of the 50-day and 200-day moving average lines as a stock's first and second lines of defense. (On a weekly chart, the equivalents are the 10-week and 40-week moving averages.) If a stock fails to find support at the 50-day line, see if it can at least hold its ground at the 200-day moving average. In the case of 3D Systems discussed earlier, you can see how the stock failed to find support at either benchmark, and crashed below both of them in heavy volume (1 and 2, above).Steppingstones: E-Trade Financial (ETFC) shows how stocks will often form steppingstones as they climb higher. This happens as the stock hits resistance (1) and pulls back, then finds support (2) and rises again. It's very healthy action to see a stock turn a former ceiling of resistance into a new floor of support.In the next installment of this series on chart reading for beginners, we'll go over the three most profitable chart patterns: cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.As we do that, you'll see how each of the three telltale clues discussed above come into play:You can also learn more with our free lessons on how to read stock charts.

1,SEE,"NASA is reportedly in talks with companies about taking over the International Space Station, but one analyst doesn't see Tesla (TSLA) chief Elon Musk's SpaceX or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin participating.XThe federal government's funding for the ISS will end in 2025, and the space agency is looking at ways to sustain it as a commercial venture beyond that.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine told the Washington Post that he has talked ""to many large corporations that are interested in getting involved"" with the ISS ""through a consortium, if you will"" and commercially manage the orbiting laboratory.A single company alone couldn't afford the funding the ISS needs. Operating costs have been estimated at $3 billion-$4 billion a year, with the bulk coming from the U.S. government. Boeing (BA) has a contract with NASA to operate and maintain the ISS, which is also used by more than a dozen other countries.Bridenstine wouldn't tell the Post which companies he's spoken to. But Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at CSIS, has some ideas on who is — and isn't — interested.In particular, private space companies like SpaceX or Blue Origin wouldn't want to take over the ISS, he told IBD.""They don't need a full space station,"" Harrison said. ""They just need modules to experiment with in space and a launch platform. It's probably faster and cheaper to build the things on their own.""While SpaceX and Blue Origin are among the highest-profile private space companies due to their ties to the Tesla and Amazon CEOs, respectively, other companies are on the rise as commercial opportunities become clearer.And they don't seem eager to get a piece of the ISS action either. Earlier this year, Bigelow Aerospace, NanoRacks and Axiom Space were asked by CNBC about taking over the ISS, and none expressed interest. Instead, those companies are working on their own space platforms.Boeing shares dipped 0.2% to 360.10 on the stock market today.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut companies investing in additive manufacturing and 3D printing could experiment with those products in space, Harrison said. ""If you can mine and extract materials in space and then make something in space, the less you have to launch.""Printing organs for people on the transplant list could be a viable ISS business too. Fiber optics are another possible commercial growth area for the ISS. Gravity causes fibers grown on Earth to have impurities and misshapen crystals.Meanwhile, biotech Amgen (AMGN) claimed it developed its Prolia and Xgeva osteoporosis drugs quicker on the ISS than on the ground, Scott Copeland, Boeing's senior manager for research integration, specialty and systems engineering on the ISS, told IBD in an earlier interview.Harrison said there are a limited set of companies that could benefit from a microgravity lab, such as pharmaceutical companies. But he is bearish overall about the commercial push.""It's not clear to me that the ISS is ever going to be commercially viable,"" he said. ""We've had decades of experimentation with laboratories in space, and have yet to find a killer app.""And not only that, but the lab could put NASA's other plans in jeopardy as it looks to move resources toward more deep-space exploration missions.Harrison thinks Congress will mandate that NASA keep funding the laboratory, taking away money from deep space projects.""It's not that different from what you see in the military when the Air Force or the Navy tries to retire an old platform. Congress steps in and forces them to keep it, which comes at the expense of modernization.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Space Industry News How The International Space Station Could Operate CommerciallySpace Warfare: Why The U.S. Is So Vulnerable, Despite SpaceX's WinsSpaceX Sees Direct Route To Mars But Boeing Doesn't — Here's Why

2,SEE,"United Airlines (UAL) on Tuesday reported first-quarter results that beat estimates and signaled tighter cost control over the year as Wall Street focuses more on how airlines can counterbalance the rising price of jet fuel.XThe carrier reported first-quarter earnings per share of 50 cents, topping forecasts by a penny. Revenue came in at $9.032 billion, just beating analyst expectations for $9.013 billion. United's unit revenue, which gauges sales by way of an airline's overall flight coverage, rose 2.7%, in line with prior company forecasts.United said that it expected full-year non-fuel unit costs, excluding third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, to be flat to down 1% during the full year.United's plan to add more flights to smaller U.S. cities over the next three years has also raised worries that rivals might retaliate by slashing fares, drawing passengers but thinning profits. The airline narrowed its guidance on 2018 capacity — or an airline's supply of seats and flights — and now sees it rising 4.5%-5.5%. In January, United said it expected capacity growth of 4%-6%.The carrier sees full-year earnings per share of $7.00-$8.50, narrowing an earlier forecast due to ""increased confidence in the outlook for the remainder of the year."" Wall Street expected $7.83. For the second quarter, United forecast a unit revenue increase of 1%-3%. The carrier also sees second-quarter capacity increasing 4%-5%. United expects second-quarter adjusted pretax margins of 9%-11%. The company expects unit costs, excluding third-party business expenses, fuel and profit sharing, to be flat to up 1% in Q2.Shares jumped 3% late in the stock market today, after ending the regular session virtually flat at 67.34.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Wall Street could stir up drama during the company's earnings conference call, set for Wednesday.After the company's third-quarter earnings call, its stock fell around 12%, with some investors not satisfied with how prepared the carrier was for this year. After United's fourth-quarter call, when it announced the expansion, the stock fell around 11%.Delta Air Lines (DAL), which reported earnings last week, closed up 0.5% and added another 0.5% late. American Airlines (AAL) finished 1.4% lower but rallied 1% late. Southwest (LUV) fell 1.1%, after a Dallas-bound plane suffered an engine problem that forced an emergency landing and left one person dead.Strong international demand helped Delta, American and United during the quarter. But investors are likely to zero in on how airlines can keep costs lean as fuel gets more expensive, Cowen analysts said in a research note.Cowen said it expected unit revenue, a key efficiency gauge that measures airline revenue by its overall flight capacity, to be lower in the second quarter vs. the first. Holiday timing as well as extra seat and flight availability will likely push the metric lower, the firm said.Another concern on Wall Street is United's plan to add more flights to smaller U.S. cities over the next three years. That expansion, announced in January, tanked United's stock, as investors worried that other airlines might retaliate by slashing fares, which attracts passengers but brings thinner profits.Delta, during its first-quarter earnings call on Thursday, said that fuel costs would be the ""wild card"" for 2018, adding that the growth rate of nonfuel unit costs also was ""unacceptably high.""But the carrier plans to offer more premium seats on flights during the year, helping to offset some of that cost growth.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Southwest Outlook Hits Airlines, But Is United The 'Direct' Culprit?United Airlines, American To Wall Street: You Don't Get What We're DoingVirgin Atlantic Follows Delta, United, American With New Economy ClassAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

3,SEE,"With artificial intelligence now firmly entrenched in many hospital operating rooms, the field of robotic surgery is starting to get competitive.Giant companies like Alphabet (GOOGL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT) are training their sights on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG), the king of robotic surgery companies. But analysts say the booming medical technology segment has lots of room to run.Robotic surgery is an area that could grow by billions of dollars as more machines are used to treat patients. Intuitive commands the space with $3.3 billion in annual sales. Its signature da Vinci robotic surgeons, however, are limited in the types of procedures they handle. The multi-limbed da Vinci can be used in a variety of procedures — including cardiac, colorectal, gynecological, head and neck, thoracic and urologic surgeries — but only as long as they're minimally invasive.How big the market could be is still unclear, yet analysts agree the potential has yet to be tapped. So more players are moving in, and quickly.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""I think investors need to understand that the robotics and AI (artificial intelligence) revolution is happening, and it's touching every sector of the economy,"" said Jeremie Capron, the director of research and managing partner for Robo Global, an index and advisory firm specializing in robotic industry investments. ""This is a technological revolution that investors can't afford to miss.""Analysts say that in March, Auris Health became the first company to pose a formidable threat to Intuitive when its catheter-based Monarch Platform gained U.S. approval. Intuitive will counterpunch by seeking approval for a flexible catheter similar to the Auris device, likely this year, RBC analyst Brandon Henry said in a recent report.Meanwhile, others are working in areas where Intuitive Surgical doesn't have a foothold. Smith & Nephew (SNN) has a robotic assistant for knee replacements. Stryker (SYK) has a robotic joint replacement system. Mazor Robotics (MZOR) and Zimmer Biomet (ZBH) have robotic offerings in brain and spinal surgery. Mazor alone could see around $3 billion in sales just from its systems.But these players have a long way to go to take Intuitive Surgical's throne.In 2005, Intuitive had a market cap of $1.3 billion. Today, it's worth nearly $52 billion. Capron calls Intuitive ""an amazing stock.""""I think the investment community has been scratching their heads trying to figure out the impact of those new entrants for Intuitive Surgical,"" he told Investor's Business Daily. ""We feel pretty relaxed about it. The size is big enough for small players to come in.""Shares of medical tech companies have been relatively insulated from the woes frustrating biotech and pharmaceutical stocks of late. The stocks of medical equipment makers such as Intuitive and Mazor have collectively spiked 15% year to date.Intuitive's ""blowout quarter"" in April helped to spur excitement, Evercore analyst Vijay Kumar said in a recent note to clients. Recent investor days from J&J and Medtronic are helping to drive that frenzy.""Robotic surgery is the topic currently in medtech with a blowout quarter from Intuitive Surgical hinting that the pace of manual-to-robotic transition might be picking up,"" Kumar said. ""The topic of competition elicits various responses from investors.""Intuitive Surgical stock is up 33% this year, after climbing 78% in 2017. Kumar expects Intuitive Surgical's competition to become more apparent over the next 12 to 18 months. Intuitive's da Vinci Surgical System now boasts ""five million patients and counting.""The da Vinci systems are also moving deeper into hernias and are seeing early-stage adoption in bariatrics surgery performed to induce weight loss.Myriam Curet, executive vice president and chief medical officer for Intuitive, noted in an email to IBD that an estimated 82% of prostatectomies in the U.S. are performed via robotic-assisted surgery. The same is true for about 80% of malignant hysterectomies.""General surgery is our fastest-growing specialty, and one where we are still in early stages of adoption for procedures such as ventral and inguinal hernia repair, colorectal and bariatric surgery,"" she said. ""We believe there is substantial opportunity to expand robotic usage in these categories, and we are developing additional tools and technologies to do so.""For the year, Intuitive guided on its first-quarter earnings conference call to 12%-15% growth in the number of procedures performed with its systems this year. That followed what many considered a strong fourth quarter in which recurring revenue — including instruments and accessories for its da Vinci systems — grew 11%. Recurring revenue represents 73% of the sales pie.Still, even Intuitive Surgical sees itself in the early innings and expects robotic surgery to present a huge total addressable market. The number of da Vinci procedures performed each year grew nearly 68% from 2013 to 2017.Among other robotic surgery companies, Intuitive's closest competitor, Auris, doesn't trade publicly. Until recently it was in ""stealth mode,"" Kumar said. But in May the medical technology company signed a commercialization agreement with a division of J&J. The agreement came two months after Auris' Monarch system grabbed approval in the U.S.Monarch is a flexible catheter. Surgeons thread it through a patient's mouth and into the lungs by remote control. Before its approval, investors believed ""credible competitors"" to Intuitive would be years away, Kumar says. But Monarch got approval months ahead of views. Intuitive Surgical plans to seek approval of its own flexible catheter later this year.On its website, Auris says Monarch's first target is lung cancer. Some experts estimate half a million lung biopsies are performed in the U.S. each year. Surgeons could also use flexible catheters in urinary tract procedures, which number roughly 400,000 procedures a year.Intuitive isn't sweating the competition. Auris' chief executive, interestingly, is Frederic Moll, who founded Intuitive Surgical in 1995. Intuitive's current CEO, Gary Guthart, joined the medical technology firm in 1996 and took over as CEO in 2010.""We have built technologies and made decisions about our architecture based on first principles, not by looking over our shoulder at what other people are doing, but by really engaging customers deeply and understanding their clinical needs,"" Guthart said on a recent earnings call.RBC's Henry notes Auris' Monarch has a 25% larger catheter than Intuitive's to allow for its camera. Intuitive sees a benefit in a smaller catheter that can move deeper into the lungs, Henry wrote in a recent report. That would allow surgeons to potentially use it to remove diseased tissue.Meanwhile, J&J has teamed up with Google on a company called Verb Surgical. Analysts are unsure what system the team is creating. They do expect it to enter the robotic surgery market in 2020, though.At the same time, Medtronic is partnered with Mazor. Medtronic also expects its own robotic surgery system to launch in 2020.It's not unreasonable to suggest Intuitive could keep 80% of the market, Evercore's Kumar told IBD. New robotic surgery companies will have to differentiate themselves.""They can't have a straightforward, 'me too' product,"" he said. ""Investors have put a pretty punchy marketable valuation on Intuitive Surgical because we're still in the early stages of this robotic conversation.""But, he added, ""This market is big enough to sustain multiple players.""That's where companies like Mazor and Zimmer Biomet, which makes systems called ROSA, come in. Both have systems that surgeons use in brain and spinal procedures.Like others, Mazor CEO Ori Hadomi says sizing the opportunity for robotic surgery companies is difficult. Surgeons use the $1.1 million Mazor X system in spinal surgeries. The company's Renaissance system can perform spinal and brain surgeries and costs $500,000.Disposable instruments and materials comprised 40% to 60% of Mazor's revenue, Hadomi told IBD. For each surgery performed with the Mazor X, the list price is $1,500 in terms of disposable items. An estimated half a million procedures would generate $750 million.Stakeholders expect spine procedures to grow rapidly.""People are being more and more active,"" he said, meaning they will suffer more injuries and require surgery more often. ""The procedures will become less invasive. The safer the procedures will become, the more patients will be willing and interested to be treated, to be operated on.""The benefits of robotic surgery are plentiful, Hadomi says. Revision surgery — surgery to correct mistakes or tweak prior surgeries — are significantly lower with a robot assisting. The precision of the robot helps to curb potential errors, he says.Last October, Mazor unveiled the results of a 379-patient study. It found a fivefold reduction of complications for surgeries performed with its Mazor robotic surgery technology. Notably, there was also a sevenfold reduction in revision surgery compared with freehand lumbar fusion surgeries.""There's no doubt from the patient's perspective, I would not consider going to surgery without the robot there knowing the chance of going through revision (surgery) is seven times higher,"" he said. Revision surgery is also costly for the hospital, which can face reimbursement hurdles.All agree that robotic surgery won't replace human surgeons. Hadomi likens his system and others like it to ""the toolbox of the surgeon"". These are simply medical technology tools that make operating easier on the surgeon and safer for the patient, he says.The benefits are also growing for investors, says Robo Global's Capron.""What's really exciting is the fact that we are at an inflection point where the technologies that enable robotic surgeries and the price point are attractive,"" he said. ""Now there's a lot of action around J&J and Medtronic. I see that as confirmation that this is a substantial, addressable market.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

5,SEE,"When a company posts high pretax margins year after year, the situation points to two realities.The first reality is that the company is doing something right. The second is that the company might be operating in a space where high profit margins are the rule, not the exception.Take a look at three stocks that have appeared recently in the Big Cap 20 with the best pretax margins.The three are Mastercard (MA), E-Trade (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW).See a trend? Yes, the money businesses are places where high margins are commonplace.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn that situation, how should an investor respond? Should the investor buy shares and then sit back and watch the stock price rise?If only it were that simple.When weighing stocks with high pretax margins, the investor should ask two questions.How do those margins look vs. companies in the same industry group? (Maybe in that context they are not so high after all.)And how do the margins compare to the company's history? (In some cases, margins may be declining.)Mastercard posted a pretax margin of 53.6% in 2017.In the eight previous years from 2009 to 2016, Mastercard's average pretax margin was 51.9%.The highest was 55.1% in 2013. The lowest was 44.1% in 2009.Within the credit payment processor group, only one stock in 2017 had a higher pretax margin than Mastercard — Visa (V), which had a 64.7% pretax margin last year.E-Trade Financial pegged a 45.9% pretax margin in 2017. In three of the previous eight years, the company lost money. The average pretax margin in the remaining five years was 25.7%.Does that sound like a problem? It isn't. Pretax margin stepped up in each of the past five years — 17.2% in 2013 and then 25.3%, 36.6%, 41.4% and 45.9%.Within the brokerage group, two stocks had a higher pretax margin than E-Trade — Interactive Brokers (IBKR) (pretax margin 54.4% in 2017) and MarketAxess (MKTX) (50.9% in 2017).Charles Schwab achieved a pretax margin of 42.4%. This represented the fifth consecutive year of increasing pretax margins.The average pretax margin over the previous eight years was 31.8%.In the brokerage group, the three aforementioned brokerages did better than Schwab on pretax margin — Interactive Brokers, MarketAxess and E-Trade.Although profit margins are important, the full range of CAN SLIM criteria should be considered before buying a stock.In some cases, a strong stock may have thin margins. Amazon.com (AMZN) had a pretax margin of 2.1% in 2017. Netflix (NFLX) delivered a pretax margin of 4.2% last year. Yet, both companies had strong revenue growth in 2017.RELATED:Oil Driller Offers High Dividend YieldP/E Ratio? Forget About ItHow To Find The Next Big Winner In Stocks

7,SEE,"Settled Science: A new study published in a peer-reviewed journal finds that climate models exaggerate the global warming from CO2 emissions by as much as 45%. If these findings hold true, it's huge news. No wonder the mainstream press is ignoring it.In the study, authors Nic Lewis and Judith Curry looked at actual temperature records and compared them with climate change computer models. What they found is that the planet has shown itself to be far less sensitive to increases in CO2 than the climate models say. As a result, they say, the planet will warm less than the models predict, even if we continue pumping CO2 into the atmosphere.As Lewis explains: ""Our results imply that, for any future emissions scenario, future warming is likely to be substantially lower than the central computer model-simulated level projected by the (United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), and highly unlikely to exceed that level.How much lower? Lewis and Curry say that their findings show temperature increases will be 30%-45% lower than the climate models say. If they are right, then there's little to worry about, even if we don't drastically reduce CO2 emissions.The planet will warm from human activity, but not nearly enough to cause the sort of end-of-the-world calamities we keep hearing about. In fact, the resulting warming would be below the target set at the Paris agreement.This would be tremendously good news.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

8,SEE,"Get premium stock lists, pass or fail stock ratings and more. Start HereThe fact that the Lewis and Curry study appears in the peer-reviewed American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate lends credibility to their findings. This is the same journal, after all, that recently published widely covered studies saying the Sahara has been growing and the climate boundary in central U.S. has shifted 140 miles to the east because of global warming.The Lewis and Curry findings come after another study, published in the prestigious journal Nature, that found the long-held view that a doubling of CO2 would boost global temperatures as much as 4.5 degrees Celsius was wrong. The most temperatures would likely climb is 3.4 degrees.It also follows a study published in Science, which found that rocks contain vast amounts of nitrogen that plants could use to grow and absorb more CO2, potentially offsetting at least some of the effects of CO2 emissions and reducing future temperature increases.Given that environmentalists want the U.S., along with the rest of the world, to spend trillions of dollars trying to cut down on CO2 emissions — based entirely on doom-and-gloom climate model forecasts — these findings are profoundly important.But instead of taking Lewis and Curry's findings seriously, environmentalists and others in the ""settled science"" community simply dismiss them — or anyone else who fails to toe the climate line — as ""deniers.""Lewis even has his own entry on a ""Climate Denier List"" web page, and Mother Jones labeled Curry a denier when she testified before Congress last year. (When IBD wrote about the nitrogen findings earlier this month, various climate scientists accused us of being misleading, not scientifically credible, and derogatory.)Slapping a scarlet D on anyone who veers from environmentalist dogma is not science. It's a strong-arm tactic meant to squelch debate and impose scientific conformity.The question now is: What will it take for the ""settled science"" crowd to stop trying to silence dissent and admit that maybe, just maybe, the science on global warming isn't so settled after all?YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Climate Scientists Mount Misleading Attack On IBD Editorial About Global WarmingU.S. Cuts 'Global Warming' Gases Faster Than Anyone Else, But Media Ignore ItThe Stunning Statistical Fraud Behind The Global Warming Scare

12,SEE,"On April 6, a bombshell will hit America's theaters. That bombshell comes in the form of an understated, well-made, well-acted film called ""Chappaquiddick."" (Full disclosure: They advertise with my podcast.)The film tells the story of Ted Kennedy's 1969 killing of political aide Mary Jo Kopechne; the Massachusetts Democratic senator drove his car off a bridge and into the Poucha Pond, somehow escaped the overturned vehicle and left Kopechne to drown.She didn't drown, though. Instead, she reportedly suffocated while waiting for help inside an air bubble while Kennedy waited 10 hours to call for help. The Kennedy family and its associated political allies then worked to cover up the incident.In the end, Teddy was sentenced to a two-month suspended jail sentence for leaving the scene of an accident. The incident prevented Kennedy from running for president in 1972 and 1976, though he attempted a run in 1980 against then-President Jimmy Carter, failing.So, why is the film important?It's important because it doesn't traffic in rumors and innuendo — there is no attempt to claim that Kopechne was having an affair with Kennedy, or that she was pregnant with his child. It's important because it doesn't paint Kennedy as a monster but as a deeply flawed and somewhat pathetic scion of a dark and manipulative family.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut most of all, it's important for two reasons: It's the first movie to actually tackle a serious Democratic scandal in the history of modern film, and it reminds us that Americans have long been willing to overlook scandal for the sake of political convenience.First, there's the historic nature of the film. Here is an incomplete list of the films made about George W. Bush's administration since his election in 2000, nearly all of them accusatory in tone: ""W,"" ""Fahrenheit 9/11,"" ""Recount,"" ""Fair Game"" and ""Truth."" There has still not been a movie made about former President Bill Clinton's impeachment (though one is apparently in the works).There's been no movie about former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's internment of the Japanese, former President Lyndon Johnson's dramatic mishandling of the Vietnam War (though we have had two hagiographies of LBJ, one directed by Rob Reiner, the other starring Bryan Cranston) or former President Woodrow Wilson's racism and near fascism.And it only took nearly 50 years to make a film about a Democratic icon leaving a woman to die in a river. It's amazing it was made in the first place.Most importantly, though, ""Chappaquiddick"" reminds us that confirmation bias and wishful thinking aren't unique to one side of the aisle. In the era of President Trump, media members have had fun telling Republicans that they have abandoned all of their moral principles in order to back a man whose agenda they support.But Democrats beat Republicans there by decades: They not only overlooked a man who likely committed manslaughter but also made him into a hero, the ""Lion of the Senate."" We can't understand how morals and politics have been split in two without reckoning with this history.""Chappaquiddick"" is a must-see. It's just a shame it took half a century for it to see the light.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Other columns by Ben Shapiro

19,SEE,"The China trade war may be about to get better, not worse. Despite Wednesday's sell-off as the Trump administration identified $200 billion worth of potential targets for future Trump tariffs, the key moment is about to arrive that could see the ice break in the brewing technological cold war between the U.S. and China.Chinese communications equipment firm ZTE saw shares soar on Thursday as the U.S. agreed to let the company resume doing business with American suppliers, pending the receipt of a $400 million escrow payment.Meanwhile, Bloomberg News reported that both the U.S. and China are prepared to resume stalled trade negotiations.The confluence of events is likely no coincidence. President Trump's commitment to lift sanctions that amounted to a death sentence for ZTE seemed to break a logjam in U.S.-China trade negotiations back in May. Soon after, Trump touted a prospective trade deal with Beijing, tweeting that  ""China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products"" and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the China trade war had been put ""on hold"" amid progress in negotiations.Those negotiations stalled as Congress complicated Trump's pledge via tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" The Senate preserved the ban on doing business with ZTE in the national defense authorization bill, but those harsh terms may not be included in the final version expected to pass in late July.The stock market reaction on Wednesday came as the threat of escalating Trump tariffs became more tangible, though the likelihood of tariffs hadn't changed. In June, President Trump directed the Office of the Trade Representative to come up with a list of $200 billion worth of Chinese imports that could face 10% tariffs, and trade officials produced that list late Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, the market downdraft on Wednesday was fairly modest. Wall Street still seems to be betting that this round of Trump tariffs will never take flight and that China won't escalate its retaliation against U.S. multinationals. We'll probably know whether Wall Street is right within the next several weeks, as the White House prepares to impose the new tariffs by Aug. 30.As long as Congress hews to Trump's wishes and drops the Senate provision mandating a ban on U.S. firms doing business with the Chinese communications equipment firm, U.S.-China trade negotiations could quickly resume and begin to demonstrate progress.Beijing refuses to negotiate under duress, so there is still a risk the China trade war will escalate with more rounds of Trump tariffs. But a U.S. reprieve for ZTE and its 75,000 global employees may allow Xi to resume negotiations without losing face, despite the Trump tariffs already in place.Yet if ZTE gets a new lease on life and there isn't a nearly immediate thaw in the China trade war and threats of more Trump tariffs continue to fly, look out.This may be the last off-ramp before a full-scale trade war that threatens to seriously damage business prospects for U.S. multinationals in China and severely disrupt technology supply chains.The U.S. imported $506 billion in Chinese goods last year, meaning about half of Chinese imports would be affected by Trump's latest tariff threat.As Trump threatens a full-scale China trade war, Beijing vows to meet the U.S, blow for blow.While Chinese targets are somewhat limited by its $130 billion in American imports, Beijing has other ways to retaliate, and that's one of Wall Street's big fears.Beyond tariffs, U.S. multinationals could face other significant hurdles in China. Beijing could make life difficult for Dow Jones stocks like Boeing (BA), Caterpillar (CAT) and Apple (AAPL) via regulations.China's government also could hit Boeing sales, and likely Caterpillar, through its state-owned enterprises that can sway the market. Meanwhile, Beijing has been holding up the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI).The way things are going, there's little reason to expect China to blink in the face of Trump threats. BMW said this week that it will shift some SUV production from South Carolina to China in the face of Trump tariffs. Meanwhile, China's currency is losing ground vs. the dollar, counteracting the impact of Trump's threatened 10% tariffs on a wide range of consumer goods.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Falls As Trump Threatens New Tariffs; Netflix Holds UpChip Equipment Stocks Get Price-Target Cuts On Market SlowdownThe Big Picture: Stocks Now Test These Critical LevelsStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To WatchHow To Invest In The Stock Market: Start With A Simple Routine

21,SEE,"When's the best time to buy stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Netflix (NFLX) and Nvidia (NVDA)? In a strong market uptrend as they break out of the kind of chart patterns that launch virtually all major moves.In this third installment of the Stock Chart Reading For Beginners series, you'll learn to spot the three most profitable chart patterns (AKA, bases): cup with handle, double-bottom and flat base.To understand what's in a stock chart and the concept behind bases, buy points and breakouts, be sure to also read the first two parts in this series:Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen looking for the best stocks to buy and the best time to buy them, three main factors come into play. You'll significantly increase your rewards and reduce your risk if you wait for each of these elements to line up before you buy.So as you learn to spot bases, remember that the chart action (AKA, technical analysis) is just one part of the stock-picking puzzle. Be sure to use a buying checklist to make sure all of the pieces are in place before you invest.TIP: For an even deeper understanding of how chart patterns work, read more about the concept and psychology behind bases.From IBM (IBM) in 1926 and Walmart (WMT) in 1980 to Nvidia in 2016, countless big winners have made large gains from a cup with handle in every market cycle for decades.The name comes from how the pattern looks like a teacup viewed from the side. It may be a quaint name, but it's an extremely powerful pattern. Here are the basic elements to look for:In the second part of this series on chart reading, we learned about support and resistance. The bottom of the cup with handle is an area of support (a floor), and the peak in the handle is the most recent point of resistance (a ceiling).The buy point is based on the most recent area of resistance (i.e., the peak in the handle) because it's a testing ground. Can the stock punch decisively through that resistance in heavy volume? If it does, it's a sign of strength, and a sign that large investors are buying aggressively and therefore pushing the stock higher.Note that we add 10 cents to peak of the handle to determine the buy point. We do that just to make sure the stock is pushing through that ceiling, and not just bumping its head against it.On the day of a breakout, look for volume to be at least 40% higher than the stock's daily average. Such a spike in trading is a sign of conviction. A breakout attempt on below-average volume shows a lack of enthusiasm, which could mean it's just a head fake.Nvidia Breakout From Cup With HandleWhen Nvidia delivered a classic cup-with-handle breakout in 2016, the first two pieces of the stock-picking puzzle were already in place. The stock market was in a confirmed uptrend, and Nvidia's innovative self-driving car and video-graphics technology was driving strong earnings and sales growth.The final piece — the chart action — fell into place when Nvidia formed and broke out of a cup with handle. In the chart below, note how the relative strength (RS) line was at a new high as Nvidia broke out. That is a bullish sign of market leadership that you like to see as a stock clears a buy point.Also note that Nvidia was featured in the IBD 50 list of top growth stocks just before it launched that run.From the breakout, Nvidia eventually rose more than 700% over the next 27 months, forming multiple bases and additional buy points along the way.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can identify the cup with handle that Amazon formed from October 2016 to February 2017.Learn More About Cup-With-Handle PatternsThe double bottom is another pattern that repeats in every market cycle. It resembles a W, and has a choppy, seesaw look to it. Not surprisingly, double bottoms typically form when the general stock market is showing similarly volatile, roller-coaster behavior.Here's what to look for in a double bottom:Like with the cup with handle and, indeed, all chart patterns, you want to see volume come in at least 40% higher than normal on the day of a double-bottom breakout.Facebook Breakout From Double BottomLike many big-buzz IPO stocks, Facebook got off to a rocky start following its May 2012 market debut. But the social media giant bolted out of a double bottom in July 2013 as its earnings growth rebounded. In the chart below, note the huge spikes in volume as Facebook launched what eventually became a nearly 600% move over the next five years.Can You Spot The Pattern?Look at a weekly chart for Micron Technology (MU). Can you see the double bottom it formed from June to August 2017?Learn More About Double BottomsAs the name implies, a flat base is shallower than a cup with handle or double bottom. It's also shorter, taking just five weeks to form. You'll often find stocks will form a flat base after breaking out of a cup with handle or double bottom. Think of it like a brief resting period after a quick sprint. A stock jumps out of a cup with handle or double bottom, then pauses to form a flat base before resuming its climb.Here are the key elements of a flat base:Netflix Breakout From Flat BaseNetflix formed a six-week-long flat base beginning in June 2017. The streaming giant flew out of that pattern the next month, but quickly pulled back to form a cup with handle. Note how the bottom of that new base formed right around the buy point in the prior pattern — a positive sign of support.After breaking out of that cup with handle, Netflix pulled back again to form yet another flat base. It turned out the third was the charm. Netflix really took off when it broke out of the second flat base at the beginning of this year.Can You Spot The Pattern?On a weekly chart, see if you can spot the powerful breakout Abiomed (ABMD) launched from a flat base in early January of this year.Learn More About Flat BasesGet instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Improve Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineLooking For Breakout Stocks Like Nvidia?

52,SEE,"On the Fourth of July, our nation comes together to celebrate the Declaration of Independence and the first chapter in a two-and-a-half century American journey.To others, the holiday also marks the creation of another U.S. institution, the national debt, the significance of which is wrapped in layers of subtle irony for accountants that know their history.In 1776, representatives from 13 colonies took the bold step of declaring their independence from the world's foremost superpower.The colonists' principal concerns were financial: Great Britain's aggressive levies on everything from postage stamps to caffeinated tea appeared to be taxation without any correlating government services.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFrom England's perspective, the taxes helped offset the costs — both human and capital — spent battling the French and Indian War. Both sides would have agreed that the colonists' lack of political representation gave them little input into tax policy.Eight years of revolutionary warfare followed, which brought additional debts to the colonies and the British Empire.By the time peace treaties were inked in 1783, the United States had spent an estimated $37 million at the national level and $114 million at the state level, much of it borrowed from nations overseas.The Congressional Research Service has pegged the inflation adjusted number at $2.4 billion.  (For comparison, that would have funded just one week's worth of operations in the Iraq War at 2008 troop levels.)The Revolutionary War bills were modest by modern standards, but substantial enough to present a heavy burden for a fledgling country with a population of just five million. Debate over the financial situation featured prominently in the Constitutional Convention unfolding in Philadelphia after the war.The ability to pay off the Revolution's debt ranged widely from state to state. Wealthy slave states like Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina quickly paid off their IOU's, while others struggled to make even installment payments.Alexander Hamilton boldly suggested that the federal government should adopt all war debt from the states. The notion enraged wealthier state governments, but obviously appealed to the others.In the era before income taxes, import tariffs represented the chief source of all government income. With the adoption of the Constitution, tariff income shifted from state to federal balance books, and Hamilton argued that the debt should follow the income.This arrangement would also knit the country together and give state governments a stake in the success of the union.Hamilton's suggestion was ultimately adopted, and the United States recorded its first national debt. Unlike in the modern day, 18th-century lawmakers saw borrowing money from foreign governments as a benefit, rather than a problem.Writing to Pennsylvania financier Robert Morris, Hamilton noted that ""a national debt if it is not excessive will be to us a national blessing; it will be powerful cement of our union.""In addition to strengthening the connection between state and federal governments, regular debt payments would establish a credit history for the nation. Hamilton promised that foreign investment capital would come flowing as a result.He also thought the debt ""a necessity for keeping up taxation to a degree which without being oppressive, will be a spur to industry.""From a modern vantage point, we can see that Hamilton was correct about the foreign investments that come with an established credit history.However, while the national debt may have acted as the ""powerful cement of our union"" in Hamilton's day, it did not keep taxes from becoming oppressive.And as the National Debt has increased to such astronomical levels in the last century, it effectively has become a cement block around the ankles of American taxpayers.We've added monumental sums to the national debt after extraordinary events like Pearl Harbor and the terrorist attacks on September 11th. Even larger amounts of debt have been slowly added on year after year, for decades, to finance routine government programs, as well as Social Security and Medicare benefits.This alarming increase in spending and promising, along with less transparency into how we spend our tax dollars, cooks the national debt like the proverbial frog in a pot of water.The debt will burden future taxpayers, many of whom are currently not old enough to vote. Our founding fathers fought the revolutionary war because of taxation without representation.This Fourth of July is a time to reflect on our Declaration of Independence, but also an opportunity to examine the origins of our national debt and how it has changed over the centuries.Oppressive taxation drove a patriotic class of budding statesmen to set out on their own and reimagine their government's relationship with the people it represents. Alexander Hamilton's saw modest borrowing as a tool to revitalize the economy and demonstrate creditworthiness.The founders would be horrified at our government's current, reported national debt of more than $20 trillion — not to mention the additional $80 trillion in unfunded Social Security and Medicare promises not included in that figure.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

53,SEE,"When Kris Bakowski was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2002, the Georgia resident felt relieved to finally put a name to the fog that was slowly enveloping her brain, even if there was no viable Alzheimer's treatment.For months, she would forget her own phone number. She had trouble with colleagues' names. Mapping out her route home from work became a chore. One day she found herself alone at the mall without any recollection where she was or how she got there.Biopharma companies believe they might be able to help soon. Analysts say Biogen (BIIB) could be first to crack the code on a disease-modifying Alzheimer's treatment that slows the disease's progression. Indeed, Biogen and Tokyo-based Eisai announced late Thursday that Phase 2 tests on their Alzheimer's drug slowed progression of the disease after 18 months. The news sent Biogen stock soaring by more than 23% at one point Friday.Novartis (NVS), Roche (RHHBY), Amgen (AMGN) and others also are developing potential Alzheimer's drugs, along with a number of development-stage biotech companies.Victory is not certain, though. A number of Big Pharma companies, including Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), have been down this road and abandoned planned Alzheimer's treatments. But at least one expert sees success in the next decade, which wouldn't come too soon for Bakowski and other Alzheimer's patients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBakowski, now 62, has been blogging about her Alzheimer's experience for 15 years. In a blog post for the Alzheimer's Association, she describes the eight months of testing that led to her diagnosis and subsequent relief. She's hopeful for a cure in her son's lifetime, but her family isn't so optimistic.""My husband likened it to the Titanic — that the ship was sinking, and he and my son were going to survive and I wasn't,"" she wrote. ""My son reflected that it was like his mother was on death row, but innocent of the crime.""The potential Alzheimer's market is massive. An estimated 5.7 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia. Without a way to intervene, the Alzheimer's Association expects the cost of caring for people with these diseases to hit $1.1 trillion by 2050, in today's dollars. That would be up from an estimated $277 billion in 2018.But, like Bakowski, many experts are hopeful.Privately held Proclara Biosciences is among a cadre of biotech companies aiming to develop an Alzheimer's treatment. Chief Medical Officer David Michelson calls the field ""pretty vibrant.""Michelson, who has held positions at Merck and Lilly, says the steady drumbeat of ""bad news"" in Alzheimer's treatments reflects not so much a failure to affect their specific targets in the brain but issues such as side effects in specific tests. He recently spoke during a webinar hosted by Endpoints News.""There's a lot of really tremendous work that's ongoing and it's enabling new approaches that are becoming possible and generating promising new targets,"" he said. ""I am actually very hopeful and optimistic about what the next five to 10 years hold for research in Alzheimer's.""Several drugs have been approved in the U.S. to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type, including Aricept from Eisai and Namenda from Allergan (AGN). Both treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Neither can cure the disease.Elliot Goldstein, chief executive of ProMIS Neurosciences, can count these types of treatment on one hand. None of them slow the progression of the disease, he told Investor's Business Daily. ProMIS is also working on an Alzheimer's treatment. It trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange for under 1 and doesn't have any sales or earnings yet. Goldstein previously worked at Novartis, which is also developing Alzheimer's drugs.Biogen's strongest hope is a drug now dubbed aducanumab. Goldstein predicts the drug will come to market in 2020.""Aducanumab has a high potential of approval because it has showed a small improvement on decline"" of patients into Alzheimer's symptoms, he said.Biogen did not respond to a request for comment for this article.Visit the IBD Stock Checkup to see how Biogen rates now on key fundamental and technical metrics.In total, Biogen has six potential Alzheimer's treatments in its pipeline. Aducanumab is farthest along, with a late-stage study likely to have data in 2019 or 2020, analysts say.Biogen and Eisai's Thursday announcement involved another drug known as BAN2401. Tests involved 856 patients diagnosed with early Alzheimer's. The companies said the drug, an antibody, achieved ""statistical significance on key predefined endpoints"" that evaluated effectiveness at 18 months. Biogen stock jumped 19.6% to close at 357.48 but had surged to an intraday high of 367.89 for a gain of 23.1% at one point.Still, it's a messy field. Biogen stock plunged 6.6% on Valentine's Day this year after it added 510 new patients to an ongoing study of aducanumab. That move caught investors off-guard. Also that week, Merck scrapped a late-stage Alzheimer's treatment study as the risks looked likely to outweigh benefits.""It can be a volatile area,"" Canaccord analyst Sumant Kulkarni told Investor's Business Daily. ""There have been very spectacular failures in the past. There's a component of the investor who thinks, 'What if the next one works?' That can help from a stock point of view.""Then again, he said, ""Nothing else has worked in the past.""The trouble in Alzheimer's treatment research is that scientists aren't exactly sure what causes the disease. One prevailing theory ties the disease to the buildup of toxic plaque in the brain. That happens when a protein called beta-amyloid structurally changes. Beta-amyloid is sticky and clumps together, becoming plaque.Pharmaceutical companies are looking at two approaches to beta-amyloid that essentially boil down to either removing it or preventing it. BACE inhibitors work to prevent the buildup, while monoclonal antibodies — like Biogen's aducanumab — aim to remove it.ProMIS' Goldstein notes adverse events also must be sidestepped. Some Alzheimer's treatments come with a side effect known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. This refers to swelling in the brain. Goldstein says ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment, set to begin clinical studies in 2019, doesn't cause that.But Mizuho analyst Salim Syed says it's possible to help patients get past ARIA. A common idiom of the industry is, ""If you don't get ARIA, are you really treating the plaque?"" he told IBD.Then, there's the trouble of determining whether a study is designed well, Proclara's Michelson says. First, evidence must show the drug engaged the intended target, like beta-amyloid. Second, patients must be proven to actually have Alzheimer's. Third, the study must be big and of appropriate duration.""It turns out when you look back across history, there aren't that many studies and that many drugs that have been studied in a way that really fulfills all three of these elements,"" he said.He argues that only two studies have hit all three design goals. They are Merck's now-failed BACE inhibitor known as verubecestat and Biogen's aducanumab.In February, Merck scrapped a study of its Alzheimer's treatment in patients with prodromal, or very early-stage, Alzheimer's disease. A year earlier, it said the same drug had ""virtually no chance of finding a positive effect"" in patients with mild or moderate forms of the disease.Meanwhile, the field is thinning. J&J stopped a midstage test of a BACE inhibitor in a group of patients in May because of liver safety concerns. In January, Pfizer (PFE) stopped all research in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment failure in late 2016 was acutely painful for the company. Its monoclonal antibody called solanezumab lost out in three late-stage studies. The last study was in patients with a mild form of Alzheimer's.ProMIS' Alzheimer's treatment binds to several toxic misfolded proteins causing Alzheimer's, Goldstein says. It functions on the theory that there are other targets in Alzheimer's disease outside of beta-amyloid. Some drugs are also testing the theory that tangles of a protein called tau could be the root cause.Privately held United Neurosciences hopes to come in with a vaccine for Alzheimer's. The goal is to use the drug as both a treatment for early Alzheimer's and as a preventive measure. Physicians must administer the drug before ""it's too late to rescue the brain,"" United Neurosciences Chief Medical Officer Ajay Verma told Investor's Business Daily.Verma's background is at Biogen, where he directed the development of drugs, including aducanumab. Before that, he was at Merck and Novartis.Verma expects aducanumab to get approval. Several sell-side analysts model around a 35% likelihood that aducanumab can appease the Food and Drug Administration.But Verma sees a possibility that aducanumab could be expensive, since it would be the first treatment to slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease. ""I think the challenge is, will it be a solution or just for the rich?"" he said.Verma ultimately expects the solution to treating Alzheimer's disease to lie in combinations of drugs. That's been key in treating cancer, HIV, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disease and high cholesterol, he says.Without intervention, the number of Alzheimer's patients will triple by 2050, James Hendrix said in Endpoints News' webinar. Hendrix is the director of global science initiatives for the Alzheimer's Association.""We need better therapies and we need them sooner rather than later,"" Hendrix said.But Alzheimer's treatment studies are tricky, United Neurosciences' Verma says. A barrier between the blood and the brain makes getting a drug to the brain difficult. Plus, animal models aren't particularly predictive, and studies must run for long periods of time.Further complicating matters, science isn't sure which stage is the best to treat.Those reasons are at the center of a 0.5% approval rate from the FDA for Alzheimer's treatments, according to a 2015 paper presented by Hendrix. The industry average is 4.1%.Research is improving, though, Hendrix says. Scientists are aware of the potential impact of beta-amyloid and tau, as well as a number of approaches targeting different stages. In the end, it could be enough for an Alzheimer's treatment to just delay the beginning of the disease by several years, he says.""It might be possible to delay the onset for us to die of something else,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Stock Market Forecast For The Next Six Months: What You Should ExpectHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

Indeed, he was so impressed with the Dow Jones firm's results he claimed that 2018 is shaping up to be ""the Year of Nike.""""Improved design and technologies and sufficient quantities (are) being brought to market with better speed (boosted by Express Lanes), whether with React (expanding more into Sportswear now as well), the Air Max platform (with 270s, Vapor Max, and more), or NBA,"" Svezia said in a research note. ""Jordan will also return to global growth this year and women's is a material opportunity as well.""Nike's Express Lanes initiative is part of its overall Consumer Direct Offense strategy, which aims to make its offerings more appealing and accessible to the consumer.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNike CEO Mark Parker says Express Lanes cuts down the time between a product's design and its appearance on the shelves from months to a few weeks.The wider Consumer Direct Offense strategy aims to make Nike the leader in innovation, speed to market, and direct connections with customers through digital systems, membership and personalization.Nike stock vaulted 11% to 79.68 on the stock market today. Old rival Adidas (ADDYY) rose 2% and new pretender Under Armour (UAA) sank 3.9%. Among other footwear stocks Skechers (SKX) climbed 0.7% and Deckers Outdoor (DECK) sank 2.7%.Nike's continued innovation is leading to even more growth, further bolstering its profits.""Digital is also accelerating (+34%), aided by the SNKRS app and more, while helping drive margins,"" Svezia said.Nike is certainly continuing to pursue this space aggressively. In April Nike acquired body-scanning software firm Invertex, as it continues to beef up its digital technology, including its artificial intelligence capabilities. And in March it bought consumer data analytics company Zodiac for an undisclosed sum.Parker cited Nike's earnings as a harbinger of good things to come, and prove that his strategy is working.""Our new innovation is winning with consumers, driving significant momentum in our international geographies and a return to growth in North America,"" Parker said in a press release. ""Fueled by a complete digital transformation of our company end-to-end, this year set the foundation for Nike's next wave of long-term, sustainable growth and profitability.""Meanwhile Svezia believes Nike is underplaying its hand with its outlook. He sees great opportunities in foreign markets, as well as at home. While North American sales grew 3% in the most recent quarter, that followed three straight quarters of declines.""There is opportunity in China and Europe in addition to accelerating growth in North America (on greater product availability and favorable comparisons) while gross margin should be supportive,"" he said.Nike is the footwear market leader in China and Cowen managing director John Kernan has said the current boom in popularity in the NBA will disproportionately benefit Nike over other brands.The sunny picture is in stark contrast to 2017, a tough year for the footwear industry in North America.

57,SEE,"If meal delivery service companies could package the aromas their recipes create, and somehow relay those to first-time users, I'm convinced sales of meal kits would be even hotter than they are now.Meal kits — recipes and ingredients packaged in precise quantities, usually shipped to your home by companies like Blue Apron (APRN), Amazon (AMZN) and Walmart (WMT) — already have a curiosity appeal, despite plenty of reasons not to like them. They take considerable work. The prices aren't exactly alluring. And like any new industry, several bugs remain in the system.Yet many people try them. And once you get a whiff of your first precisely concocted meal, it's all over. I've made meals from cookbooks as well as from scratch, and they've never smelled this good — even when I followed the recipe to a T. With meal kits, the appealing scent was always there — without fail. I began to wonder if they were manufactured.These aromas put a rose-colored tint on most everything I did when it came to meal kits, even when I botched my end of it. They make the meals taste better. They create the illusion you're a good cook. And for many Americans, they help make the time and money seem worthwhile.It's clear meal delivery service companies have found a niche. How big is this business? Statistics portal Statista says meal kits generated $1 billion in revenue worldwide in 2015 and will hit $10 billion by 2020. Packaged Facts put meal kit revenue at $5 billion last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseData analytics company Nielsen released data in March that showed 9% of U.S. consumers, or 10.5 million households, bought a meal kit in the prior six months. Another 25% of consumers, or 30.1 million households, said they would consider trying one in the next six months.I am now one of the 9%. In all, I tried six different meal kit companies over the past few months, and made 26 individual meals. I spent $287.51 of my company's money, or $11.06 per plate. I came away thinking this is a good idea — particularly since everyone I told about this story was curious about it.Still, there were questions. Can meal delivery service companies compete as retail giants enter the market? Walmart and Amazon.com are both selling meal kits, suggesting future price pressures. How long can smaller players like Blue Apron hold up? Shares of Blue Apron jumped nearly 6% Monday, but the stock remained at 3.21 a share. Walmart, meanwhile, is around 83 a share while Amazon is at an other-worldly 1,723.79.With a market basket full of competitors — and not a lot to distinguish one from the other — the business will only get more cutthroat as they jockey for position. Who can survive the shakeout?Meal-kit deliveries are somewhere on the cost spectrum between buying the ingredients yourself at a grocery store and going to a restaurant. In fact, some say meal kits are meant to be the bridge between the two, though market forces are moving it closer to the grocery store.A Chef'd chicken Marsala meal, shipped by Amazon, goes for $12.45 a plate. That's 31% cheaper than the $17.99 I'd pay for the same dish at the fairly nice Italian eatery in my neighborhood.But a meal delivery service is considerably more expensive than buying only the ingredients I needed at my local supermarket. The market price would've only come to $8.33 a head — that is, if you could buy only the amounts you need. On Planet Earth, they won't let you do that. So you'd need to make the dish two or three times — replenishing some ingredients along the way — to get that price. In addition to meal kits from Blue Apron, Amazon and Walmart, consumers can choose from a veritable smorgasbord of companies, including Home Chef, HelloFresh, Freshly, Sun Basket, Plated, Green Chef, Terra's Kitchen and PeachDish.Lifestyle mogul Martha Stewart is behind Martha & Marley Spoon. Even New England Patriots Quarterback Tom Brady is jumping in the game by partnering with a veggie-oriented service called Purple Carrot.Meal-kit discounts are getting more plentiful, so the margins are bound to get tighter for them all. You wonder why any company would make the effort, particularly if the cost curve is getting steeper.So far, only one pure-play meal kit provider in the U.S. has gone public, Blue Apron, and its stock is trading near 3, down 72% from its 11 IPO price in June 2017. Blue Apron has yet to turn a profit, and its sales have declined in the past two quarters.HelloFresh is traded on public markets, but only on its home court in Germany. After some ups and downs, the stock has a 2018 gain of 9%. Sales growth is strong, but like Blue Apron, the company is not yet profitable.At first blush, shelling out money for the privilege of slaving over a hot stove seemed unappealing when I could pay just a little more for someone else to do that for me at a restaurant. Not only do they place a meal before me, they do so while I'm sipping a cocktail.I also don't do that much cooking at my house. I do a lot of eating, as evidenced by my formidable girth. And don't get me wrong, I can cook. I grew up in a family that did a lot of work in restaurants. I just don't cook much anymore. It's one of many reasons my wife should be considered for sainthood.Third, my local grocery store — Ralphs, a California chain owned by Kroger (KR) — is less than one block away from my house. Ordering something online and having it delivered seems supremely lazy given my geographical situation, and waistline. But should I get even cheaper and lazier, my local store says it may soon be among the Ralphs stores offering prepackaged meal kits from Home Chef. And I hear the prices may be more inviting.That said, there's plenty to like about meal kits. It's not just the smells. The tastes were quite good, too. There wasn't a bad meal, even though I fumbled the cooking chores a couple of times.The aim of meal kits is to make cooking simple. If you can read, you can cook using this method. You just have to follow directions, which shouldn't be that hard.One plus is you're introduced to cuisine you normally wouldn't cook. Instead of Tuesday's rubber chicken, you can have the elegant-sounding Steak Moutarde with roasted sweet potato wedges. Still insist on poultry? They can dress that up, too. There's the aforementioned chicken Marsala with Linguine and roasted broccoli with goat cheese on the side. No rubber included.You also might encounter a wealth of new ingredients and tastes you never knew existed. Ever heard of Gochujang red pepper sauce? How about shredded Chihuahua cheese? I discovered those, plus Tumari sauce, Fregola Sarda Pasta and a cooking wine known as Verjus Blanc. What's great is if you find you don't like any of these, you're only allotted what you need for that meal. No waste.Further, you get a certain satisfaction from cooking the meal yourself. People who never thought they could cook probably will discover they can.Guys can fool their girlfriends into thinking they're debonair, at least for an evening. Busy people can do it in relatively short order, though probably not in the compressed time frame the makers of meal kits claim. And lazy husbands can help out their soon-to-be-canonized wives.Here are some of the highlights I personally encountered on my prepackaged culinary adventure. In order, we used Blue Apron, HelloFresh, Walmart, Chef'D via Amazon, Freshly and Home Chef.

58,SEE,"Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters (URBN) delivered its best run from February 2003 through November 2005 when the stock gained 1,206% vs. 67% for the Nasdaq.Growth investors sought a piece of the action, and Urban Outfitters offered plenty of opportunities.The stock formed six bases during the almost three-year run, delivering good gains until the sixth-stage breakout failed.Normally a stock doesn't deliver much beyond the first two bases, but Urban Outfitters was a special case. In fiscal 2003-05, the company grew earnings 63%, 71% and 80%. Revenue jumped 21%, 30% and 51% in the same years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFast forward to the present, and the glory days are over.Urban Outfitters reported an 11% decline in earnings in 2015, then two years of 6% growth and a 14% decline in fiscal 2018 ended in January.Revenue growth has been in low single digits the past three years.Yet things are beginning to look better for Urban Outfitters and its retail apparel group. Going into Tuesday's session, retail apparel was up 17% so far this year, which was good enough for No. 9 among 197 industry groups.The stock of Urban Outfitters is up 37% so far this year.In Stock Checkup at Investors.com, Urban Outfitters is rated No. 5 among 39 stocks in its group.Ideally, an IBD-style investor likes to buy either the No. 1 or No. 2 stock in a group. (The No. 1 position belongs to Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and the No. 2 position to Burlington Stores (BURL).)Current quarterly earnings might be the Urban Outfitters statistic to zero in on because it is there that the investor will first see a turnaround. Earnings jumped 21% and 280% in the past two quarters. Revenue jumped 6% and 12%.The 12% revenue rise in the most-recent quarter was the best revenue growth in the past 13 quarters. The company said in its SEC filing that the increase in sales was due to same-store growth. The filing noted, ""Retail segment comparable net sales increased 14.7% at Free People, 10.4% at the Anthropologie Group and 8.3% at Urban Outfitters.""Urban Outfitters also owns Anthropologie, Bhldn, Free People and Terrain.The same-store sales growth is a sign of strength. If growth came mainly from new stores, that would be not nearly as bullish.RELATED:Which Stocks Are Top Funds Buying?Stock Of The DayTrump Could Sink The Market With Hoover-Like TariffsMarketSmith, 3 Weeks For $19.95IBD Digital: Five Weeks For $5

59,SEE,"NorthCoast Asset Management dialed back its equity bets in Q1 for its ETF portfolios for clients' retirement accounts.The firm shifted to Treasuries but kept eurozone and U.S. large cap investments as top holdings for its ETF retirement portfolios. NorthCoast parted ways with foreign equity ETFs focused on Canada and the Pacific region. It also has been closely monitoring the potential impact of U.S. trade policies for emerging market positions.NorthCoast slightly trimmed its iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) positions, which remained top holdings in three of its ETF retirement portfolios.""We saw a strong economic background, but valuations were stretched,"" said Patrick Jamin, chief investment officer for NorthCoast. ""We were seeing lower technical signals from the market, so our model was telling us to decrease our allocation to equities.""Shares of IVV are down 2.4% year-to-date.Jamin points to strong sentiment data as a potential tailwind for the holding going forward. ""The ISM manufacturing index climbed above 60 in February indicating the sector is off to a strong start this year,"" he said. ""Homebuilder sentiment index also remains on solid ground signaling a positive outlook for the housing market.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

""We'll be monitoring the impact and change in the data and potentially be adjusting our allocation.""IEMG shares have been flat so far this year but remain up 19.3% from a year ago.NorthCoast closed out of positions in iShares MSCI Canada ETF (EWC) and iShares MSCI Pacific ex Japan ETF (EPP) during Q1 as part of its shift away from equities.RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

64,SEE,"In America, most moviegoers must have a bag of popcorn while watching. In growth stocks, what's the one thing you must have for an outstanding breakout?Volume. Lots of it.If the amount of shares traded on breakout day, or a few days afterward, surges well above normal levels, your confidence in the stock should grow. As a stock bolts out of a good double bottom or other type of base, heavy turnover means this: The big guns on Wall Street are accumulating shares big time. They're willing to pay up.What are ""normal levels?""IBD calculates a 50-day average daily share volume and plots it as a thin red line on daily charts. So you can quickly see if volume was heavy, flat or light on any trading day. Just compare the height of the volume bar for that day with the 50-day line itself.At Investors.com, open up a daily chart and click on any price-and-volume bar. A pop-up data box shows the volume that day and how it compares with average volume. Ideally, volume on the breakout day should be at least 40% above the 50-day average.

The handle was also quite long, but it showed a dry-up in volume (2). Note the bullish support along the 50-day moving average.On the breakout, the market was in a confirmed uptrend. (Always check in the Big Picture column). TI rallied 1.9% and rolled past the 84.34 buy point (10 cents above the handle's highest price). See how the volume bar soared well above the 50-day moving average line (3)? Mutual funds, banks, pension funds and the like furiously snatched shares. Turnover soared 154% above its average 4.06 million shares to 10.3 million.TI briefly pulled back three days later in above-average trade (4), but it paled vs. the breakout volume. Plus, the Dallas-based firm held above the proper buy point. No reason to sell.Could you have viewed TI's base as a flat base as well? No problem.

75,SEE,"Nike (NKE) earnings and sales are due after the close Thursday, and the world's dominant athletic apparel brand will be expected to address the question of whether its primacy in North America is under any threat.Sales in the U.S. and Canada have declined, year over year, for the last three straight quarters. On the most recent Nike earnings call in March, Chief Executive Mark Parker pointed to a ""reversal of trend"" happening in the fourth quarter (the period to be reported on Thursday), an expected inflection point that comes as Nike rethinks its retail distribution and focuses on online commerce.Analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research expect Nike earnings to grow 7% to 64 cents, on an 8% increase in revenue to $9.39 billion.Within the North America segment, footwear sales have been leading declines. Nike has expressed confidence in its new products, however, including the VaporMax, Air Max 720 and Epic React, as it looks to fend off Adidas' (ADDYY) resurgence in recent years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Nike pulls itself away from ""undifferentiated, mediocre"" retail outlets, Adidas sees an opportunity, says Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy.""Overall, management sees the (North American) marketplace cleaner in 2018 and anticipates their growth in the region to be led by shelf-space expansion within existing distribution (12k doors vs. >24k for NKE) as the brand is fully distributed in about 10% of its footprint,"" she wrote last week. ""Adidas sees any proactive Nike distribution reduction as a windfall for them.""Shares were down 1.5% at 72.35 on the stock market today amid a broad market retreat sparked by fears of a spiraling trade war. Nike is now back in buy range after clearing a 70.35 entry point from a flat base and rising into extended territory by early June. Adidas dropped 1.8%, while Under Armour (UAA) dipped 0.3%.Still, even if U.S. sales are sluggish, Nike earnings may not see much downside. At its investor day last October, Parker said he expects nearly 75% of the company's growth to come from outside the U.S., and maintained that the company would hit $50 billion in revenue within its five-year target. Nike's greater China segment has been outperforming other units, and sales in Europe are solid.""Outside the U.S., while growth remains strong, Nike is likely taking share in Europe while sustaining (positive double-digit) growth in China,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia on June 14.He raised his price target to 82 from 75 on the expectation that Nike will exceed estimates throughout fiscal 2019 due to accelerating growth in North America and possibly abroad, among other factors.But Nike's exposure to China also represents a risk, as President Trump escalates a trade war with the world's No. 2 economy.While Beijing's use of retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. may not affect Nike's Asia-based production, the government can still make business difficult via regulatory moves.Government officials also could call for a boycott of U.S. goods, for example, impacting companies like Nike, Starbucks (SBUX) and Disney (DIS), which have a big presence in the country.Meanwhile, Nike is likely to field questions about its slew of executive departures, which number close to a dozen, in the wake of its #MeToo moment and reports of a ""boy's club"" working environment.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Nike, Marijuana Earnings Due; Big Bank Payouts: Investing Action PlanFIFA Fever: It's Really These Two Teams Vying For The World CupNike Rival Adidas Says This 'Massive Category' Is Growing The FastestAdidas' U.S. Boss Talks Amazon, Retail Strategies, And Kanye's Real ImpactStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

79,SEE,"Biogen (BIIB) ceded some gains Tuesday after nearing a buy point last week following positive data for its Eisai-partnered Alzheimer's treatment.On the stock market today, Biogen stock lost 2.6% to close at 344.82. Earlier, shares fell as much as 4.2%. That followed a 1% decline on Monday as Biogen moved further away from a breakout at 370.67. Meanwhile, shares of biotech companies dipped less than 1%.Still, analysts remain bullish about the biotech companies' drug, dubbed BAN2401. On Friday, the biotech companies said BAN2401 slowed the clinical progression of Alzheimer's in patients with an early form of the disease. Biogen stock spiked 20% on the largely unexpected news.Previously, analysts hadn't given much credence to BAN2401, which failed to meet its goals at a prior interim analysis. Now, Biogen and Eisai will unveil final data for the study on July 25 at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe news gives Biogen two late-stage bites at the Alzheimer's treatment apple. Biogen also is working on a drug called aducanumab in Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs target toxic plaque in the brain known as beta amyloid thought to cause Alzheimer's disease.""If successful in Phase 3, our (key opinion leader) believes aducanumab or BAN2401 would immediately become the standard-of-care treatment and utilized broadly despite the need to monitor or bimonthly (intravenous) infusions,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.Following the news on Friday, Biogen stock joined Investor's Business Daily's Big Cap 20 list.The biggest question now is what data will Biogen and Eisai present later this month, analysts say. The study of BAN2401 had a different design from other Alzheimer's treatment tests. It also used a different goal, called Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score, or ADCOMS, to determine the drug's effectiveness.""Neither company is divulging any details,"" Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in his report to clients. It's possible the biotech companies could provide the full 18-month data, their definition of a statistically significant improvement in the study or a breakdown on the new marker for effectiveness.The ADCOMS marker is somewhat controversial. Most Alzheimer's treatment studies look at another measure to determine effectiveness, known as Clinical Dementia Rating — Sum Of Boxes, or CDR-SB. Biogen's wholly owned Alzheimer's treatment, aducanumab, is using the latter as its measure.But, according to the physician cited by RBC's Abrahams, an improvement in ADCOMS is a legitimate measure. He also is not concerned about the study's unique design, which allowed for multiple interim analyses of the data. Others have been critical of the new measure, saying its bar for success is too low.""Our (key opinion leader) felt that ADCOMS, despite its increased sensitivity, is indeed a legitimate endpoint, and given its makeup, could track similarly to the CDR-SB endpoint used in aducanumab studies,"" Abrahams said.RELATED:How To Trade: Why Biogen Fell Below Its Buy Point On Breakout Day, But Still Won BigBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsHow Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?

80,SEE,"Federal Reserve officials reaffirmed their commitment to gradually raising the benchmark lending rate amid rising risks from trade battles and emerging-market turmoil that could blunt the tailwind from fiscal policy.The minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee's June 12-13 gathering in Washington, released Thursday, also highlighted a debate among policymakers over how many more rate increases would be needed to keep the economy on a stable footing in the long run. A ""number"" of officials said it might ""soon be appropriate"" to modify language in the Fed's post-meeting statement language that describes rates as ""accommodative,"" according to the minutes.""Participants generally judged that, with the economy already very strong and inflation expected to run at 2% on a sustained basis over the medium term, it would likely be appropriate to continue gradually raising the target range for the federal funds rate to a setting that was at or somewhat above their estimates of its longer-run level by 2019 or 2020,"" the minutes said.At the meeting, Fed officials unanimously raised the main lending rate for the second time in 2018 — to a target range of 1.75% to 2%. They now expect a total of four hikes this year, from three estimated in March.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseU.S. central bankers are trying to keep the economy on a sustainable path as growth gets a boost from tax cuts and additional government spending, with a ""few"" Fed officials saying in the minutes that fiscal policy ""posed an upside risk"" to the outlook. At the same time, they're watching closely for signs that an escalating trade war is damping business investment, the biggest contributor to growth in the first quarter.""Most participants noted that uncertainty and risks associated with trade policy had intensified and were concerned that such uncertainty and risks eventually could have negative effects on business sentiment and investment spending,"" the minutes said.The U.S. has imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum and threatened to slap more levies on other products from some of its biggest trading partners, particularly China and the European Union. All have vowed to retaliate in what would amount to a trade war that could raise prices and slow the global expansion.Despite those risks, ""the economy is doing very well,"" as Chairman Jerome Powell told reporters after the decision. He said the following week that, in principle, "" changes in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook,"" adding that business contacts were telling the Fed it might be a reason to delay investment or hiring.Unemployment was 3.8% in May, matching the lows since the late 1960s, and the Fed's preferred gauge of consumer prices rose 2.3% on annual basis in May. Officials have said they will tolerate a slight overshoot to bolster inflation expectations after years of being under the target.The minutes said U.S. central bankers debated the amount of labor-market slack left in the economy, with ""several"" participants saying ""there was further scope for a strong labor market to continue to draw individuals into the workforce.""Officials also discussed risks of inflation, with ""a number"" of them saying it was ""premature to conclude that the committee had achieved"" its 2% inflation target on a sustainable basis. Others voiced the concern that ""a prolonged period in which the economy operated beyond potential could give rise to heightened inflationary pressures or to financial imbalances that could lead eventually to a significant economic downturn.""Political and economic turmoil in some parts of Europe and emerging-market economies were also cited as a downside risk to growth and inflation by ""many"" Fed officials.Most analyst projections show economic growth accelerated in the second quarter after a 2 percent annualized pace in the first three months of the year.The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow tracker put the rate of expansion last quarter at 4.1%, while the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg is for 2.9% for the full year.

123,SEE,"Singapore Summit: So President Trump cancelled his meeting with Kim Jong-un, scheduled for June 12 in Singapore. A diplomatic disaster? No. Diplomacy, Trump-style. We'll now see what Kim's made of.In pulling out of the meeting, Trump sent a formal letter that deployed surprisingly deft diplomatic reasoning.""Based on the tremendous anger and open hostility displayed in your recent statement, I feel it is inappropriate, at this time, to have this long-planned meeting,"" Trump said in his letter. ""Therefore, please let this letter serve to represent that the Singapore summit, for the good of both parties, but the detriment of the world, will not take place.""The letter came a day after North Korea's Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son Hui sharply criticized Vice President Mike Pence, calling him ""ignorant"" and ""stupid"" after Pence commented that North Korea risked ending up like Libya if it didn't make a nuclear deal with the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSo it's off. A disaster? Hardly.Now we will see whether Kim Jong-un, just as his grandfather Kim Il-sung and his father Kim Jong-il did, is playing the U.S. to win pre-summit concessions — or really is serious about seeking a nuclear rapprochement.Trump was right to be wary.In recent days, Kim shifted from a months-long charm-offensive to just plain offensive, abruptly cancelling a meeting with South Korea, complaining about routine U.S. military exercises in the region and seeking to remove North Korea's nuclear program from the summit agenda — despite that being the main reason for the summit in the first place.Given the abrupt shift and increasing demands, Trump really had no choice.As for Kim's claim to have destroyed a remote nuclear research site Wednesday in North Korea as a goodwill gesture to the U.S. and South Korea, he allowed only journalists and a handful of other foreigners in as observers — but no one with nuclear technical expertise to determine what really was being demolished, and whether it was of any consequence to Pyongyang's nuclear program at all.Trump's letter was, as we noted, carefully worded, and thanked Kim for releasing three Americans, which Trump called a ""beautiful gesture."" He left open the possibility of still meeting, but put the ball in Kim's court.Smart move.As American Enterprise Institute Fellow and North Korea expert Nicholas Eberstadt wrote on Wednesday, ""these are standard North Korean shakedown techniques, honed to perfection by three generations of regime negotiators. Mr. Kim is probing for pre-emptive concessions before his big get-together with Mr. Trump. Such techniques have proved successful in the past, which is why today North Korea is for all intents and purposes a nuclear state.""That's why Trump called his bluff. Going back to the early 1990s, when President Clinton signed a ""nuclear deal"" with North Korea that the Hermit State later reneged on, the U.S. has been taken to the cleaners repeatedly by North Korea's totalitarian ruling Kim family.They sign deals, get trade, aid and other assistance upfront, then cheat on the deals as soon as it's no longer in their immediate material interest.And, no, this is not a partisan issue: They've done it with Democratic presidents and Republican ones alike.This, by the way, helps explain why Trump was so eager to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal two weeks ago. That deal, negotiated by the Obama administration, was so weak and riddled with giveaways to the Iranian regime, that Trump, John Bolton and others in the administration no doubt felt it had to go.""Why would Mr. Kim accept a worse deal for North Korea than what Iran had obtained?"" Tod Lindberg, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute wrote. ""Leaving one bad deal still active would have established the precedent for another bad deal.""As a long-time executive in the rough-and-tumble world of mega-project real estate development, Trump knows that sometimes the best move of all is to walk away from a bad deal. Make your opponent counter your offer. If not, it's not for you.In the case of Kim, Trump's instincts were right. Maybe Kim will seek a summit. Maybe he won't. But Trump almost certainly will continue to make clear that a nuclear North Korea is not acceptable under any circumstance. And that failure to make a deal will have consequences.Your move, Mr. Kim.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:North Korea Diplomacy By Trump Wins Kudos, But Americans Still Wary Of Talks: IBD/TIPP PollNorth Korea's Nuclear Threat Is Here And It's Real — Kim Jong Un's Regime Must GoOur Long History Of Misjudging North KoreaClick here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

263,SEE,"Accountability: Even before President Trump announced his pick to replace Justice Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court, predictions of doom and gloom were rampant. They'll only get more dire as Brett Kavanaugh's nomination battle proceeds. Will anyone hold these people accountable for their unfounded, irresponsible, uninformed scaremongering claims?As a public service, we've been collecting some of the more fantastical forecasts about the hellscape that Judge Kavanaugh will unleash on the country should he make it to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, political leaders and the media can get away with such outlandish claims because nobody bothers to follow up. They just make a new round of dire predictions.We think that needs to change. So we encourage readers to print and save this for future reference. See if any of them come to pass with Kavanaugh on the bench. Hold the scaremongers accountable.""If Kavanaugh is confirmed, we could see progress rolled back on many issues including the right of women to make their own medical decisions, voting rights, rights of workers to organize for better wages and working conditions, the principle of equal justice under the law & more."" — Sen.

265,SEE,"There's an interesting debate going on around cybersecurity titan and IBD Sector Leader Palo Alto Networks (PANW). After a big run already, is it too late to buy?A stock gets extended when it moves too far past a proper entry point to be actionable. A common pitfall for many growth investors is to buy a stock too late after a big price run already.But whether or not Palo Alto Networks is extended is open to interpretation.For those that view the cybersecurity stock as extended after a breakout from a base in mid-January, one option is to wait and see if it can eventually form a flat base. It's been a shallow pullback so far, but it's only been consolidating gains for three-and-a-half weeks. The minimum time frame for a flat base is five weeks. Watch for continued tight trading above the 10-week moving average.Palo Alto Networks cleared the 156.95 buy point on June 18, but it wasn't a conviction breakout by any means. It could only muster a 2.5% gain from the buy point before pulling back to its 10-week moving average. It fell 5% below the buy point, not enough to trigger a sell signal, such as the golden rule, and the breakout gained traction after that.Another reasonable interpretation is that Palo Alto cleared a long cup-with-handle base with a 191.63 buy point during the week ended April 6. In this case, Palo Alto is still in buy range as it gets support at the 10-week moving average.The network security company, with a market capitalization of nearly $20 billion, continues to trade near highs as the stock market anticipates more market share gains.In its latest reported quarter, earnings per share jumped 62% from the year-ago quarter. The results marked the second straight quarter of accelerating growth. Sales increased 31% to $567.1 million.In March, Palo Alto closed its acquisition of Calif.-based Evident.io, a leader in public cloud services infrastructure protection, for $300 million.In April, it bought Israel-based Secdo, an endpoint detection and response (EDR) firm. EDR tools are used to detect and respond to cyber threats.

286,SEE,"The poor stock market performance in March and the first quarter took its toll on many of the best mutual funds, according to IBD's latest Best Mutual Funds Performance Report. But mutual fund managers who spoke with IBD are not hitting the panic button yet. In fact, they point to a silver lining.""The pullback has taken some of the richness out of stock valuations,"" said Vladimir ""Val"" de Vassal, co-manager of $2.8 billion Glenmede Large Cap Core Fund (GTLOX), a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. Each of those top mutual funds beat its benchmark in 2017 and over the past three, five and 10 years as of Dec. 31. Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Awards list. ""A drop in valuations is good,"" he added.Meanwhile, how weak was stock market performance? March's 2.54% setback marked the S&P 500's second straight monthly decline after 15 straight monthly gains. The bogey's 0.76% Q1 reversal was its first after nine straight quarterly advances. Likewise, the 0.93% March decline by the average U.S. diversified stock mutual fund was its second in a row after five monthly climbs. The group's 0.38% Q1 shrinkage was its first after seven quarterly gains in a row.Investors were jolted in part by fears of inflation, de Vassal said. That arose from January's strong payroll numbers — 200,000 jobs created instead of the 180,000 that were expected — and 2.9% rise in average hourly wages versus the prior year. Later downward revisions eased investors' concerns, but those jitters were replaced by new ones stemming from concerns about a possible trade war, sparked by U.S. tariffs on Chinese aluminum and steel, and the falloff by technology stocks.Still, many mutual fund managers look beyond the weak March and Q1 stock market performance and see encouraging signs. ""The economy looks good,"" said Chip Reed, co-manager of $11.6 billion Eaton Vance Atlanta Capital SMID-Cap Fund (EISMX), another 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner. ""The market looks good. We have the tax stimulus package. We have global synchronized recovery in economic growth for the first time since the 1990s. It doesn't get better than this.""Despite U.S. diversified stock mutual funds' March fall, small-cap growth funds managed a 1.23% gain. That made them the best-performing subgroup. They also led Q1 overall by advancing 3.13%.And in contrast to the losses on average by U.S. diversified stock mutual funds in March and Q1, world equity funds eked out a 0.11% Q1 gain despite slipping 0.85% in March. Pacific ex Japan funds led world regions in March by posting the smallest setback, 0.35%. Latin American funds led foreign stock fund categories in Q1 with a 5.57% advance.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut the weakest market moved sharply in the opposite direction. India region funds plunged 7.51% in Q1, trimming their five-year average annual gain to 11.90%, still best among foreign stock markets.Among major sectors, real estate funds topped the pack in March with a 3.36% gain. Global science/technology funds' 5.53% advance was tops in Q1.Precious metals funds did worst among sectors in Q1, plummeting 7.21%, despite gaining 1.93% in March amid jitters about inflation and a possible trade war.On average, taxable bond funds gained in March but lost ground in Q1. Tax-exempt bond funds as a group also rose in March but sank in Q1.Despite the macro factors fueling his constructive outlook, Eaton Vance's Reed added that a trade war and high valuations could disrupt the party. ""You need to be cautious,"" he said.Matthew Moberg, lead manager of $5 billion Franklin DynaTech (FKDNX), a third 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner, says investors should expect continued volatility for the rest of this year. Otherwise, he is constructive. ""A combination of tax reform and earnings increases is good,"" he said. ""And inflation is being held in check by large internet platforms.""Further, despite the recent tech stock sell-off, Moberg's tech-focused fund remains bullish on select tech names. ""The fund invests in innovation,"" Moberg said. ""Places where we are invested still have a lot of secular growth.""In cloud computing, Moberg likes the huge lead that Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) have in a growing market. In mobile advertising, he says Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) are growing and enjoying solid profitability.Three companies dominate chipmaking. He owns Intel (INTC) but not Samsung or Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM). In the payments arena, he cites secular growth by Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA).In the software space, he likes ServiceNow (NOW). ""This company helps information-technology departments,"" Moberg said. ""Their software is finding new applications.""Reed looks for all-weather stocks. ""We look for holdings that can do well in any environment,"" he said. ""Our holdings tend to be companies that are somewhat immune to the economic cycle.""One is Verisk Analytics (VRSK). ""They sell data on insurance claims (mainly to property and casualty) insurance companies that they receive from other insurers,"" Reed said. ""They have a reservoir of information and tax records."" The company also has an insurance unit focused on risk assessment, rating and risk modeling for the oil and gas, petrochemicals, power-generation, and metals and mining industries.Markel (MKL) is another Reed favorite. ""They're a specialty insurance company,"" he said. ""They don't compete with big insurers. They underwrite insurance for bars, day care centers. The risks are higher, but that enables them to demand higher premiums.""Reed also holds Blackbaud (BLKB), a cloud software company focused on nonprofits. ""They design software that helps nonprofits run their business, from the accounting side to the fundraising side.""Blackbaud's programs enable nonprofits to focus on core missions rather than allocate resources to developing their own software, Reed said. ""They are dominant in that industry, and they expanding into education,"" he said.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeIn A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course With Your Mutual Funds?

315,SEE,"If you are new to buying or selling growth stocks when they break out, you might wonder what to do when this happens: A leader crosses above a proper buy point, then falls below it by day's end. This is exactly what the biotech stock Biogen, a former true market leader, did back in early 2013.Should you sell and hit the ejector button?Not always. Even if the stock is below your purchase price and beneath the proper entry, such action is not an absolute reason to exit the position. IBD research has found that as many as four out of 10 great winners will test the buy point after a breakout. Some stocks do so a few weeks after the start of a big move up. Others simply do so the same day as the breakout itself.The time to sell quickly? When you have to cut losses at 7% to 8%. You could also get out if the price-and-volume action is repeatedly poor, as noted in an Investor's Corner published on June 29.A close below the breakout point could highlight worsening market conditions. Do you check IBD's current outlook regularly? See it in Market Pulse, found in each day's The Big Picture column. If the market is selling off and the outlook is weak, consider raising some cash. Is it still a confirmed uptrend? If yes, then hold the stock.It's always vital to check that you've picked a true industry leader in a top-performing sector. Let's review Biogen (BIIB) as it vaulted past a 155.40 trigger point in a well-formed base on Jan. 28, 2013.At one point, shares rallied 7.3% to as high as 156.94. Yet by day's end, Biogen had risen 2.6% to 149.99, nearly 6 points below the breakout point. Volume bulged 130% above the 50-day average, a good sign.On Dec. 31, 2012, IBD upgraded the market outlook to ""uptrend resumes"" just as the Nasdaq gained 2% in heavy volume. By the time Biogen broke out, the Nasdaq marked only two distribution days, or significant declines by key indexes in higher volume. Therefore, the market was acting right.Biogen rallied more than 80%, peaked at 157.18 on Sept. 26, 2012 (1), then formed the 18-week cup with handle. A 14.8% drop within the base hinted that large funds weren't selling en masse. Biogen bottomed at its 200-day moving average, then rebounded within 2 points of the cup's left-side high. (See a historical chart on MarketSmith to view the 200-day line.)

""Small caps can do well in a rising interest rate environment. Also, we have a focus on quality stocks, which are stocks that are less leveraged and more profitable. In this environment, quality stocks should see strong earnings growth, demand (for their products and services) benefiting from corporate tax cuts and rising M&A.""The fund managers are also counting on their valuation discipline to stay ahead of most rivals. ""Our disciplined process is a conservative growth strategy,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""As a more conservative growth fund, we differ from rivals that have a more aggressive approach.""As a result, GARP, or growth at a reasonable price, is a fair label for this portfolio's investment approach, Skillman says. ""We're looking for growth, quality and valuation,"" he said. He added, ""The price you pay determines your investment experience. It also provides downside protection, which can be important since smaller, rapidly growing companies can be volatile. It's also part of your offense.

He and his teammates are with Cadence Capital Management, subadvisor for this fund.PGT Innovations makes residential doors and windows. Earnings per share grew 80% and 171% the past two quarters.""They make impact-resistant doors and windows, and they're based in Florida,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""About 90% of their revenues are in Florida. The most recent storms heightened awareness of the need for protection against wind damaged and blown-out windows. That segment of the market is growing faster than the housing market. And it's growing faster than its category. They're facing some cost pressures like many companies, but they're executing well on their margins and they're deleveraging.""Kinsale Capital, which is a specialty insurer, is one of the fund's financials. EPS grew 13% and 31% the past two quarters. ""They operate in a niche of the insurance industry called 'excess and surplus,' "" Fitzpatrick said. ""They underwrite hard-to-place risks, like a small business that has an adverse claims history.""The company combines its niche focus with a strong management team. Fitzpatrick said, ""They also have a strong technology platform that they view as a competitive advantage. It improves their underwriting accuracy, speed and efficiency.""Skillman added, ""It enables them to undercut costs of rivals by as much as 20%.""IBD'S TAKE: Kinsale Capital is ranked No. 1 in IBD's Insurance-Property/Casualty/Title industry group thanks to traits like four years in a row of earnings per share growth and 58% projected EPS growth this year.

EPS grew 17%, 7% and 62% in the past three quarters.""They participate in the sports boat segment,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""That segment is growing faster than the overall boat market."" MCBC watercraft are popular among boaters who are young enough to enjoy wakesurfing, a sport in which a rider trails a boat, riding the steep face of the craft's wake. It's like surfing, using a boat to create a wave.""Wake boating is what the lake and river crowd like,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""It's a youthful crowd like with many water sports.""Among other holdings, Medifast makes weight and disease management products. EPS growth has sped up, going from 0% four quarters ago to 8%, 76% and 98% the past three stanzas.That growth stems from a focus on its Optavia brand, which is a product line of weight-loss foods sold by health ""coaches"" to customers globally, Fitzpatrick says. It also reflects the closing of numerous sales channels, making the surviving channels healthier financially.Kemet (KEM) makes capacitors used by the aerospace, automotive, computer, defense and telecom industries. EPS grew at a triple-digit pace in seven of the past eight quarters. A couple of those were profits from year-ago losses, so they weren't exactly profit increases.""This electronics company is a cyclical grower,"" Fitzpatrick said. ""Today's strong economic environment has a lot of components in short supply, which helps pricing and profits. Strong economic growth brings on new capacity (among customers), so demand exceeds supply for Kemet.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE THIS:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeGrowth Stocks, Industrials Look Promising To Investment Strategists

But she called the trajectory of GE's remaining businesses ""uninspiring,"" with ""no V-shaped recovery in sight,"" owing in large part to a severely challenged power market.She also noted GE is disposing off its strongest units in terms of free cash flow conversion – health care, transportation and lighting. ""GE RemainCo will be left with far weaker FCF conversion than the various disposals,"" she said.The aviation unit, which some analysts call the crown jewel in a vast portfolio, is set to benefit as Indian carrier Vistara plans massive expansion and eyes overseas growth.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stock

400,SEE,"The U.S.-China trade war started with the Trump administration accusing China of unfair practices related to the forced transfer of American technology and intellectual property. But U.S. tech companies are seeing little impact so far from the trade dispute as the U.S. on Friday imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods.The U.S. is imposing an additional duty of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese imports covering 818 products. The list does not include products commonly purchased by U.S. consumers such as mobile phones or televisions. It targets mostly products that are part of the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial policy. That policy includes industries such as aerospace, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.The list of Chinese products impacted includes engines, motors, generators, furnaces, pumps, compressors, machine tools, and manufacturing, construction and agricultural equipment. It also includes aircraft and aircraft parts, cars, trucks, oil and gas drilling gear, television cameras and broadcast gear.China retaliated on Friday with 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. products, mostly agricultural goods. The impacted U.S. goods include grains, corn, soybeans, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, fruits and vegetables, alcohol and tobacco. China's levies also cover U.S.-made autos.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe U.S. is planning a second wave of tariffs covering 284 Chinese goods worth about $16 billion, but does not have an implementation date yet.""While tariffs on both sides should have limited direct head wind to IT (information technology) hardware and semiconductor companies, there are a few ways for U.S.-China trade wars to impact companies,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday.For instance, companies that procure components and materials from China could see an uptick in their costs, he said.U.S. technology companies also could be subject to retaliatory actions by the Chinese government, Daryanani said. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court this week could be a result of the trade disputes, he said. Micron stock was up fractionally 53.23 at the close.Also, China has held up chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal has been ""in limbo 17 months and counting,"" Daryanani said. Shares of both were up fractionally in afternoon trades Friday.While the first wave of Chinese products subject to U.S. import tariffs includes computer hard disk drives, U.S. data storage systems vendors Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) should see minimal impact, he said.The impact will be ""manageable and transitory"" given that Seagate and Western Digital also have factories outside of China, he said. Seagate stock was off 2 cents to 58.59 while Western added 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 77.93.If the trade conflict lingers, though, it could impact the U.S. tech industry in other ways. President Donald Trump has threatened to block Chinese investment in U.S. companies.That could cut off investment capital being used to fund such things as electric and self-driving vehicles. U.S. firms like Tesla (TSLA) could be impacted.

419,SEE,"Energy Markets: Based on all the stories about ""surging"" gasoline prices, you might think the country was about to relive the energy crisis of the late 1970s. The truth is, the cost of filling up today is nowhere near where it was during most of the past decade.Just before the July Fourth holiday, several news outlets noted that pump prices are higher than they've been in four years. Democrats are, not surprisingly, playing this up as an election issue, saying it's the result of President Trump's misguided policies toward Iran and his softening Obama-era fuel economy standards for new cars.Trump, too, has joined the chorus of complaints, casting blame on OPEC.On July 4, Trump tweeted that OPEC ""is driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $'s. This must be a two-way street.""Fair enough. But the complaints about today's gasoline prices expose more about the short attention spans of Americans and the mainstream press than they do about oil markets.According to the Energy Information Administration's weekly report, a gallon of gas costs about $2.92 nationwide. And, indeed, the last time prices were that high was in October 2014.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut stories about today's gas prices rarely adjust for inflation. When you do that, you find that at $2.92, a gallon of gas costs the same today as it did back in June 1984.During President Obama's 8-years in office, gasoline averaged $3.25 a gallon, in today's dollars. For 14 months during those years, it was above $4 a gallon, which is higher than prices ever reached in the wake of the Iranian revolution. (They peaked at $3.94 in March 1980.)What's more, while Trump is right that OPEC can have an impact on oil prices, the explosion of domestic oil production has dramatically weakened OPEC's hand.That's a result of the fracking revolution, which unlocked vast stores of previously unrecovered oil deposits. Plus, Trump promised when he came into office that he'd remove impediments to still more production, and has taken several steps to do so.As a result, oil companies produced 14% more oil this April than they did when Trump took office. In the first half of this year, they will have produced about as much domestic oil as they did in all of 2009.For those who really do want to see lower gas prices, the answer isn't to complain about Trump's Iran policy, or call for him to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve — as some are already doing.The answer is to review the pile of environmental regulations and federal mandates that raise costs. That includes the ethanol mandate, regional air quality rules that have Balkanized gasoline markets in the country, and various EPA rules on what can go into gasoline. The Obama administration's ""Tier 3"" regulations, for example, added as much as 9 cents to a gallon of gas.Regulations made building new refineries almost impossible, resulting in refining capacity dropping from 18.6 million barrels a day in 1981 to 16.8 million by 2005. Obama added to still more refining costs with new regulations imposed in 2015.On top of all this, add state and federal per-gallon taxes, and you see that the government is responsible for a significant portion of gasoline's price.The Trump administration and the Republican Congress could bring gasoline prices down. But only by further enraging their already hysterical political opponents.Is Trump's Protectionism The Death Knell For Global Free Trade?Turns Out, Those Forced Union Dues Did Go To Liberal Advocacy GroupsCalifornia's Costly Global Warming Campaign Turns Out To Be Worse Than UselessMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

464,SEE,"When Notre Dame law professor and possible Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett was nominated for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, her affiliation with a religious group called People of Praise raised red flags. It was some sort of cult, they implied. Sen. Dianne Feinstein famously reproved the nominee by intoning that ""the dogma lives loudly within you, and that's of concern.""It was an echo of the kind of anti-Catholic bigotry that characterized American life for centuries. When the Democrats nominated the first Roman Catholic for president, Al Smith in 1928, opponents warned that all Protestant marriages would be annulled and all Protestant children declared bastards if the Catholic were elected. Republicans circulated pictures of Smith posing before the almost-completed Holland Tunnel with a caption declaring that instead of emptying into New Jersey, it really led 3,500 miles under the Atlantic Ocean to the basement of the Vatican. After his loss to Herbert Hoover, Smith was reputed to have quipped that he had sent a one-word telegram to the Pope: ""Unpack.""But Feinstein's comment and others' insinuations that Barrett's religion is somehow creepy or suspicious reveals a broader anti-religious bias.Barrett and her family are reportedly members of a religious group called People of Praise. The New York Times implied that the group — most, but not all of whose members are Catholic — departed from mainstream Catholic ideas and doctrines. My Ethics and Public Policy Center colleague Ed Whelan disposed of those suggestions.Curious, I looked at their website. I suppose it's possible that the benign image they attempt to convey to the world is mere window dressing. But then again, Pope Francis appointed one of their members as an auxiliary bishop in Portland, Oregon. It seems doubtful, bordering on impossible, that he would have conferred that honor on a cult member.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFounded in 1971 as part of the lay Catholic ministries movement, People of Praise provides spiritual community, support for those in need, prayer and counseling, and guidance for successful marriages, among other things. More than 1,000 couples have completed their Marriage in Christ program that instills habits of prayer and — this is shocking — conversation to improve relationships.The first thing you see on the People of Praise website is a Louisiana picnic attended by a notably interracial group. One might have thought that such membership groups are far too rare — especially in the current climate. As Dorothy Anderson, an older African-American woman put it: ""In almost all of his speeches, Martin Luther King spoke about blacks and whites living together in unity. I didn't think I'd live long enough to see it, but I saw it last Thursday night at the barbecue.""People of Praise is ecumenical, with Lutheran, Methodist, Anglican and other Christian members in addition to the Catholics. It contains both Democrats and Republicans, rich and poor. Like churches, they send missions to needy communities in the United States. More than 100 members have helped to build and renovate homes, run summer camps for thousands of kids and found schools.As for Barrett herself, it seems that she lives her faith. She and her husband have seven children, including one with special needs and two adopted from Haiti. Her former colleagues on the Notre Dame law school faculty, many of whom have disagreements with Barrett, unanimously endorsed her nomination to the Circuit Court, describing her as ""brilliant"" and also ""generous"" and ""warm."" They wrote: ""She possesses in abundance all of the other qualities that shape extraordinary jurists: discipline, intellect, wisdom, impeccable temperament, and above all, fundamental decency and humanity.""If Barrett is a glazed-eyed cultist, she's done an incredible job of hiding it. She fooled her fellow clerks on the Supreme Court when she worked for Justice Antonin Scalia. Dozens of clerks, including some who worked for Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, endorsed her previous nomination, calling her a ""woman of remarkable intellect and character.""She fooled her students, hundreds of whom signed an endorsement reading, in part, ""Our religious, cultural, and political views span a wide spectrum. Despite the many and genuine differences among us, we are united in our conviction that Professor Barrett would make an exceptional federal judge."" And she fooled all of the Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee along with three Democrats, who voted to approve her nomination.The words ""people of praise"" raise hackles among secularists. Considering their charitable work and transracial, trans-class appeal, they deserve at least the benefit of the doubt. And that Barrett is reportedly a member is the best testimonial of all.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

466,SEE,"Cara Therapeutics (CARA) touched a 12-month high Wednesday after its intravenous drug curbed pain, nausea and vomiting in patients who'd undergone abdominal surgery.On the stock market today, Cara wrapped the day up 9.9%, closing at 18.06. Earlier, shares rocketed as much as 35.6% to touch their highest point since June 30, 2017. Meanwhile, shares of biotech companies broadly dipped nearly 3%.Janney analyst Ken Trbovich called the data a ""major catalyst for the stock.""Cara tested the drug, called CR845, over a 24-hour period following abdominal surgery. Patients received two loading doses before surgery and four doses following. At a dose of 1 microgram per kilogram of weight, CR845 significantly reduced pain and vomiting/nausea.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

He reiterated his buy rating and 27 price target on Cara stock.Another dose of CR845, at 0.5 micrograms per kilogram of weight, failed to significantly reduce pain in post-surgical patients. But it did significantly cut down on nausea and vomiting over a 24-hour period after surgery, Cara said in a news release.Chief Executive Derek Chalmers noted the need to find alternatives to addictive painkillers known as opioids. Researchers have also tied the use of opioids to nausea and vomiting.""There is a critical need for post-surgical analgesics (painkillers), like I.V. CR845, that lack abuse potential and traditional mu-opioid side effects,"" Chalmers said in a written statement.Janney's Trbovich says he wouldn't be surprised to see Cara seek out a partner to help it develop and commercialize intravenous CR845 for post-surgical pain relief. It's possible now that short sellers could give the stock a reprieve.As of May 31, 6.8 million shares of Cara had been sold short, he said. This is down from 9.8 million shares that were short as of June 30, 2017, when Cara reported negative results for oral CR845 in osteoporosis pain. But the current short still represents 25% of the firm's float, he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichLooking For The Next Nvidia?

468,SEE,"No one wishes to take losses fast in the stock market. But seasoned IBD readers know that at some point you'll take a lump, even in a hot growth stock.IBD's golden rule of investing is this: Cut your loss if the stock falls 7% to 8% below your purchase price. But can you do better than that? Can you find clues that the stock isn't acting right, then get out with a smaller loss?Absolutely. Splunk (SPLK) offers a fresh example. The Big Data analytics expert jumped past a 112.76 buy point on May 8 in a strange-looking cup base.At first glance, it may have the look of a cup with handle. The decline on the cup's left side? A mild 16%. Good. But the lowest price within the handle (1), or 96.28, nearly matches the cup's own low of 94.39.That's a flaw. A handle marks the final shakeout of weak shareholders before a stock breaks out and runs into new high ground. But that handle should form in the upper half of the cup, not the lower half.Let's say you go for it, anyway. You buy shares right at 112.76. At day's end, 1.65 million shares exchanged hands. By itself, that's a lot. But turnover actually was 16% below Splunk's 50-day average (2).Disappointing? Yes. You want to see volume soar on the breakout day. On an IBD daily chart, the volume bar should vault well over the red line draped across the volume bars. That red line shows average turnover over the past 50 sessions.Look for at least a 40% rise vs. the 50-day average on the breakout day, or in the next few days.Splunk failed to see such a strong gain in healthy turnover. Instead, in the next few weeks the stock reversed lower in heavy volume, jabbing a few times below the 112.76 buy point. On May 25, Splunk dropped more than 5% in enormous volume (3). If you sold at the day's close of 110.26, your loss would have been only 2.2%.In the next day, the stock fell 1.7% but refused to clip the 50-day moving average. Then shares made a decent run-up and hit a new high of 121.64. But volume came in below average in many of those up days. At the peak, volume grew as the stock closed in the lower half of the day's range (4). That action resembled a negative reversal. When Splunk reversed lower again in mid-June, it offered multiple chances to exit the stock at break-even or salvage a small profit.Splunk dropped 7% on June 22 and plunged right through the 50-day line. Volume soared (5). That day, Splunk also triggered the 7%-to-8% loss sell rule.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:The Latest Inside Investor's CornerDo You Know The Golden Rule?How Much Fear Is In The Market Now?

477,SEE,"Investors in dividend-rich real estate investment trusts should generally not expect to see big capital gains in such stocks. But the hefty payouts can make a high-quality REIT attractive for long-term holding. Consider Independence Realty Trust, an apartment REIT based in Philadelphia.Independence Realty (IRT) went public in August 2013 at $8.50 a share. The stock's close at 10.30 on Tuesday produces a 21% gain over nearly a five-year span.The S&P 500, in contrast, has rallied 64% since its close of 1655 in the week ended Aug. 16, 2013.Payouts, however, are a different story. As seen in the General Market Indicators page (view it via the link at the bottom of The Big Picture), the 500's annualized yield is 1.84%. The strong advance over the past nine years has depressed that yield somewhat. Still, the S&P 500 cannot hold a candle to Independence Realty's 7% yield.So, assuming the share price of Independence Realty Trust (IRT) doesn't move much from year to year, a long-term investor can aim at getting a decent return based on dividends alone.On April 20 and July 20, Independence paid holders 18 cents a share, up sharply from the 6 cents it paid over the prior four years going back to February 2014.The Philadelphia-based company focuses on selling apartment-building complexes that typically hold 150 to 500 units. As of mid-June, it owned and operated 56 multifamily properties totaling 15,280 units. Most of the properties are located in the South, parts of the Midwest (including Ohio, Indiana, and Missouri), and the Southwest.

The cryptocurrency's 2018 crash may help cement its place in the bubble record books.Down 70% from its December high after sliding for a fourth straight day on Friday, Bitcoin is getting ever-closer to matching the Nasdaq composite's 78% peak-to-trough plunge after the U.S. dot-com bubble burst. Hundreds of other virtual coins have all but gone to zero — following the same path as Pets.com and other red-hot initial public offerings that flamed out in the early 2000s.While Bitcoin has bounced back from bigger losses before, it's far from clear that it can repeat the feat now that much of the world knows about cryptocurrencies and has made up their mind on whether to invest. Bulls point to the Nasdaq's eventual recovery and say institutional investors represent a massive pool of potential cryptocurrency buyers, but regulatory and security concerns have so far kept most big money managers on the sidelines.""You'll have to see the market reverse before you see"" institutions pile in, Peter Smith, chief executive officer of Blockchain Ltd., which introduced a crypto trading platform for professional investors on Thursday, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBitcoin declined as much as 4.2% to $5,791.19 on Friday, the lowest level since November, according to Bloomberg composite prices. It traded at $5,860 as of 8:52 a.m. in New York, down 59% for the year and heading for a second-quarter loss of 14%. Other coins including Ether and Litecoin slumped more, while the combined value of tokens tracked by CoinMarketCap.com declined to $236 billion. At the peak of crypto-mania, they were worth about $830 billion.While it was difficult to find fresh catalysts for Bitcoin's drop on Friday, hacks at two South Korean exchanges and a regulatory clampdown in Japan have weighed on sentiment in recent weeks. Regulators around the world have stepped up scrutiny of cryptocurrencies on concern that they're a breeding ground for illicit activity including money laundering, market manipulation and fraud.Lesser-known tokens have been hit the hardest. Dead Coins lists around 800 that are effectively worth nothing, while Coinopsy puts the tally at more than 1,000. Fewer than 4 percent of initial coin offerings raising from $50 million to $100 million were successful or promising, according to a March analysis from ICO advisory firm Satis Group.Bitcoin may not go to zero, but it's ""very much"" a bubble, Robert Shiller, the Nobel laureate economist whose warnings about dot-com mania proved prescient, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television's Tom Keene on Tuesday.

488,SEE,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues. Patients must be monitored after their first dose.""The attribute neurologists care most about in a next-generation S1P therapy is the absence of first-dose monitoring,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said. ""They also rank an advantage on liver enzyme impact pretty far down the list of comparative advantages they're looking for in an S1P vs. Gilenya.""It's not clear whether ozanimod will have a similar requirement. But Celgene management indicates ""the going assumption is that ozanimod won't avoid it,"" Raymond said in his note to clients.""As we see it, unless ozanimod can avoid first-dose monitoring, Celgene faces an uphill battle in its efforts to differentiate the molecule,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

It climbed 3.1% in the five sessions through Tuesday. Cinemark Holdings (CNK), which operates more than 300 theaters with 4,500 movie screens across 41 states, gained 3.2%.Analyst consensus expects Lion's Gate to post its first quarterly loss in 11 quarters when its reports fiscal first-quarter results on Aug. 9. The stock had gained 19% from a May low on Wednesday. But it is still below is 40-week moving average and within a six-month consolidation.Cinemark's outlook is a bit stronger, with consensus estimates for a 75 % earnings gain in its second quarter.

495,SEE,"Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Fortinet (FTNT) and Proofpoint (PFPT) are often mentioned in a discussion of top cybersecurity stocks. But a lesser-known name in the group — Qualys (QLYS) — is worthy of a closer look.With a market capitalization of around $3.5 billion, Qualys is a provider of cloud-based security and compliance solutions. The company's technology helps customers collect and analyze IT security data. It also helps identify and prioritize vulnerabilities.Fund sponsorship, critical to a growth stock's long-term success, has been steadily rising in recent quarters. Another positive is that Qualys is nowhere near ""overowned."" At the end of the second quarter, fewer than 400 funds owned shares. When a growth stock gets overowned by funds and other institutional investors, it gets harder to move the price.In its latest reported quarter, the cybersecurity leader reported adjusted earnings of 36 cents a share, up 80% from the year-ago quarter. Sales growth accelerated for the third straight quarter, rising 22% to $64.9 million.For the current quarter, the Zacks consensus estimate expects profit of 35 cents a share, up 35%. Sales are forecast to rise 21% to $67.13 million.Last year, annual pretax margin and return on equity were at or near multiyear highs of 29% and 14.4%, respectively.After a breakout above an 85.10 buy point, shares jumped more than 6% on June 14. The move was fueled by a raised price target from Needham to 105 from 95.A technical flaw for Qualys is that it recently flashed a sell signal when it erased a double-digit gain from the buy point. That means the latest buy point is null and void. But after an orderly pullback and with the stock comfortably above the buy point again, aggressive investors might be willing to give the stock a second chance.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.You Might Also Like:Cloud Computing: Find Top Cloud Stocks And Track Industry TrendsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch; See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

499,SEE,"Biotech giant Celgene (CELG) could win big after U.S. patent officials shut down a challenge facing Novartis' (NVS) multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya, analysts said Thursday.On Wednesday, an appeals board of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld a patent protecting Novartis' Gilenya until December 2027. This extends Gilenya's exclusivity well past a prior August 2019 expiration date, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said.While undoubtedly a win for Novartis, the decision also has implications for fellow multiple sclerosis drugmakers Celgene and Biogen (BIIB), he said in a report. Celgene recently suffered a delay for its multiple sclerosis drug, ozanimod.This gives Celgene more time to get approval for ozanimod — which is currently hamstrung by questions from the Food and Drug Administration — before a generic Gilenya comes out and begins to take share, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""For Celgene, this should provide a better ozanimod launch runway especially after their (new drug application) filing delay, and give Biogen less medium-term price/share compression risk for its MS franchise, particularly for (its drug called) Tecfidera,"" he said.On the stock market today, Celgene jumped 2.7%, to close at 85.60. Novartis advanced 3.4%, ending the session at 78.94. Biogen rose 1%, to 347.66.Generic competition in multiple sclerosis is already underway. In October, Mylan (MYL) gained approval for a generic version of Teva Pharmaceutical's (TEVA) multiple sclerosis drug, Copaxone. In the first quarter, Teva said its U.S. sales of Copaxone declined 40% year over year.The same could happen for Novartis' Gilenya if generics arrive. Despite the patent appeals board decision, generic rivals will likely appeal, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said. Gilenya could still lose patent protection at some point in 2022-24 depending on appeals.""In summary, ozanimod will no longer be launching vs. a generic Gilenya in 2019,"" he said in a report to clients. ""This gives ozanimod at least a three-year window to launch in a branded market and establish presence in MS.""RBC's Abrahams noted Celgene could benefit to the tune of $200 million in upside depending on the length of the delay for generic Gilenya.Ozanimod is meant to be a safer version of Gilenya. Both belong to a class of drugs called sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator, or S1P modulators. Gilenya is tied to heart rate and liver issues. Patients must be monitored after their first dose.""The attribute neurologists care most about in a next-generation S1P therapy is the absence of first-dose monitoring,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond said. ""They also rank an advantage on liver enzyme impact pretty far down the list of comparative advantages they're looking for in an S1P vs. Gilenya.""It's not clear whether ozanimod will have a similar requirement. But Celgene management indicates ""the going assumption is that ozanimod won't avoid it,"" Raymond said in his note to clients.""As we see it, unless ozanimod can avoid first-dose monitoring, Celgene faces an uphill battle in its efforts to differentiate the molecule,"" he said.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors Rich

So they are moving to a ground-based solution there,"" said Tom Karako, a senior fellow and missile defense analyst at CSIS.The new radar will be deployed in Hawaii and have a 180-degree field of view toward North Korea, he said. He added that there might be a second radar planned for somewhere in the Pacific.Raytheon shares closed down 1% on the stock market today.

Trump later tweeted there ""is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""However, satellite images have since shown North Korea upgrading the plutonium production reactor and support buildings at its Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center.While all the defense contractors picked have extensive missile defense experience, Lockheed has scored some key radar contracts recently.Lockheed is currently building the Long Range Discrimination Radar in Alaska. But Karako said the radar is too far north to see missiles headed to Hawaii from North Korea.Lockheed is also reportedly building its long-range radar for two of Japan's planned Aegis Ashore missile defense systems.Despite the large price tag, the X-Band Radar replacement can't be used against other emerging threats, such as hypersonic boost glide vehicles or a cruise missile attack, Karako said.""The Pentagon's missile defense review isn't out yet, but it was specifically tasked by Congress to look at the full range of missiles,"" he said.To counter sophisticated emerging threats from near-peer adversaries like China and Russia, space-based sensors will be needed as ground-based radars are limited by the curvature of the earth.Still, ground-based radars like the one slated for Hawaii will still be necessary as they augment space-based radars' coverage.Space-based sensors have been discussed by every administration since President Reagan's but haven't made it off the drawing board.""I predict this year a decision will be made,"" Karako saidYOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To WatchThis U.S. Ally Buys Boeing Spy Planes As China Tension Heats UpAir Force Urges This New Hypersonic Weapons Mindset, Faster RolloutAs North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works

504,SEE,"As I watch a great number of my fellow Americans and virtually all of the mainstream media descend further and further into irrational and immoral hysteria — regularly calling the president of the United States and all of his supporters Nazis, white supremacists and the like; harassing Republicans where they eat, shop and live; ending family ties and lifelong friendships with people who support the president; declaring their opposition to Trump and the Republican Party the ""Resistance,"" as if they were American reincarnations of the French who fought real Nazis in World War II; and so on — I ask myself: What is going on? How does one explain them?Here are some answers:Many Americans are naive, about life, about good and evil, and about America. They don't realize how rare America is and how good they have it. This mass naïveté was vividly expressed by the reaction of tens of thousands of mostly white middle-class Americans to then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008, when he was campaigning in Columbia, Missouri. Obama announced, ""We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.""I frequently play the recording of Obama's statement on my radio show not only to explain a basic difference between right and left — the left believes America needs to be fundamentally transformed, while the right thinks America needs to be incrementally improved — but also for people to hear the crowd's reaction.Very few contemporary American recordings are as depressing as the ecstatic and prolonged cheering the crowd gave that terrible promise from Obama. I believe it is not an exaggeration to say that had he announced a cure for cancer, the cheering could not have been louder and probably would not have been longer.Why would middle-class Americans — people who have more affluence, more opportunity, better health, better health care and more liberty than almost anyone alive in the world today, and certainly than anyone who ever lived — thunderously applaud a call to fundamentally transform their decent country?One answer — one of many, as we will see — is naïveté.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarlier this year, I had a debate/dialogue with two left-wing students at the University of California, Berkeley. I thought debating left-wing students, rather than giving a speech, would accomplish two objectives: deter left-wing protesters from disrupting my appearance and enable young people at Berkeley and around the world (via the internet) to hear differences between right and left clearly spelled out. Both aims were achieved.My final question to them was ""Do you believe people are basically good?"" Without a moment's pause, both students said yes.I told them they think that way because they live in such a decent country. It is easy to remain naive in America, where most are insulated from the suffering inflicted on so much of humanity in deeply corrupt, poverty-stricken and war-torn societies. Nevertheless, given the way humans have treated one another throughout history, and only two generations after Auschwitz, only the naive can believe people are basically good. And since no Western religion (i.e., any religion based on the Bible) has ever posited that people are basically good, this naïveté is abetted by secularism, which allows for the pursuit of knowledge but destroys wisdom.Only the naive — or willfully ignorant — could equate support for Donald Trump with Nazism. Are most Israeli Jews Nazis? Are a third of America's Jews Nazis? (Many on the left would probably answer yes, which gives you an idea how mean and sick many on the left are.)Boredom, at least in our time, is the most overlooked source of evil. In the past, before people went to college and abandoned religion — the two greatest reasons there is so much moral idiocy in our time — people knew how dangerous boredom was. ""Idle hands are the devil's workshop"" was a commonly used aphorism that wouldn't even make sense to most young people today.By bored I am not referring to a lack of things to do. There is more opportunity to do and experience things today than ever before. By bored I mean a deep boredom of the soul, what the French call ""ennui."" This is the boredom that emanates from lack of purpose and a yearning for excitement.The combination of affluence and secularism produces boredom as surely as the combination of hydrogen and oxygen produces water. Without affluence, people have a built-in purpose: obtaining food and shelter, supporting oneself and one's family, etc. And religion, with or without affluence, likewise has always provided people with meaning. Without religion, therefore, purpose is often lost. Add to that the number of people who are not married and do not have children (also a result of the combination of affluence and secularism) and you remove another universal source of meaning.A disproportionate percentage of those on the left (not traditional liberals) do not lack for material needs, have no religion and are single and/or childless. Those left-wing screamers you see in restaurants, the left-wing mobs on campus, the left-wing ""antifa"" thugs and the left-wing Black Lives Matter demonstrators who close down bridges and highways do not generally consist of married people with children who attended church the previous Sunday.These people find this lack of purpose assuaged by leftism. It provides meaning and excitement, a very heady combination.These are a few explanations.

510,SEE,"Sugar stockpiles are poised for a record as slowing demand growth and surging production creates the worst-performing commodity of 2018.Consumers have become increasingly wary of the health impact of their sweet tooth, and companies from canned-fruit maker Del Monte Foods Inc. to snack-food seller Mondelez International Inc. are touting products made with less sugar. While global consumption is still rising, the pace of growth has slowed to an average 1.4% in recent seasons, down from 1.7% over the past decade, according to researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists.That's coming at a time when production is booming, especially in India, the world's No. 2 producer. Farmers in Thailand are also collecting massive crops. World stockpiles are set to swell to the highest ever this season and stay near the record next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sugar futures in New York have already slumped 25% in 2018. That's the biggest loss on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 components.""Unless there's a weather issue, it doesn't look that the bulls have any hope for a sustained rally,"" said Donald Selkin, a New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which oversees about $2 billion. ""Everybody is trying to do away with sugar and sugary products. You see that in supermarkets and grocery stores. Demand is going to remain less than what's been in recent years. The price is doomed to stay low for a while.""On Monday, raw sugar for October delivery fell 1% to 11.4 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.Investors are setting up for more declines.In the week ended July 3, money managers more than tripled their net-short position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, to 54,736 futures and options, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Monday. The move came as short holdings increased 15%, while long bets fell almost 7%.Global production will top demand by 19.6 million metric tons in the 12 months that end Sept. 30, the biggest overhang ever, Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool said in a report last month. The excess would be more than enough to meet annual demand in China, the world's top importer.After farmers collected a mammoth crop, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said July 3 that processors are seeking to increase export quotas to a record 6 million tons. The group estimates the country's output at as much as 32 million tons, a gain of 58% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, in Brazil surging ethanol stockpiles and tumbling prices for the biofuel mean cane millers could process more of the crop into sugar.Of course, crops can still fail, especially if the weather turns worse than expected. Dry conditions have hurt plants in Brazil's central southern region, the world's biggest-producing locale. The potential for an El Nino weather pattern later this year could also mean some damage to Asian crops.But in a market where demand slowing, small supply shocks can often be absorbed. While health concerns and taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economies, Green Pool said that these factors are now being ""replicated"" in emerging markets.""All the bearish elements that had sugar pinned down initially are still in place, and some are even worse,"" said Frank Jenkins, the president of JSG Commodities in South Norwalk, Conn. ""We are looking for a long period of time with a very substantial surplus. We are in the fourth or fifth inning of this bear market.""

Celgene advanced 0.9%, to 84.56. Shares of biotech companies broadly dipped less than 1%.Luspatercept could stoke more confidence in Celgene, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said. The firm's biggest cancer drug, Revlimid, will soon face a patent cliff. But Celgene is working other angles in cancer drugs. It acquired Juno Therapeutics and is partnered with Bluebird Bio (BLUE).""We view this as another positive development that, after recent successes with (Juno's drug called) JCAR017 and (Bluebird's drug called) bb2121, could begin to re-instill investor confidence in the pipeline beyond Revlimid not substantially reflected in shares at current levels,"" he said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe study, called Believe, tested luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta thalassemia who are dependent on regular blood transfusions. These patients don't produce enough of a protein that carries oxygen throughout the body.Luspatercept showed a ""highly statistically significant"" improvement in red blood cell response. The goal was to reduce red blood cell transfusion burden by at least 33%. Researchers also looked for an absolute reduction of at least two transfusion units from week 13 to week 24 of the study.In addition, luspatercept also met all key secondary goals of the study. Side effects were consistent with previously reported data, the biotech companies said in a news release. The firms now plan to ask regulators in the U.S. and Europe to approve the drug in the first half of 2019.The news was largely expected. About two weeks ago, Celgene and Acceleron released positive data for luspatercept in another study. That late-stage test looked at the drug's ability to improve red blood cell response in patients with what are called myelodysplastic syndromes.Analysts had varied models on these two markets for luspatercept. Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster calls for $2 billion in peak sales for both disorders. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges sees $2.6 billion in peak 2025 sales for both uses.RBC's Abrahams models just $1.2 billion for luspatercept — a small fraction of the $12 billion in peak sales for Revlimid. But that could still help Celgene to fill its future Revlimid-shaped hole.""We see this, coupled with other positive pipeline developments for JCAR017 and bb2121 as putting the company (Celgene) on track to reach $10 billion in probability-adjusted sales for its current pipeline,"" he said.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff was more bearish on partner Acceleron. He downgraded Acceleron stock to a neutral rating and cut his price target to 52 from 55.Tenthoff acknowledged the win for luspatercept but said Acceleron is ""not a buy at this valuation.""He sees sales of $20 million in 2020 after U.S. and European officials likely approve luspatercept. The biggest opportunity for the drug is in myelodysplastic syndromes where it could replace current, less effective therapies.But the tail will be short, Tenthoff said. Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) are working on a potentially curative treatment for beta thalassemia. Their therapy could get approval by 2020, he said.""While not all patients will be appropriate for or able to afford gene therapy/CRISPR (a form of gene editing), we anticipate significant competitive pressure to impact Acceleron's market share,"" he said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

512,SEE,"When Delta Air Lines (DAL) releases second-quarter earnings on Thursday, Wall Street will be bracing for its response to the higher fuel costs and international tensions that have converged on airline stocks and profits this year.Delta Air Lines last month cut its second-quarter earnings-per-share outlook, citing a ""sharp rise"" in jet-fuel costs. The carrier this month stuck with that EPS forecast, of $1.65-$1.75, compared with Zacks forecasts for $1.75, up 7%. Analysts expect revenue to rise 8% to $11.679 billion.But fuel costs and labor are typically an airline's biggest expenses. Since Delta first cut its EPS outlook in June, analysts have been waiting to see whether the airline will trim flights from its schedule, or otherwise rearrange it, to recapture sales.Delta in June said it would make a decision on how to handle its flight-capacity plans for the fall. The company said that decision would be made ""through the lens of strong demand and volatile fuel.""""The first course of action may be to adjust their fall and winter schedules, while trying to raise fares in strong markets,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said in a research note last week.Despite the concerns about fuel, corporate and leisure travel remain solid. Delta expected a 4%-5% gain in second-quarter unit revenue, or an airline's sales as they relate to the scope of its flight coverage.""Delta's unit revenue outlook will be important as investors continue to worry about the industry's ability to raise ticket prices to cover rising jet fuel prices,"" Becker said in the note.Southwest Airlines (LUV) last month also pulled back its outlook for flight-capacity growth this year amid higher fuel costs. American Airlines (AAL) said travelers might have to deal with steeper fare prices as fuel costs run higher.Delta stock rose 0.2% in the stock market today. American Airlines stock lost 0.5%. Southwest Airlines stock retreated 0.5%. Delta, American and Southwest all recently hit their worst levels of the year.United Airlines (UAL) was down 0.7%. United stock tested support at its 50-day line; it has been consolidating for more than a year.Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani said in a research note Monday that he expected Delta to cut its earnings-per-share outlook for the year.

""In our conversations with investors, we have encountered far more excuses to sell them than reasons to buy them.""Analysts also worry about the state of Brazil's economy, and how much that will weigh on demand in Latin America. But any good news, Linenberg said, could be really good for airline stocks.""That said, investors' expectations toward the sector are quite low, and we are of the view that it probably wouldn't take much positive news to send airline shares higher by 5%-10%,"" he continued.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:S&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Delta Air Lines Flags This 'Wild Card' In Earnings Guidance This YearSouthwest To Abandon This Piece Of Its 'History And DNA' PermanentlyAirline Industry News And Stocks To Watch

516,SEE,"Dow futures rose modestly Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. The Dow Jones led another solid stock market advance Monday, with the S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite also strong following Friday's big rally. But quality breakouts were scarce. Monday's big winners tended to be recent laggards, including Dow Jones components Caterpillar (CAT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) as well as recent China livestreaming IPOs Huya (HUYA) and iQiyi (IQ).The lack of breakouts is somewhat surprising. Friday's post-jobs-report, post-China-tariffs surge triggered a shift in IBD's market direction back to confirmed uptrend. Given that stocks, even leading stocks, tend to follow the major averages, you'd expect to see some new breakouts. The Nasdaq composite is just below last month's record high, while the S&P 500 index is just below a four-month best, near a handle-like formation. The Dow Jones reclaimed its 50-day moving average Monday.There are some quality stocks working on buy points. Marathon Oil (MRO) and EOG Resources (EOG) are among the many energy stocks closing in on breakouts. Trendy apparel and handbag retailer Michael Kors (KORS) — along with Dollar General (DG) and Home Depot (HD) — is also in sight of an entry area. But none of these top stocks cleared buy points in Monday's stock market trading.Cactus (WHD) stock shot up 4.5% to 35.60 on Monday, clearing a 35.28 cup-with-handle buy point. But the maker of wellhead and pressure-control equipment tumbled late on plans for a follow-on offering. Cactus came public at 19 a share in early February.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

But Caterpillar stock is still below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. So are JPMorgan stock and Goldman stock, after both hit 2018 lows last week.Huya stock, a recent spinoff from YY (YY), shot up 18% Monday.

517,SEE,"Allergan's (AGN) blockbuster eye drug, Restasis, could outperform expectations this year, an analyst said Monday as she boosted her price target on the stock.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler raised her price target on Allergan stock to 194 from 176, though she kept her neutral rating. Koffler cited bullish views for Restasis sales in 2018 and longer-term expectations for Botox and Vraylar, a depression drug. But, there are still unknowns for other drugs, she said.""The stock has been edging higher and we pulled the model out an additional three years 2025 to assess if we are missing something in the story,"" Koffler said in a report to clients. ""Indeed, we found additional value, especially if management can remain disciplined about (operational expenses).""Koffler expects Restasis sales to be $278 million, $264 million and $136 million for the next three quarters. That tops the Street view for $247 million, $165 million and $87 million, respectively. Restasis increases the eyes' ability to produce tears in patients with chronically dry eyes.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseRestasis sales likely will be durable from May through July, she said. If that comes to fruition, Allergan may increase its full-year guidance. Meanwhile, Botox sales look strong longer term and Vraylar could grab approvals to treat more forms of depression.After 2018, Koffler's model lags the consensus which is likely running on the assumption the firm can grow at a 5% compounded annual rate from 2017-22. But Koffler sees only 2% growth over that time period. She has conservative views on Allergan's pipeline and international segment.Koffler doesn't ascribe any value to Allergan's ability to treat nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, a form of liver disease. She also has modest expectations for new eye drugs and a treatment for a digestive disorder. Further, the consensus may be missing patent cliffs for two drugs in 2021-22.Investors could be open to management turnover and restructuring attempts. Koffler, though, worries that Allergan could engage in risky mergers and acquisitions. At the same time, she sees Allergan's efforts to sell its women's health and anti-infection units as neutral to its valuation.""However, we don't expect the company to be acquired and there is still significant uncertainty about capital deployment, and whether management will pursue risky or expensive (mergers and acquisitions) or opt for a more conservative debt repayment strategy,"" she said.If Allergan goes the more conservative route for debt repayment, ""we could see an additional bump in the stock,"" she said.On the stock market today, Allergan rose 1.3% at the closing bell, to 176.84.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half PositionNew Option Strategy Limits Risk Around Earnings

518,SEE,"Hindsight may be 20/20, but with some studying, your stockpicking foresight can get pretty good, too.Foreseeing the move by a stock with terrific fundamentals, a No. 1 ranking in its industry, and loads of fund sponsorship, before it happens is crucial. If such a stock breaks out with force, then you're more likely to grab shares at the proper buy point.Think of the ""buy point"" as the ground floor of a potential elevator-like advance to new highs. It's not enough to just buy the right stock. You have to buy the right stock in the right way at the right time.Those who read Investor's Corner regularly have a strong command of one of the most important patterns in growth investing: the cup with handle. The pattern allows you to be consistent in your buying. You're essentially entering a stock only when it's reached the point in which it can rise fast in a relatively short time frame.Human nature hasn't changed. Greed and fear still drive the market. So the cup with handle and other useful patterns of investor behavior will continue to pop up among IBD's wide span of features and screens designed to help you find and buy great stocks at the right time.Make a habit of going through the stocks presented in IBD 50, Big Cap 20, Stock Spotlight, Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders and Stocks Near A Buy Zone. Most of these can be accessed via Stock Lists on the home page at Investors.com. (See the Income Investor columns by clicking on ""Research"" on the main navigation bar on the home page.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAre you completely new to chart analysis, or want to bring your skills up a notch? Check out the real-time annotations done in Leaderboard, which debuted in July 2011.A buy point is a price level at which a stock is most likely to begin a significant advance. It also points to an area of the chart that offers the least amount of resistance to price progress.Where that point is depends on the type of base the stock has formed, whether a cup with handle, a cup without handle, a flat base or double bottom.This is the critical moment. Identifying the correct buy point can make all the difference between a successful investment and a losing trade. And before you buy, always check that the Market Pulse table, updated every day in The Big Picture column, shows the current outlook as ""Market in confirmed uptrend.""Let's look first at one of the easiest buy points to spot: one from a cup without handle.In this type of base, the stock declines as much as 30% to 33% from a recent 52-week or all-time high, then starts to recover in a process that takes at least six weeks to complete. Once the ascent begins, there are no significant pullbacks, or anything that might be considered a handle.The buy point on this pattern is easy: 10 cents above the peak in the left side of the pattern.The flat base isn't much different. When the stock recovers and is 10 cents above the base's prior highest point, that's when you jump in.As the stock approaches new highs — building the right side of the cup pattern — the stock suddenly pulls back moderately in price. This pullback is up to 15% in depth but can be much less. According to IBD research, most handles in the most successful stocks show a drop of no more than 8% to 12% from the handle's highest price.Also, a good handle will form within the upper half of the base. How can you tell? Sometimes you can see it visually. Maybe the handle began forming when the stock was just a few points below the cup's left-side high.When it's difficult to tell, what should you do?Use the midpoint test. Add the highest price and lowest price within the cup, then divide by 2. Do the same with the handle.If the handle's midpoint is higher than the base's midpoint, a breakout has a better chance of succeeding. The stock has already shown strong demand by climbing off its lows, plowing past prior price levels in which some shareholders had bought and immediately harbored paper losses. As a stock rebounds, these folks eagerly sell and get rid of the stock.Use the highest level in the handle area and add 10 cents to derive the buy point.Take Seacoast Banking (SBCF) as an example from 2016. After the Donald Trump presidential election win on Nov. 8, bank stocks took off. Florida-based Seacoast joined the bandwagon with a gusher of a move from Nov. 9 to 14, rising as much as 9% during that time frame and clearing an 18.05 handle buy point on a nine-week cup pattern.The midpoint of the cup was 16.83 (15.85 + 17.80 divided by 2). The handle's midpoint of 17.38 (16.82 + 17.95 divided by 2) was higher, so it passed. As seen in Seacoast's case, sometimes, the handle may begin forming slightly above the cup's left-side high.The double-bottom base is a bit different. The stock forms a cup pattern, but makes another correction before it reaches new highs. The second bottom usually is lower than the first.The pattern has a W-shape. The buy point is the middle intraday peak of the W-shape plus 10 cents. Keep in mind that a handle may also form, presenting an alternative entry.No matter what type of base it is, the stock should pass its buy point in heavy volume. That gives you the confidence big investors are buying as well.How much volume should you expect? Trading should swell at least 40% above the stock's 50-day average volume.If you're watching a stock during the trading session and aren't sure if volume is so strong, check the stock quotes at Investors.com. The volume percentage change is continually calculated.Nursing care facility operator VistaCare went public in December 2002 and by April 2003, it had formed a cup base with a high handle (1). The highest price in the handle was 19.Within the handle, the stock fell 11.6%, in range with the typical handle on a cup base during a bull market. Meanwhile, stocks were taking off and leading growth names were bursting out of bases after the market followed through on March 17, 2003, Day 4 of a new rally attempt. On that day, the Nasdaq soared 3.9% in higher turnover; the S&P 500 gushed 3.5% higher.VistaCare broke out on April 28, 2003, in heavy volume, then held above the 19.10 buy point two weeks later during a pullback that became a bullish reversal (2).On the breakout day, VistaCare showed decent ratings  on IBD Stock Checkup despite being such a young new public company: a 72 Composite, 80 EPS, 78 RS and A- for Accumulation/Distribution.Investors who bought at the correct buy point stood to more than double their money by year's end.(A version of this column was originally published in the April 16, 2010, edition of IBD.

529,SEE,"The principal objection raised by opponents to the T-Mobile-Sprint merger is that it will reduce competition in the wireless industry. That argument, which sounds intuitively valid at first, rests on two flaws.The first flaw is that opposition to the merger as anti-competitive ignores the relative sizes of the existing major four carriers. Verizon and AT&T each have roughly one-third of all wireless users, while T-Mobile and Sprint each have roughly one-sixth.Particularly in the face of the enormous capital costs of implementing 5G technology nationwide, the two smallest competitors have a structural competitive disadvantage. Combining them would make three roughly equal-size competitors.That's a formula that virtually guarantees robust competition.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWithout the merger, the smaller two will be capital-constrained. They will probably lag in the rollout of 5G, if not at the outset, then later.They could each wind up with such a technological disadvantage that they begin to lose customers on an irreversible trend that could easily conclude with only two surviving major carriers. That possibility should trouble any free-market advocate.How ironic it would be if the opponents of the merger claiming it would reduce competition unwittingly set the stage for greater concentration and far less competition in the long run.Three similar-sized competitors will compete vigorously. But two competitors can settle into a comfortable oligopoly, in which competition is merely symbolic rather than real.Some opponents of the merger are recycling successful arguments from opposition to the failed AT&T-T-Mobile merger attempt in 2011.  Those arguments do not apply to the current case.That merger would have been anti-competitive. Why? It would have taken one of the scrappiest and most creative competitors, T-Mobile, out of the game altogether. It would have left Sprint alone as the only challenger to the potential Verizon-AT&T oligopoly.Like T-Mobile, Sprint has been an aggressive and innovative competitor. Putting those two together in the currently proposed merger will unify and strengthen the competitive alternative to a Verizon-AT&T oligopoly, whereas the proposed AT&T-T-Mobile merger of seven years ago would have weakened it.The second flaw in the arguments of opponents to the merger is that rolling out 5G technology by the two smaller competitors will likely result in duplicated and redundant 5G capacity in densely-populated cities at the cost of rural and middle America.There are myriad areas in our country with dead spots and weak coverage areas. If T-Mobile and Sprint remain separate and capital-constrained, then basic business economics will dictate that they concentrate their available capital deployment in major cities.It is in the public interest to expand 5G technology to unserved and under-served areas.  That's much more likely if costly and unnecessary duplication in urban areas is minimized.When the Department of Justice, the Federal Communications Commission and the Congress review the proposed merger, they should thoughtfully and thoroughly consider the long-term competitive impact, not only the immediate competitive impact.If they do, they should see that three strong competitors of roughly equal size will better serve the public interest. The proposed T-Mobile-Sprint merger is pro-competitive, not anti-competitive.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

537,SEE,"Many organizations are over-relying on supposed best practices due to the mindset of ""it's how we've always done things.""That's from Steve Goldbach, who with Geoff Tuff wrote ""Detonate: Why — and How — Corporations Must Blow Up Best Practices (And Bring a Beginner's Mind) To Survive."" Both authors are principals with professional services network giant Deloitte.""We have recently entered into an era when lessons of the past seem no longer to provide effective guidance,"" Tuff said. Best practices in many companies have become ""bad habits, and they may create blinders to impending disruption. To survive and thrive in a digital era, companies need to blow up the playbooks of the past in order to build something new and better.""Tips on knowing when and how to shake things up:Trigger new perspectives. The average life span of a company listed in the S&P 500 in the early 1960s was about 60 years. Today, it's under 20.This is partly because those once-successful companies clung on to their tried-and-true methods that worked well before. Instead they should have brought ""a beginner's mind to the challenge,"" Tuff said. ""Ironically, the best way for any company to stave off disruption from startups and unforeseen competition is to approach its business as if it is the underdog rather than the incumbent — and to continually refresh and renew.""Microscope status quos. Regularly ask: How does your company do things? How do you approach the competition?""Then you need to figure out which orthodoxies are legit,"" Tuff said. ""Some will need to exist: There are good regulatory and safety reasons that some playbooks need to remain sacrosanct. But not many will pass the test.""When you have a hunch an orthodoxy might be challenged, ask: What would it look like if we didn't do things that way? Do we see evidence of companies — in our industry or elsewhere — that don't follow the same rule?""Embrace differences. Whether in hiring or promotions, leaders often ask, ""Does this person fit in?"" This is the wrong question, says Francesca Gino, author of ""Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life."" She's also a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.""Companies should hire people who poke holes in the status quo,"" she said. ""When Catchafire founder and CEO Rachael Chong is deciding who to hire, she gives candidates problems the organization has struggled with or is currently facing. And then she looks for people who think differently from her and her team. She hires people who are going to challenge her and disagree with her thinking."" Catchafire connects skilled volunteers to nonprofits.Be nimble. Experience provides confidence to make quick decisions on the toughest problems, Gino says. ""But a narrow focus on what we already know cuts us off from all we have left to learn, hindering creativity,"" she added.An example she uses: In January 2009, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger had 208 seconds to make a decision after his plane was disabled by a flock of geese. ""Landing at the nearest airport was the most obvious answer,"" she said. ""But he put aside more than 30,000 hours of flying experience and kept an open mind.""Sullenberger quickly determined he'd never make it to an airport and instead made a daring water landing in the Hudson River.Shake things up. Stability can be overrated, Gino says.Whether in leadership or work it's easy to fall into ""comfortable, almost mindless routines,"" she added. ""That pattern allows people to make predictions about the future — to know how work will look tomorrow.""People find more joy in work when they are allowed and encouraged to come up with better ways of getting things accomplished. As a result, they are engaged, and the data show ""they are more than three times as creative as their disengaged counterparts, and perform 20% better than them,"" Gino said.

546,SEE,"It seems that everything is going the energy sector's way.The price of oil is trending higher, and the sector is expected to blow the doors off second-quarter earnings. Energy companies on the whole are expected to expand earnings 139.8% in Q2 as the sector continues to emerge from a two-year earnings recession, according to research firm CFRA.Indeed, many companies' earnings are still coming up against easy year-ago comparisons. For example, the consensus estimate for Occidental Petroleum's (OXY) EPS of 693% growth compares against a profit of just 15 cents a share in Q2 of 2017.Crude is the tide that lifts all oil stocks, and the price of U.S. oil briefly topped $75 a barrel the past week. It was the highest level since November 2014. Major oil-producing countries are keeping supplies from swelling, and supply constraints pop up in Iran, Libya and Venezuela. Meanwhile, producers continue driving down costs.Among IBD's industry groups, only U.S. exploration and production is in the top 20 of 197 groups. Drilling is No. 57.Energy's expected profit growth is far above any other sector. The second-best sector is materials, with a projected growth of 29.6% thanks to higher commodity prices and higher volumes, says Lindsey Bell, CFRA investment strategist.Financials and information technology are forecast to grow profits 22.7% and 21.3%, respectively. The other seven S&P sectors are estimated to lag the S&P 500's overall profit increase.Technology remains the market's big profit engine. It's headed for the seventh quarter in a row in the top three sectors and the eighth quarter with double-digit growth, Bell notes. Telecommunications is seen rising 15.2%, industrials 14.1%, consumer discretionary 13.4%, health care 9.9% and consumer staples 7.4%. Real estate and utilities are the only sector indicated to decrease Q2 earnings, down 3.8% and 1.5%.For the entire S&P 500, CFRA sees another strong quarter of 19.5% growth. Historically, quarterly growth ends up 3.5 to 4.5 percentage points higher than initial estimates. That might put final earnings up 23%, on par with the 23.3% increase recorded in the first quarter.""We expect this will be the second quarter in a row for earnings growth of greater than 20%, something that hasn't been recorded since 2010 (a result of a rebound in earnings off recessionary declines),"" Bell wrote in a June 28 report. ""This time the robust growth rate is a reflection of strong sales growth and reduced tax rates from the new tax policy.""Revenue for the S&P 500 is expected to increase 8.9%. Materials is forecast to grow sales 30.3%, energy 19.7%, health care 14.7% and technology 11.4%. Consumer staples and utilities are the only sectors expected to report a decline in sales.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70

550,SEE,"Just as Prime Minister Theresa May softened her plan for leaving the European Union -- a move that companies welcomed -- the resignation of the U.K.'s top Brexit officials and foreign secretary creates new uncertainty for business.XCarolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, called the weekend resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and his deputy, Steve Baker, a ""blow"" on Monday morning. On Monday afternoon, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson also resigned.The departures come just days after May said she had secured cabinet backing for a plan to keep close ties to the European Union. The resignations increase the chances she'll face a leadership challenge over her Brexit policy.""One of the things that business welcomed on Friday was finally cabinet unity,"" Fairbairn said on BBC Radio. ""It's all going to be about what happens next, because actually there were real rays of light in the conclusion from Friday.""May on Monday named Dominic Raab, a housing minister and Brexit backer, to replace Davis as Brexit secretary. Johnson's replacement is yet to be announced.While business has favored greater alignment with the EU, the departures could destabilize May's government, creating new turmoil for companies trying to figure out how to deal with Brexit. Before May announced the cabinet agreement, companies ranging from Airbus (EADSY) to Jaguar Land Rover to BMW warned of the consequences of leaving the EU with no deal or one that's unfriendly to global businesses.Dutch health-technology company Philips (PHG) also said over the weekend that it may move manufacturing out of the U.K., where it employs 1,500 people, in the event of a hard Brexit.Though the resignations could give May the chance to install a Brexit team that's more attuned to business concerns, the prospect of challenges to her leadership adds a degree of uncertainty that makes it hard for companies to plan investments.But for a lot of businesses, the departures will be seen purely as personnel changes, according to William Bain, a British Retail Consortium policy adviser and former lawmaker. What companies are focused on now is the white paper that will be published Thursday.""We know the twists and turns there can be in politics but what's fundamental is, are we making progress toward our withdrawal agreement?"" Bain said. ""Are we, in terms of the final relationship, getting to something that's going to avoid border controls?""In a sign of the fallout, investment from abroad in Britain's financial-services firms fell 26% last year, EY said in a report released Monday. During the same period, Germany experienced a 64% increase, while the figure for France more than doubled.The pound was trading down 0.1% at $1.3274 shortly after Johnson's resignation was announced.Even for those businesses that welcomed the direction the government set out Friday, uncertainty remains over whether the EU will go along with it.""For a big part of the economy, the proposals on the table will not be sufficient,"" said Pascal Kerneis, managing director of the European Services Forum, which lobbies for services companies including BT Group Plc.

551,SEE,"Nissan Motor (NSANY), the Japanese carmaker that was embroiled in a vehicle-inspection scandal last year, said it uncovered some instances of misconduct involving falsified data about exhaust emissions and fuel economy.XThe data falsification, which occurred on 19 models across five plants in Japan, was found out when the company was carrying out an internal check about employees conducting final inspection of vehicles, Nissan said at its Yokohama headquarters Monday. The incident won't lead to any recalls as the vehicles meet catalog specifications for fuel economy and emissions, according to the company.Although the tests were not in line with Japanese government requirements, the incident -- based on what has been disclosed -- may not be as threatening as the emission scandal that engulfed Volkswagen (VLKAY). Testing of vehicle emissions rose to prominence globally after the European carmaker was caught fitting devices on its diesel vehicles that helped it overcome the standards. German authorities are still scrutinizing the automaker. Daimler is also under investigation, and both face lawsuits in Germany and the U.S.During the checks, Nissan found out that employees misrepresented temperature and humidity data in the testing chamber and manipulated emission data on carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The automaker has hired a law firm to investigate the matter further.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNissan's announcement, following an inspection debacle that led to the recall of about 1.2 million vehicles last year, is the latest in a string of compliance scandals at carmakers including Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Subaru Corp. that has dented the reputation of Japan's manufacturing sector.Nissan dropped 4.6% in Tokyo, the largest decline since November 2016, before the company held a press conference Monday. The stock has lost 11% of its value this year.Renault, which is the largest shareholder of Nissan, tumbled as much as 2.6% initially, before recouping some of those losses.Hiroto Saikawa, 64, said last year he and other officials at the carmaker will take a voluntary pay cut after the car inspection crisis led to a vehicle recall in Japan and a reduction in its profit forecast. Nissan halted vehicle registrations in Japan after its inspection process was deemed faulty by the government.Workers not authorized to certify vehicles approved the final inspection at the very end of assembly lines and that process may have dated back to 1979 at its Tochigi plant, according to a report last year from Nissan and a third-party law firm it assigned to investigate.Last year, Kobe Steel Ltd. said it sold products that failed quality control tests to over 500 companies. Subaru, which admitted to manipulating emission data records to match mileage submitted to the government, was also embroiled in a similar controversy as Nissan's. Yasuyuki Yoshinaga stepped down as Subaru CEO this year.Nissan bailed out Mitsubishi Motors in 2016 after the company was caught falsifying mileage estimates for several of its vehicles. Suzuki Motor Corp. Chairman Osamu Suzuki ceded the role of CEO after the automaker admitted to using unapproved fuel-economy testing methods in 2016.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

553,SEE,"Many organizations are over-relying on supposed best practices due to the mindset of ""it's how we've always done things.""That's from Steve Goldbach, who with Geoff Tuff wrote ""Detonate: Why — and How — Corporations Must Blow Up Best Practices (And Bring a Beginner's Mind) To Survive."" Both authors are principals with professional services network giant Deloitte.""We have recently entered into an era when lessons of the past seem no longer to provide effective guidance,"" Tuff said. Best practices in many companies have become ""bad habits, and they may create blinders to impending disruption. To survive and thrive in a digital era, companies need to blow up the playbooks of the past in order to build something new and better.""Tips on knowing when and how to shake things up:Trigger new perspectives. The average life span of a company listed in the S&P 500 in the early 1960s was about 60 years. Today, it's under 20.This is partly because those once-successful companies clung on to their tried-and-true methods that worked well before. Instead they should have brought ""a beginner's mind to the challenge,"" Tuff said. ""Ironically, the best way for any company to stave off disruption from startups and unforeseen competition is to approach its business as if it is the underdog rather than the incumbent — and to continually refresh and renew.""Microscope status quos. Regularly ask: How does your company do things? How do you approach the competition?""Then you need to figure out which orthodoxies are legit,"" Tuff said. ""Some will need to exist: There are good regulatory and safety reasons that some playbooks need to remain sacrosanct. But not many will pass the test.""When you have a hunch an orthodoxy might be challenged, ask: What would it look like if we didn't do things that way? Do we see evidence of companies — in our industry or elsewhere — that don't follow the same rule?""Embrace differences. Whether in hiring or promotions, leaders often ask, ""Does this person fit in?"" This is the wrong question, says Francesca Gino, author of ""Rebel Talent: Why It Pays to Break the Rules at Work and in Life."" She's also a professor of business administration at Harvard Business School.""Companies should hire people who poke holes in the status quo,"" she said. ""When Catchafire founder and CEO Rachael Chong is deciding who to hire, she gives candidates problems the organization has struggled with or is currently facing. And then she looks for people who think differently from her and her team. She hires people who are going to challenge her and disagree with her thinking."" Catchafire connects skilled volunteers to nonprofits.Be nimble. Experience provides confidence to make quick decisions on the toughest problems, Gino says. ""But a narrow focus on what we already know cuts us off from all we have left to learn, hindering creativity,"" she added.An example she uses: In January 2009, Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger had 208 seconds to make a decision after his plane was disabled by a flock of geese. ""Landing at the nearest airport was the most obvious answer,"" she said. ""But he put aside more than 30,000 hours of flying experience and kept an open mind.""Sullenberger quickly determined he'd never make it to an airport and instead made a daring water landing in the Hudson River.Shake things up. Stability can be overrated, Gino says.Whether in leadership or work it's easy to fall into ""comfortable, almost mindless routines,"" she added. ""That pattern allows people to make predictions about the future — to know how work will look tomorrow.""People find more joy in work when they are allowed and encouraged to come up with better ways of getting things accomplished. As a result, they are engaged, and the data show ""they are more than three times as creative as their disengaged counterparts, and perform 20% better than them,"" Gino said.

554,SEE,"An agreement by Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE) to defer drug price increases in an effort to play nice with President Donald Trump led analysts Wednesday to question what the fallout of the drug giant's action would be for the industry.Analysts wondered whether other pharmaceutical companies would follow Pfizer's example. Though, notably, Celgene (CELG) is still going ahead with 5% increases for blockbuster cancer drugs Revlimid and Pomalyst, RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a report.""Pfizer's unprecedented reversal of its early July price increases marks tangible administrative influence,"" Morgan Stanley analyst David Risinger said in his report to clients. He noted Pfizer is awaiting more details from a so-called blueprint to tug down drug prices in the U.S.Late Tuesday, Pfizer said Chief Executive Ian Read had an extensive discussion with Trump, leading the company to back off price increases on drugs that had been effective July 1. Earlier in the week, Trump attacked Pfizer and others for raising ""drug prices for no reason.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Pfizer shares the president's concern for patients and commitment to providing affordable access to the medicines they need,"" Read said in a written statement. He also noted Pfizer had committed $5 billion of capital to expand manufacturing in the U.S.But not everyone jived with Pfizer's and Trump's announcements.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Pfizer and the Trump administration to reveal the details of the arrangement that led Pfizer to back off drug prices increases.""Secret, sweetheart arrangements with Big Pharma companies are exactly why America's drug pricing system is broken,"" he tweeted. ""Trump and his Admin are busy trying to score cheap PR points why Pharma (companies) continue to raise prices by DOUBLE digits.""Pfizer stock dipped 0.6% at the close, to 37.21. Broadly, shares of pharmaceutical companies fell about the same amount on the stock market today.Trump renewed his pledge in May to lower the cost of prescription medicine in the U.S. At the time, analysts largely said the proposed blueprint appeared to be more rhetoric than reform.Morgan Stanley's Risinger believes Pfizer's U.S. price increase reversal could have slightly negative implications for the second-quarter earnings season. He notes Pfizer's updated guidance commentary will be key later this month.""In addition, the news could put a near-term damper on future price increase action by other pharma-bio companies,"" he said. ""But Pfizer indicated that its action is temporary since it only committed to keeping prices unchanged through the end of 2018.""Other pharmaceutical companies could also rethink their 2019 guidance, he said.""Whether manufacturers limit themselves to one price increase per year or hold off entirely on customary January increases is key swing factor to earnings which we think is underestimated by the market,"" he said.Even Celgene's price increases for Revlimid and Pomalyst remain in line with 2018 medical inflation of 5.3%, RBC's Abrahams said. They are also below historical increases. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences (GILD) joined Pfizer and walked back on planned price increases, he noted.""We see this more reserved price increase and increased transparency as potentially tempering headline risk and public scrutiny, as has been experienced by Pfizer, and it's in line with our view that companies will self-police in price increases to a much larger degree from now on,"" he said.Also Wednesday, Pfizer announced it would split its business into three distinct units in 2019 as it contends with looming losses of exclusivity. Under the restructuring, Pfizer's Innovative Medicines division will include biosimilars, anti-infection drugs and sterile injectables. Its Established Medicines unit will include off-patent branded and generic drugs, Finally, the company's Consumer Healthcare branch will hold all over-the-counter medicines.Innovative Medicines will run all the current Innovative Health businesses as well as the new Hospital Medicines business unit. Pfizer will also incorporate its biosimilar portfolio into its Oncology, and Inflammation and Immunology units.Established Medicines will hold the majority of Pfizer's off-patent drugs. This includes Lyrica, cholesterol drug Lipitor, high blood pressure drug Norvasc and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra. The business will run globally.The unit is meant to operate ""as a true stand-alone business within Pfizer,"" the company said in a news release. It will have its own manufacturing, marketing, regulatory and, with some exceptions, enabling functions.Consumer Healthcare, on the other hand, differs from Pfizer's two prescription medicine businesses, Pfizer said. The firm confirmed it's still mulling strategic alternatives for this unit. It expects to make a decision before the end of the year.""Trends in consumerism and an increased focus on staying healthy are causing consumers to seek easily accessible health and wellness solutions,"" the firm said.

556,SEE,"It's a mystery. The U.S. economy seems strong. Since the nadir of the Great Recession, employers have added about 19 million workers. The unemployment rate is 4%, near the lowest level since 2000. By standard economic theory, the strong demand for labor should be pushing up wages. But that isn't happening. Wage gains of 2.7% roughly match inflation.And no one really knows why.The puzzle is not just American. It also applies to much of Europe and Japan. ""Wage growth is still missing in action,"" declares a new report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Worse, the ""unprecedented wage stagnation is not evenly distributed across workers."" While wages of the top 1% are growing, they're stagnating for most others. Inequality and resentment worsen.Nor does the media agree on what's happening. Many publications have run stories exploring the wage puzzle.

""I'm sure that many workers — both relatively new entrants and those with long experience — have had moments when they felt lucky to have a job at all. Even though the economy has been strengthening for years, are workers reluctant to go into the boss's office and ask for a raise? Likewise, are employers used to resisting increases in their payroll obligations.""Maybe.Strain admits that this is just a guess, and finding corroborating evidence is hard. He also usefully lists other theories. With thanks and apologies to him, here's a summary of his summary.(1) There's more ""slack"" in labor markets than standard employment statistics indicate. People who had given up looking for work are re-entering the job market. More than 5 million people say they'd like a job but aren't counted in the labor market because they're not looking.(2) Demographics — the aging of American society — distort reported wage changes. As well-paid baby-boom workers retire, they're being replaced by younger and not-so-well paid workers, even though their wages may be rising. But the effect is diluted by the loss of retirees' high wages.(3) Employers are competing for workers ""using levers other than wages"" — better fringe benefits, signing bonuses, laxer overall standards in hiring. Although these have economic value, they don't boost wages.(4) Some employers refrained from cutting wages during the worst of the recession and are now trying to offset these higher costs by delaying new wage increases.(5) There is no problem — only a misinterpretation of economic data. Strain cites a study by Adam Ozimek of Moody's Analytics that examined the ""employment rate"" (the share of a population with a job), as opposed to the unemployment rate, and found that wages are ""growing at a pace you would expect."" Similarly, slow productivity growth implies slow wage growth.Strain declares himself impressed but not convinced.

Both small caps and large caps could not escape the selling in stocks today. Some retailers sold off especially hard.At 2 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average led the sell-off and traded near session lows Wednesday, down 0.9%; the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite dropped 0.6% to 0.8%. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time Tuesday on the Nasdaq but was slightly lower on the NYSE.The S&P SmallCap 600 slipped 0.7%.Utilities advanced. Airlines fell hard despite a more than 4% sell-off in West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices. It's been a torrid year so far for crude oil, though. At $70.52 a barrel, WTI near-term futures still claim a 16.7% gain since Jan. 1.Within the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average, export-heavy firms suffered the brunt of the selling.

Floor & Decor (FND) and kitchen goods and furniture retailer Williams-Sonoma (WSM) both dropped hard in heavy turnover. The former gouged its 50-day moving average as shares dropped more than 5% to 48.71 in quadruple usual trade.In a 10-K filing to the SEC, Williams-Sonoma has noted that a dependence on foreign vendors and ""our increased global operations subject us to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could impact our operations and financial results.""

573,SEE,"Online fashion play Stitch Fix broke out of a new base and Apple continued to motor higher as the Nasdaq composite commanded the market upside, rising more than 1.3% during late-afternoon trading in stocks today.Clearly, large-cap techs in the fields of software, e-commerce, biotech and semiconductors led the way. The S&P 500 rallied nearly 0.9%, better than an almost 0.5% lift for the Dow Jones industrial average.A strong U.S. jobs report for June did not send bond investors fleeing the debt market. In fact, Treasuries saw good demand on the long end as Friday marked an official start of billions of dollars in U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond slipped 2 basis points to 2.82%.""The top-level takeaway is that the labor market remains consistent with robust economic growth but not yet tight enough to generate the kind of upward inflation pressures that would encourage the Fed to raise rates more rapidly,"" said Eric Winograd, senior economist at the mutual fund giant AB.  ""One very encouraging aspect of the labor market over a longer time horizon is that the employment/population ratio is steadily marching higher.""The U.S. economy added 213,000 jobs in June, higher than forecasts of 190,000. Average hourly wages rose 2.7% year over year, just below the 2.8% Econoday consensus forecast.Jeffrey Cleveland, chief economist at Los Angeles-based money manager Payden & Rygel, points out that while nonsupervisory wage growth ""continues to slowly climb,"" he's not seeing evidence of an ""overheating"" economy. That particular factor of wage increases hit a current economic cycle high of 2.8% in June. Plus, manufacturing jobs increased by 36,000 amid widespread media coverage on the tit-for-tat tariffs on imports.""So, two very popular narratives (trade and overheating) are not seeing much love in the June jobs report,"" Cleveland told IBD.Stitch Fix (SFIX), which went public at $15 a share in November last year, is trying to surpass upside resistance near 30. The stock peaked at 30.07 in December, then began forming its first authentic base pattern.The San Francisco-based company is a small cap with a market value of $3.1 billion, a float of 27 million shares, and 97 million total shares outstanding.That base has a boxy shape and is not a double bottom, since the June 4 low of 18.02 did not undercut a first low of 18.00 seen four months earlier.Yet notice on the accompanying weekly chart how Stitch Fix's action shows several positive factors.One, the stock is leading the 10-week moving average, drawn in red, higher. Two, the relative strength line (painted in blue in all IBD charts and in MarketSmith) is rocketing into new high ground. This means Stitch Fix is beating the pants off the S&P 500.Three, the strong weekly gain is not a fluke; Over the past five weeks, the e-commerce play had already seen three strong weekly gains in heavy volume. That's a strong clue the institutional crowd is accumulating shares.According to Stock Checkup, Stitch Fix holds a fantastic 97 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99.That ranks it No. 4 in terms of this special rating, combining fundamental, stock price strength, and institutional sponsorship quality measures, within the Retail-Internet industry group. The Internet-Retail group itself is ranked No. 14 on a six-month relative basis among 197 industries tracked each day by IBD.Stitch Fix has turned in an annual profit for three years in a row, but quarterly earnings can be lumpy. Seasonality may be one factor. Plus, the company is new and so must invest heavily for future growth.Earnings fell 67% to 5 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in October, then slid 50% to 7 cents in the January-ended second quarter. But the bottom line jumped 200% to 9 cents a share in Q3 ended in April.The Street sees fiscal Q4 profit of 3 cents a share vs. a loss of one penny in the year-ago quarter.What has been consistent? Sales growth. The top line has bulged 139%, 51%, 35%, 26%, 26%, 25%, 24% and 29% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters. Analysts on consensus expect fiscal Q4 sales rising 23% to $317.7 million and FY 2018 sales up 26% to $1.23 billion.Top ranked within that group: Etsy (ETSY), the global online e-commerce platform for artisans, artists and photographers. Etsy is a member of IBD Leaderboard. The IBD premium service, started in 2011, helps investors pick outstanding growth stocks. The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard stocks get annotations in real time to pinpoint prime buy points and sell signals.Etsy joined the Leaders list on Feb. 28 as a full-sized position. At that time, shares gapped up and out of a well-formed cup without handle.That cup without handle featured a standard 21.96 buy point. Go to a Leaderboard daily chart to see the alternative entry.Today, Etsy is approaching the 45 price level.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to do heavy lifting for all the major indexes with a 1.2% jump to 187.61. At that price, it remains barely within the 5% buy zone.The iPhone, iMac, digital wearables and digital services giant has risen at a slow and steady pace since it cleared a proper double bottom and a 179.04 buy point.Please see this recent Stock Market Today piece on why Apple's improving fundamentals make the stock a difficult one to defy. As noted in the IBD ""Click"" all things tech blog on Friday, Apple got a price-target hike from Loop Capital on solid growth prospects for its new iPhones.Elsewhere in stocks today, gold mining, wholesale food, newspaper, major retail discount chain, alcohol and homebuilder stocks failed to join the buying fest. These groups and a few others fell 0.5% to 3.8%.Keep track of the top industry groups within IBD's ranking of 197, for the best growth stocks tend to hail from leading industries, not lagging ones.Biogen (BIIB), which has made big gains in past bull market cycles, looks eager to lead again.The stock, getting a boost from positive results in a middle-stage trial for a new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, gapped up at the open and surged more than 19%. The intraday high of 367.89 came within less than 3 points of the new cup base's left-side peak.Biogen has grown earnings 22%, 4% and 16% vs. year-ago levels in the past three quarters on sales gains of 4%, 15% and 11%.According to IBD Stock Checkup, Biogen's Relative Price Strength Rating is a lowly 58 on a scale of 1 to 99. But after Friday's massive gain, expect that RS Rating to rise quickly.Focus on stocks with an RS Rating of 80 or higher. This means you'll put hard-earned money only in those companies that are outperforming at least 80% of the entire stock market over the past 12 months.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and financial markets.)Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:What's New In The Top IBD Growth Screens?

574,SEE,"Here's your Investing Action Plan for Tuesday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. General Motors (GM) reports U.S. auto sales for the second quarter just after Tesla reported production jumped 55% in Q2. Ford Motor (F), Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), Toyota Motor (TM) and other automakers report June sales results. GM stock and other auto stocks aside from Tesla have retreated in recent weeks as the Trump trade war turns to auto tariffs.June sales are likely to be strong, thanks in part to an extra selling day and weekend this year, industry analysts say. The annualized pace of U.S. auto sales in June is estimated to rise to 17.1 million after dipping to 16.9 million in May, according to Edmunds. Fiat Chrysler, Toyota Motor and Ford Motor should grow sales 7%, 4% and 1%, respectively. But Nissan is likely to see sales shrink 7% from a year ago.GM sales release Tuesday will be the automaker's first on a quarterly basis since it abandoned monthly reports in April.Trade concerns hammered most auto stocks in June.GM warned Friday that if President Donald Trump charged ahead with tariffs, the move could result in ""less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages"" for its workers. The Association of Global Automakers, comprised of 14 carmakers, also pushed back against the proposals to impose high tariffs on vehicle imports and auto parts on national security grounds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""These tariffs will harm today's U.S. auto industry ... and tariffs will substantially increase prices for consumers,"" John Bozzella, president of the group, said last week, adding ""retaliation against U.S. exports is inevitable.""But Trump on Sunday told Fox News that he sees auto tariffs as the ""big"" weapon in trade negotiations to force other countries to give concessions.Shares of GM rallied to close up 0.3% at 39.51.  GM technically is in a cup-with-handle base with a 45.10 buy point last month. But shares are more than 10% below the buy point. Ford rose slightly while Toyota and Honda edged lower on the stock market today, all mired well below their 50-day moving averages.Fiat Chrysler rose 1.1% but also sits below the 50-day line.Tesla jumped more than 6% intraday on its Model 3 production success, but reversed to trade down 2.3%.German automakers are seen as most at-risk from Trump trade war fallout. Their stocks have been among the biggest losers in recent weeks. Daimler (DDAIF) last month warned on full-year profit, citing the impact of Chinese tariffs on U.S.-made vehicles.The specter of tit-for-tat tariffs from China, Europe and other key markets comes at a tense moment for automakers. Car site Edmunds sees several challenges in the auto market, which could be near a tipping point.""The strength of the economy is creating a very thick forcefield for automakers now, but once that starts to weaken, there are a lot of market factors bubbling just below the surface that could really start to slow down sales,"" said Jeremy Acevedo, manager of industry analysis at Edmunds. ""Even though millennials are finally starting to buy new vehicles, the U.S. market is virtually saturated. Add to that record-high vehicle prices, rising interest rates and historically high numbers of people who owe more than their cars are worth, and the stage is set for a market contraction.""Both industry experts and carmakers expect the annualized pace of U.S. auto sales to dip below 17 million in 2018, for the first time in years.Meanwhile, automakers are investing staggering sums of money in developing self-driving cars, though consumers remain cool on the idea.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Tesla Meets Goal Of 5,000 Model 3 VehiclesToyota: Trump Tariffs On Autos Would Undermine National SecurityHere Are The 5 Biggest Dow Jones Stock Losers This YearRetail, Energy Among Top Stock Plays As Sector Rotation OccursIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

The fund is up about 20% year to date. Now, shares are rising from a pullback to the 50-day moving average, leaving the ETF in a buy area.It's been a strong tide that has lifted a great many software stocks, including the fund's top holdings.Salesforce.com (CRM) — the largest holding with nearly 9% of the fund — broke out of a flat base in January and again in May. Microsoft (MSFT) (8.4% of the ETF) has been rising since a breakout Dec. 15 despite a bumpy 2018.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Intuit (INTU) (4.6%) keeps finding support at its 50-day moving average.But Oracle (ORCL), the fourth-largest holding with 8%, has struggled in 2018. After hitting a record high in March, the stock plunged more than 9% March 20 after disappointing quarterly results.In all, iShares North America Tech Software has nearly 65 holdings. The $1.87 billion fund separates its holdings into application software, which is more than half the portfolio; systems software, 35% of assets; and home entertainment software, which is about 13%.The technology sector is expected to again have a strong showing when second-quarter earnings come out. FactSet estimates a healthy 24.6% increase. Broken down by industry, software comes out relatively weaker.

578,SEE,"Social media giants like Twitter and Facebook that used to brag about promoting free speech now say they're taking on a new role — the speech police.Twitter is suspending as many as a million accounts a day, with 70 million silenced in May and June, according to data disclosed Friday. The massive purge is to prevent the spread of fake news, Twitter says. The problem is this: Who decides what's fake?Democrats in Congress are encouraging the crackdown. They point to how Russians set up social media accounts and flooded the internet with phony news and inflammatory rhetoric in the months before the 2016 presidential election, and according to special counsel Robert Mueller, tilted it in favor of Donald Trump. At a Senate hearing, Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., ordered lawyers for Facebook, Twitter and Google to do something about it ""or we will.""Don't be fooled by these calls to ""clean up"" the internet in order to protect our democracy. Fake news, hateful remarks and Russians impersonating Americans are not as dangerous to our democracy as Silicon Valley's misguided drive toward censorship.It's probably true that Russians tried to meddle with public opinion to tip the election in Trump's favor. But the Russians' antics, laid out in an indictment by special counsel Robert Mueller, are laughably unthreatening.The 13 Russians named in the indictment created thousands of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts and posted messages like ""Choose Peace and Vote for Jill Stein. Trust me, it's not a wasted vote."" This is the voter manipulation we're supposed to be terrified by?Mueller's indictment says this tiny crew of Russians ""engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump."" The correct reaction to these Russian high jinks is ""so what?"" American democracy has survived political dirty tricks by foreigners for two centuries.In 1796, agents of the French government tried to tilt the election toward Thomas Jefferson by smearing incumbent Vice President John Adams as a monarchist and organizing local pro-Jefferson societies in many states. In the 1940 presidential election, the British spread propaganda to defeat Wendell Willkie and ensure FDR's re-election, because Willkie opposed the U.S. joining Britain's battle against the Nazis.Foreign shenanigans are nothing new. You wouldn't be hearing about Russian interference if Hillary Clinton had won.Far more perilous to our democracy is the misguided expectation that global social media companies should act as the Ministry of Truth, like in George Orwell's novel ""Nineteen Eighty-Four.""Facebook's attempt at policing is producing comical failures. In the run-up to July Fourth, a small Texas newspaper, the Liberty County Vindicator, posted the Declaration of Independence, including its reference to ""merciless Indian savages."" Facebook uses algorithms to automatically shut down any posting with words that could be hurtful. So Facebook labeled the Declaration hate speech and took it down.Facebook singles out some postings as misleading. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center explains that it's ""about going after conservative talk on the internet and banning it by somehow projecting it as being false."" Similarly, Twitter tags tweets from the conservative news aggregator Drudge Report as ""sensitive content,"" complains House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif.Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey is committed to promoting ""healthy conversation."" That's like colleges calling for safe spaces. It's harmful to democracy, because discord and political controversy are what make democracy thrive. That's why the founders wrote the First Amendment, to protect unrestrained debate in the public square.Social media platforms should be the 21st-century version of the public square, where the free exchange of information and political opinions is guaranteed, not censored.Germany's learning that the hard way. A new German law requires social media companies to delete questionable content within 24 hours — taking on a role similar to what Feinstein suggested.Already it's backfiring in Germany. ""Legitimate expressions of opinion are being deleted,"" says Bernhard Rohleder, CEO of Bitkom, Germany's federal association for information technology and new media. Germans see their freedom of expression and access to information being curbed by global social media companies.Don't let it happen here.

579,SEE,"Apple (AAPL) will have a tough time increasing average selling prices with its next-generation iPhones, given consumer pushback over higher prices for its current-generation handsets.That's the view of Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty from a note to clients Friday. Huberty predicted that Apple's upcoming 12th-generation iPhones are unlikely to boost the company's average selling prices for smartphones.She is forecasting average selling prices for iPhones in fiscal 2019 of $730, down 1.8%. Apple's next fiscal year starts Sept. 30.Apple is unlikely to raise the price of its top-of-the-line model. That's the current iPhone X, which starts at $999, she said. Unit sales volumes dipped this iPhone cycle as consumers balked at higher prices. They also held on to their existing handsets longer.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHowever, Apple could see an increase to iPhone average selling prices if it boosts the price of a new midrange handset, Huberty said. That handset is expected to have a 6.1-inch LCD screen.Analysts expect Apple to release three new iPhone models this fall. In addition to the big-screen LCD phone, Apple is expected to come out with two new OLED screen models. One OLED iPhone will have a 5.8-inch display like the current iPhone X, while the other will have a jumbo 6.5-inch display, she said.""We see upside to our $730 (ASP) estimate if Apple prices the non-flagship 6.1-inch LCD iPhone at over $700,"" Huberty said. IPhone average selling prices could rise as much as 2% next year under this scenario, she said.As is its custom, Apple likely will reduce the prices of its current handsets by $100 each when it comes out with the new iPhones, Huberty said.She expects iPhone shipments to decline 1% year over year to 215 million units in fiscal 2018. Meanwhile, she sees iPhone revenue growing 13% this year on the back of a strong 14% uplift in average selling prices.Huberty rates Apple stock as overweight with a price target of 214.

580,SEE,"AbbVie (ABBV) sank to a two-month low Friday after an analyst suggested that its blockbuster arthritis treatment Humira could face increasing sales pressure from rival copycat drugs later this year.On the stock market today, AbbVie lost 2.2%, to close at 93.49. Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 125.96. Stocks of pharmaceutical companies rose a fraction to wrap up the regular session.Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan noted that patents protect Humira sales in the U.S. until 2023. In Europe, though, AbbVie's arthritis treatment is expected to see biosimilar competition later this year. Biosimilars are nearly identical copies of biologic drugs.""With our estimates suggesting the biologic blockbuster Humira accounts for 60% of AbbVie's total (net present value), we remain cautious on AbbVie's outlook in front of Humira biosimilar competition,"" Divan said in a note to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's also likely AbbVie could see competition for its arthritis treatment in the U.S. prior to 2023, he said. He noted that AbbVie recently lowered its 2018 Humira sales guidance in the U.S. That cut represents additional pressure from insurers and less ability to raise prices in the U.S., he said.Divan reiterated his underperform rating on AbbVie. His comments followed a decision Thursday from the Food and Drug Administration to withdraw and reconfigure draft guidance for developing biosimilars.The decision is intriguing, he said.""Our interpretation of this development is that the FDA is learning (along with all of us) what is necessary in order to ensure safe and effective, but also cost effective and efficient, development of biosimilars in the United States,"" he said.Divan expects the FDA to issue updated guidance in the coming months. On Thursday, the FDA said it decided to withdraw the guidance based on public comments. It now plans to rework the guide for developing biosimilars with further consideration of scientific and regulatory issues.FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb noted the potential for biosimilars to foster competition and lower the cost of biologic treatments. President Donald Trump has long argued for competition to help bring down the price of drugs for American consumers.""Yet the market for these products is not advancing as quickly as I hoped,"" Gottlieb said in a written statement. ""We're taking a fresh look at our draft recommendations for evaluating analytical studies in order to ensure our guidance takes into consideration the most current and relevant science.""RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

589,SEE,"China stocks Baozun (BZUN) and Momo (MOMO), both IBD Sector Leaders, are holding above a key technical level after finding support. The moves could represent opportunities to add on shares. Baozun stock jumped 4.3% to 57.81 Monday while Momo stock pared most of its gains and rose 0.5% to 46.65.Baozun and Momo are top China stocks in the fast-growing internet segment that each earn an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99. That means their shares outperform 98% of stocks in the market based on key fundamental and technical factors. Those factors include earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and relative price performance.China internet stocks were some of the top performers in June. But as stock market indexes came under pressure in the latter part of the month, so did China stocks. But pullbacks aren't necessarily bad, as they can lead to buying opportunities.Baozun stock is looking to close at its highest level in eight sessions, and to retaking the 50-day line Monday after hovering around that level for about two weeks of trade.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhen a stock rebounds higher after finding support at the 50-day line, that could be a chance to add shares to a position. With add-on buy points, you want to buy as close to the 50-day line as possible to prevent from buying an extended stock.This represents Baozun's first pullback to the 50-day line, or 10-week line on a weekly chart, since the China stock's earnings fueled a breakout past a 52.43 buy point.The first two pullbacks to the 50-day line after a breakout are seen as good opportunities to add shares to an existing position, as long as the line is above the buy point.But Baozun stock plunged below the 50-day line in above-average turnover on June 27, closing below the buy point. That may have prompted some investors to exit their positions.That's why it's a good idea to take at least partial profits when a stock becomes 20% to 25% extended from a buy point. Baozun reached that level in its third week after the breakout.Meanwhile, Momo is holding above its 50-day line after rebounding from that level Friday. While Momo stock pared all its gains Monday after rising as much as 4.4% early in the session, volume isn't massive. If the stock was falling hard in heavy volume after rising that much, that would be very bearish.The cup-half-full investor would note that Momo battled back to break even after losing as much as 0.9% midway through the session.The chart for Momo stock looks similar to that of Baozun. Shares gapped up, past a buy point, after earnings and then ran up more than 30%. Then it pulled back to the 50-day line. But unlike Baozun, Momo never round-tripped its gains.As this is the first pullback to the 50-day for Momo after a breakout, it could qualify as an add-on opportunity as well.Momo's June-quarter earnings are projected to accelerate from 57% to 77% as revenue growth slows from 64% to 54%. Accelerating earnings growth is bullish. While the top-line growth is seen slowing, a 54% jump still represents strong growth.Meanwhile, Baozun is expected to see earnings growth slow from 29% to 17% on a sequential basis. Revenue growth is estimated to decelerate slightly from 25% to 21%.In addition to looking at stocks with strong technical action, it's important to focus on stocks that have good fundamentals.

590,SEE,"Global stock markets continued their dislocation in June as small-cap stock funds led the advance in U.S. equities. International stocks, meanwhile, suffered further declines due to signs of weakness in the ""global synchronized growth"" which had propelled global equity markets going into 2018.World equity funds on average fell 2.04%, 2.96% and 2.87% in June, Q2 and the first half of 2018, respectively, according to data from Lipper Inc. Meanwhile, small-cap growth funds jumped 1.32%, 8.69% and 12.18% in those periods.The average U.S. diversified equity fund advanced 0.45%, 3.71% and 3.36%. Large-cap growth also did well, while value and alternative strategy funds lagged. By comparison, general U.S. Treasury funds rose 0.25% in June and 0.12% in Q2, for a yearly decline of 2.08%. However, corporate debt funds fell, resulting in the taxable bond fund group's overall decline despite high yield's solid performance.That said, Fidelity's Director of Global Macro Jurrien Timmer observed that U.S. markets remain in a ""twilight zone. Until January of this year, we had everything going for us: Fairly easy financial conditions and strong earnings growth from the tax cut provided a tremendous tailwind for the market.""However, since January, the market has been in a stalemate, he notes. Tightening liquidity due to rising interest rates and a stronger dollar have been a headwind for the market: ""It's like a tug of war, and the market has been stuck right in the middle of those two opposing tensions.""What Keeps Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Going StrongSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceAmong the largest funds, $85 billion Vanguard Small-Cap Index (NAESX) soared 5.07% in June, for a Q2 gain of 6.59%, beating others by a wide margin.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFidelity's Timmer says he's seeing a pretty big separation in leadership. As of May, small-caps, which are mostly a pure play on the U.S. domestic economy, ""have broken out and made new highs, while the S&P 500 is still stuck in the trench,"" he said. The S&P 500 index, which has big exposure to foreign markets, rose 0.58%, 3.31% and 2.41% during the one-month, Q2 and H1 periods.He also pointed out that price increases by FAANG stocks, which include Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Alphabet's Google (GOOGL), accelerated in June and remains very strong. This advance came at the expense of industrials (which did very well last year), and of financial stocks.Rich Weiss, chief investment officer of Multi-Asset Strategies at American Century Investments, says that since the last two months of 2017 and throughout 2018, he's been more cautious on equities: ""Depending on the specific strategy, we either went to a neutral position — that is we weren't going to be overweighting stocks or buying on the dips anymore — or for our more risk-sensitive investors, such as in our target-date retirees entities, we actually moved to underweight equities. It's worked out fairly well for us overall.""Weiss explains that although economic growth continues to accelerate modestly, ""the primary source of that growth has continuously come from the corporate sector, in large part induced by the tax reform and the shot in the arm from the lower corporate tax rates. More importantly, we have not seen the beneficial halo effect for the consumer.""Other warning signs include a number of potentially inflationary pressures on the horizon: rising oil prices, potential wage inflation, accommodative fiscal policy and barriers to trade. ""You add higher interest rates, which are a done deal at this point, then the specter of inflation to an already somewhat muddled outlook for economic growth,"" he said, which results in an environment not that favorable for the stock markets. And while corporate earnings continue to do fairly well, ""they're a coincident indicator, not a leading indicator.""In addition, growth numbers out of Europe, U.K. and Japan have come in weaker, thus dislocating the synchronicity of growth experienced by worldwide markets earlier in the year.For the remainder of 2018, Ernie Cecilia, CIO at Bryn Mawr Trust, expects continued volatility and mid-single-digit returns for large-cap stocks. But a recession appears unlikely in the near-term.""Small-cap stock performance has been quite positive of late. This is one of several indicators that leads us to believe a recession is likely not on the horizon anytime soon,"" he said.American Century's Weiss points out that we're in the 10th year of an economic recovery, which is ""more than twice the length of a typical U.S. market cycle — it's pretty long in the tooth.""His message to investors is: ""Whatever you've been doing over the last nine years or so that may have worked for you is likely not to be the same strategy that works for you over the next year or two, because of this potential inflection point. Naively buying on the dips in the stock market works well in a bull market, but it certainly does not in a choppy market or a bear market if that's to come ...

591,SEE,"AbbVie (ABBV) stock is trading about 2% north of its actual value, an analyst said Monday in a far-reaching analysis of the pharmaceutical company.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges says the pharmaceutical company's current assets put its fair value around 91 per share. On the stock market today, AbbVie stock rose 0.5%, to end the regular session at 93.11. The stock is consolidating with a buy point at 125.96.""But accounting for the most uncertain part of the company valuation, which is return on future unallocated R&D (research and development) expense, could get the valuation up to about 104 per share (assuming a 10% return),"" he said in a report.The biggest chunks of value for AbbVie stock come from Humira and Imbruvica. They are worth 57 and 18 per share, respectively, he said. Humira treats several forms of arthritis and psoriasis. Imbruvica is a cancer drug AbbVie acquired along with Pharmacyclics in 2015.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

He sees those — drugs called elagolix, risankizumab and upadacitinib — as worth a collective 11 per share today. Without risks, they would be worth 18, he said.Even earlier-stage assets could be worth an added 13 per share, he said.""The opportunity for AbbVie stock comes from either demonstrating a return on this expected future R&D expense or revealing material upside compared to our forecasts for one of the current or later pipeline programs,"" he said.Humira will see competition from biosimilars, or copycat drugs, in Europe as soon as the end of this year and in the U.S. in 2023, analysts say. Porges expects Humira to hit peak sales of $22 billion in 2022, before declining 15% in 2023 and 25%-30% from 2024-30.Imbruvica is among the pharmaceutical company's biggest drugs, though its contribution to revenue pales in comparison to Humira. In the first quarter, Imbruvica accounted for about 10% of total sales, whereas Humira generated close to 60%.AbbVie stock is down 4% year to date. It has lost 26% from its 2018 high.

General Motors (GM) warned the Commerce Department that Trump tariffs would ""lead to a smaller GM, a reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""

595,SEE,"EOG Resources (EOG) weathered a massive oil price drop a few years ago thanks to smart investments across multiple basins, first-mover advantage and loads of data.Now, the shale exploration and production company is one of the top performers in its sector as oil prices rebound.Ninety percent of EOG's production comes from its U.S. shale operations. But EOG has spread its resources throughout the Bakken Shale basin in the north-central U.S. and southern Canada, as well as the Eagle Ford and Permian basins in the Texas and New Mexico area. That diversity has been one key to EOG's success.""They have attractive portions across multiple basins,"" said Brian Youngberg, analyst at Edward Jones. ""Some of the other premier players, like Pioneer Natural (PXD), are more focused geographically. But EOG has a handful of positions they got into early, at a low cost.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEOG produced the equivalent of 609,000 barrels of oil a day last year on average for a total of 222 million barrels. It has an estimated 2.527 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proved reserves. EOG grew in both categories during 2017 after a downturn the previous two years.The company is part of IBD's Oil & Gas-U. S. Exploration and Production group, which also features top names like Diamondback Energy (FANG) and Parsley Energy (PE). The company has a 95 Composite Rating from IBD. That means it is outperforming 95% of all stocks in key fundamental and technical criteria.A recent IBD Stock of the Day, EOG is building a base on base with a 128.13 buy point.Managing data is key for tech companies in Silicon Valley to take advantage of trends. EOG brought the power of data to the shale fields, earning it the nickname the ""Apple of Oil"" by analysts.Dave Meats, a senior analyst at Morningstar, says EOG's larger size gives it access to more data than smaller players in the space. EOG has access to its own data on previously drilled wells. It also has data on wells drilled by other companies where it has a small stake.EOG used analytical data from thousands of wells. They find everything from the optimal length to drill during each fracking stage, to which rock type is more productive.""The company does have a technical edge,"" Meats said. ""Not so much (in that) it can do things other companies can't, but that it can lead the way in achieving technical benefits before some of its peers.""Last year, EOG said it had developed 20 mobile apps of its own over two years that allow workers to stay connected day and night. It also has collected data from 5,000 horizontal wells in almost every major unconventional play in the U.S.Further, proprietary data is helping the company cut costs. Meats said the company isn't reliant on expensive analytics packages from Schlumberger (SLB) and other service providers.On top of that, data helped EOG take advantage of being one of the first movers into newer, fringe areas in a potential shale play. It analyzed the success and failure of other wells in the area.""They were kind of early on the Eagle Ford and Bakken,"" Youngberg said. ""They just saw things years ago under the leadership they had and were able to build big positions.""With acreage in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S., the company's broad geographic offerings give it the ability to be more flexible with spending if issues arise.""Some companies are very nimble like EOG. They will move capital here or there a little bit if it makes sense to,"" Youngberg said.Companies that shifted their assets to exclusively focus on the Permian now see production backing up, bottlenecked by limited pipeline capacity that likely will remain constrained through 2019. But both Youngberg and Meats don't expect the Permian bottleneck to affect EOG.When times are tough, company management isn't afraid to make the tough call to put the brakes on spending, analysts say.""They pulled back spending more than others did at a time when oil prices fell back,"" Youngberg said. ""They are willing to go defense when they have to, when oil falls, then switch back into offense pretty quickly.""Unlike its peers, EOG reduced production during the downturn three years ago, when other companies tried to keep production flat or grow slightly.Over the past year, Wall Street's appetite for increases in production at all costs has slowed. Now investors are looking for companies to focus on returning cash to shareholders rather than drilling to keep production up.In its first-quarter report, the company reiterated its 2018 oil production growth target of 16%-20%. It also backed its forecast for a full-year exploration-and-development budget of $5.4 billion-$5.8 billion, after raising it by $1 billion the previous quarter.The company plans to increase its dividend growth rate. And it has small overseas operations in Canada, China, the U.K., Trinidad and Tobago. But EOG is unlikely to commit a lot of capital to any mergers or acquisitions. Instead, management is focused on boosting organic operations.EOG's second-quarter earnings are seen soaring 1,400% to $1.20 per share, up from eight cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenue is seen rising 45.8% to $3.79 billion.The company isn't immune to all headwinds, however. Meats says he's bearish on long-term oil prices despite current supply constraints out of Libya, Venezuela and Iran currently boosting crude futures.He only expects a supply crunch in the short term and believes oil prices will stay around $55 per barrel in the long term.""EOG is a high-quality company with good asset quality,"" Meats said. ""But I think like every other shale company, the potential for lower oil prices weighs on validation.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Energy Stocks And Industry NewsWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under Water

596,SEE,"Wall Street showed continued confidence in the economy on Thursday as FAANG companies and other market leaders flexed strength in stocks today. The buying surge offset weak moves by some names in the apparel retail, department-store and bank industries.The Nasdaq composite roared more than 1.3% higher by day's end and notched a new all-time high of 7823, up 13.3% for the year. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average trailed with gains of nearly 0.8% to 0.9%. Volume ran nearly 10% higher vs. Wednesday on the Nasdaq and fell nearly 5% on the NYSE, according to preliminary data.Among the FAANG plays, Netflix (NFLX) cooled off with a 1.2% decline to 413.50 in trading that boosted 43% above usual levels. Yet the stock holds a comfortable cushion above its rising 50-day moving average. The Leaderboard member is up 115% year to date. The four other FAANG techs advanced 1.5% to 2.4%.Apple (AAPL), up 1.7% to 191.11, has now risen 6.7% past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.Meanwhile, enterprise software companies firmed up their leadership role with more gains. Two top names in HR, finance and payroll management, Workday (WDAY) and Paycom Software (PAYC), advanced more than 4% and 3%, respectively. Paycom's turnover came in 9% below its 50-day average. But it was also the highest in more than two weeks.Workday joined the IBD Leaderboard as the 10th current stock in the hand-selected list of top growth companies. It triggered an aggressive entry point in a Shakeout+3 pattern. Workday also has been forming a double-bottom base, one of the eight bullish patterns that every growth investor needs to know to time their buys in the strongest market leaders.More than 2.6 million Workday shares exchanged hands on Thursday, 38% above its 50-day average.In general, seek out those highly rated stocks that form solid bases, then break out past a proper entry in volume at least 40% above average. Huge volume on the breakout day boosts the chance that a growth investor will make money in a relatively short period of time. Sometimes, however, big volume can arrive in the days after a breakout.The Nasdaq 100, tracking the 100 largest nonfinancial companies on that all-electronic exchange, rose 1.5%. Within the FAANG names, Alphabet (GOOGL) rallied 2.6% to 1201 and notched a new all-time closing high.The stock is close to surpassing a new handle on its nearly six-month chart pattern, a bullish double bottom. The double bottom features two sell-offs, and the second low must undercut the first low. If no handle forms, the typical buy point is 10 cents above the middle peak in between the two lows.While the Google search engine, AI and self-driving-car company has not been seeing the triple-digit growth that it once enjoyed soon after its 2004 IPO, it's still showing solid growth as a megacap company.In 2017, Alphabet grew profit by 29% to $35.90 a share as revenue rose 23% to $110.86 billion, eclipsing the $100 billion level for the first time.The Street sees earnings climbing 23% to $44.28 a share in 2019.Revenue has jumped 21%, 20%, 22%, 22%, 21%, 24%, 24% and 26% vs. year-ago levels in the past eight quarters.As seen in IBD Stock Checkup, Alphabet earns a top-notch A for SMR Rating, which stands for Sales + Profit margins + Return on equity.Alphabet is highlighted in today's IBD Stock Of The Day feature.Workday joined the Leaders list of Leaderboard as it moved further past an aggressive entry of 160.9The daily and weekly charts of Leaderboard names are annotated by senior markets writers to flag critical buy points, timely sell signals, and instances of chart action that indicate unusual strength.Fellow enterprise software names ServiceNow (NOW), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Ultimate Software (ULTI) gained 4%, 2%, and 1.3%, respectively.Software continues to rank as the No. 1 sector among 33 tracked by IBD for mid- to long-term performance. See the full rankings in IBD's NYSE and Nasdaq stock tables.Ultimate Software corrected sharply for two weeks but has rebounded fiercely. Still, its latest action is too narrow to qualify as a proper cup base.The company's earnings jumped 73% to $1.30 a share in Q2, the biggest year-over-year increase in at least 18 quarters. Revenue grew 21% to $276.8 million, a quarterly best.On the downside, Broadcom (AVGO) dragged down the fabless semiconductor industry group. The large-cap designer and maker of many types of electronic chips at one point gapped down more than 18% in huge volume following news that it's buying business software firm CA (CA).

603,SEE,"After running up three weeks in a row, gaining nearly 11% in the process, Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) is taking a well-needed breather.But with the stock dropping as much as 6% intraday Monday, should shareholders lock in gains?Answering this question spurs a pair of questions. First, would you be happy with a profit of 20% in a short period of time since Supernus cleared its latest correct buy point? If yes, then the recent action has justified a move to sell on the way up.The expert in treatments for epilepsy and migraine headaches broke out of a nearly eight-month cup with handle May 9. Volume was sharply above average, yet the stock closed below the 49.85 entry. No matter. Supernus kept climbing. At the end of a six-day spurt, the small-cap growth stock rose to a high of 59.05, up a stout 18%.The base is first stage.In the past two weeks, Supernus reached the 20% profit level as shares tried to conquer price resistance at 60. Selling most of your winners when the gain reaches 20% to 25% is smart portfolio management.And nabbing such a double-digit profit during a market in which the S&P 500 has risen just 1.7% during the first six months of 2018? It's like a scoring a goal against a World Cup contender from well outside the penalty area.At the same time, Supernus hasn't flashed any defensive sell signals.As a weekly chart shows, the stock has maintained firm support along the 10-week moving average.After a long run-up, a sharp plunge through the 10-week line, usually in volume that jumps 40% or more about average, typically signals that a good stock is ready to correct sharply in price and possibly form a new base.Investors can benefit in their portfolio decisions by asking themselves this: How much conviction do I have in the company itself?Judging by Supernus' recent results, a decision to try to hold longer and see if the company can, at one point, achieve midcap status is reasonable.In the year 2014, the Rockville, Md., company hit a milestone on the top line. Revenue hit $122 million, breaking the $100 million mark. Yet the relatively young company, incorporated in 2005, lost money for a fifth straight year. But in 2015, Supernus made another key milestone. It earned 28 cents a share as revenue jumped 21% to $147 million.Since then, growth has stayed hot.In 2017, Supernus earned $1.26 a share, up 350% from 2015. Sales broke the $300 million barrier on an annual basis, growing 41% to $302 million.In the past four quarters, the top line jumped 47%, 42%, 42% and 57%. It looks increasingly likely that the company will soon achieve $100 million in sales in a single quarter.For the first quarter this year, Supernus said that total product prescriptions for Trokendi XR and Oxtellar XR rose 49% to 200,878.According to IBD Stock Checkup, the stock's 99 Earnings Per Share Rating places it in the No. 1 rank within IBD's biotech industry group.Supernus also makes the Sector Leaders screen. As noted on a Leaderboard daily and weekly chart, Supernus recently created a narrow five-week flat base that produced a new buy point at 59.15.The breakout past that entry has been less than savory so far.

604,SEE,"Each month, the IBD/TIPP Poll, a collaboration between Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, produces an exclusive Presidential Leadership Index. In addition to tracking President Trump's job approval rating, the index combines results from several questions in the monthly IBD/TIPP Poll to gauge how well the president is viewed when it comes to leading the country, both domestically and internationally.The index includes questions on presidential approval, favorability measures on the president's handling of domestic and foreign policy issues, and whether the president is providing strong or weak leadership.In addition, IBD/TIPP each month asks questions focused on the public's outlook overall. These questions gauge satisfaction with the direction of the country, respondents' quality of life, and the United States' standing in the world.IBD/TIPP also produces the Economic Optimism Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index climbed nearly 8% in July to the highest level since President Trump first took office. The highest reading Trump has scored on this index was in his first month in office, when it stood at 49.2. The lowest came in August 2017, when it fell to 35.9.The Leadership Index comprises three subindexes measuring the president's favorability (up 4.2% in July), job approval (up 9.4%), and whether he is providing strong leadership (up 10.3%).The July poll found that 41% of the public approves of the job President Trump is doing, which is up 5 points from the month before. This is the highest approval rating Trump has received since March 2017, and it's just a point below Trump's first month in office. Fifty-four percent say they disapprove of the job he's doing.The Direction of the Country Index dipped 1.8% in July to 44.5. The index is currently well above its 17-year average of 41.6, and even further ahead of the 37 average during President Obama's eight years in office.The Quality of Life Index also dropped 1.8% in July, the second monthly drop for this index. It had been climbing fairly steadily under Trump. At 60, this index is still close to the all-time high level of 63.1, reached in January 2004. The average under President Obama was 53.7. Unlike other measures, the Quality of Life Index has been relatively steady over the past 17 years.The Standing in the World Index was essentially flat in July at 44.9.  That just slightly below the 17-year average for this index of 45.5, and above the average 42.6 under Obama. Over the past 17 years, the highest this index ever reached was in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when it hit 74.9.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsJune 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

609,SEE,"Kraft Heinz  (KHC) reportedly is interested in buying Campbell Soup (CPB), which is mulling strategic options as packaged-food giants struggle. Rivals such as General Mills (GIS) also could want to take a bite of the soup and snack giant.Campbell Soup stock jumped 9.4% to close at 42.23, and Kraft Heinz stock edged up 0.2% to 63.32 in the stock market today. General Mills stock added 1.8%. All three packaged-food stocks are still trading near multiyear lows.A Kraft-Campbell deal could boost Warren Buffett's exposure to the ailing packaged-food industry. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) is a major shareholder of Kraft Heinz, which believes the soup and snack maker will likely put itself up for sale soon, sources told the New York Post.Campbell Soup said in May it was reviewing all aspects of its strategic plans and expects to discuss the outcome in August. CEO Denise Morrison abruptly resigned last month as Campbell Soup cut earnings guidance. The company has not yet named a permanent replacement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSoup giant Campbell looked for growth with purchases such as Bolthouse Farm juices, Goldfish crackers and Pepperidge Farm cookies. But its $6.1 billion buyout of Snyder's-Lance came just as the packaged-food industry slumped.The company's bleak full-year forecast pummeled the stock in May, ultimately taking a toll on the reign of its seven-year chief executive.The B-class shares of Berkshire Hathaway dropped 1.15% to undercut the May low of 188.62.Meanwhile, Coca-Cola (KO), another consumer products giant in which Berkshire holds a notable stake, rose 0.8%.Kraft Heinz arose through a 2015 merger of food giants Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz.Buffett owned 500 million shares of Heinz before the merger, while his investment partner, 3G Capital, owned a similar stake in Heinz. Buffett now owns 325.6 million shares of Kraft Heinz, valued at $20.3 billion as of March.Initially, Kraft Heinz stock rallied as the new owners boosted profits despite flat-to-falling sales by cutting costs. But like a ketchup bottle running low, cost-squeezing efforts seem to have run their course. Meanwhile, traditional branded food companies are facing multiple headwinds. They're struggling to appeal to changing consumer tastes toward organic and natural foods. Meanwhile, grocery sellers are stepping up house brands, with more attractive packaging and quality. Food companies also have cut marketing spending to boost short-term profit, but at the risk of losing long-term brand exposure.Kraft Heinz may see a Campbell Soup deal as a way to wring out more costs. Kraft in 2017 made a bid for Anglo-Dutch consumer products giant Unilever (UN), which rebuffed the offer.Buffett reportedly remains optimistic about companies that sell consumer packaged goods. Both Kraft Heinz and Coca-Cola are top-five stock holdings in his widely followed investment portfolio.

610,SEE,"Ferrari stock has outshined fellow automakers and luxury players alike since its 2015 debut. But Trump tariff threats and slowing earnings growth have tapped the brakes on the Italian sports car company's shares.Along with declines for the major stock market indexes, Ferrari (RACE) is feeling the weight of recent tweets from President Donald Trump, who is threatening a 20% tariff on cars imported from the EU. The latest threat comes after retaliatory tariffs from the EU in response to Trump's implementation of duties on steel and aluminum.Whether or not the Trump tariff threats become a reality, the threat of automakers getting swept up into the trade war drama in a massive way is a risk that some investors may not be willing to take on. But Ferrari's pricing power could mute the potential impact.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd as the Trump tariff threats loom, so does the company's capital markets day in September, where Ferrari has plans to update its five-year road map. The company in January announced its first SUV is due out in late 2019 or 2020. Ferrari also said it will push into the Chinese market.Ferrari is also working on a luxury electric car that could woo high-end consumers away from premium offerings from Tesla (TSLA). Several luxury and sports carmakers are rolling out would-be Tesla killers in the next few years.""While acknowledging the potential for exciting new product unveils and reiteration of ambitious medium term targets to drive the stock toward our bull case, we remain UW (underweight) as we look ahead of an epoch of higher spending, elevated execution risk, and fierce competition,"" said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas in a May 22 report.A notable concern for a brand like Ferrari, which has a long history of success in Formula One racing, is how to strike the right balance between growth and preserving exclusivity.Ferrari management's existing strategic plan is to increase sports car shipments from 7,694 units in 2015 to 9,000 in 2019.""We have a great deal of confidence in management's ability to execute on this plan given plentiful evidence that demand currently far outstrips supply,"" said JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman in a May 7 research report.Brinkman noted yearlong waits for customers to take deliveries and the recent announcement of a complete sellout for the F12tdf, of which only 799 were made.""There is likely a level of deliveries beyond which expansion would harm exclusivity (and therefore pricing and profits). We do not know precisely where this limit lies, of course, but we believe it is well in excess of the 10,000 per annum amount,"" Brinkman said.But Jonas says the expansion into new markets like China and new segments like SUVs presents ""a challenge to the brand's exclusivity and residual value retention.""Ferrari stock broke out of a flat base with a 141.66 buy point on June 13. After becoming slightly extended from the 5% chase zone, shares began pulling back amid broader stock market selling and the Trump tariff threats.By the end of June, Ferrari had undercut its 50-day moving average and fell as much as 7% below its buy point, triggering a sell signal. Since then however, Ferrari stock has found support at its still-rising 50-day line.Ferrari stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 96 out of 99. That means it outperforms 96% of stocks on metrics like earnings and sales growth, margins, ROE and price performance. That's far better than any other automaker.Revenue likely fell 4% in the June quarter. That would mark the first top-line decline since Ferrari's public spinoff from Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) in October 2015.Analysts expect earnings growth to decelerate. They see 11% EPS growth in the June quarter after Ferrari earnings raced 37% higher in the March quarter. That would be the smallest profit gain in 10 quarters. Ferrari costs have risen due to product portfolio revisions and the launch of new models.While analysts at Banca IMI called the current year ""more challenging"" for Ferrari, optimism remains.""We believe that Ferrari's unique characteristics place the company in a good position to achieve its midterm targets and to deliver an EBITDA margin at the high end of the range (33-38) of luxury players,"" analysts with Banca IMI said in a June 4 research report.Ferrari's successful IPO could spur public offerings from other high-end automakers.""A read-across on the planned IPO of Aston Martin may also heighten investors' appetite for Ferrari,"" Banca IMI said. The analysts said that could inspire a ""re-rating"" of Ferrari's valuation given there would be a competitor to compare financials.Conversely, Morgan Stanley's Jonas isn't convinced that these IPOs would necessarily be a good thing for Ferrari.Jonas argues that ""a potential supply of new ultra-premium car companies to the public equity markets (Aston Martin, McLaren, Lamborghini, etc.) offers greater supply of stock for investors to choose from, potentially diluting Ferrari's exclusive position in the market.""But with the Trump tariff threats, those IPOs may be on hold, at least until market conditions improve.On the positive side, Jonas notes that Ferrari and other luxury brands ""have shown resilience during periods of economic uncertainty."" He added that the luxury car company is ""probably the least cyclical company in our coverage universe.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:U.S. Auto Sales Strong, But This Is Why GM, Ford Stocks Keep FallingThese Auto Stocks Rev Higher; Is Trump Tariffs 'Ploy' Working?Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksCan Tesla Stand The Heat As It Burns Through Cash?

612,SEE,"Like psychologists, advisors can find themselves in intimate conversations with clients. To do their job, they need to listen raptly and gather highly personal information.Some clients speak freely about the most sensitive issues. Others prefer to avoid certain topics altogether.By building trust and not passing judgment, advisors learn more from even the most reluctant clients. The key is making individuals feel comfortable opening up and revealing their innermost secrets.""Advisors need to create a safe atmosphere,"" said Lynn Dunston, a certified financial planner in Denver, Colo. ""We're letting them know we want to interact on a human level.""When leading these get-to-know-you meetings, Dunston begins by making three points. He assures them of confidentiality, emphasizes he won't judge what they say and thanks them in advance for sharing.""They usually respond with a sigh of relief and say, 'That's good to know,' "" he said.His third point — thanking them for confiding in him — wields a special power. Many clients appreciate a sincere expression of gratitude and feel less guarded as a result.""I want them to know that I'm honored to hear their stories,"" Dunston said. ""And when they share their stories, I thank them again. It shows I don't take that for granted. And that brings us closer.""Dunston has learned that by remaining quiet, clients are more apt to talk. Even if they veer off-topic, he stays silent and does not interrupt.Because financial planners spend much of their day dishing out advice, it's natural to want to offer guidance to clients grappling with difficulty. But if they feel hesitant opening up, it's often best to restrain the urge to advise.Clients may need time to weigh whether to broach a painful subject, such as their troubled marriage or a family tragedy. Advisors who strike an attentive pose signal that they are ready to listen.""I learned early in my career to match and mirror clients' body posture,"" Dunston said. ""If they lean forward, I lean forward. It signals, 'I hear you. I'm with you. I want to hear more.' ""The setting also plays a role. If clients feel relaxed in your environment, they're less likely to withhold sensitive information.Shelly Terzolo, an advisor in Syracuse, N.Y., meets with clients around a table rather than from behind a desk. She offers them a beverage and lets them steer the conversation.""I don't start off by opening a folder with a long questionnaire,"" she said. ""I just have a notepad and a pen, and I'll move it aside to set the stage for them to feel comfortable in the space.""She has found that some clients are less inclined to open up if they see her writing notes as they speak. By maintaining friendly eye contact, she strengthens her bond with them.Part of the challenge for advisors is prompting clients to flesh out their thoughts and feelings on a delicate matter. In many cases, individuals will not tackle a tender subject head-on; instead, they will hem and haw until they feel ready to address the core issue.With a compassionate nod of the head, Terzolo shows her sympathy while allowing clients to elaborate. Her goal is to assure them that she cares and wants to help.""I don't want them to feel bad that they brought it up,"" she said.Flexibility pays off as well.

618,SEE,"Biogen (BIIB) stock flirted with a breakout Friday, soaring more than 23% after the biotechnology giant said its Eisai-partnered Alzheimer's treatment slowed progression in Alzheimer's disease patients.On the stock market today, Biogen rocketed 19.6%, to close at 357.48, in high volume. Earlier, Biogen stock was up more than 23% to an intraday high of 367.89, and neared a buy point at 370.67 out of a consolidation. AC Immune (ACIU), which is also working on Alzheimer's treatments, popped about 38.3%, to end the session at 12.86.The stock pops followed news of Biogen and Japanese biotech Eisai's drug, called BAN2401. At a final 18-month analysis, the treatment slowed the progression of Alzheimer's in 856 patients with an early form of the disease.Most analysts say this lends credence to the theory that Alzheimer's is tied to the buildup of toxic plaque called beta-amyloid in the brain. BAN2401 and a later-stage Biogen drug called aducanumab work to remove that plaque.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe results for BAN2401 ""could not only enable Biogen to have a second shot on goal, but also provide strong validation for the hypothesis underling the key Phase 3 candidate — and potential future growth driver — aducanumab,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients.Analysts noted the study had a unique design allowing Biogen multiple interim analyses to look for early effectiveness or futility. The study also used a marker called Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score, as well as a measure of reduction of amyloid using a PET scan to determine effectiveness.Researchers found a statistically significant reduction in amyloid and slowing progression in those who received the highest dose. The worst-case scenario would have been a reduction in beta amyloid, but not a slowing of progression. This would have disproved the theory, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report.BAN2401 had ""an acceptable tolerability profile."" The most common side effect was brain swelling known as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities, or ARIA. ARIA is a common side effect of Alzheimer's treatments. It appeared in less than 10% of most patients and below 15% of those at the highest dose.RBC's Abrahams noted the way the study was designed ""stacks the deck in favor of its own success.""Further, the measure for progression was first proposed by Eisai researchers. In most Alzheimer's treatment studies, including aducanumab, researchers look for improvement as measured by the scale known as Clinical Dementia Rating — Sum of Boxes.The news for BAN2401 was largely unexpected. In December, the Alzheimer's treatment failed to meet its key goals at an interim analysis. But the biotechnology giant said it would continue the test out to the 18-month mark based on the fact it didn't appear futile.Biogen is preparing to release the full details at a future medical conference. Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said Biogen could take two tacts for BAN2401. It could seek approval based on the Phase 2 study, putting the drug on the market in late 2019. More likely, it will design a Phase 3 study.Meanwhile, analysts are scrambling to determine what the BAN2401 results mean for Biogen's key Alzheimer's treatment, aducanumab. Both drugs work to remove beta amyloid, though they aim for different types of the plaque. Aducanumab is set to have Phase 3 data in late 2019 or early 2020.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges was the key detractor for Biogen and Eisai's results. Unlike other analysts, he doesn't see the BAN2401 study as proving the beta-amyloid thesis for Alzheimer's disease. Further, the Food and Drug Administration hasn't yet weighted in on Eisai's alternative measure of progression.""There is very little detail about other more validated cognitive measures in the joint press release and we find no reason to believe this either proves or disproves the amyloid hypothesis or has an impact on the likelihood that aducanumab will succeed in its ongoing Phase 3 trial,"" he said in his note to clients.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Why Hope Endures For An Alzheimer's Treatment — And Biogen Could Be FirstChart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?How To Tame A Volatile Swing Trade With A Half Position

619,SEE,"It became official just after lunchtime on Wednesday, just after the Supreme Court announced its final decisions of the term and went into recess. Justice Anthony Kennedy, the 104th person to serve on the court, is retiring, effective just after his 82nd birthday next month, after 30 years of service.Justice Kennedy's decision, announced in a two-paragraph letter to President Donald Trump, has been predicted — and eagerly anticipated and dreaded — for years now. He has been the swing vote in several noteworthy — for some, notorious — cases going back to the early 1990s, as well as the author of the opinion of the court in many.Appointed by President Ronald Reagan after two nominees failed to be confirmed, Kennedy has long been feted by many liberals for these stands. Since the early 1990s, he has stood against repealing the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion. Starting with his decision to overturn two sodomy convictions in 2003, he has opposed discrimination against gays and was the author of Obergefell v. Hodges, the 2015 decision that legalized same-sex marriage.Kennedy joined mostly Democratic-appointed colleagues in taking what were considered liberal stands on other issues as well, including the death penalty for young offenders, judicial review for Guantanamo detainees and state laws attempting to strengthen or supplement federal enforcement of immigration laws.On these, conservative legal scholars looked askance. Some ridiculed Kennedy's flowery language in decisions like Obergefell v. Hodges. Some classed him with other Republican-appointed justices who sided regularly with liberals.But that's an overstatement. Justice Kennedy came out on the same side as Republican-appointed colleagues on the Second Amendment, on partial-birth abortion bans, on the unconstitutionality of bans on political speech, and on subjecting states to special voting-rights scrutiny based on evidence from 1964 and 1972. In every one of the past year's 19 cases decided by 5-4 votes, he came out against the four Democratic-appointed justices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn my view, it makes sense to see Justice Kennedy not so much as a liberal warrior in our culture wars but as a judge who placed an especially high value on the First Amendment freedom of speech. People should be free to engage in gay sex, and organizations should be free to engage in political speech.That concern about freedoms of expression characterized his most recent decisions. He applied sharp scrutiny on government efforts to force public employees to pay for political speech they opposed (Janus v. AFSCME) and to force a Christian baker to custom-design a cake for a same-sex couple (Masterpiece Cakeshop Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission).Even where he saw First Amendment rights as at stake in legislative redistricting cases, he ruled in 2004 and again this year that he professed to see no neutral principle distinguishing plans that were unconstitutionally partisan from those that weren't. Any verbal formula, he apparently believed, would just leave judges free to rule for their partisan friends.This led legal scholar Rick Hasen to predict — accurately — his decision to retire and then call his decision ""final abdications"" that indicate ""a depressing kind of defeatism."" He evidently sees Justice Kennedy as a committed culture warrior for the left.But language in some of his most controversial opinions shows not a desire for one side's total victory but for both sides' friendly accommodation of the other.In Obergefell, Justice Kennedy took care to recognize that ""religions, and those who adhere to religious doctrines, may continue to advocate with utmost, sincere conviction that, by divine precepts, same-sex marriage should not be condoned.""In Masterpiece Cakeshop, Justice Kennedy wrote, ""To describe a man's faith as 'one of the most despicable pieces of rhetoric that people can use' is to disparage his religion in at least two distinct ways: by describing it as despicable, and also by characterizing it as merely rhetorical — something insubstantial and even insincere.""This is not so much legal argumentation as it is a plea for combatants in the culture war to show respect — even friendly respect — for one another.The Senate will probably ""confirm Justice Kennedy's successor this fall,"" as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell quickly promised, despite hysterical predictions that abortion will be criminalized and same-sex marriage abolished.But Justice Kennedy's central legacy is his firm defense of the First Amendment. Against California's claim that its law requiring pro-life pregnancy counselors to promote abortions is ""forward-looking,"" Kennedy wrote, ""It is forward thinking to begin by reading the First Amendment as ratified in 1791; to understand the history of authoritarian government as the Founders then knew it.""First things first.Other columns by Michael BaroneMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

620,SEE,"The big banks have their tax cuts, a good economy and higher interest rates. They also dumped a whole bunch of extra returns on shareholders last month. But as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) prepare to report second-quarter earnings on Friday, big bank stocks have been in a mass slide lower.XDread over a flattening yield curve, and its potential foreshadowing of a recession, has crept into bank stocks this year. Lending has picked up. But it remains slow overall, and businesses are still skittish about borrowing money to expand. The Trump administration is flinging tariffs at China and criticizing NAFTA, adding to businesses' ambivalence. Deposit costs are rising, crimping profits.""We had a benefit from corporate tax reform that was good for a lot of these companies, and there isn't a lot of evidence that they've invested very much in their businesses,"" Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said.He said Q2 bank earnings this month will likely be more defined by management's outlook for the rest of the year, as banks — and their large and small clients — assess whether a strong U.S. economy can stomach a trade war.Keefe-Bruyette & Woods forecasts median second-quarter loan growth of 2.8% for JPMorgan, Citigroup, Wells Fargo and Bank of America (BAC). For the year, KBW expects median loan growth for those banks of 3.1%.Nonetheless, KBW said it expects the banks to put up ""solid"" results. The firm said that ""fundamentals will support further outperformance once geopolitical risks dissipate."" Low expectations could also work to the banks' advantage.""We believe that investor expectations for loan growth have come down since the

"
622,SEE,"earnings then stocks could react positively,"" KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a research note on Tuesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFor JPMorgan, Wall Street expects a 23% jump in earnings per share to $2.23. Analysts see revenue up 8% to $27.54 billion.Also expected: CEO Jamie Dimon, who missed JPMorgan's first-quarter earnings call in April, will be in attendance. Dimon often uses the bank's quarterly earnings to weigh in on the economy and Washington. His reflections on the economy in earnings releases and annual shareholder letters have the feel of a Warren Buffet-esque fireside chat. His remarks on earnings calls? Not always so much.""He has the potential to create some fireworks here,"" Shanahan said of Dimon. ""I'm kind of looking forward to what he has to say about Trump's policies as it relates to corporate taxes, tariffs, and this trade war, which, arguably, we're in now.""Dimon's return would reunite him with his more measured counterpart, CFO Marianne Lake, who tends to do most of the talking during the calls.Lake, after the bank's first-quarter results in April, said it was too early to tell if businesses were borrowing more due to tax cuts. Earlier that month, Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders that ""anything that starts to resemble a trade war creates risk and uncertainty to the global economic system.""The Trump administration this week said it planned to impose tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese products. Those duties, which would come on top of tariffs that hit $34 billion in Chinese products last week, could take hold in August following a review period.JPMorgan's stock twitched 0.2% lower to 106.39 on the stock market today. That's essentially where the stock was at the beginning of the year.At the core of investors' anxiety over the banks is the yield curve, which measures the difference between rates on short-term and long-term government debt. The yield curve is also a reflection on investors' longer-term expectations of inflation and the strength of an economy able to get away with higher prices.Short-term rates influence the rates at which banks borrow money from depositors. The long end influences the rates they set on money they lend to others. Banks' margins depend on the gap between those two.The Fed has bumped up short-term rates, in turn pushing up what banks can charge on things like credit-card and auto loans. But the long end has wavered, reflecting a dimmer view of the economy further out.Citigroup is expected to report a 23% increase in EPS to $1.56, as revenue increases 3% to $18.46 billion.The bank is the most internationally exposed of the big banks, drawing only half of its revenue from North America last year, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Fourteen percent came from Latin America.Citigroup has been bullish on business prospects in Mexico, saying in April that it expected ""continued revenue growth"" in the nation. Citi at that time also noted ""momentum"" in its card and retail banking businesses there.Mexico, however, this month elected as president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a staunch leftist who rode a populist, anti-establishment wave to victory. He has called Trump ""erratic and arrogant."" But after his election win, he said he would aim for ""friendly relations"" with the U.S. Obrador has also said he wants Mexico to stay in NAFTA.KBW last month also noted that Citigroup, at a recent conference, said ""the economy (in Mexico) could slow either on the back of no NAFTA or renegotiated NAFTA or an outcome of a presidential election on July 1."" But the bank still remained bullish on growth.Citigroup dipped 0.5% on Wednesday. Shares are down 8% year-to-date.Zacks forecasts a 5% increase in Wells Fargo's earnings per share to $1.12. Revenue is seen slipping 3% to $21.58 billion.Wells Fargo is still trying to recover following revelations that it created unauthorized customer accounts in an attempt to boost sales. Since then, suspicions have grown in other areas of its business. The Federal Reserve in February restricted Wells Fargo's growth, saying it was responding to ""widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns.""""Management feels comfortable that scandals are in the past, but we believe only time will tell,"" KBW analysts said after the company's investor day in May.Shares lost 1% Wednesday.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Futures: Stock Market Rally Is Missing This Key ElementS&P 500 Earnings Hot, But Will Trump's Trade Wars Chill Guidance?Economy Adds 213,000 Jobs As Jobless Rate Rises To 4%: Goldilocks ReturnsBanks And Financial Stocks: Latest News And Analysis

625,SEE,"Oil dropped the most in almost three weeks Thursday after a surprise increase in American stockpiles and moves by Saudi Arabia to cool a rally that's drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.XFutures fell 1.6% in New York following a government report showing U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.25 million barrels last week as imports rose and exports fell. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been expecting a median 5 million-barrel decrease as supplies typically decline this time of year amid strong demand from refiners.At the same time, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. lowered August pricing for most crude grades in Asia and Europe and cut them all in the U.S. a day after Trump called on OPEC to ""REDUCE PRICING NOW!"" in a tweet Wednesday. The kingdom was also said to have increased daily output by about half a million barrels in June.The market was expecting ""higher exports and lower imports, but we got the reverse,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets.Crude hit a three-year high of $75.27 on Tuesday as the outlook for less supply from Iran, Libya and Venezuela overshadows a pledge by OPEC and its allies to boost output by 1 million barrels a day. Inventories at the key U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, have declined for the seventh straight week.West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery fell $1.20 to settle at $72.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close in a week. There was no settlement Wednesday due to the U.S. holiday.Brent for September settlement slid 85 cents to end the session at $77.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $6.76 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., crude imports rose to the highest level since February 2017, with crude coming from Canada at the highest on record. Meanwhile, crude exports fell by the most since mid-May. The EIA also reported refinery utilization ticked lower for the first time since early May. Gasoline supplies declined, while distillate stockpiles rose.In addition to cutting prices, Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped about 10.5 million barrels of crude a day last month as the kingdom sought to cap rallying prices by ramping up output, according to people familiar with the matter. The June figure would represent an increase of about 500,000 barrels a day from May.As OPEC and its allies implement their new agreement, the market will have to see how much oil Saudi Arabia will send onto the marketplace, said James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics.

630,SEE,"Apple (AAPL) continued to show market leadership. The megacap tech refused to give up any of its solid gains over the prior three sessions while Microsoft (MSFT) edged higher for a fourth day in a row as large and megacaps outperformed the small-cap space in stocks today.While the Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% for its fourth win in a row. The Russell 2000 dived 0.5%. But the latter has a bigger year-to-date return. The Russell, at 1694, boasts a 10.3% advance. The Dow, at 24,919, is up just 0.8%.Fellow Dow Jones component Microsoft (MSFT) edged up less than 0.2% to 102.01 but is now within spitting distance of hitting new highs. The diversified software and consumer electronics powerhouse has advanced 18% since breaking out of a six-week flat base at 86.30 in heavy volume on Dec. 15.The S&P 500 rose 0.3%. NYSE volume edged slightly higher, according to early data. Defensive sectors including food and utilities, as well as cyclical groups such as semiconductors, homebuilders, steel and automakers, paced the advance. Roughly eight of IBD's 197 industry groups rose 1% or more. (See the entire list of 197 IBD industries and the six-month relative strength rankings here.)The banking and transport sectors fell, losing some of their recent big gains. The Dow transports fell just 0.3%, but IBD's truck transport industry group skidded 1.7% lower. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) halted a three-day win streak, losing 0.6% to 106.62 and failing to close back above its 200-day line.As noted in a prior Stock Market Today column, Apple cleared the 5% buy zone from a 179.04 correct entry in a narrow double bottom.Apple, rising to as high as 191.28 on Wednesday before closing off just 0.1% at 190.35, is now up 6.3% past the proper buy point. It's now extended.Micron Technology (MU), a current member of IBD's Sector Leaders, outperformed the market with a 3% gain to 55.74 in light trade. The data storage play reclaimed its 50-day moving average for the first time in two weeks and is trying to mold a new base.Stitch Fix (SFIX), a curated-apparel service popular among the young, surged to new highs with a 6% lift to 32.99. The Nasdaq stock is now up more than 9% past a cup-without-handle entry point of 30.17.Volume zoomed to triple its usual level of 2.1 million shares per day. The stock did suffer a sell signal after falling more than 8% from the entry, yet has recovered.San Francisco-based Stitch Fix notched $977 million in revenue in 2017, up 34%. This year, the Street sees the top line bulging 26% to $1.23 billion, then rising another 20% to $1.47 billion in 2019. However, earnings are seen slipping 41% to 19 cents a share in 2018 and falling another 26% to 14 cents a share in 2019 as the company invests aggressively to expand its services.The company shows excellent operating cash flow, coming in at $1.38 a share in 2017. That's quadruple the 32 cents it earned that year.Energy stocks were active, but a relatively large group of the sector's leaders retreated from session highs.Cactus (WHD), featured in IPO Leaders in the past and the new IBD Stock of the Day, bounced within a wide range of nearly 4 points before ending the day down more than 5% to 33.69. Volume surged five times above its 50-day average.For three sessions in a row, the stock tried to clear a 35.28 buy point in a narrow cup with handle. But some funds have used the opportunity to dump shares. Cactus went public at 19 a share on Feb. 8.A good cup with handle typically shows a minimum length of seven weeks. Think of it this way: The left side of the cup may form over three weeks, the right side in three weeks, and a downward-sloping handle over one week. That all adds up to seven weeks.However, IBD research has found that in some rare cases, a stock with extraordinary fundamentals can bolt out of a six-week cup with handle so long as it shows excellent price-volume action, has glowing fundamentals, owns a leadership spot in its industry, and is rising along a confirmed market uptrend.In his 2004 classic, ""The Successful Investor,"" IBD founder Bill O'Neil wrote that the cup with handle ""should be at least six to eight weeks in length, starting with the first week closing down off the stock's top.""On the positive side, the expert in wellheads and oil rig-related gear found buying support near its 50-day moving average. Cactus has rallied as much 97% from its IPO price.Notice how sell-offs in early and mid-June sent the stock briefly below the 50-day moving average.The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM) ETF cooled off after rising sharply the past few weeks. The popular exchange-traded fund edged 0.4% lower to 43.97 in quiet trade. EEM is down nearly 7% year to date, hurt in large part by its 32% weighting in China.Notice how EEM posted a key sell signal on Feb. 5 as the ETF sliced through the 50-day moving average in huge volume. EEM eventually tested institutional buying support at the long-term 200-day moving average, bounced sharply and briefly flung above the 50-day line, and tried to build a new base.Yet since March, EEM has continued to struggle as the 50-day line became a level of resistance. The 50-day moving average has also been sliding for more than three months, indicating a negative intermediate-term trend.Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Nomura Securities, noted in a new monthly global economic outlook that his team believes ""global growth has peaked and, as it slows, we are most cautious in EM (emerging markets).""""We are specifically forecasting that global growth will slow from an annual rate of 4.0% in 2018 to 3.7% in 2019,"" he added.RELATED:The IBD Stock Of The DayDividend Stocks: These 6 REITs Crush The Yield Of The S&P 500 by 350%-475%Which 9 Stocks Currently Join IBD Leaderboard?Investor's Corner: Make Sure Every Breakout Has This Vital ElementWhich Way Is The Stock Market Headed?

632,SEE,"Just when the Democrat Party has gone socialist, the old line, anti-Trump, GOP Establishment is flipping out too. Two former GOP Secretaries of State, James Baker and George Shultz, have teamed up to support what they are calling a national carbon tax, which would basically be a trillion dollar national gas tax, and a new tax on electricity and all other forms of traditional energy.That would amount to a death grip on the American economy.They have formed a front to advance this mayhem called the Alliance for Market Solutions. They call this new trillion-dollar tax on working people and the middle class ""pro-growth,"" as they explain in a book, ""Carbon Tax Policy: A Conservative Dialogue on Pro-Growth Opportunities"". But there is nothing pro-growth or conservative about this burdensome, intrusive, Big Government, anti-growth tax.Before you can have a market solution, you must have a problem to solve. ""Carbon pollution"" is not a problem, because there is no such thing as carbon pollution. That term refers to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, which come from burning the fossil fuels — oil, natural gas, and coal — that powered the Industrial Revolution. That economic revolution produced the sustained, long term, economic growth that created the modern world.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCO2 is a natural substance found in the environment, essential actually to the survival of all life on the planet. CO2 enables plants to grow, feeding animals, which feed other animals, including humans. Without CO2, plants would die, and so would all other life on the planet, scientifically labelled ""carbon-based life forms"".This is why CO2 can never be referred to as ""pollution.""  As CO2 emissions have increased the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the planet has flowered with greenery that can be observed from satellites orbiting the planet. This is why very high concentrations of CO2 are pumped into actual greenhouses, to promote rapid growth of plant life.The double peer-reviewed ""Climate Change Reconsidered II,"" published by the Heartland Institute, explains, ""At the current level of 400 parts per million (that is 0.04% of the atmosphere, 4/100s of one percent, a minuscule amount), we still live in a CO2-starved world.  Atmospheric levels (of CO2) 15 times greater existed during the pre-Cambrian period (about 550 million years ago) without known adverse effects,"" such as catastrophic global warming. (emphasis added).CO2 falling below 250 parts per million is considered the starvation threshold for plant life, which would be the real catastrophe for the human race. See e.g. Princeton Physics Professor Will Happer.And as the industrial revolution's economic growth has built the modern world, billions have been lifted out of poverty. Global poverty is now slated for extinction. The middle class has been created, now spreading worldwide. Food supplies have burgeoned. Fatal diseases have been slaughtered. Human health and longevity have skyrocketed.In the movie series ""Planet of the Apes,"" stupid apes originally took over the planet from humans by cutting off the electricity supply, which they were smart enough to know was the foundation of the modern world. Now come the privileged, GOP elites who would do to American and western prosperity what OPEC boycotters did in the 1970s, by raising the price of energy.Naïve Washington ""savants"", as they have called themselves, tell us that with the gusher of revenues from the carbon tax, we can give the money right back to the people with revenue neutral rebates. We can finance income tax cuts, and roll back energy squelching regulations.But who could be silly enough to think we could run trillions of increased taxes through Washington, without seeing it eaten up with increased, wasteful, counterproductive government spending. It wouldn't even reduce the deficit. And President Trump is already rolling back energy-squelching regulations, on his way to American energy dominance, beyond just independence.We don't need to fuel the Washington bureaucracy, and further flood the Washington swamp, pouring oil on the bonfire with trillions of increased taxes paid by the middle class, the poor, and working people.

633,SEE,"In the battle for investment survival, you can learn a lot from judo. The first and most important lesson in that martial art is the same for the stock market: damage control.Judo masters begin not by learning how to throw, but how to fall. They practice this skill until it's as natural as breathing. No matter how many times they're flipped, they can rise to fight again.Highly successful stock pickers go through similar training: They must learn how to cut their losses short. This means selling a stock when it's down 7% or 8% from your purchase price.Sounds simple, but many investors have learned the hard way how difficult it is to master the most important rule in investing.No one wants to sell for a loss. It's an admission that you made a mistake. But if you can set your ego aside, you can take a small loss and still be fit enough, both financially and mentally, to invest the next day. Cutting losses quickly prevents you from suffering a devastating fall that's too steep to recover from.Consider the math. Say you buy a stock at 50. For whatever reason, it drops 8% to 46 during the next few days. You promptly unload it and move on. To reclaim that loss, you need to make an 8.7% gain on your next purchase with your remaining capital, which shouldn't be hard to do.What if you hold on?You're sure the stock will snap back. Your research convinces you it's worth $100, so why get scared by a minor setback?There's one problem. The market doesn't care who you are, what you think or how much you believe in a stock. It says you miscalculated, at least in the short term — a message that gets louder as the stock drops 25% to 37-1/2. To get back even, now you need a 33% gain, which is much tougher to come by than that easy 8.7%.What if the market really doesn't like your stock and slices it in half to 25? You don't need a calculator for this one: To recover a 50% loss requires a 100% gain. How many stocks did you pick last year that doubled in price?If you limit losses on initial purchases to 7% or 8%, you can stay out of trouble, even if only 1 out of 4 buys delivers a modest profit of 25% or 30%. You can be wrong 3 out of every 4 times and still live to invest another day.A .250 batting average is nothing to crow about. But even the best hitters in baseball fail more than they succeed. Consider Tony Gwynn, who in 1999 became the 21st member of pro baseball's 3,000-hit club. That year, the former San Diego Padres outfielder finished the season with a batting average of .338. That means he was coming up empty nearly 2 out of 3 times at the plate.You won't see Gwynn fret after grounding out. The same is true for successful investors. They calmly take a small loss and look for the next potential winner.So leave your emotions behind. Cutting losses with discipline will help keep your head clear when it's time to return to the market. A great paradox of investing is that the ripest buying opportunities occur just after bear markets — when the major stock averages have declined 20% or more.That's exactly when most investors who haven't cut their losses are reeling and don't want to be hit again. It's hard to think straight after losing thousands of dollars. But the market always recovers. What kind of shape will you be in?(Editor's Note: This column originally ran in the Aug. 23, 1999, edition of IBD. Gwynn's last season was in 2001. His career batting average held at .338, according to Baseball-Reference.com.

635,SEE,"In the cup with handle or double bottom, success of the breakout depends on the way a stock rises and falls within the base.A third pattern shows that a stock can choose to take neither path before its big move north.Rather than go on an uptrend or downtrend, the stock moves sideways for weeks or months. This action — or lack of it — becomes what's called the flat base.This pattern often forms after a stock breaks out of a cup or other base, gains ground for a few weeks, then stalls. Why? The market might not be ready to rally strongly, or is still weak.A flat base reflects unusual strength. Instead of bending lower, it holds steady in price. This action tells you the stock wants to run higher.When the market finally begins to rally, the stock explodes out of its crouch position.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA flat base must be at least five weeks in length. It can last much longer than that. Within the base, the percentage decline from the stock's high to low usually ranges within 10% to 15%. When the stock drops within the base, institutional investors step in to shore up the stock. The stock doesn't fall much more because investors overall feel comfortable with the stock's current price.When should you buy? Wait until the stock rises 10 cents above the highest price in the flat base. Sometimes the price high is found on the left end of the base. In other cases, the high is in the middle of the base or on the right. Just add 10 cents to that price to find the pivot. Buy it as close as possible to that price point. Don't chase it if it's already more than 5% above the pivot.Oracle (ORCL), the database and e-commerce software giant, muscled out of a seven-month cup with handle on Sept. 3, 1999 (1). In five sessions, the stock rose 18% and hit new highs. A fine start.The market suffered choppy action. From Sept. 13 the Nasdaq tumbled 7% over the next two weeks, yet held up above its 50-day moving average. Two weeks later, it strode to a new high. But the next two weeks saw the Nasdaq fall 10%, and briefly below the 50-day.Oracle dug in its heels. Growth stocks tend to fall 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 times the correction in the major indexes. Not Oracle. The stock held up above 40 during most of its seven-week flat base (2). On an intraday basis, it was no more than 15% below its high.The high on the left side of the flat base was 46.94. Add a dime to get the buy point. Oracle briefly poked above the flat base's 47.04 buy point during the week ended Oct. 15, 1999, but stumbled. A week later, Oracle dropped more than 8% below the prime entry, ushering the golden rule of investing. Some breakouts turn out to be fakeouts.However, one day after the Nasdaq staged a follow-through day on Oct. 28, Oracle broke out for real. It rallied on heavy volume for seven straight sessions (3). A follow-though is a critical signal that the market has possibly bottomed and is ready for a significant turn higher.At the time, Oracle scored an excellent 95 Earnings Per Share Rating, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, and an A for SMR (Sales + Margins + Return on equity). The stock's relative strength line, painted in blue in every IBD daily and weekly chart, shoved into new high ground. The enterprise software group was ranked third among 197 groups.Oracle gained 273% through its March 2000 peak.Here are three more good flat bases that formed in 2016 and 2017 and yielded strong breakouts:Align Technology (ALGN), breakout on Feb. 21, 2017: The nine-week flat base began on Dec. 19, 2016, when the invisible braces marketer peaked at 102.10. Total decline within the base: 13%. Heavy volume was largely absent as Align cleared the 102.20 buy point, yet check out the strong gain on Feb. 1 following quarterly results.Align gapped up 6% and turnover boomed 272% above average. That was a clear sign of strong institutional buying.You can see historical charts of Align and all other U.S. stocks by going to MarketSmith, IBD's advanced charting and stock screening service.Control4 (CTRL), breakout on July 12, 2017: Volume powered 305% above the 50-day moving average on breakout day. In small-cap stocks, volume often rockets double or triple average levels. Total decline within the base: 13.5%.Notice on a weekly chart how as the base formed, the 10-week moving average contained the stock's move.The 10-week line is drawn in red on both an IBD chart and in MarketSmith.Arista Networks (ANET), breakouts on Nov. 14, 2016, and on Feb. 17, 2017: In the first flat base, Arista took the minimum five weeks to complete the base, which sat on top of a much larger first-stage construction. The proper buy point was 87.72. Total decline within the base: 10%.In the second flat base, Arista vaulted out of the base in a breakaway gap past 103.10. On Feb. 17, the data center networking play opened at 111, 7.7% above the proper buy point. Given the huge opening move and strong fundamentals, it would have been perfectly acceptable to buy right at the open. Arista finished the session at 119.06.

636,SEE,"A migraine prevention treatment from Eli Lilly (LLY) faces an uphill battle against Amgen (AMGN) which, late Thursday, had strong results from long-term studies of its approved medicine.Both Amgen and Lilly have migraine prevention drugs called anti-CGRPs. These drugs work by blocking a specific peptide associated with migraines. Amgen's drug, Aimovig, grabbed approval in May, but Lilly's is fast approaching approval, likely in September.Although Allergan's (AGN) Botox is well known as a treatment for wrinkles and facial lines, it has other uses in excessive sweating, urinary incontinence and to prevent migraines. On Wednesday, Lilly showed that its drug, called Emgality, can benefit patients for whom Botox didn't prevent migraines.But RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay doesn't expect the study to ""substantially impact positioning in the marketplace.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We do find the post-Botox analysis to provide a unique perspective and marketing point for Emgality with the physicians who have established familiarity with Botox and the estimated 50% of patients that may step through Botox to CGRP therapy,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, Lilly advanced 1% at the closing bell, to 85.49. Amgen sank 0.1%, to 183.34. Shares of pharmaceutical and biotech companies each rose a fraction.Late Wednesday, Lilly said Emgality benefited some patients for whom Botox didn't work to prevent migraines.Lilly tested its anti-CGRP at 120-milligram and 240-milligram doses in patients who failed on Botox as a migraine prevention treatment. On average, 41.3% and 47.5%, respectively, saw their migraine days per month cut in half.""These data are compelling given that Botox is a commonly used agent in the prophylactic treatment paradigm for migraine, and could potentially be required as a step-through therapy prior to treatment with the CGRP class,"" RBC's MacKay said.But Lilly will continue to face an uphill battle against Amgen, MacKay said. U.S. officials approved Aimovig in May. The drug already has an established safety and effectiveness profile. It also beat rivals Lilly, Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) and Alder Biopharmaceuticals (ALDR) to market.""We expect that Aimovig will continue to benefit from their first-to-market status,"" he said.But MacKay doesn't expect Aimovig to completely fill the revenue hole Amgen faces amid a growing list of challenges for its legacy products. Notably, three of Amgen's drugs are facing potential competition from biosimilars, nearly identical drugs.Further, Amgen partners with Novartis (NVS) on Aimovig, meaning it will have to share sales.Amgen is more bullish, though. The biotech released results on Wednesday of a survey of 11,000 patients who experience at least four migraines per month. Six in 10 respondents said they missed at least a week of work each month due to migraines.Effective migraine prevention could help ease an estimated $22 billion annually in economic cost, Amgen said. About half of that is due to lost productivity. Additional data show patients are often reluctant to admit suffering from a migraine.This suggests the ""already extremely large market could see potential upside beyond the incident and prevalent populations estimated in medical literature, as well as the numbers underpinning assumptions in our model,"" MacKay said.MacKay estimates that there are 2.4 million chronic and 4.3 million episodic migraine patients in the U.S.""However, despite potential for the migraine market to be significantly larger vs. established literature, we see (Amgen's) base business erosion creating a significant/challenging revenue hole to fill, especially given Aimovig revenues are shared with partner Novartis,"" he said.Late Thursday, Amgen said Aimovig was tested for a year in chronic migraine patients. The biotech also took an interim look at data three years into an ongoing five-year study in episodic migraine patients. Researchers tested patients at doses of 140 milligrams and 70 milligrams.On average, patients saw their migraine day per month decline by a respective 10.5 days and 8.5 days. Monthly migraine days declined by half for 67% and 53% of patients, respectively. Those days also dropped by three-quarters in 42% and 27% of patients, respectively.Just 13% of patients on the 14-milligram dose and 6% of patients on the 70-milligram dose had no migraine days.""These data showing sustained (effectiveness) and consistent safety and tolerability of Aimovig over an extended period of time are important for migraine patients and their clinicians to know,"" Stewart Tepper, professor of neurology at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth Medical School, said in a prepared statement.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Trade Stocks: Why Most Penny Stocks Fail To Make Investors RichSell And Take Profits Or Hold?

640,SEE,"Oil dropped the most in almost three weeks Thursday after a surprise increase in American stockpiles and moves by Saudi Arabia to cool a rally that's drawn the ire of U.S. President Donald Trump.XFutures fell 1.6% in New York following a government report showing U.S. crude inventories climbed 1.25 million barrels last week as imports rose and exports fell. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had been expecting a median 5 million-barrel decrease as supplies typically decline this time of year amid strong demand from refiners.At the same time, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. lowered August pricing for most crude grades in Asia and Europe and cut them all in the U.S. a day after Trump called on OPEC to ""REDUCE PRICING NOW!"" in a tweet Wednesday. The kingdom was also said to have increased daily output by about half a million barrels in June.The market was expecting ""higher exports and lower imports, but we got the reverse,"" said Rob Thummel, managing director at Tortoise, which manages $16 billion in energy-related assets.Crude hit a three-year high of $75.27 on Tuesday as the outlook for less supply from Iran, Libya and Venezuela overshadows a pledge by OPEC and its allies to boost output by 1 million barrels a day. Inventories at the key U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, have declined for the seventh straight week.West Texas Intermediate crude for August delivery fell $1.20 to settle at $72.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the lowest close in a week. There was no settlement Wednesday due to the U.S. holiday.Brent for September settlement slid 85 cents to end the session at $77.39 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The global benchmark traded at a $6.76 premium to WTI for the same month.In the U.S., crude imports rose to the highest level since February 2017, with crude coming from Canada at the highest on record. Meanwhile, crude exports fell by the most since mid-May. The EIA also reported refinery utilization ticked lower for the first time since early May. Gasoline supplies declined, while distillate stockpiles rose.In addition to cutting prices, Saudi Arabia told OPEC it pumped about 10.5 million barrels of crude a day last month as the kingdom sought to cap rallying prices by ramping up output, according to people familiar with the matter. The June figure would represent an increase of about 500,000 barrels a day from May.As OPEC and its allies implement their new agreement, the market will have to see how much oil Saudi Arabia will send onto the marketplace, said James Williams, president of London, Arkansas-based energy researcher WTRG Economics. ""But, there is clearly going to be a supply excess by mid-to-late September.""

641,SEE,"Not much stood in the way of U.S. bond markets to continue their trajectory of a rate-tightening cycle as the Federal Reserve went ahead with its anticipated rate hike in June. The U.S. Treasury yield curve flattened slightly, with the 10-year yield finishing the month at 2.84%. And money market funds look more enticing.The Fed hiked its target rate by 25 basis points to a range of 1-3/4% to 2% — its seventh increase since 2015. While it stated that its stance remains accommodative, it added the possibility of a fourth rate hike this year and removed language of a ""gradual"" pace of its future rate increases while modestly upping its growth expectations.""For retail investors, one of the most tangible manifestations of that would be money market funds and their interest rates,"" said John Hollyer, principal and global head of Vanguard Fixed Income Group. ""For the first time in a number of years, some money market funds yield at or above the rate of inflation.""Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund (VMMXX) yields just over 2% and holds $101 billion in assets.

By comparison, the average U.S. diversified stock fund rose 0.45% in June, 3.71% in Q2 and was up 3.36% for the year.Internationally, emerging markets local-currency debt funds were the worst performers, sinking by 2.9% in June and 10.05% in Q2 for a yearly loss of 6.58%. Hard-currency ones fell 1.8%, 5.34% and 5.77%, respectively, as the dollar strengthened.Municipal bond funds held their heads above water, adding 0.14% in June and 0.87% in Q2 for a scant 0.05% yearly gain.For the remainder of 2018, Vanguard's Hollyer expects the Fed to stay on their path, with the 10-year yielding around 3%. However, going out further to next year, he sees a possibility of the Fed becoming more restrictive, meaning a level sufficient to restrict the economy, at which point riskier assets such as stocks and credit will start underperforming.""This is not an emergency like 'you must act now,' but rather a rational expectation,"" he says.Jeffrey Gundlach, DoubleLine's CEO and CIO, said in a recent webcast: ""We're pretty much in the clear for the next six months certainly, maybe even 12 months relating to recession, but some of (the indicators) are starting to show the potential look for recession in 2019. Too early to say anything definitive, we'd need further development. ... However, global growth is not as strong as it was starting the year.""He points out some real changes in the data underlying the ""synchronized global expansion"" that was in place early in 2018. European economic data, especially, is now a lot softer than before, along with weaker numbers out of Japan.In addition, Gundlach calls the current combination of rising rates and an expanding budget deficit not only unprecedented but a ""suicide mission,"" which will make it harder for the U.S. government to service its increasing debt at higher rates. ""And that will be a fiscal solvency problem eventually,"" he said.With this in mind, Bob Gahagan, senior vice president at American Century Investments and co-manager of the $6 billion American Century Diversified Bond (ADFIX), $381 million American Short Duration (ACSNX) and $1.5 billion American Century Global Bond (AGBVX), says he's been paring back credit in favor of structured product.""We like securitized because of the lower duration, and also the housing market is in very good condition. There, the technicals are supportive of spreads hanging in there,"" said Gahagan. He specifically likes floating-rate asset-backed securities, non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities as well as high-quality collateralized loan obligations.Gahagan is also constructive on TIPS. Despite those being in the upper-end of the break-even range, he believes that ""if those break out, it would be to the upside not the downside."" He explains that goods, which comprise around 40% of the CPI and are mostly global, have been a deflationary drag on inflation so far, but have started to move up. In addition, a trade war also would be inflationary in the short term. He's been using TIPS to replace longer-duration bonds.Emerging markets have been beaten up in recent months, so Gahagan points out that ""there are some idiosyncratic stories that are getting interesting ... (other emerging-market) countries that have been beaten up just because of   the Argentinas, Turkeys and Brazils, but that are still fundamentally good stories.""For bond investors, Gahagan recommends watching the risks that are out there: geopolitical, trade-related and ""any kind of global slowdown. That would in turn probably mean that the Fed might have to re-evaluate their tightening program. ... While he said the U.S. economy is very strong and they were pretty adamant about moving forward, (Fed chief Jerome Powell) did recognize that they are watching the global economy.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Is The Stock Market In An Uptrend Or Downtrend?

642,SEE,"Dow futures rose solidly Thursday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures. But the stock market is under pressure on Trump trade war concerns. U.S.-China fireworks begin Friday. A pair of sectors at high risk from a Trump trade war have been big losers. That includes Dow Jones industrials such as Boeing (BA) and Caterpillar (CAT), as well as automakers. Chipmakers slumping, with Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron Technology (MU) stocks all failed breakouts. Apple (AAPL) stock also coming under pressure, with its heavy exposure to China.Dow futures rose 0.7% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.6%. Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.6% higher.The Federal Reserve will release minutes from its June meeting at 2 p.m. ET. At that meeting, policymakers raised rates and signaled two more Fed rate hikes are likely this year, one more than previously expected. Investors will be looking to see how hawkish Fed members really are.Also Thursday: the ADP employment report will estimate June private-sector hiring, the Labor Department will release weekly jobless claims and ISM will issue its June nonmanufacturing index. Those all lead up to Labor's June employment report on Friday.But the big news Friday: President Trump is due to impose tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese goods, mostly tech and telecom products. China says it will immediately retaliate, dollar for dollar.In Tuesday's half-day session before the 4th of July holiday, the major stock market averages opened higher but reversed lower. Nasdaq composite fell 0.9%, but closed above its 50-day moving average. The S&P 500 index slid 0.5%, once again sinking below its 50-day line. The Dow Jones industrial average retreated 0.55% after rising intraday above its 200-day line.Micron stock triggered Tuesday's sell-off. A Chinese court barred Micron Technology from selling chips in the country, siding with Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics (UMC) in a patent fight. Rightly or wrong, investors took that Micron ruling as part of the U.S.-China trade war. China has been holding up approval of the Qualcomm (QCOM)-NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) deal until the U.S. lifts harsh sanctions on China telecom gear giant ZTE.In any case, Micron stock fell 5.5% Tuesday. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index retreated 1.8%, moving back below its 200-day line. Micron was indicated lower again Thursday.Chip stocks have been conspicuous laggards even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite hit new highs in June. Even Intel stock, Nvidia stock and Micron stock, which were outperforming the chip sector, have fallen well below buy points and their 50-day moving averages.U.S.-China trade war tariffs won't target semiconductors much at first. But the U.S. is wary of China of buying cutting-edge tech as Beijing seeks dominance via Made in China 2025. Beijing could continue to make life difficult for U.S. chipmakers working in China via regulatory hurdles. Longer term, the trend is toward a U.S.-China cold trade war in technology that would roil complex supply chains and cut off markets.China is a huge and growing market for Boeing jets. China could favor Airbus (EADSY) over Boeing in a trade war. Boeing was the top Dow Jones stock in 2017. Boeing stock recently triggered a sell signal and is trading below its buy point.Another Dow Jones component, Caterpillar stock, has fallen below its 50-day and 200-day lines.General Motors (GM) and Ford (F) reported solid U.S. sales Tuesday. But GM stock, Ford stock and their global peers are struggling as Trump threatens a global auto import tariff. That would trigger retaliation and raise supply chain costs as even U.S.-made cars and trucks tend to have high non-U.S. content.Apple, another Dow Jones stock, is also vulnerable to a prolonged U.S.-China trade war. China is a big market for the Apple iPhone and various services. Most Apple iPhones are made in China. A trade war could hit iPhone suppliers, China could hold up exports and threaten any number of actions to hinder Apple.Apple stock blasted out of a buy zone in a sharp rally from the end of April to early May. Strong earnings helped, fueled by fast-growing high-margin services as iPhone sales were so-so A huge buyback and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) buying more Apple stock also were big Apple stock drivers.But in recent weeks, Apple stock has been fading. It's now just modestly above a buy point. Shares are fighting for support at 50-day, closing just below that level Tuesday.So far stocks have largely retreated on trade war fears, even as hopes remain that the actual damage will be minimal. But on Friday, President Trump is open hostilities with tariffs on an initial $34 billion of Chinese goods. China has vowed to retaliate. Tariffs are slated to hit a further $16 billion in Chinese products soon.Trump has threatened tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods, and then a further $200 billion.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Big Picture: Stocks Face This TestTrump China Tariff Decision Will Be Yuuuge For StocksThese 4 Top Stocks Have One Thing In Common  IBD Stock Of The Day Tests Buy Point After 19% Run

646,SEE,"Leadership isn't about being the person who has all the answers. Quite the opposite. There's nothing wrong with asking for input, seeking help and admitting you don't know it all. It pays to show you're vulnerable.""A leader who acts like he has all the answers isn't approachable,"" said Steve Arneson, who runs his own Boulder, Colo.-based executive coaching and leadership consulting firm. ""But if you're open-minded and not afraid to ask for help, then people know they have the opportunity to weigh in.""Here's how to build that environment.Get participation. Make sure your people are involved in key decisions. Seek help, input and feedback. Say you're looking at both sides of an issue and want to hear what they think.""You have to get past, 'I have all the answers,'"" Arneson said.Set aside ego. Confidence is vital for a leader. But that doesn't mean you know everything. Arneson said the most confident leaders are also often the most likely to show they're vulnerable. They're not afraid to open up, even about their faults.Gain strength. The power inside people can only truly be unleashed if they bring everything they have to their role, says Barry Kaplan, a partner in New York-area executive coaching firm Shift 180. Openness plays a big role.""That includes talking about things that might be dangerous or risky,"" Kaplan, co-author of ""The Power of Vulnerability,"" told IBD.Be clear. Build an open and trusting environment by first talking about it. When Kaplan works with companies, he often has people write down something they haven't shared before but that's important to the business. It might be about saving money or why one person hasn't been fired. Then talk about that point in a forum where there is no fear of retribution.""There's a lot of pent-up truth that's ready to be unleashed,"" Kaplan said. ""There's courage involved in being vulnerable and speaking my truth. But if I'm authentic it makes me feel good about myself.""Stay true. Be consistent in how you act and treat people. And stick to your values while doing that.""That produces a track record of behavior that people can bank on,"" Arneson said. ""Then when they walk in on Monday morning, they know who they're getting.""Spread the word. Build authenticity into your group's culture by displaying it yourself, so others see it starts at the top. Talk about it every chance you get: in meetings, through a CEO blog and at employee celebrations.""The cool thing about authenticity is you don't have to think about it,"" Arneson said. ""It just comes naturally.""Win faith. If you're open about your weaknesses, you'll earn trust among your team.""Then you'll create a powerful team because people will have each other's back,"" Kaplan said.Take the lead. If the company chief doesn't show vulnerability and authenticity, others won't either. But if she does, it'll spread fast.Kaplan once worked with the leader of an auto parts company who was at a crossroads about whether to shut the doors or keep investing. The boss spoke openly to his people about his dilemma. They opened up about their fears and their staunch belief the company could recover from its slump. The boss decided to invest more in the company.""His people believed more in him because he was willing to say, 'I don't know,'"" Kaplan said. ""He couldn't have been more real. And they ended up having their best year ever.""Reap rewards. Once you open up to the point that you build trust, the benefits pour in.""Then you have an environment that's going to lead to improved performance,"" Kaplan said. ""One new idea leads to creativity and innovation, or you can cut your losses earlier if your company was going to do something that doesn't work.""

662,SEE,"Trade: First, President Trump hit China, Canada, Mexico and the EU with trade tariffs. Now, the world is hitting back. Will a burgeoning trade war with our closest trading partners be the undoing of global free trade and Trump's own domestic agenda? Don't count on it.Here's the action so far: President Trump already slapped 10% to 25% tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. In retaliation, Canada has hit U.S. imports with an estimated $12.6 billion in tariffs in retaliation.Next, some $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese goods are set to go into effect later this week, which China vows will not go unanswered.Meanwhile, Trump is also threatening tariffs on European Union autos, a severe sore spot for the EU. It says it will levy $300 billion in tariffs on U.S. autos and other goods — that's not a misprint — if Trump's tariffs go into place.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd Trump has taken it even a step further. As Axios reports, the White House has even threatened to push legislation to ""blow up"" the World Trade Organization by getting rid of its two most basic rules: One, the ""Most-Favored-Nation"" principle, under which all countries in the WTO get the same tariff treatment as others; and, two, ""Bound Tariff Rates,"" under which already-negotiated tariff ceilings can't be removed unilaterally.This might sound like a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo, but it isn't. Most of the world's tradable goods come under WTO rules. Eliminating the rules overnight would be destabilizing to the world economy, to say the least. It's one of the big reasons why global financial markets have been on such a roller-coaster ride in recent months.Major U.S. companies (like Harley-Davidson), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and even some Senate Republicans — usually allied with Trump on most issues — have issued strong denunciations of Trump's tariffs and plans to exit the WTO.But if Trump worries about the reactions from Congress and overseas, he doesn't let on. He promised explicitly to raise tariffs during his election campaign. And if Trump has shown Americans anything since entering office in January of 2017, it's that he's dead-set on keeping his promises.""Any country that devalues their currency to take unfair advantage of the United States and all of its companies that can't compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating,"" Trump said in 2016.So, yes, Trump is serious about tariffs. But what's also clear is that any extreme moves on trade can by stymied in Congress.There's already a move afoot in the Senate, led by Republicans Bob Corker and Pat Toomey and Democrat Michael Bennet to get rid of Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs. They'll stand on solid legal ground. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress, not the White House, power to regulate trade, including tariffs.Moreover, Congress approved of the creation of the World Trade Organization. So pulling out of the WTO or changing it beyond recognition would require Trump to win a vote in Congress.It ain't going to happen.So what's Trump's aim here? Trump isn't just tariff-happy. And he doesn't just hate the WTO to hate the WTO. There's an endgame he has in mind.So what is it? He wants nothing more than for other countries that have highly favorable trade deals through the WTO and U.S. trade agreements to level the playing field a bit. Ultimately, if the gambit works, free traders should be happy. It will actually make trade freer and fairer, rather than treating obsolete trade agreements as if they were an eternally fixed part of Mosaic law.Andy Puzder, who served as CEO of CKE Restaurants for 16 years, explained the dynamic in a recent opinion piece.""With a trade deficit over $500 billion running in their favor, we need to create incentives for our trading partners to renegotiate our current relationships,"" Puzder wrote. ""That's because nations — like people — rarely give up economic benefits they've grown used to having simply because doing so would be fair. They operate in their self-interest.""As noted, the WTO has quite effectively lowered average overall tariffs and trade barriers on many goods and services. It's been a huge success in that respect. But deals made through the WTO have also frozen in place existing unfair advantages that the U.S. agreed to give to Europe, Asia, Mexico and others to help develop their economies.It was a noble act, one for which our major trade partners give the U.S. little or no credit. Last year the U.S. had an overall goods deficit of $810 billion, an enormous amount. That was reduced to an overall deficit of about $568 billion, thanks to exports of services and high-tech. Whether free trade advocates acknowledge it or not, large swathes of the industrial Midwest got decimated by those deficits.Donald Trump promised them relief and hope. He's now keeping that promise, at least rhetorically. Whether tariffs or anything else can ever ""re-industrialize"" the Midwest is an open question.As we've written here many times, we take a back seat to no one on free trade. And we don't like tariffs. Period. They're a tax on consumers and producers. We'd like to see them all go. We believe in truly free trade.That said, highly regulated trade, with tariffs fixed to our disadvantage in semi-perpetuity, cannot be called free trade. That means we need to change past trade deals. That includes NAFTA and the many WTO trade deals that are no longer fair. Trump's doing that.In that sense, despite the anti-Trump rhetoric on trade both here and abroad, the president may in fact be doing free trade the biggest favor of all: He's taking it seriously.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:High Tariffs And Weak Dollar Are No Way To Make America Great AgainTrump Plays Dangerous Game Of Chicken With Trade TariffsWill Trump's Tariff Temptation Kill His Economic Boom?

665,SEE,"Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund owes much of its success in investing in growth stocks to great team work. And this top-performing mutual fund's team is bigger than most funds' — big enough to field a baseball team.The $1.5 billion Federated Kaufmann Small Cap(FKASX) has nine portfolio managers. Each covers stocks in industries in which they have expertise. As a result, the portfolio recently has been investing in growth stocks such as Veeva Systems (VEEV), Grubhub (GRUB), Canada Goose Holdings (GOOS), RealPage (RP) and Tyler Technologies (TYL). All are market leaders with IBD EPS Ratings of 90 or higher and Relative Strength Ratings ranging from 99 to 83.This year through June 30, investing in growth stocks like these have brought gains ranging from 24% by enterprise software maker RealPage to 86% by upscale winter wear maker Canada Goose.Federated Kaufmann Small Cap Fund has another trait that stands out. The portfolio has held many of its heavy-hitting stocks since they first came to market.With its team of experts working together to find new companies that the fund can hold long-term, this top mutual fund as of Dec. 31 has beaten the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years. That feat makes it a 2018 IBD Best Mutual Funds Award winner.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd it's won the award in three categories: U.S. diversified equity funds, growth funds and small-cap funds. And that's no easy feat: Only 10.4% of eligible U.S. diversified stock funds made the Best Mutual Funds Award list.Fund lead manager Stephen DeNichilo, 42 years old, has been with federated since 2012 and has 20 years investment experience. He discussed his fund's hot streak and other aspects of the team's investment approach with IBD from his team's offices in Manhattan.Best Mutual Funds Monthly Performance ReportBeyond Q2: Stock Fund Managers' Outlook NowMoney Market Funds Back In Bond MixSee Which Stocks The Best Mutual Funds Have Been BuyingBest Mutual Funds: Six Month LeadersBest Mutual Funds: Quarterly LeadersMutual Fund Category PerformanceIBD: Nine portfolio managers guide this fund. Why so many?DeNichilo: There are two lead managers, me and John Ettinger. Each portfolio manager has buy and sell discretion. ... Each manager focuses on different sector verticals — technology, biotech, consumer, financials, software and so on. Industrials, materials and energy are my areas. Our arrangement brings buy and sell decisions closer to the research process.IBD: You've outpaced the broad market in four varying time periods. What enables the fund to outperform so consistently?DeNichilo: The consistent focus of our process. Our sole focus is to find innovative, growing companies regardless of the macro environment's noise.We at Federated have used the same philosophy on our flagship Kaufmann Fund (KAUAX) (now a $6.6 billion midcap growth portfolio) for 30 years. And members of the small-cap fund's team have been working together on average over 15 years.IBD: Why use so many portfolio managers rather than analysts?DeNichilo: When you have companies that are small and growing 15%, 20%, 30% sequentially, things are moving very fast. You need to be on top of those. Our process brings the portfolio manager closer to the research process. The closer, the better. And on top of it, we have senior managers — I am one of them — monitor the portfolio, monitor risk management. They provide a sort of check and balance.IBD: Why does your fund participate in so many initial public offerings?DeNichilo: The team analyzes virtually every IPO that comes to market. I would say, broad brush, we buy anywhere from 25% to 50% of IPOs we see, varying widely throughout the years based on the quality of deals.Each IPO is vetted by the sector PM, who often has a solid working understanding of the company and market segment before the deal comes to market.Over 50% of the fund's holdings were initially bought on IPO. That's one of the most inefficient parts of the market. And buying at IPO gives us a first-mover advantage with a stock.IBD: Why has Veeva Systems trended higher the past couple of months?DeNichilo: This is a stock we've owned since the IPO. It has a fantastic combination of experienced leadership who know what to build and how.This is a SaaS (software as a service) solutions company for the life sciences market. Sort of a Salesforce.com (CRM) for life sciences.They have a proprietary content management platform that's used for medical promotions and regulatory-clinical trials. And it enables their customers to move critical functions in regulatory submissions and manufacturing quality to the cloud. They have a knack for hiring people with deep industry knowledge, who work closely with customers to build what their most advanced customers want, and apps that can be tailored and integrated for high levels of customer success.IBD: Grubhub's earnings per share growth has sped up for three quarters. Why?DeNichilo: This is another name we bought on IPO. They're in an enormous and rapidly growing total adjustable market. They stand to benefit. They're expanding into additional cities. They're signing major restaurant chains like Yum Brands.There's some concern about competition from Uber Eats and DoorDash. But we think the market is large and growing, with room for more than one player. And Grubhub has first-mover advantage and a strong brand name.IBD: Enterprise software maker RealPage has eight straight quarters of increasing ownership by mutual funds. What's this feeding frenzy about?DeNichilo: This is another stock we bought on IPO in 2010. They are a real estate software company that helps solve huge inefficiencies in the property management vertical.They enable property managers to better manage renter life cycles and property management workflow. They are a leader in helping apartment owners manage their property, their tenants, their buildings, schedule repairs and take rental payments.They have a huge amount of recurring revenue, a nice history of hitting their numbers and they are a nice consolidator in the industry.IBD: After two quarters of declining EPS, Canada Goose posted gains of 39%, 48% and 166%. What do you like about them?DeNichilo: We think there's big growth in the consumer functional luxury space. Canada Goose is successful in their wholesale business, and is in the early stages of developing its retail business with just a handful of stores in the U.S. and Canada and Europe. And it's moving its brand beyond winter garments into an all-seasons assortment.The company limits distribution and inventory growth to maintain premium pricing and avoid discounting, which is the death knell for any retailer. Sales have grown in excess of 30% (annually). We think estimates for only 25% growth will prove conservative.IBD: Tyler Technologies is in the same IBD enterprise software group as RealPage. It provides IT management services and software for various levels of government. Why is that attractive to you?DeNichilo: They are a SaaS company for municipalities. They make government more efficient. Their software automates processes. It's used in everything from public safety to small-claims arbitration. It lets everything be done online.IBD: Government is often rapped for being slow and resisting change.DeNichilo: After the financial crisis, when municipalities found themselves in fiscal trouble, they saw the payback and return on investment for using Tyler was so large that they couldn't ignore it.IBD: What's your thesis for Novanta (NOVT), which makes photonics and motion control systems?DeNichilo: We think they are still an undercovered company on Wall Street. Management has done a fantastic job turning the company around, pivoting from cyclical to secular areas. Now they're focused on such secular growth areas as 3D printing, DNA sequencing, robotic surgery and warehouse automation.Novanta allows customers' (devices) to have precise movements down to the micron level. They've reduced their semiconductor exposure from 50% of revenue to less than 10% today. And they're focusing more on industrial automation and next-generation medical processes.IBD: What's the appeal of At Home Group (HOME)?DeNichilo: They're a value player that is taking share in retailing. They showcase a broad, inexpensive assortment of home decor in large-format stores. They were created out of the bankruptcy of the former Garden Ridge.Their productivity remains relatively low with significant opportunity for growth in same-store sales. They have plenty of real estate opportunities as other large-format stories like Sears and Kmart close.They have ability to grow 20% annually. They're not online currently, but that's a longer-term opportunity.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Millennials: Tips For Reaching Goal Of Becoming A MillionaireYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And Income

Celgene lifted 3.6%, to 79.42. Meanwhile, shares of other biotech companies rose. The ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology (BIB) exchange-traded fund lifted 3.5%, to 57.20.Late Thursday, the two biotech companies said luspatercept met both its key goals in a study. They tested luspatercept vs. a placebo in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. In these disorders blood cells are poorly formed or don't work well.The two biotech companies are now preparing the necessary documents to ask regulatory officials across the globe to approve luspatercept, Celgene Chief Medical Officer Jay Backstrom said in a written statement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""This result from the Phase 3 (study called) Medalist demonstrates the potential clinical benefit of luspatercept as an erythroid (a red blood cell) maturation agent for the treatment of chronic anemia in patients with low-to-intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes,"" he said.Patients tested in the Medalist study had chronic anemia. Their disease also had progressed, or they were either intolerant or ineligible for another anemia treatment called an erythropoietin-stimulating agent, or ESA. Before luspatercept, they required frequent red blood cell transfusions.Luspatercept-treated patients experienced at least eight straight weeks without red blood cell transfusions during the first 24 weeks of treatment. The study also met its second goal. Patients were able to go at least 12 consecutive weeks without transfusions.Celgene and Acceleron will likely grab approval and launch in 2019, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report to clients. He calls for worldwide sales of $170 million in 2020, increasing to $1.5 billion by 2023. Analysts, meanwhile, see $326 million and $1.2 billion, respectively.RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay boosted his expectations for luspatercept success to 95% from 90%. He calls for peak sales of $770 million in this specific patient group. Under the deal with Celgene, Acceleron will receive royalties on sales in the U.S.Though numerical details were lacking in the press release, this ""does not indicate lack of statically significant improvement,"" MacKay said in his note to clients. The biotech companies said they plan to offer more detail on the study at a future medical conference.Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster noted even reducing the frequency of transfusions for these patients would be an improvement, ""especially considering the lack of treatment options for patients with this condition.""Auster boosted his price target on Acceleron to 60 from 55. He sees a 90% likelihood luspatercept will get approval as an anemia treatment for this group of patients.The biotech companies also are considering testing luspatercept in low-to-intermediate risk patients with myelodysplastic syndromes who have never undergone ESA as an anemia treatment. Soon, the firms will also have data for luspatercept as a treatment for patients with beta-thalassemia.RBC's MacKay sees a ""high likelihood of success"" in using luspatercept to treat beta-thalassemia, a blood disorder that reduces the production of hemoglobin.

668,SEE,"Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) shares rocketed to a three-month high Friday after rival Galapagos (GLPG) released disappointing results for a cystic fibrosis treatment that led partner AbbVie (ABBV) to opt out of additional studies.On the stock market today, Vertex popped 15.2%, to 169.96. Shares of Galapagos tumbled 3.8%, to 92.18, though AbbVie stock lifted 0.3%, to 92.69.

The patients had already received Vertex's drug, Orkambi. But Galapagos' goal of showing its drug could be part of a triple-regimen in cystic fibrosis fell short.At day 28, patients treated with GLPG2737 showed a 3.4% improvement in lung function over those who received the placebo. That failed to hit statistical significance.

674,SEE,"For Canada-based apparel retailer Lululemon Athletica (LULU), new things are happening in a foursome.• The first item is who will emerge from the company's CEO search. In the upscale retail space, an imaginative leader can make a big difference. Thanks to recent acceleration in quarterly earnings and sales, Lululemon's top spot could be attractive to top-tier candidates.Earnings growth stepped up from 3% to 19%, 33% and 72% in the past three quarters. Revenue stepped up from 5% to 13%, 14%, 18% and 25% in the past four quarters.• The second item is overseas expansion. Lululemon has 15 stores in China, including three in Hong Kong and one in Taiwan.At the May 27 earnings call, Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden noted that Lululemon has ""the greatest amount of (its) new store openings happening in China.""Store growth outside North America is ""still in the early innings,"" Haselden said.Ten years ago, the U.S. and Canada accounted for 91% of Lululemon's store count. As of April 29, North America's share dropped to 81%, despite a massive increase in the U.S. store count.Only four nations were in the store count in early 2008: Canada, the U.S., Australia and Japan. Countries since added include New Zealand, United Kingdom, Singapore, Switzerland, Germany, South Korea, Ireland and China, which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan.Lululemon plans to open 40 to 50 stores in 2018, including 20 to 30 in the international space.• The third item is men's lines. Amid eye-rolling skepticism, Lululemon began focusing more on men's clothes in 2013.How is it going? Of new customers acquired in Q1, ""about 30% of them were men. So, that was higher than the overall level of increase, a little bit higher than the number of women that we're attracting,"" Haselden said.Yet, just how far that card can be played isn't clear. Sales aren't reported by gender in company filings.• The fourth item is lower markdowns. This reflects in part Lululemon's determination to remain an upscale brand that can command full prices. It also points to an improving world economy.""We can continue to drive a very healthy full-priced business,"" Haselden said on the call. ""We see that continuing into Q2 and the balance of the year.""Stock charts don't lie, so what is Lululemon's chart confessing?The action from August 2016 to August 2017 was sloppy and ugly. But after settling down, the stock began to rise in a steady fashion last November.Lululemon's most recent entry was a pullback to the 10-week moving average in March.

""If we see that opportunity within the confines of what we can legally do, we will do it.""The remarks came in response to an analyst question about Sands' broader thinking about the cannabis market, and to what extent Constellation Brands saw an opening to enter the marijuana business in states like California.Recreational marijuana sales became legal in California in January. Constellation Brands last year invested in Canopy Growth Corp. (CGC) a Canadian pot producer. Canada is legalizing recreational pot use, starting in October. Sands on Friday said Constellation had recognized gains of more than $700 million since it invested in Canopy, which recently listed in the U.S.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

It's also spurred speculation over how it could change the way people socialize.In an effort to get ahead, Heineken (HEINY)-owned Lagunitas, a brewer in California, said this week it will launch a THC-infused sparkling water in California dispensaries on July 30. Sands said Constellation was ""pretty interested"" in what Lagunitas was doing, and how it was doing it.Lagunitas' cannabis beverage, Hi-Fi Hops, stems from a collaboration with AbsoluteXtracts, which is part of CannaCraft, a California marijuana producer.Pot is still illegal on a federal level in the U.S. Making a cannabis-infused beverage directly would put brewers' licenses to make beer at all at risk, according to a story from the Santa Rosa Press-Democrat.Under the collaboration, however, Lagunitas supplies the sparkling water, while CannaCraft handles the THC-infusion process.Molson Coors (TAP) is also reportedly weighing whether to partner with a Canadian marijuana company to offer cannabis-infused drinks. U.K. tobacco company Imperial Brands (IMBBY) this week said it was investing in a medical marijuana research company.Constellation Brands skidded 5.55% in the stock market today, after its earnings per share and full-year profit outlook missed analyst estimates. The company blamed marketing expenses, bad weather, and higher transportation costs.Elsewhere during the call, Sands said its Toronto-based affiliate, Greenstar, was working ""diligently"" with big advertising, marketing and consulting firms to figure out how to take advantage of the cannabis industry. He said the Canopy collaboration aims to develop products ""for the world market.""Canopy in June also said Greenstar had bought up 200 million Canadian dollars' worth of its convertible debt.

On June 28, the Federal Reserve will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.Some analysts see a majority of banks making payouts that exceed profits for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, with the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo among them.""I don't think generally today's results, that everyone passed, are a big surprise to anybody. It was largely expected,"" Raymond James managing director Michael Rose said.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stress test actually being stricter this year.Under 2018's stress test scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak. This is tougher than the 6.5% drop that was modeled last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's stress test outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Banks will be able to unveil their capital return plans for the coming year following the release of the second set of results next Thursday. Those tests determine how large a capital buffer that banks need to protect themselves from a financial crisis.But Wells Fargo is at an elevated risk to fail the June 28 test due to oversight issues related to its account-opening scandal and perhaps a lack of focus by management on the exam due to the scandal, Rose said.""Even if everybody passes quantitatively, (Fed regulators have) historically made an example out of one or more banks on the qualitative side,"" he told IBD. ""I wouldn't expect them to deviate from that historical pattern when we get next week's CCAR results.""Shares of JPMorgan closed essentially unchanged on the stock market today. Bank of America rose 0.2% and Wells Fargo dipped 0.2%, while Citigroup gained 0.4%. Goldman Sachs fell 0.4% and Morgan Stanley (MS) slid 0.2%.After the close, Wells Fargo edged up, while the others fell.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGoldman analysts see State Street (STT), Wells Fargo and Northern Trust (NTRS) able to increase payout ratios the most among large-cap and trust banks. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Not everyone is quite so bullish, however. The likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James see the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks. This is around a quarter more than in 2017.""We look for the median bank's total payout ratio to approach 100%, while both dividends and share repurchase increase over 20% from CCAR 2017's level,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said in a research note. ""We believe the pace of dividend increases could exceed that of share repurchase.""There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.One fly in the ointment is the current flattening yield curve. This could lower profits, as banks make money on the difference between long- and short-term rates. The spread between U.S. Treasuries 2-year and 10-year yields has not been this narrow in a flattening process since 2005.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:These Banks Are Seen Paying Out The Most To Investors After Stress TestWhy Tougher Bank Stress Test May Not Hurt Dividends, BuybacksIBD Stock Of The Day: Bank To The Tech Stars Sets Up Swing Trade, Add-On ChancesStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

Sarepta, which unveiled strong results for its gene therapy in muscular dystrophy on Tuesday, saw its stock pop 6.8%, to 153.69. Biotech stocks collectively rose less than 1.5%.Both biotech companies are working on treatments for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a muscle-wasting disease with a genetic component. The condition is tied to mutations in the gene that makes dystrophin, a protein related to muscle fiber function.Despite Solid Biosciences' plummet Wednesday, analysts said the smaller biotech actually has the better Duchenne muscular dystrophy treatment. Instinet analyst Christopher Marai attributes this to the way Solid Biosciences constructs its drug, SGT-001.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We recommend accumulating Solid Biosciences as the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy field becomes increasingly de-risked, and we see potential upside, as SGT-001 could become best-in-class with the differentiated (formula),"" he said in a note.Marai kept his buy rating and 37 price target on Solid Biosciences. Earlier in the week, the Food and Drug Administration lifted a clinical hold keeping the biotech company from enrolling patients in a study.It's likely that Solid Biosciences will report some data from the study earlier than guidance for the second half of 2019, Marai said. Solid Biosciences is competing against Sarepta and Dow Jones component Pfizer (PFE). But the market could support all three, he said.""We view the (Duchenne muscular dystrophy) market as being large enough to support multiple gene therapies and solutions,"" he said.Chardan analyst Gbola Amusa similarly sees Sarepta's report on Tuesday as having a positive impact on Solid Biosciences. Solid stock skyrocketed 46.4% on Tuesday as Sarepta shares ramped up 36.8% to close at a record high.""We see this as a positive read-across to Solid, based on the similarities between the approaches but, to us, (there are) superior elements of the Solid microdystrophin construct,"" Amusa said in a report to clients.Further, it's possible SGT-001 ""may demonstrate even more (effectiveness) to what was seen (Tuesday) from Sarepta,"" Amusa said.

679,SEE,"A rumored buyout of drugmaker Tesaro (TSRO) by Swiss drugmaker Roche (RHHBY) — which sent shares of Tesaro soaring Wednesday — makes little sense from a strategic standpoint, one analyst says.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay sees the combination as unlikely ""given what we see as a lack of a compelling strategic rationale."" Tesaro makes an ovarian cancer drug called Zejula, which competes against rival drugs from AstraZeneca (AZN) and Clovis Oncology (CLVS).MacKay notes Tesaro's 2018 guidance for Zejula sales is in trouble as rivalries grow in ovarian cancer drug sales. He expects Tesaro to lower its full-year outlook. That would make a potential acquirer hesitant, he said in a report to clients.Spanish website Intereconomia.com said late Tuesday that Roche is interested in acquiring Tesaro after it announced its plan to buy Foundation Medicine (FMI). The site reports Roche could announce the acquisition of Tesaro in the next few days.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

At the same time, biotech stocks rose less than 1.5%.Further, Tesaro already has ongoing collaborations with Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) in treating forms of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. It's also partnered with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in developing Zejula to treat prostate cancer.Roche, on the other hand, is collaborating with Roche's rival Clovis in treating gynecological tumors. Clovis makes an ovarian cancer drug called Rubraca. The duo is testing Rubraca with Roche's immuno-oncology drug called Tecentriq.""With Roche's focus on developing/acquiring best-in-class molecules, we see Rubraca (with its in-line effectiveness and superior safety vs. Zejula) as a potentially better fit within the context of this strategy than Zejula,"" MacKay said.Tesaro, too, already has partnerships with Zejula in markets outside the U.S. This may detract from the value of acquiring it for a global pharmaceutical company like Roche.On the flip side, Roche and Tesaro do have an ongoing clinical collaboration to look at Roche's Tecentriq with Zejula in bladder cancer. Researchers are also combining Zejula and Roche's drug Avastin in a form of ovarian cancer.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

680,SEE,"Because of the ever-descending moral and intellectual state of the mainstream news media, there has been no outcry against the leftists who call President Donald Trump and all Americans who support him Nazis. Indeed, members of the media now regularly do so.Without that outcry, this labeling will only increase; and this steadily increasing drumbeat of hysteria is likely to lead to one result: violence against conservatives.It is not plausible to foresee any other outcome of left-wing normalization of the terms ""Nazi"" and ""white supremacist.""The American left has put itself in a moral quandary: Either it doesn't mean it when it calls the president and his supporters Nazis, in which the case it is merely guilty of cheapening — and, as I explained in my previous column, actually denying — the Holocaust, or it does mean it, in which case morality demands it take violent action against Trump supporters.For at least a decade, I have been saying that America is fighting a second Civil War. But I have always added that unlike the first Civil War, this one — thank God — is nonviolent.It's getting harder and harder to assume it will stay that way.A Senate intern shouts an obscenity at the president of the United States in the halls of Congress and the U.S. senator for whom she works does not fire her.Left-wing mobs yell and chant ""No justice, no sleep"" in front of the homes of administration officials.A Democratic Congresswoman, Maxine Waters, foments such action. ""Let's make sure,"" she tells Democratic mobs, ""we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them. And you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Democratic Party labels political opposition to the president ""Resistance,"" the term used to describe the opposition to the Nazis during World War II.All these are only the beginning. Few violent movements begin with violence. And when the left sees that these tactics do not undo the last presidential election, some morally consistent leftists could quite possibly take the obvious next step and start targeting Republicans — as the shooter of Republican Rep. Steve Scalise and four others did.As one liberal writer, Peter Beinart of the Atlantic, asked nearly a year ago, ""If you believe the president of the United States is leading a racist, fascist movement that threatens the rights, if not the lives, of vulnerable minorities, how far are you willing to go to stop it?""When conservatives — even one as critical of the president as Ben Shapiro — need the protection of bodyguards and police officers in riot gear when speaking on an American college campus, it is clear where we are headed. You can get an idea by watching what students did to biology professor Dr. Bret Weinstein, perhaps the only decent faculty member at Evergreen State University, because he refused to cooperate when left-wing students demanded that all whites leave the university campus for a day. Some months later, Weinstein was told by the left-wing university administration it ""could no longer guarantee his safety."" Weinstein then left Evergreen State for good.In March 2017, Charles Murray's scheduled speech at Middlebury College was pre-empted by a violent left-wing mob, resulting in police escorting him off the campus. In the process, his interviewer, professor Allison Stanger, was injured by enraged leftist thugs, and she later ended up in a neck brace.The New York Times recently reported that left-wing intellectuals regret the historic liberal defense of free speech. There is no question that if the left were to have its way, many, if not most, conservative opinions would be legally banned and those expressing them arrested.I pray violence does not erupt in America. But if, God forbid, it does, let's be clear it was the left that started it, just as surely as the South's firing at Fort Sumter started the first Civil War.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

682,SEE,"The monthly IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a collaboration of Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, gauges how confident consumers, workers and investors are in the pace and direction of the U.S. economy. As with all of IBD/TIPP's proprietary monthly indexes, a reading above 50 signals optimism, below 50 pessimism.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is made up of three subindexes, including one for the respondent's outlook six months into the future, the respondent's personal financial outlook, and how the respondent views current federal policies. The goal each month is to give as accurate a reading of the current state of the economy as possible.The average for the index over the past 17 years has been 49.4, or slightly pessimistic. The index high of 62.9 was reached in March of 2002, six months after the 9/11 attacks, as Americans rallied behind the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and confidence grew that the post-9/11 economy would not go into recession as widely feared. The index bottomed in August 2011 at 35.8, as the economy struggled to emerge from the financial crisis and key initiatives to boost economic growth had yet to have an impact.IBD/TIPP also produces the Presidential Leadership Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index saw a sharp 4.6% gain to 56.4 in July.  This is the third straight gain for the index, and the second highest it's been since October 2004. It also marks the 22nd straight month that Economic Optimism Index has been over 50 — which signals overall optimism about the economy — a record run for this index. It is also well above its long-term average of 49.4. The index stood at 44.4 in December 2007, the month that the U.S. officially entered a recession.The Six-Month Outlook is a forward-looking gauge that looks at how consumers feel about the economy's prospects over the next half year. The index climbed 4.3% to 53.4. in July. The volatile gauge surged 11.4% in January, and then bounced up and down for several months. The reading for this index remains in optimistic territory and well above its long-term average of 46.3. This index stood at 32.1 in December 2007, the month the economy fell into recession.The gauge of how Americans feel about their own finances in the next six months rose another 1.1% in July to 62.8, which marks the third straight monthly increase. The index's all-time high of 65.3 was set in January 2004, when the Bush-era tax cuts began to kick in. It jumped this January, the month President Trump's tax cuts went into effect. The Personal Financial Outlook is the most consistently optimistic index in the IBD/TIPP data set. It remains above its long-term average of 57.1.A measure of Americans' confidence in government, the Federal Policies component shot up nearly 10%, from 48.3 in June to 52.9 in July. That's the highest it's been in nearly 12 years and well above its 17-year average of 44.8. This index briefly moved into optimistic territory in February 2017 for the first time in 10 years, and in March of this year returned to that feel-good zone. Intended to gauge how Americans view government policies put in place by the president, Congress, the courts and the Federal Reserve, the Federal Policies Index has consistently been the least optimistic of the three subindexes that make up the Economic Optimism Index.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Presidential Approval IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsJune 2018May 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

687,SEE,"With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you identify the best stocks to buy and to have on your watchlist? Start by regularly checking stock lists like Sector Leaders, IBD 50 and the IBD Big Cap 20, all of which have a proven track record of outperforming the S&P 500.From big names like Apple (AAPL) and the so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — to lesser-known companies like teen-focused discount retailer Five Below (FIVE) and chip designer Nvidia (NVDA), the top-performing stocks consistently appear on IBD's screens in the early stages of their major price runs.Be sure to also regularly check IBD Stock Lists Update, which shows you which stocks were just added to — and removed from — Sector Leaders, IBD 50 and other screens.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe table below shows how indexes based on IBD's stock lists have significantly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500. In 2017, the Sector Leaders screen more than doubled the performance of the S&P, while the IBD 50 outpaced it by 79%. In Q2 2018, IBD stock lists continued to top the S&P 500. (Data as of June 29, 2018).See How To Use IBD Stock Lists And RatingsThe strategy behind IBD's stocks lists is simple.Through an ongoing study of every top-performing stock over the past 100-plus years, we've identified seven common traits big market winners typically share just before they launch their major moves.Using IBD SmartSelect Ratings and other screening criteria based on that research, we identify which stocks are most strongly showing those same traits right now.In other words, history shows what big market winners look like in the early stages of a new climb, and IBD's lists alert you to stocks that have that same look today.Also note that the screens are computer-generated and based solely on objective rules, not human emotions, guesswork or predictions.While you should never just buy a stock because it's on one of IBD's screens, regularly checking Sector Leaders and other lists is a quick and efficient way to build your own watchlist and zero in on the next crop of potential big winners.To further speed up your research, you'll also find alerts to stocks in or near a potential buy zone in the chart analysis provided for each name on Sector Leaders, IBD 50, IBD Big Cap 20, IPO Leaders and Stock Spotlight.For example, self-driving car technology leader Nvidia was featured in the IBD Big Cap 20 on March 1, 2016 and in the IBD 50 the next week on March 7. The chart analysis noted that the stock was ""working on cup base with 34.04 entry, strong weekly RS line."" That gave you time to put Nvidia on your watch list and research the company before it broke out two weeks later.From the breakout, Nvidia rocketed over 660% in just 24 months before pulling back. Throughout its run, Nvidia has continued to show up on various IBD lists and is still on the IBD 50. Nvidia is just one recent example of why you want to regularly check IBD's stock lists as part of your investing routine.Not every stock on the lists will launch those types of gains, but checking these screens regularly is a proven way to help improve your investing results by quickly building a high-quality, actionable watch list.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Which Companies Are On IBD Stock Lists Right Now?Facebook, Nvidia, Netflix Reveal 3 Key Stock-Picking TipsLessons On How To Invest: When To Buy And Sell, Chart Reading And MoreVideo: How To Find Top-Rated Stocks Before They Break Out

Just how much can the U.S. economy, which delivered solid June jobs growth on Friday, still grow after a nine-year expansion?Analysts expect another blowout quarter in Q2 — 20.7% earnings-per-share growth for S&P 500 index components and an 8.1% jump in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Wall Street is betting on continued scorching results for the rest of the year. But they may not be as scorching if President Donald Trump's trade wars with China, Canada, Mexico, Europe and others become more heated. The quiet earnings growth next year might be even more muted.Analysts say the effects of a trade war have yet to be priced into financial forecasts.""I think the first tangible impact should start showing up in estimate revisions as these earnings results come out,"" said Sheraz Mian, director of research at Zacks.In other words, the second-quarter earnings season could offer some higher drama than CEOs' usual blanched remarks about ""headwinds"" and ""tailwinds."" Investors, even more than usual, will focus on earnings guidance and post-earnings call commentary to get some answers as to how the tariffs will affect profit, sales, prices, corporate strategy and shareholder returns.Higher costs for parts and supplies that U.S. companies bring in from overseas could mean higher costs for customers. Businesses could rethink or even uproot complex global supply chains. Higher prices on U.S.-made goods sold overseas could crimp international demand. Companies could cut or delay major investments.S&P 500 index companies, filled with hundreds of U.S. multinationals and exporters, are more exposed to tariffs and global demand than the U.S. economy itself.As for the second-quarter itself, the gains from S&P 500 companies come courtesy of President Trump's tax cuts and an enduring U.S. economy.Rebounding oil prices will lift the energy sector's Q2 earnings by around 141.5%, with sales up some 20%, according to Thomson. S&P 500 energy stocks, which include Dow Jones giants Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) as well as ConocoPhillips (COP), Valero (VLO), Marathon Oil (MRO), Schlumberger (SLB) and many others, have generally been strong performers.Analysts expect the S&P 500 financials to clock a 22% gain in earnings on a 4.5% bump in revenue, as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and other banks enjoy lower taxes and deregulation. Thomson forecasts semiconductors and internet software and services to lead the S&P 500 tech components toward 25.5% earnings growth. Tech revenue is seen jumping 12%. Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) are all slated to deliver solid-to-stellar growth.As estimates stand now, Thomson Reuters is forecasting the 20%-plus earnings growth to reach into the third and fourth quarters.""The last time we had earnings growth in Q3 and Q4 like this was in 2010,"" Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Thomson Reuters, said in an email.However, looking past 2018, analysts appear to have a harder time justifying bullish expectations for S&P 500 companies.""You look at the numbers going forward, you really don't start to see a significant drop in growth until you get into 2019, when again, you'll be back to apples-to-apples on the tax rates,"" said John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet.But tougher comparisons aren't a massive concern right now, analysts say. And next year's growth still looks solid. Dhillon said that for 2019 investors can expect a 9.7% earnings growth rate, ""which is still higher than the 20-year average of 7.3%.""Wall Street also worries that the U.S. economy has fewer tools at its disposal to keep its marathon run going. The dollar is stronger. The yield curve is flatter due partly to the Federal Reserve's decisions to lift short-term interest rates.The narrowing yield curve, the gap between rates on short-term and long-term government debt, looms large for banks in particular. The flatter curve, also seen as a precursor to an economic downturn, has dragged bank stocks lower in recent months.Banks also lend money to borrowers based on long-term rates, but borrow from depositors according to short-term rates. The narrower the difference between the two, the narrower the banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan, Citigroup (C) and Wells Fargo (WFC) report second-quarter earnings on Friday.The three banking giants, which all announced hefty shareholder-return packages last month, are expected to deliver solid EPS growth. But JPMorgan stock, along with that of Citigroup, Wells Fargo and others, is near 2018 lows.When the Fed raises rates that affects the money flowing into global, emerging markets as well.""If U.S. interest rates are going up,"" Mian said, ""and an investor or a class of investors is scouring world markets for yield and returns, and if the yield and return is going up in a developed market like the U.S., then there's no reason to take the extra risk of going to Argentina or Turkey when you can get it in the U.S.""The U.S. on Friday lobbed tariffs at $34 billion worth of Chinese products — more than 800 types of products total. That's the first part of a $50 billion response for what Trump says are China's trade abuses against the U.S.The U.S. tariffs target aircraft parts, industrial parts and equipment, some vehicles and other machinery. The duties from the U.S. targeted products related to China's tech-focused ""Made in China 2025"" plan. Trump has said that initiative would ""hurt economic growth for the United States and many other countries.""""The United States can no longer tolerate losing our technology and intellectual property through unfair economic practices,"" Trump said in a statement last month.China on Friday responded with penalties of its own on U.S. products, including automakers and agriculture. China aimed those tariffs squarely at Trump's base.Trump has threatened to levy another $200 billion in tariffs on China, and even more. Meanwhile, Trump has threatened to impose a global import tariff on autos. That follows duties on steel and aluminum that have spurred Europe, Canada and Mexico to retaliate.Further trade discord could force companies to rethink their supply chains. Those adjustments could undo corporate America's efforts over the past two decades to more efficiently manage their inventories. Such practices over that time firmed up businesses' balance sheets.The brinkmanship has swept up some of the most iconic American businesses along the way. General Motors (GM) said as much last week, warning that more tariffs would lead to ""reduced presence at home and abroad for this iconic American company.""Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would offer more detail, on its earnings call this month, about its plans to move some production out of the U.S. to skirt tariffs from the EU. Brown-Forman (BFB) is raising the price of Jack Daniel's in parts of Europe because of the tariffs imposed by the EU.No one knows how the Trump trade wars, and their impact on S&P 500 companies, will play out.""We expect company-specific risks from tariffs and China-trade exposures to be a central discussion topic during 2Q18 earnings calls,"" RBC analyst Deane Dray, who covers industrials vulnerable to steel and aluminum tariffs, wrote in a note last month. ""But no one has a crystal ball on how the tariff situation will ultimately play out, especially the potential knock-on effects.""He said companies like 3M (MMM) and Danaher (DHR) looked best equipped among industrials to handle the trade disputes.The trade war also threatens chipmakers like Micron (MU). A Chinese court blocked sales of some of its chips in the country, a move seen as pushback from the nation against Trump's trade salvos. China has held up approving the Qualcomm (QCOM) takeover of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Boeing (BA) isn't subject to China tariffs, but Beijing could favor Airbus (EADSY) jets in a protracted U.S.-China trade war. The aerospace company in April downplayed worries over a trade war.Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford covers transportation and logistics companies like UPS (UPS), FedEx (FDX) and Expeditors International (EXPD). Hartford wrote in a research note last month that he'd seen no ""material evidence (yet) of freight volume weakness amid rising global trade tensions.""Some analysts, like Tigress' Ivan Feinseth, expressed optimism that strength in corporate earnings would offset any trade damage. Others wonder how much a trade war will hurt corporate travel for the likes of global carriers like American Airlines (AAL) and Delta Air Lines (DAL), and cargo demand broadly. Delta Air earnings are due Thursday.""We still expect demand to grow, but those expectations are dampened with each new tariff introduced,"" Alexandre de Juniac, CEO of the International Air Transport Association, said of air cargo demand in a statement this week.

714,SEE,"Selling stocks at the top is a worthy goal for swing trading but easier said than done. Combining the context of the stock market indexes with the price action in individual stocks can inform your selling decisions. That was how a sell in Akamai Technologies ended up within 1% from its recent top.Your success in a swing trade doesn't just depend on a single decision or metric. It starts with buying right. Then determining your holding rules. Finally, how to maximize your profits or reduce your losses when selling stocks.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) formed a classic cup-with-handle pattern in March and April. It joined IBD's SwingTrader after breaking out on June 5 at 78.43 with double its average volume (1). The stop loss was a little different on this one. Normally, a stop loss at the low of the entry day is appropriate. A drop below that level usually signals the stock may need more time to consolidate. For swing trading, we'd rather take the small loss and move on to a new opportunity. That helps us maximize profits in our shorter time frame.For Akamai, a stop loss at the entry day low was too tight, less than 1.5%. If you make your stop too tight, a loss is more likely due to a brief shakeout. In this case, we moved the stop loss to the prior day's low for a 3% risk percentage. A proper stop loss is essential for holding a stock.That extra room came in handy since the stock did challenge the low of the entry day the very next session (2). Two days later, Akamai fell again. This time it fell below the 5-day moving average and re-challenged the entry day low but reversed strongly (3). A tighter stop loss would mean taking a loss in this trade and missing the subsequent move. It also demonstrates why we wait to see if the stock closes below the 5-day moving average line or gets support before making our sell decision.After two weeks, we hit our 5% profit goal and took full profits at 82.38 (4). Those familiar with our swing trading strategies may note a departure from our normal routine in selling stocks. Usually, we take half profits at the 5% level and see if we can maximize profits toward a 10% profit goal. Two things influenced the decision for the early sell here.First, the time of the trade. Swing trading looks at a typical trade length of just a couple of weeks. We seek short explosive moves and then take profits on the way up. This often avoids pullbacks that follow. We were already at a trade length of two weeks when we hit the 5% profit goal.Second, the Nasdaq composite was already extended when Akamai Technologies joined SwingTrader. At the time of the sell, the index was holding up well enough but showed difficulty making progress. Market context is a huge factor in determining whether holding or selling stocks is more appropriate. Akamai did have a couple attempts at progress above 83 but couldn't hold it long. Less than a week after the sell and the stock was down 3% from our exit price.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits: Knowing When To Say WhenDon't Be Greedy!

715,SEE,"Can the future really be female if an unspoken gender gap keeps quietly eating away at women's futures? While women have been shown to outperform men at investing, they tend to shun the stock market for the deceptive safety of cash savings, leaving men to reap the gains — and keep a grip on the world's private wealth.This disconnect between women and Wall Street runs deep. Hollywood portrayals only underscore the divide, from the chest-thumping boys' club in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" to ""Sex and the City"" heroine Carrie Bradshaw. As she once said about investing, in a phrase that launched a thousand Etsy posters: ""I like my money right where I can see it — hanging in my closet.""In the real world, millennial women in particular are financially vulnerable. The investing gender gap can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of a lifetime. That means the difference between being in control of the future and being swept away by the undercurrent of daily expenses.""One thing we realize more than ever these days is that money is power. And that if you don't have as much money as the guys do, it can put you in a tough position,"" says Sallie Krawcheck, CEO of investing platform Ellevest. ""It can keep you in a job you don't want to do. It can keep you in a relationship you don't want to be in. It can keep you from taking that trip around the world, or starting the business you've been dreaming about.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseCompared with the average single man, the average single woman's net worth is three times smaller, according to a joint study from Merrill Lynch and Age Wave.Pay equity is part of the equation, compounded by the fact that women are more likely to pause their careers to raise children and take care of aging parents and spouses. Compared with a man with no workforce interruptions, the average woman cumulatively has earned $1.06 million less by the time she hits retirement age.""Women, generally, we're leaning in to our careers and we're becoming much more comfortable around being ambitious professionally. But we're not having that same dynamic (with our money),"" says Jennifer Barrett, a former CNBC personal finance editor and the current editor-in-chief of Grow, a web publication from micro-investing app Acorns. ""It's to our detriment if we don't invest.""No matter where you look, the numbers are pretty straightforward: Compared with men, women are tepid about the stock market. Some 57% of women didn't invest a dime in 2017, vs. 44% of men, according to a recent Acorns study. If handed a thousand bucks, 2.5 times more men than women said they would put that money in stocks. Women also lag men in 401(k) participation and contribution, says the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies.Some women are already feeling the fear of missing out.The Merrill Lynch/Age Wave study found that 41% of women said their greatest financial regret was not investing more of their money. That even trumps career, credit-card and lifestyle woes.Thirty-year-old Caroline Rhoads, an account director at a marketing firm in Philadelphia, said Wall Street ""seems very intimidating.""She has consulted a financial planner once, invested around $1,000 through a Robinhood account, and feels good about her 401(k) and financial future. But she invests conservatively, ""because I feel like if I'm going to invest I need to know what I'm doing, and I don't.""Bridging the investing gender gap may seem abstract and distant, particularly for 20-something women mired in student debt, decades away from retirement. But there are serious consequences for not at least trying to get the ball rolling.""In not being comfortable investing, what you're saying is you're not comfortable building wealth,"" says Barrett. And the gender gap there is ""growing, not shrinking, even as women are earning more and closing the wage gap. We still have a gaping wealth gap.""If it's so important, why is there a dearth of female investors? What accounts for this gender gap in the market? More than a couple of things, it turns out.Think back to ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's testosterone-fueled, Martin Scorsese-directed yacht parties, filled with models and bottles. And earlier this year, an E-Trade Financial (ETFC) ad showed men cavorting with bikini-clad women on a yacht. Who wouldn't want to be associated with that lifestyle?Uh, women.""I can't help but equate Wall Street with the a**hole bros filling lower Manhattan bars most nights, who drink too much, act rudely toward women, and generally behave badly,"" wrote Refinery29's Work & Money Director Lindsey Stanberry in a 2016 story on how to invest. ""Do I really want to put my hard-earned money in their hands? (No.)""Ellevest's Krawcheck says the fact that the investing gender gap even exists ""tells me that women are not being well served by the existing investing industry and by Wall Street.""She should know. Her Wall Street cred includes stints as the head of Merrill Lynch and Citigroup's (C) wealth management divisions. Now she is a vocal proponent of something she calls ""financial feminism,"" or wealth equality between men and women.And no, the solution isn't slapping a bunch of pink labels on existing financial products. Of her days at the heavyweights, Krawcheck said efforts to appeal to female investors didn't consider their financial desires.Ellevest's ""gender-aware"" investing algorithms, she says, consider key differences about women. Their salaries peak sooner than men's. They earn less over their lifetimes. They are more likely than men to outlive their resources.So she aims to help investors reach their goals, not beat the market. Wall Street's obsession with outperforming the stock market indexes ""leaves women completely cold,"" she says.Female investors are more interested in reaching certain milestones, such as retiring at a certain income, buying a home or starting a business, she adds.And she's quick to dismiss the notion that women's risk aversion toward stocks drives the investing gender gap.""It's not that she's risk averse, she's risk aware. And the industry has done a poor job explaining risk to her,"" said Krawcheck of female investors. ""When she understands it, she's happy to take it.""But it's true that women are doing less with their money. Financial services startup SoFi found that men contribute 32% more to their investment accounts than women do, and tend to invest more aggressively.Meanwhile, women are equally or more confident than men in paying bills and setting budgets. But they're far less confident about managing their investments, say Merrill Lynch/Age Wave researchers.Maybe that's why female investors keep more of their money in cash. According to an oft-cited BlackRock study from 2015, female investors keep 68% of their portfolios in cash vs. men's 59%.The apparent safety of a savings account, however, is deceptive. Over the long run, hoarding cash is a terrible way to increase net worth. Consider the math: Interest rates on savings are near zero while inflation is now 2%, which means that $1,000 in the bank today is objectively worth less in the future.Additionally, it pays to take advantage of compounding interest.Say you invest $500 tomorrow in a low-cost index fund that tracks the S&P 500. Then add 50 bucks to that account every month thereafter. Say it grows by an average 8% every year. (Over the last 90 years, the average yearly return for the S&P 500 has been 9.8%, even accounting for crashes.) In 30 years, a no-interest savings account would have grown to $18,500. Your investment in the stock market would have amassed $73,001.26.Still, that's easier said than done for those who don't trust Wall Street. There's a whole generation of women and men who remain deeply distrustful of the stock market. Both the dot-com crash and the Great Recession blindsided them in their formative years.""In a short period of time, they saw two recessions and two market meltdowns,"" says Bankrate Chief Financial Analyst Greg McBride. ""Those memories are fresh. So a lot of (millennials) just never warmed up to equities and have taken a naturally risk-averse stance, detrimental though that may be to their long-term financial health.""Younger people prefer real estate and cash over the stock market, according to Bankrate surveys. And millennial women in particular are in a financially precarious position.""Here's my concern, and it's heightened for millennial women,"" says McBride. ""Millennials are going to have the biggest retirement savings burden in history,"" thanks to longer life spans, fewer pensions, more uncertainty around Social Security, and higher health costs than any generation before them. And holding on to safe-haven assets like gold, he says, is not going to cut it.""To accumulate retirement savings, you need the power of compounding to do the heavy lifting.""Michelle Trejo, a 29-year-old quality assurance engineer in Los Angeles, says that her main vehicle for retirement is her 401(k), though she isn't sure how much she's contributing. Once she saves more money, she is looking to invest in real estate, and then potentially in the stock market.""I wish I knew how to play (the stock market),"" says Trejo, who has dabbled in cryptocurrencies, a far higher-risk investment than stocks. ""I know there's a lot of money there. I just don't know how to get started.""Some experts venture that women get a one-sided directive about what to do with their money: Spend it.""Generally speaking, if you look at who's spending money on clothes and keeping up with the trends,"" says Barrett, ""it's not men. It's women.""Think about how many magazines or style blogs talk about buying ""investment pieces"": a classic necklace, a blazer that will never go out of style. An analysis from purse reseller Baghunter will have you believe that a Birkin bag from Hermes is a better purchase than gold. Of course, that assumes you hold on to the bag for 35 years and keep it in mint condition.""When we talk about buying a handbag as an investment, it makes me cringe,"" said Barrett.That mindset extends beyond the investing gender gap to the venture-capital world.Men with wealth are encouraged to amass more wealth, said The Helm CEO and co-founder Lindsey Taylor Wood at the recent United State of Women conference. Her venture fund invests in female entrepreneurs.""Their buddies are like, 'Get in on this deal, invest in this company, buy this stock,' "" she said. By contrast, ""women with wealth are invited to give their money away. 'Chair this gala, join this nonprofit, be on this board.' ""A notable 61% of women would rather chat about their own death (!) than talk about money, according to Merrill Lynch/Age Wave data.""In our society, talking about money is pretty taboo for women; we learn this from childhood,"" says Ellevest's Krawcheck. ""If you're not talking about money, how do you know what raise to ask for, or how to invest? The answer is: You don't. And women are the poorer for it.""That deep-rooted behavior is encoded early on. In fact, 63% of millennial women vs. 53% of their male peers learned from their parents about saving money at an early age, according to a recent PNC Investments survey. But only 29% of those same women said their parents showed them how to grow wealth, vs. 37% of men.""(There are the) stories that we tell ourselves and the stories that we've heard and internalize,"" says Acorns' Barrett, who is writing a book about the wealth gender gap. ""That investing is hard, that you need to be wealthy to invest. Women in particular get that message a lot. And if you look at the research — even the way parents talk to their sons and daughters about money is different.""Kathy Mirescu, a 40-year-old director of product design, is far from the norm when it comes to enthusiasm for personal finance. It is a quality the Los Angeles resident learned from her mother, a self-taught commercial real estate investor with an accounting background who ""was always looking for investment opportunities and would talk about them"" openly with her three children.""I just grew up not really thinking about it, until I became a lot older, and I started realizing that a lot of my friends, a lot of my peers, who are college educated — a lot of them have advanced degrees — didn't know a lot of the things that I just knew"" about finance, said Mirescu.She bought her own condo at just 29. The down payment came from cash and proceeds from the sale of blue chip stocks that her mother bought for her early on in life.Now Mirescu wants to start an investing club that will help her friends and other women become more financially literate. ""To just simply have a place where we all get in a room,"" she said, and ""help each other set up Roth IRAs.""Acorns' survey found that 42% of women chose Oprah as the person they'd be most likely to take investing advice from. More than half of men chose Warren Buffett.That likely speaks more to women's trust in Oprah than the gender gap, says Barrett. But it also serves to highlight how few female investors are well known on Wall Street.""If you think about really famous investors — can you think of a woman?"" she said. ""We don't have a lot of female role models."" (According to the Merrill study, 45% of women don't have a financial role model, to be exact.)Krawcheck, who took the stage at the United State of Women conference to hearty applause, is an emerging rock star in the realm of financial feminism. At the mention of the Ellevest founder, Mirescu starts ""fan-girling."" (Her words.)She, too, sees money as a ""feminist issue.""""It's about having choices, and money gives you the freedom to have choices,"" says Mirescu.

Shares are consolidating with a buy point at 149.44. Biotech stocks collectively rose less than 2%.The biotech company is using a priority review voucher for ALXN1210. It aims to treat a rare blood disease called paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. A priority review voucher allows for an eight-month FDA review period as opposed to 12 months.RBC analyst Kennen MacKay says this could add to 2019 expectations.

These applications will also be in the same rare blood disease.MacKay has an outperform rating on Alexion stock.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges is similarly bullish on ALXN1210. Alexion presented updated data for ALXN1210 at the European Hematology Association annual meeting. ALXN1210 appears to offer more consistent effectiveness with less frequent dosing, he said in his note to clients.""After this presentation, it's clear to us that ALXN1210 is even more differentiated than we had anticipated and is likely to dominate treatment of newly diagnosed paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria,"" Porges said.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

717,SEE,"Dow Jones futures rose Tuesday morning, along with S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures, on crude oil, China and Germany. On Monday, the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite erased early losses to close higher. On the flip side, Tesla stock looked strong before and just after the opening bell on Tesla (TSLA) Model 3 production, but reversed to close lower. Facebook stock fell modestly late as it confirmed that more federal agencies are probing the social giant's data sharing practices. Meanwhile, recent hot IPOs Pivotal Software (PVTL) and Chinese livestreaming stocks iQiyi (IQ) and Huya (HUYA) are trying to find support after sharp pullbacks.Dow Jones futures rose 0.6% vs. fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.5%. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.7%.U.S. crude oil futures rose more than 1%, approaching $75 a barrel. Iran admitted renewed U.S. sanctions will hurt exports while Libya supply woes returned. China's Shanghai composite stemmed a slide as China's central bank talked up a falling yuan. The benchmark Chinese index is in a bear market. Finally, European stocks rallied as German Chancellor Angela Merkel reached an immigration compromise with Bavarian rebels who threatened her long-running reign.Remember that U.S. markets close early today, at 1 p.m. ET, and are closed for the 4th of July.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

The focus is on the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and whether public Facebook statements have been truthful.Facebook stock rose 1.6% to 197.36 in Monday's stock market trading. That's at the edge of a 5% chase zone from a 188.42 buy point.Tesla stock action Monday offered a trio of key investing lessons.Be wary of overnight trading: Trading after the close and before the open often doesn't translate into how a stock will close in the next session. Tesla rose more 6% than in premarket trade and shortly after the opening bell. That came on news that Tesla Model 3 production topped 5,000 in the last week of June, the first time the electric vehicle maker hit that weekly milestone. But Tesla stock quickly pared gains, and by the close fell 2.3% to 335.07. Some analysts wondered if Tesla Model 3 output was sustainable.Likewise, Dow Jones futures, S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures all pointed lower before Monday open, but the actual indexes rallied for slim-to-solid gains.For what it's worth, Tesla stock fell 0.9% in Tuesday's premarket.Good news sometimes spurs selling: ""Buy the rumor, sell the news"" is an old stock market saying that doesn't always hold up. But the stock market does a good job of pricing in good news, especially if that news is expected. Tesla stock had rallied strongly in late May to June 18 as CEO Elon Musk predicted Model 3 output would hit 5,000 in the last week of June.Given that Musk's promises often don't hold up, it wasn't surprising to see Tesla stock rally early Monday. But ultimately the ""sell the news"" trend took hold.Wait for a proper buy point: Even at the Tesla stock intraday peak of 364.78, it was still well below a 373.83 handle buy point. When a stock clears a buy point, the odds are high that it will rise, and rise strongly. That's no guarantee, but you make big money bets when the odds are in your favor.Tesla stock also reflects a fourth investing lesson over the long run.Focus on the very best stocks: Tesla has a Composite Rating of just 38 out of a possible 99. All-time stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of big runs. That reflects Tesla's significant losses and recent poor, sluggish share price performance. Tesla's relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, has been lagging for nearly a year. The RS line really hasn't made headway for more than four years.Obviously, Tesla stock has been a big winner, from its April 2013 breakout to the end of February 2014. Perhaps the company is turning the corner in terms of production and cash burn. If so, the stock may be a big winner. But investors generally should focus on the best of the best of the best.Pivotal Software is a Dell spinoff. Its cloud-based service helps companies streamline software development and manage apps. Huya, a spinoff of YY (YY), is the leading Chinese streaming site for video games. IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, is called the ""Netflix of China.""Pivotal stock is finding support right at its 20-day line after the April IPO blasted higher in early June but then pulled back.The Chinese livestreaming IPOs have been consolidating for a few days before their 20-day lines, after significant pullbacks. Huya stock and iQiyi stock had skyrocketed in June, becoming sharply extended from their 10-day moving lines. That made a near-term retreat likely.On Monday, Pivotal stock rose 1.8% to 24.70. iQiyi stock rose 1.55% to 32.80. Huya stock sank 2.4% to 32.10, but held above a recent near-term low and closed near session highs.Early Tuesday, iQiyi stock and Huya stock rose 1.7% and 0.8%, respectively. Pivotal stock was not yet active.But it's early days for these stocks. Just because a stock has stopped falling for a few days, or even begun to move higher, doesn't mean it's a buy. Wait for a stock to consolidate and blast out of a new buy point.Just look at Brazilian IPO PagSeguro (PAGS). The payments stock rocketed from early February to late March.

718,SEE,"A mixed week for IBD's Global Leaders list saw some mixed action in the past week, but a promising chart for Atlassian (TEAM).There were some heavy losses among China-based names, with Alibaba Group (BABA), ZTO Express (ZTO) and Huazhu Group (HTHT) carving deep declines as China's domestic markets staged a sharp pullback.At the other end of the spectrum, China-based IPO CLPS (CLPS) spiked about 50% for the week. That left the financial software provider more than 150% above its May 24 IPO price.The list's only other gains for the week came from stocks outside China: Mellanox (MLNX) and Orion Engineered Carbons (OEC). Both are extended from buy points.Among the week's more interesting chart action, software developer Atlassian — headquartered in the U.K. with its operations in Australia — added a tenth week to an unusual base pattern.Atlassian's cloud-based products help direct project-management and team collaboration within large companies and government agencies. IBD Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW) is a key competitor, as are Box (BOX) and the start up Slack. In addition, Microsoft (MSFT) entered the market in early 2017 with its own products. It moved more seriously into the space early this month with its $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub.Atlassian has also been an acquirer, paying $425 million for Trello in January last year. Analysts expect to see more deals.Despite the competition, consensus views see Atlassian earnings rising 33% this year and 40% in 2019. Revenue growth is projected at 34% and 30%, respectively, over the same two years.Atlassian shares are up about 42% so far this year. The advance has been saw-toothed, with many highs and lows, including a breakout attempt that failed in February. At the same time, the gains have been loosely cradled by the stock's 10-week moving average.The result sets up the perfect circumstances for an ascending base, considered to be a rare but bullish chart pattern. An ascending base forms when buying pressure forces a stock higher, while general weakness in the market triggers periodic flight among investors.The result is a three-lobe base that forms over a nine-to-16 week period. Each grotto within the base forms higher highs and higher lows. The final high provides the position of the buy point.In Atlassian's case, the base began during the week ended April 20. The buy point is at 68.85. The stock has been trying to clear that entry but fell almost 5% early Friday, testing support at its 10-week moving average before paring losses to around 2%. That left shares down a bit more than 2% for the week.While the base is considered rare, IBD Leaderboard and Global Leaders stock Autohome (ATHM) broke out from an ascending base May 30 with a 107.64 buy point.And while the bases tend to be bullish, some do fail. Alibaba Group broke out from an ascending base in September. The stock rose 8% before pulling back far enough to trigger the automatic sell rule in February.By Thursday, Atlassian's relative strength line had leveled out at new highs. Its Accumulation/Distribution rating was a B-, suggesting institutions were buying moderately.RELATED:Autohome Stock 'Ascends' Into Buy Zone Via This Rare, Bullish BaseHow Atlassian Stacks Up Versus ServiceNow, Microsoft In EnterpriseAtlassian Bulls Focus On Customer Growth, Product InvestmentsInternet Tax Decision, OPEC Worries Spur Selling; Time To Sell Growth Stocks?Trade War Heats Up As EU Tariffs To Kick In: Investing Action Plan

723,SEE,"Walt Disney (DIS) won U.S. antitrust approval for its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox's (FOXA) entertainment assets, raising hurdles to a potential rival bid from Comcast (CMCSA).XDisney agreed to sell Fox's regional sports networks to resolve the Justice Department's concerns that the deal would raise prices for pay-TV companies, according to court filings made Wednesday in New York.Disney rose to a session high after Bloomberg reported that the government clearance was imminent. It climbed 1% to $105.41 at 12:11 p.m. in New York. Fox gained as much as 2.5%.The approval is a victory for Disney in its battle with Comcast for one of the media industry's biggest prizes. Fox last week accepted a sweetened bid from Disney, which upped its offer following Comcast's competing $65 billion bid. The $38-a-share price is about $10 a share higher than what Disney offered in December -- and $3 above Comcast's bid.Comcast is now mulling its next steps, including possibly teaming up with private equity investors in its pursuit of Fox assets, a person familiar with the situation said. The Wall Street Journal reported that if the bidding reaches a high enough level -- say, $90 billion -- the company may go to private equity firms or other backers for help. In one scenario cited by the newspaper, a strategic investor could take on Fox's U.S. assets -- including the 20th Century Fox studio and regional sports networks -- and leave Comcast with overseas assets.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That threat prompted AT&T (T) to buy Time Warner, a deal the government challenged and lost at trial.Disney and Comcast have traded jabs over which bid would face an easier path to regulatory approval, an important consideration for Fox stockholders, who must weigh which deal to accept. A July 10 Fox shareholder vote on the Disney deal was postponed to a ""future date"" to allow more time to evaluate Disney's new offer.When Comcast made its bid for Fox, Comcast Chief Executive Officer Brian Roberts said in a letter to Murdoch and his sons that he is ""highly confident"" that Comcast will ""obtain all necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and that our transaction is as or more likely to receive regulatory approval than the Disney transaction.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

724,SEE,"Check out the way Facebook stock has responded to the data-breach scandal that smacked the company earlier this year, and it seems clear the social networking giant's long apology tour has helped lift the stock.XOn the public relations and Facebook (FB) news pages of the company's website, there are headlines such as ""Removing Bad Actors From Facebook."" It says Facebook took down 2.5 million pieces of hate speech and disabled 583 million fake accounts in the first quarter of 2018. Further, the company is still running a media blitz that started in May called ""Facing Facts,"" an explanatory campaign that includes national commercial broadcasts and regular messages to Facebook users.Facebook also is trying to keep users updated on what it's doing to prevent false news and how its fact-checking program is working. It has pledged to commit a task force of 20,000 people to get the job done.Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, has called the data breach the darkest chapter in Facebook's 14-year history. Still, he says, the fundamental damage to the social network's platform has been ""very contained.""""We're seeing minimal damage over the last few months, in terms of user engagement, trends and advertising,"" said Ives. ""Facebook is going through a hand-holding period with users, regulators and app developers to make sure these things can't be repeated.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs details of the data breach emerged, Facebook stock plunged 24% from a high of 195.32 on Feb. 1 to a one-year low of 149.02 on March 26. But the stock has rebounded 32% since then, indicating Facebook's mea culpa and recovery plan is working. Facebook stock surged to another all-time high of 203.55 on June 20. On Monday, shares gained 1.6% to close at 197.36 on the stock market today.Facebook's data breach involved research firm Cambridge Analytica and its access to personal information from 87 million users of the social network. The breach seeped its way into the U.S. presidential election of 2016, due to its connection with alleged Russian meddling.In subsequent congressional hearings, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg was dragged before both House and Senate panels, giving 10 hours worth of testimony. Since then, Facebook has faced a storm of criticism from users, advertisers and regulators over the past few months, both in the U.S. and Europe.Facebook's troubles helped spur the European Union into implementing the General Data Protection Regulation, which created data protection rules across Europe. It took effect in May, and Facebook and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google unit already have complied.But it has also raised a question as to whether digital advertising revenue at Facebook and Google will be impacted long-term by a regulatory wave in Europe and in the U.S.""It's created some disruption but I think the bark is worse than the bite,"" said GBH's Ives. Ives has a rating of highly attractive on Facebook stock and price target of 225.Whatever troubles Facebook is facing hasn't slowed its consistent pace of double-digit growth in revenue and earnings. Facebook's first-quarter revenue jumped 49% from the year-ago period to $11.96 billion, along with 63% growth in earnings per share.For the second quarter, analysts are looking for Facebook to report revenue growth of 43% to $13.3 billion. They also see 30% growth in earnings per share.Working in Facebook's favor is its massive size. It has 2.2 billion monthly active users, one-third of the world's global population. That's up 14% from the same period a year ago. About 1.45 billion people log on daily, spending an average of 20 minutes per visit.Put it all together and Facebook has enormous influence among advertisers, which account for about 96% of its revenue. Facebook's clout, resulting from the large amount of data it has on users, is matched only by Google. Combined, the two rake in about 60% of digital advertising spending. That includes Alphabet's YouTube.Other social networking sites, including Twitter (TWTR), Snap (SNAP), Pinterest and Yelp (YELP) have hardly put a dent in Facebook's armor.All this is occurring while Facebook stock still has several revenue-growth levers to pull. Its biggest ace-in-the-hole right now is Instagram, the photo- and video-sharing mobile platform that just surpassed 1 billion users. Compare that with Snap's Snapchat, which had 191 million users at the end of the first quarter.Facebook has steadily monetized Instagram with ads. The company does not break out Instagram revenue. It is, however, seen by analysts as a core revenue driver with a lot of room to accelerate.KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Andy Hargreaves believes ad revenue will more than double from a year ago to $8.9 billion. By 2020, he thinks Instagram will account for 26% of Facebook's total revenue.""As core Facebook matures, Instagram is the key to the next leg of growth,"" Hargreaves wrote in a report to clients this month. He has an overweight rating on Facebook and price target of 245.""Facebook continues to grow its core user base and increase the effectiveness of its advertising offerings, which, when combined with a massive opportunity to grow Instagram and monetize its messaging products, we believe creates a substantial opportunity for future growth for many years,"" he wrote.Another growth lever is the Facebook Messenger platform.This past month, analysts have spotted some of the first advertisements on Messenger. That includes ads from Staples, Uber and Peloton.""Just in the last two weeks we have seen consistent ads in Facebook Messenger for the first time,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a June 19 note to clients. Facebook Messenger has 1.3 billion monthly active users.Mahaney thinks Messenger could contribute $6 billion to $8 billion in revenue. That translates into $1 in earnings per share to the company by 2020. He has an outperform rating on Facebook and price target of 250.Another future growth lever is Facebook's other messaging platform, WhatsApp, with 1.5 billion users.There is one overhang out there that analysts are watching closely. The issue is whether younger users are abandoning the platform for social apps considered more ""cool,"" or other reasons. It's already happening, but not to a level that has yet threatened the stock, GBH's Ives says.Facebook had dominated the social media landscape among America's youth. But it no longer is the most popular online platform among teens, a recent Pew Research Center survey said. In a survey on Facebook and teenage usage, about half of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 say they use Facebook, but they use YouTube, Instagram or Snapchat more often, in that order.Notably, it said 95% of those teens have a smartphone, with almost half saying they ""almost constantly"" use the internet. That's a big pool of advertising opportunity.""That's been a challenging demographic for them and speaks to why the Instagram acquisition will go down as one of Zuckerberg's best moves in the evolution of Facebook,"" said Ives. ""What Instagram has done is put a competitive moat around that demographic.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:Mark Zuckerberg, The Facebook Data Breach And The Dark Side Of Social MediaFacebook's Zuckerberg Admits Big Mistake, Apologizes For ScandalFacebook Rejects Claims In New York Times Story About User Data AbuseFor First Time, Facebook Seen Losing Youth Audience To Snapchat

Crude oil prices hit multiyear highs. General Electric (GE), kicked out of the Dow Jones, announced a partial breakup. Amazon.com (AMZN) moves disrupted the pharmacy and shipping industries. Harley-Davidson (HOG) said it would shift some production to Europe due to tariffs, angering President Donald Trump.The Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite sold off on Monday and Wednesday, breaking or testing key support levels, amid concerns about Trump trade war moves against China investment. All three fell for the week, even with gains on Thursday and Friday. So far in 2018, the Dow Jones is down 1.8%, while the S&P 500 has gained 1.7% and the Nasdaq 8.8%. The Treasury yield curve continued to flatten, signaling concerns about Fed rate hikes down the road. Bank stocks, under pressure for weeks on the flattening yield curve, rebounded Friday after the Fed cleared most to raise dividends and buybacks. Energy stocks rallied as crude prices soared. GE popped on its restructuring plan. Nike sprinted on a U.S. sales revival and a big stock buyback.Oil futures jumped more than 8% to $74.15 a barrel to their highest levels since 2014 over supply issues from North America and Iran. The Trump Administration warned allies that they needed to stop importing Iranian crude by November, according to reports. Meanwhile, a key oil-sands facility in Canada will be shut down until August. U.S. crude stockpiles fell by 9.9 million barrels, more than expected, while gasoline supplies rose by 1.2 million barrels, according to weekly Energy Information Administration data. Domestic production was flat last week at 10.9 million barrels per day.General Electric (GE) ended a century-plus run on the Dow Jones industrial average and said it plans to shrink even further. The industrial giant, seeking to pare debt and simplify, will spin off GE Healthcare and divest its majority stake in oilfield services company Baker Hughes (BHGE). After prior, smaller divestitures, GE will now focus on aviation, power and renewable energy.

The iconic motorcycle maker said the EU tax — retaliation for Trump's steel and aluminum tariffs — would cost it roughly $100 million a year. After announcing a plan to shift production for Europe overseas to avoid the hit, Harley took fire from Trump's tweets. Analysts see some risk that Harley-Davidson could suffer a long-term reputation hit. Harley stock retreated.Amazon turned to small fry to disrupt two major industries on Thursday. Its deal to buy online pharmacy PillPack, with $100 million in 2017 revenue, gave Amazon just a toehold in a $300 billion industry. But it roiled many health care stocks. New Dow Jones stock Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) tumbled 9.9% on Thursday. CVS Health (CVS), which is buying insurer Aetna (AET) partly in anticipation of Amazon entering the pharmacy space, fell 6.1%. Drug distributor McKesson (MCK) fell 6.1%. Amazon also said it would help entrepreneurs launch local businesses delivering Amazon packages with fleets of up 40 vehicles.

Wells Fargo (WFC) rallied Friday on its buyback and dividend plan. But JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and many other bank stocks slashed gains or closed lower. But the Fed restricted the payout plans of Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs (GS) and failed the U.S. division of the embattled Deutsche Bank (DB). The Fed said Morgan and Goldman would ""maintain their capital distributions at the levels they paid in recent years"" after their capital ratios fell below the Fed's minimum — the result of a one-time reduction due to tax reform. Goldman and Morgan came close to missing the Fed's minimum on a key leverage ratio in the first round of the tests.This past week 11 IPOs raised about $2.8 billion.

Canopy turned in a steeper loss than a year ago as it spent more on investments ahead of Canada's recreational legalization. Beer-and-wine giant Constellation Brands (STZ), which has taken a stake in Canopy, reported fiscal Q1 earnings per share that missed estimates, with sales roughly in line. Shares of Constellation tumbled Friday.Sonic earnings rose 21% to 52 cents a share, better than consensus for 49 cents EPS, but sales slid more than expected, declining nearly 5% to $118 million vs. analyst views for $120 million in revenue. The fast-food drive-in chain now projects full-year earnings of $1.45-$1.49, vs. prior guidance for $1.43-$1.50. The narrower guidance implies below-consensus Q4 EPS.

Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) shares also dropped as Carnival warned on fuel costs and exchange rates.Paychex (PAYX) retreated from a potential 73.20 buy point after quarterly earnings met and revenue edged past estimates. The payroll and HR services provider expects revenue to grow 6% to 7% in fiscal 2019 and EPS to rise 11%, as it fends off existing and new rivals, such as cloud-based Paycom Software (PAYC).Walgreens Boots Alliance announced a $10 billion buyback and quarterly dividend hike to 44 cents.

728,SEE,"Conagra Brands (CAG) agreed to buy Pinnacle Foods (PF) for about $8.1 billion in cash and stock, gaining freezer-aisle brands such as Birds Eye to capitalize on growing demand for frozen foods.XThe deal values Pinnacle at $68 a share, the companies said in a statement Wednesday. The price is 23% above Pinnacle's closing level on April 19, when an activist investor disclosed a stake in the Parsippany, New Jersey-based company and began pushing it to sell itself. Bloomberg News reported last week that Conagra had approached Pinnacle about a deal. Including assumed debt, the deal values Pinnacle at about $10.9 billion.The purchase will give Chicago-based Conagra more exposure to one of the few bright spots in the grocery store: Frozen food sales are growing after years of decline. Even millennials, known for their foodie tastes, are embracing frozen meals, which are convenient and less expensive than takeout. More than half of Pinnacle's revenue comes from frozen brands including Birds Eye, Van de Kamp's and the Gardein line of vegetarian products.The pressure on packaged-food makers to get bigger has intensified in the aftermath of Whole Foods Market's sale last year to Amazon (AMZN). Frozen food, however, is considered relatively resistant to Amazon's push to get shoppers to buy more groceries online because they're tricky to deliver.Conagra's quarterly results, also posted on Wednesday, showed why the company is doubling down on frozen food with the Pinnacle deal. Conagra's refrigerated and frozen segment, with brands like Banquet and Healthy Choice, was the fastest-growing.""The long-awaited deal finally comes together,"" Stifel analyst Christopher Growe, who advises buying Conagra's stock, wrote in a note. ""The nearly $11 billion acquisition creates a powerhouse in the frozen food aisle.""Growe added it was ""a bit surprising"" that the multiple for the deal was lower than recent acquisitions in the food industry and the $68-a-share price came below his expectation of $75.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseActivist fund Jana Partners urged Pinnacle to explore a sale after reporting a 9.5% ke in the packaged food maker in April. The New York-based hedge fund, run by Barry Rosenstein, said in a filing then that it thought the company was in a good position to consider consolidation given its strength in the frozen foods industry.Jana also has history with Conagra, which in 2015 agreed to add two directors to its board in a settlement with the fund. It currently owns a stake in Conagra of less than 1 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Conagra's brands also include Marie Callender's and P.F. Chang's Home Menu.Pinnacle holders will receive $43.11 in cash and 0.6494 of a Conagra share for each of their shares. The implied price of $68 is based on the average price for Conagra in the five days ended June 21.In Conagra's earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter ended May 27, net sales climbed 5.6% to $1.97 billion, compared with the average analyst estimate of $1.93 billion.

733,SEE,"The words ""Made in China"" now hang in the balance on whether the Trump administration will declare a trade war on imported steel and aluminum, and use tariffs as a sledgehammer for negotiating a better, long-term trade deal.The president has doubled down on his commitment to enforce tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum, actions that offer a Pyrrhic victory for America's 140,000 steel workers but at great cost to steel consuming manufacturers in America who employ 6.5 million workers.As the U.S. remains on the precipice of a trade war with China, we should examine whether it is wise to barter for the economic vitality of one layer of American industry — a struggling steel industry — while imposing increased costs on many other sectors of our economy, including agriculture, automakers, various manufacturing companies and energy producers.The United States has frequently tried to go the protectionist route of tariffs, and often with terrible results. Whether it was the more recent Bush administration steel tariffs in the early 2000s or the Smoot-Hawley tariff act going all the way back to the 1930s, it's clear that strategic trade, not free trade, has a populist political allure.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's a line of economic debate and thinking that matches the theme of President Trump's ""America First"" drumbeat.This is what drove the Trump Administration to initiate, in 2017, a Section 232 National Security investigation into whether imports of steel and aluminum were adversely affecting U.S. national security. The investigation focused on China's decades-long program of subsidizing its steel and aluminum industries, which has resulted in global oversupply of steel and the consequent suppression of global prices.The Commerce Department's section 232 findings indicated that imported steel and aluminum ""threaten to impair the national security."" The president accepted these conclusions and moved to impose tariffs of 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports, ensuring that the U.S. industries would be able to sustain sufficient capacity utilization rates to remain competitive. Or so Trump's economic advisors seem to think.No one has a crystal ball to predict the future, but by referencing the aforementioned Bush steel tariffs, we can see the likely ill effects. In 2002, President George W. Bush imposed tariffs on imported steel products following a period in which 30 American steel manufacturers declared bankruptcy.According to a Trade Partnership Worldwide analysis, these steel import tariffs resulted in 200,000 Americans losing their jobs across a variety of industries. Workers lost approximately $4 billion in wages and American steel consumers bore a heavy cost. The tariffs were so disastrous that Bush lifted them just a year after they were implemented.On a more micro-scale, steel tariffs have severe implications for a variety of industries, for example the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas production is steel-intensive, with steel products needed for drilling, pipeline, onshore and offshore production facilities, refineries, LNG terminals, refineries, and petrochemical plants.Tariffs on steel pipe and other products will increase the cost of production, particularly with respect to deep water projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and quotas will cause delays because U.S. substitutes are not immediately available or have not been qualified.Pipeline-grade steel is a specialty product. It must meet high quality specifications not required for other steel products (pipeline steel can't be brittle or it could crack and cause a pipeline incident). American steel manufacturers have largely exited the niche pipeline market because it is relatively small and involves higher costs and lower margins.Today, U.S. steel producers are capable of meeting just 3% of the total steel required by the energy pipeline industry.There is little doubt that the steel import tariffs will have an effect on the competitiveness of the U.S. oil and gas industry, among others. In fact, these tariffs run counter to the Administration's policy of U.S. energy dominance.Steel tariffs could open Pandora's box. In attempting to revitalize U.S. manufacturing, we shouldn't risk being drawn into a trade war. The Trump administration must examine the effects of trade policies across the full industrial spectrum. Steel tariffs represent a dangerous blunt foreign policy instrument that could easily do more harm than good, threatening both America's energy and economic resurgence.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn Monday, Trump said he was surprised the motorcycle manufacturer ""would be the first to wave the White Flag.""""I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the EU, which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion,"" Trump continued. ""Taxes just a Harley excuse — be patient!""In a subsequent tweet, Trump said the U.S. is managing to get other countries to lower existing tariffs and barriers that he said have been in place for years through bad deals. ""We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!"" he said in the post.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders downplayed the announcement earlier Monday, saying Trump's ""trade and economic policies have been a huge benefit to the American economy.""""The European Union is attempting to punish U.S. workers with unfair and discriminatory trade policies, and President Trump will continue to push for free, fair and reciprocal trade in hopes that the EU will join us in that,"" Sanders told reporters at the White House.Tariffs have also forced the hand of the maker of another iconic American brand, Jack Daniel's.Brown-Forman (BFB), which also produces Woodford Reserve and other bourbons, will have to raise prices for its whiskey sold in the European Union following the implementation of a 25% tariff, according to spokesman Phil Lynch. The higher prices, which he said would primarily affect Jack Daniel's, would amount to about a 10% increase for consumers.Lynch did not say what effect the expected price increases would have on European sales, noting that ""we continue to invest behind the growth of American whiskey in the EU.""Brown-Forman fell to its lowest level in almost seven months on Monday.The EU's levies are only the latest blowback Harley has faced from Trump's trade policies. A year after Trump pulled the U.S. out of a 12-nation trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, in January 2017, Harley announced it would close its factory in Kansas City, Missouri, and consolidate production in York, Pennsylvania, eliminating about 260 jobs.Trump hosted Levatich and other Harley executives and union leaders for a White House listening session in February 2017 and hailed the motorcycle manufacturer as ""a true American icon"" and ""one of the greats.""""Thank you, Harley-Davidson, for building things in America,"" Trump said at the time. ""I think you're going to even expand. I know your business is now doing very well and there's a lot of spirit right now in the country that you weren't having so much in the last number of months that you have right now.""Harley-Davidson's headquarters are in Milwaukee, and on Monday the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican who has opposed Trump's move to impose tariffs, said the company's announcement was evidence of the detrimental effect of the president's trade policy.""This is further proof of the harm from unilateral tariffs,"" AshLee Strong, a Ryan spokeswoman, said Monday. ""The best way to help American workers, consumers, and manufacturers is to open new markets for them, not to raise barriers to our own market.""Lawmakers weighed in Tuesday on Trump's latest tweets.""What I'm worried about is that it's just the first of many that we are going to see as a result of tariffs,"" Senator Doug Jones, a Democrat from Alabama, told CNN in an interview to discuss Harley's announcement that it would move some production abroad.""I don't know all the details but from what I saw was it would be a $2,200 increase on the final price per bike with these tariffs,"" Congressman Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, told CNN in a separate interview. ""That's going to impact sales.""""I don't have a problem with the president taking on China,"" Kinzinger added.

746,SEE,"This week, Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., issued a clarion call to Democrats outraged at the policies of the Trump administration: It's time for mob action.In the wake of mobs targeting Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Waters explained: ""God is on our side! On the side of the children ... Let's make sure we show up wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""Waters has always been a fan of mob action. She infamously touted the violent and brutal 1992 Los Angeles riots, which did approximately $1 billion in property damage and ended with 63 people dead. Waters called the events a ""rebellion,"" labeling them a ""spontaneous reaction to a lot of injustice and a lot of alienation and frustration."" And yet Waters has been affectionately nicknamed ""Auntie Maxine"" thanks to her rabid attacks against the Trump administration.Democratic leaders ranging from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., denounced Waters' words. They've done the same with regard to violent protests on college campuses. That is meritorious and deserves praise.But there is little question that major political figures on both sides of the aisle have played footsie with mob action to little or no blowback.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's not just Waters. President Obama made excuses for riots in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, during his presidency; Rev. Al Sharpton, who has actually been involved in precipitating mob violence, still gets to play peacemaker on national television; during President Trump's 2016 campaign, he repeatedly referenced the possibility of violence against protesters.No civil society can humor such overtures to mob action and remain civil for long. The First Amendment protects Maxine Waters, of course, and it should. But Americans should be appalled by her words, rather than slightly titillated by them. And yet it seems that extreme rhetoric now earns a sort of badge of ""coolness"" that can't be matched by those calling for cooler heads.To call for civility now seems unwoke. No wonder Symone Sanders of CNN stated, ""the folks calling for civility might need to check their privilege."" To be angry is to be justified; not being angry enough is the greatest sin.And that is dangerous. It's not that Americans will suddenly begin attacking one another in the streets. It's that large populations can be moved by small, extreme minorities.Nassim Nicholas Taleb writes in his new book, ""Skin in the Game,"" about the phenomenon of ""renormalization,"" whereby larger, more moderate groups appease small minorities simply to avoid certain costs. That can happen when reasonable people stop standing up to advocates for mobocracy, afraid that doing so will alienate their most vocal supporters.Waters has always been a fringe figure. Perhaps she'll remain so. But there are no guarantees. And we shouldn't be sanguine about the prospects of quashing radical tribalism. It's not quite as easy as putting out a few tepid statements.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The Left Tries To Blame Trump For Their Own Hate Mongering

754,SEE,"In Part 1, I described the vendetta by the Russian government's propaganda apparatus against technologies like fracking and modern genetic engineering techniques applied to agriculture, and the aid the Russians receive from U.S.-based organic industry lobbyists and activists.Second Of Two Parts. (Read Part 1.)We ended Part 1 with the observation that advocacy, which we see in many industries and special-interest groups, is one thing, but character assassination, trolling and intimidation are something else. That crosses the line. We discuss that here.Overall, the organic industry's propaganda campaign has achieved impressive gains — if you consider ripping off consumers and character assassination to be positive.Academics Review, a science-oriented nonprofit organization of academic experts, performed a review of hundreds of published academic, industry, and government research reports concerned with consumers' views of organic products.It also looked at more than 1,500 news reports, marketing materials, advocacy propaganda, speeches, etc., generated between 1988 and 2014 about organic foods.Their analysis found that ""consumers have spent hundreds of billion dollars purchasing premium-priced organic food products based on false or misleading perceptions about comparative product food safety, nutrition and health attributes,"" and that this is due to ""a widespread organic and natural products industry pattern of research-informed and intentionally deceptive marketing and paid advocacy.""That advocacy is particularly vile. The organic industry seeks not a level playing field for their products; instead, they try to level the players on the other side. The activists regularly trot out a litany of false accusations about their enemies.One of the most unlikely and undeserving targets is Stephan Neidenbach, a Maryland middle-school teacher and science communicator who blogs about science and technology. The trolls and character assassins variously tried to get him fired and conducted a campaign of harassment and intimidation against him. Read his chilling account here.Academics have been a favorite target. An NGO called U.S. Right to Know, or USRTK, has filed harassing Freedom of Information requests for emails and documents of at least a hundred public university faculty and staff members, hoping to find embarrassing snippets that might imply conflicts of interest.Their efforts to undermine scientists and public policy scholars whose work threatens the Russians' agenda follow a familiar pattern. In the words of University of Florida plant biologist Kevin Folta, who has been excoriated repeatedly by USRTK for supposedly being a Monsanto sock puppet, the activists ""develop a narrative that suggests industry collusion or undue influence, especially with any attempt to connect the faculty member to Monsanto, a company that is the bogeyman favorite of activists.""Every page of every email requested by USRTK must be examined by attorneys to ascertain whether they are releasable. Professor Folta estimates that the USRTK fishing expedition may have cost his university as much as a million dollars of taxpayers' money.Another prominent victim was Peter Phillips, Distinguished Professor of Public Policy at the University of Saskatchewan, whose supposed sin was (surprise!) too close a relationship with Monsanto and allowing the company to influence what he said and wrote.Other eminent academics, such as University of Illinois Professor (Emeritus) Bruce Chassy and University of Oklahoma Law Professor (Emeritus) Drew Kershen and science writer extraordinaire Jon Entine have also been targeted.I have been on the USRTK hit-list since I was a prominent opponent of an unscientific, unwise and probably unconstitutional 2012 California referendum issue that would have required labeling of genetically engineered food.USRTK were proponents of the measure. Paid pro-referendum activists lied effusively about me in the campaign, and some of their more flagrant falsehoods were regurgitated by the New York Times' hapless food columnist, Mark Bittman, apparently without any fact-checking.Fast forward to 2015, when a UN-based agency erroneously categorized the herbicide glyphosate (which Monsanto markets as Roundup) as a ""probable carcinogen."" Although Monsanto and I had a long history of mutual antagonism (see this and this, for example) a scientist acquaintance there emailed me and asked if that was something I might write about.I responded that I was overwhelmed with various projects but that they should sent me a ""high-quality draft,"" a poor choice of words by which I meant stuff — other government agencies' evaluations, scientific studies, as well as the company's view of the decision. Eventually, they sent me all of that.When those emails were later released as part of a lawsuit in 2017, a New York Times reporter whom I (along with many in the scientific community) had criticized repeatedly for biased and inaccurate reporting, penned a vindictive hit-piece implying that my op-ed was ghostwritten. The Times article was misleading and incomplete.In a phone conversation — which, of course, is not reflected in the emails — I had told a Monsanto person exactly what arguments and points I wanted to make, and they sent me a rough draft that consisted almost entirely of what I had outlined. I then modified and published it as an op-ed.In the end, the ideas, opinions and words were my own. (Moreover, the article was in every respect accurate and, for once, reflected the views of both the scientific community and industry.)Let me be clear: I have authored three books, scores of journal articles and more than a thousand columns for the popular press (including, by the way, for the New York Times) and nobody has ghostwritten any of them.The University of Florida's Kevin Folta has characterized the activists' goal as leaving ""these trusted professors, dietitians and physicians 'Google Dead', a state where their online reputation will always drag the anchor of activist derision.""Professor Folta describes how these campaigns work: ""In the case of (University of Saskatchewan Professor) Phillips, US-RTK acquired emails and used Jason Warick from CBC News as a complicit pipeline to media. This way it is not simply (USRTK co-director) Gary Ruskin and his band of industry-financed lackeys slandering scientists on activist websites. Instead, it takes (on) the patina of legitimate research, hard-core gumshoe reporting. It really is a reporter doing the bidding of US-RTK, who is doing the bidding of a handful of organizations, companies, and undisclosed donors paying for the hit.""New Yorker staff writer Adrian Chen describes what happened to him in 2015 while he was doing background research in St. Petersburg about Russia's notorious ""troll farm,"" the Internet Research Agency:""As I conducted my reporting, I was myself the target of an elaborate smear campaign to label me a neo-Nazi sympathizer and U.S. intelligence agent — an early use of the kind of bizarre tactics that have been documented by numerous investigations in both the Russian and Western media, and by the internal investigations of social-media companies.""Thus, American activists and NGOs, paid by the organic agriculture industry and aided by Russia's propaganda machine, routinely trash, troll and harass scientists, academics, journalists and even middle-school teachers who promote sound science generally and promulgate accurate information about genetic engineering, in particular.The character-assassination campaigns present an exquisite irony: USRTK and its ilk accuse their targets of being shills — paid agents of the agribusiness industry who have a conflict of interest — but it is they who are the shills, bought and paid for by the organic and ""natural products"" industries.The fake-news-based disinformation campaigns launched by the NGOs and other trolls on subjects from agricultural chemicals and genetic engineering to fracking erode the ability of disinterested observers — the public — to judge what is true and what is not with respect to complex public policy issues.And it is distressing for those of us being attacked, to say nothing of our friends and families.As the fellow said in the Mark Twain story, after being tarred and feathered and run out of town on a rail, ""If it weren't for the honor, I'd just as soon have walked.""However, history is on the side of scientists, science communicators and journalists who tell the truth. In the words of philosophy professor Crispin Sartwell in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, ""The power of the Russian intelligence services ... is considerable, but it does not include the ability to bend the fabric of reality.""On the other hand, even if we're not found floating face-down in the Volga, it's no fun being among the Google Dead.RELATED:Part 1: Russia Does Far Worse Than Meddle In Our Elections — It Meddles In Our Science

757,SEE,"Snoop Dogg, Sir Patrick Stewart and a large British tobacco company: all vaguely in the same news story, thanks to an investment deal announced late Wednesday that an analyst called Big Tobacco's ""most significant"" attempt yet to gain exposure to the marijuana industry.Imperial Brands Ventures, a subsidiary of U.K. tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMBBY), and Snoop Dogg's venture capital firm, Casa Verde Capital, said they are investing in Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies, a British medical marijuana research firm backed by Stewart of ""Star Trek"" and ""X-Men"" fame.The decision by Imperial, whose cigarette brands include Winston and Kool, comes roughly a year after the company appointed the chairman of a medical cannabis company to its board. It also comes amid flagging demand for cigarettes, and on the heels of the FDA's approval this week of Epidiolex, a cannabis-based drug from GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH).""We are pleased to be partnering with OCT,"" Matthew Phillips, Imperial Brands' chief development officer, said in a statement on Wednesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Cannabinoid products have significant potential and our investment enables Imperial to support OCT's important research while building a deeper understanding of the medical cannabis market,"" he continued.Earlier this year, an Imperial spokesman told IBD that the tobacco company was ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing (cannabis) segment.""Oxford said in Wednesday's statement that it had secured investments from Imperial Brands Ventures and Casa Verde and others as part of a Series A funding round. Oxford will use the funds to set up a strategic research partnership and a laboratory in Europe.The company, founded in 2017, intends to fund research surrounding cannabinoids in academic institutions internationally.""With indications ranging from pain and inflammation to cancer and neurological disorders, OCT has commissioned research in many critical areas,"" the statement said.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Thursday, said Imperial's investment was ""the most significant move among the global tobacco players in the cannabis industry to date. We continue to expect to see more activity in cannabis from both global tobacco and global alcohol.""Last year, Imperial appointed Simon Langelier, the chairman of PharmaCielo, a Canadian medical cannabis company, to its board. The spokesman for Imperial told IBD this year that the company appointed Langelier largely due to his three-decade stint at Philip Morris International. However, the spokesman added that Langelier's cannabis background was not ""irrelevant,"" either.Some analysts believe that the quickly growing — and destigmatizing — marijuana industry presents more of an opportunity for tobacco firms than alcohol.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Still, tobacco stocks like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI) crashed two months ago after Philip Morris International (PMI) turned in weak first-quarter sales and weaker-than-expected demand for so-called ""reduced-risk"" devices.Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig-Zag, has expressed excitement about pot legalization in Canada and the cannabis industry broadly. Philip Morris International planned to invest around $20 million in an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016.Imperial Brands rose 2.8% in over-the-counter U.S. trading.

792,SEE,"A day of reckoning is near for Tesla stock, the Model 3 sedan and the company's colorful co-founder and chief executive, Elon Musk.By the end of this month, Tesla (TSLA) plans to finally live up to Musk's repeated vow to crank out 5,000 Model 3s — billed as a sedan for the masses — each week. In the coming quarter, the maker of luxury electric cars aims to make good on Musk's relentless promise to be profitable. And in the process, the company and its CEO hope to reassure investors that Tesla's $10.5 billion debt burden and scorching cash burn will soon be in the rearview mirror.It's heady corporate drama. Will Tesla ultimately become a new-age General Motors (GM), a force majeure in the rising electric-car industry? Or will its far-reaching vision fall short?Musk, a modern-day corporate magnate, is determined to blast skeptical short sellers worried about the Tesla cash burn by mass-producing Model 3s.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWall Street is divided on whether Musk and Tesla can pull it off. Romit Shah, an analyst at Nomura and a Tesla stock bull, points out that the company has a two-year backlog of Model 3 orders to help smooth the road ahead.""They don't have an issue with demand,"" said Shah.Still, Tesla short-seller Mark Spiegel, manager at hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Management, said he considers the carmaker to be ""a company so landmine-filled that I think it can implode at any time.""Tesla stock is one of the most shorted issues on Wall Street. Those counting on the Tesla cash burn to help it fail are betting it will miss its production targets for the new Model 3 for the third time, putting the company in a financially risky situation.Short sellers get Musk's dander up. The Tesla chief recently tweeted he would torch them with one of the flamethrowers he had made as a moneymaking promotion for one of his other ventures, the tunnel-digging Boring Co.""Short burn of the century coming soon,"" Musk wrote in a tweet last month. ""Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.""It's unclear, though, just who faces the heat. The Tesla cash burn recently forced a 9% reduction in staff. The usually cheeky Musk has become curt at news conferences. Company goals keep falling by the wayside.Much of it stems from the Model 3. If Tesla can more than double Model 3 output from the prior quarter to 5,000 a week, Musk believes the company can be profitable in the third quarter and avoid having to raise cash. But profitability has continually eluded the company.Musk most recently attacked short sellers on June 17, saying they had about three weeks ""before their short position explodes."" That time frame coincides with the end of the second quarter and would be about the time Tesla typically reports quarterly vehicle deliveries. A number above expectations could send Tesla stock soaring even higher than the more than 20% jump it has seen since hitting a low four weeks ago.Tesla shares were down 0.3%, near 332.70 during Monday afternoon trading on the stock market today. The stock hit a record high of 386.99 set on Sept. 18.Musk, though, is known for setting ambitious deadlines he often can't meet. The Roadster, the Model S, Model X and the Model 3 were all delayed from his original timeline.Still, his ambitions persist. Musk plans to double Model 3 production again to 10,000 as it adds a third production line at its Fremont, Calif., manufacturing plant — a line that is being built temporarily under a tent.Tesla's long-term Model 3 goal is to ramp up production to 500,000 vehicles per year. That's a huge leap from its 100,000 annual run rate for the Model S sedan and Model X sport-utility vehicle.Further, Tesla still promises to price the Model 3 at $35,000, a version that has yet to materialize. The Model 3s coming off the line now are loaded with extras and go for roughly $50,000.Another obstacle for Tesla is expanding its massive battery plant in the Nevada desert to supply power for all those cars. The 5.8-million-square-foot plant, called Gigafactory 1, already has cost more than $1 billion.Further, Tesla seeks to add gigafactories in China and Europe. It also will need more retail outlets, service centers and charging stations.All this is going on at the same time Tesla is developing the Model Y, a crossover vehicle, in addition to a big-rig truck called Semi and a new Roadster.Perhaps the biggest albatross hanging around the company's neck, though, is the $10.5 billion in debt that could grow further.""Of course, the debt load concerns me,"" said Brad Erickson, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets. ""But the reality is: With the manufacturing improvements and the plodding toward profitability, the cash burns go down dramatically. If Tesla can make the Model 3 in greater quantity, we believe they will turn gross-margin positive in the third quarter.""The Tesla cash burn will decline dramatically, if not halt, should current Model 3 targets be met, he said. ""So the moment you're not burning cash anymore, that's a moot point,"" Erickson said.When Tesla reported first-quarter earnings on May 2, it showed a cash balance of $2.67 billion. It burned through $1.1 billion in cash during the quarter. It isn't clear how much it's spent in the current quarter.But it will need to spend billions of dollars more as it expands vehicle production and invests in batteries and other infrastructure. Skeptics say that only cash injections from the outside can help.In March, financial pressures and production shortfalls spurred Moody's Investors Service to downgrade Tesla's credit rating to B3, from B2. That's six levels below investment grade.Moody's said Tesla faces liquidity pressures due to its large negative free cash flow and pending debt maturities. Moody's thinks the company needs to raise $2 billion to cover the Tesla cash burn for 2018.Goldman Sachs analyst David Tamberrino said in a report last month that Tesla could need to raise more than $10 billion in capital by 2020 to fund operations and expansion. That includes the cost of a new facility in China that could serve as both a vehicle manufacturing plant and gigafactory.He has a sell rating on Tesla stock with a six-month price target of 195, little more than half of where it currently trades, around 360. Tamberrino is skeptical that Tesla will meet its production goals for the Model 3. He forecasts that the company will run low on cash by year-end.Other Tesla stock skeptics include UBS analyst Colin Langan, who has a sell rating on Tesla stock, also with a price target of 195. Langan, in a research note last month, said he remains cautious on Tesla stock, ""given the cash burn, the volatile and uncertain production timeline, and initial quality concerns."" He also said it's unclear how Tesla can fund its aggressive product plans.Ryan Brinkman at JPMorgan, a Tesla bear, has a price target of 180 and rating of underweight.KeyBanc's Erickson is also critical of Musk for mismanaging expectations and being a poor forecaster of his business. On the other hand, he says, Musk is on a long leash.""Who else can announce an electric car in a webcast and not advertise or say when the car will come and take in nearly a half-billion dollars in deposits?"" said Erickson. He was citing the company's Model 3 debut.Nomura's Shah, perhaps the most bullish analyst for the company on Wall Street, says the Tesla cash burn doesn't worry him. He recently raised his Tesla price target to 450 from 420, with a buy rating. That's roughly a 25% premium from where the stock now trades.Narrowly focusing on Tesla's balance sheet is a backward way of looking at things, he says.""We see them overcoming the production issues and accelerating growth in the back half of this year for Model 3,"" Shah said. ""I expect that in the next three months we'll go from talking about the balance sheet and negative cash flows to market opportunity and market growth.""Shah's confidence in Tesla is due in part to the company's size and fast growth. Revenue rose 68% in 2017 to $11.76 billion from the year-ago period. That comes after 73% growth in the previous year, though Tesla can boast of only two profitable quarters.""It's really unusual to find a company in the multibillion-dollar range growing revenue more than 60% per year,"" Shah said. ""I don't see that slowing down.""The Model 3 comes just as Ford (F), General Motors (GM), BMW, Volkswagen (VLKAY), Toyota Motor (TM) and others threaten its standing among electric-car makers.General Motors previously announced a goal to make 1 million GM electric vehicles a year by 2026. Ford has said it will invest $11 billion in electric-vehicle production.Among the challenges faced by Musk is that he's stretched thin. Musk spends about half his time as chief executive of SpaceX, which is routinely launching satellites.Musk also runs Boring Co., which is more of a side project. It promises to lessen traffic congestion by digging underground tunnels for high-speed transportation. The multiple demands could be among the reasons Musk abruptly cut off analysts halfway through Tesla's first-quarter conference call for posing what he called ""boring"" and ""boneheaded"" questions.Despite Tesla's history of burning cash at a rate better-established companies would likely be crucified for, Musk has steadfastly opposed the idea of raising more equity or debt later this year. Tesla says it has significantly cut its projected capital expenditures by focusing on critical near-term needs.The company recently laid off 9% of the Tesla workforce, part of a thorough reorganization announced in May. Musk said the cutbacks would not affect the company's ability to reach Model 3 production targets.Musk expects cash flow from selling Model 3s to the 450,000-plus people who have placed a $1,000 reservation deposit. He says that will help fund several Tesla initiatives. Among them are its gigafactory expansion and a new plant to make the Model Y crossover vehicle.During the recent Tesla annual shareholder meeting, Musk once again reiterated his target of becoming cash-flow positive in the third quarter of this year with the ramped-up production for the Model 3.Tesla could meet its production targets. But it also will have to meet targets for higher gross margins to hit profitability.Several Wall Street analysts consider that unrealistic, given the company's missed production goals and high debt.Then there are the short sellers. Among the most vocal is Stanphyl Capital's Spiegel.""I don't think Musk can make this company profitable, or even save it at this point because of all the debt,"" said Spiegel. ""The company seems to require more than $4 billion a year, and that's without building a second factory to make the Model Y, or a truck.""Spiegel also thinks Tesla is on shaky ground because of the $7,500 federal tax credit that buyers of electric vehicles can receive.That tax credit has limits. It's available to the first 200,000 U.S. Tesla buyers, as is the case with other electric-car manufacturers. Upon meeting the 200,000 threshold, the credit begins to gradually wind down over the next several quarters.Tesla should hit the 200,000 limit this year. That would effectively raise prices for buyers of Tesla vehicles. General Motors is also nearing its limit, but new providers of electric vehicles will have the full $7,500 credit.Yet, as Erickson notes, Musk has come out on top many times.""It would be foolish to count him out at this stage of the game given all that he has been able to accomplish to date,"" he said.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Three Hot IPOs Flash Sell Signals, And These China Stocks Keep TumblingCheck Out Top Stocks Near A Buy Point NowYou Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeGet All The Latest Tesla News, Stock Chart And More

795,SEE,"Progressives: The shocking primary victory of 28-year-old socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez over Congress' No. 4, Democrat Joe Crowley, underscores what we have long noted: The Democratic Party is no longer a party of moderation, but a party of the extreme left. And it's moving ever faster and farther leftward with each election cycle.The 57%-42% drubbing of Crowley looks like the death knell not just for his political career, but for that of his mentor House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Crowley, after all, was the hand-picked successor to Pelosi. He had outraised his far younger opponent by 10-to-1.Ocasio-Cortez isn't a make-believe socialist; she belongs to the Democratic Socialists of America. And she had the backing of Bernie Sanders' ""Our Revolution"" political group.""Our Revolution""? Do they want a civil war? It's a real concern. A new Rasmussen poll shows 31% of Americans think a civil war is likely soon, while 59% fear violence from Trump haters. That's scary.And, by the way, Ocasio-Cortez is no fluke. She's part of a trend. Just look at who the leading lights of the Democrats are today. In addition to such progressive stalwarts as Pelosi and Hillary Clinton, their most vocal and visible leaders include far-left Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Kristen Gillibrand, Cory Booker, and Kamala Harris.The House has so many far-left Democrats we couldn't list them all in an editorial. But they are numerous, and angry, pushing their side ever closer to violent confrontation.Take Rep. Maxine Waters, an influential Democrat who had this to say about civility toward the political opposition: ""If you see anybody from that (Trump) Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.""As the violent rhetoric ramps up, Trump officials (Sarah Huckabee, Elaine Chao, Jeff Sessions, among others) have been harassed in public places and at their homes, threatened with violence and even thrown out of restaurants because they work for this White House. It shows what the left really thinks of democracy.Is this a preview of what America will be like under a Democratic administration?Is this the future of the Democratic Party? Sure looks that way.The party's base is itself increasingly far left. As a study last year by the American Culture and Faith Institute of adults 18 and older showed, 37% of adults said they ""prefer socialism to capitalism."" Most of those were self-described liberals.""That is a large minority,"" wrote researcher and Executive Director George Barna. ""And it includes a majority of the liberals — who will be pushing for a completely different economic model to dominate our nation. That is the stuff of civil wars. It ought to set off alarm bells among more traditionally-oriented leaders across the nation.""They already are pushing for a ""different model.""In addition to embracing violence and the denial of such basic constitutional rights as free speech, freedom of religion and the right to protect oneself, much of the Democratic Party now embraces a spate of far-left ideas. These include such winners as open borders, Medicare for all (single-payer health care), unrestricted abortion, special ""gender"" rights, free tuition, government controlled housing, deep and dangerous defense cuts, a job-killing $15-an-hour minimum wage, a ""guaranteed income"" for all, and ever-higher welfare spending.Meanwhile, the party's socialist-progressive wing, which now dominates, love-hugs all these ideas. And it's actively anti-capitalist.Parts of this agenda of unbridled socialism show up in Democrats' official new policy blueprint called ""A Better Deal."" A better name would be ""A Rawer Deal,"" because these ideas have been tried before and failed. As we've noted here repeatedly, there are no successful socialist countries. None. It's an unworkable, inhuman system that replaces individual rights and freedom with authoritarian control imposed from above, all in the name of ""the people.""Americans have had their economic knowledge systematically dumbed-down by the media and the schools, from elementary school through university. Ask younger people whether they like socialism, and a majority now say yes. They've been trained to hate capitalism, and never lived under socialism. So they don't know it's the death of all they hold dear and the end to their individual dreams.In addition, socialism is antithetical to democracy. A study in 2015 by MIT economist Daron Acemoglu and University of Chicago economist James A. Robinson suggests that democratic systems are the only way to thrive as an economy. ""Our central estimates suggest that a country that switches from autocracy to democracy achieves about 20% higher GDP per capita over roughly 30 years.""It's shocking because there are so many examples of socialism's failures today — from Zimbabwe and North Korea to Cuba and Venezuela. No socialist nation thrives. Ever. Why would a major American political party embrace such failure and misery?YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Democrats' Turn To Socialism Is Ominous Sign For The Party — And For The CountryZimbabwe's Coup, Venezuela's Default, And The Ongoing Failure Of SocialismUnhappy Birthday: Communism's Tragic Centenary

800,SEE,"I'm not surprised that mobs shriek at Trump administration officials in restaurants and that Maxine Waters wants more of that. I've watched this happen at American colleges.One example:Heather Mac Donald is a Manhattan Institute scholar who wrote the book ""The War on Cops."" She argues that Americans are less safe today because police, for fear of being called racist, back off. I sometimes disagree with Mac Donald, but she is a thoughtful researcher whose ideas deserve to be heard.At UCLA, when she was allowed to give her ""Blue Lives Matter"" speech, many in the audience applauded.But then ""they stormed the stage,"" she explains in my video interview with her.The protesters, both white and black, shouting ""Black lives — they matter!"" drowned out any possible questions.Watching video of the event, I was surprised to see what looked like a party atmosphere. Protesters smiled as they got out cameras and recorded each other.""It's almost an expectation that if you're a minority student on campus, you're there to protest,"" Mac Donald told me.Eventually, the UCLA protesters took over the stage. No further discussion was possible.From UCLA, Mac Donald went to Claremont University, where she was met with posters that said her speech should be ""shut down"" because she is an ""anti-black fascist."" I asked Mac Donald about that.""This is preposterous. I have spent enormous amounts of time in high-crime, minority neighborhoods talking to good people there who are desperate for more police, who have a right to expect the same freedom from fear that people in safer neighborhoods take for granted,"" she replied. ""My agenda is to try to give voice to these people. To say that I'm anti-black is ridiculous.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNevertheless, Claremont activists blocked the entrance to the lecture hall where Mac Donald was scheduled to speak so that no one could enter.Mac Donald gave her speech to the empty room, and that was recorded for the internet, but no students could ask questions because they couldn't get in.Even a school newspaper reporter who tried to get opinions from protesters was shouted down.""I'm with the Claremont Independent, and I'm wondering if you might be willing to tell me anything at all,"" he pleaded with the mob, but they were more interested in stopping speech than in arguing any points.""The protesters are the ones engaging in what is clearly historically fascist behavior,"" said Mac Donald later. ""In the case of the Berkeley riots, vandalizing, breaking glass, setting fires, beating people up. But they go under the moniker 'anti-fascist' ... They called me a fascist. But I have not tried to silence anybody.""Years ago, California Governor Ronald Reagan called Claremont ""a place that fosters discussion and debate ... where a student could learn to deal with controversy.""No more, wrote Mac Donald in a City Journal article titled ""From Culture to Cupcakes.""""College once promoted an understanding of Western culture,"" she says. ""Today ... there is an enormous bureaucratic infrastructure dedicated to teaching students that they're victims.""She calls that the diversity bureaucracy.""UCLA has a Vice Chancellor for Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (who) makes $445,000 a year. The Berkeley Division of Equity and Diversity Inclusion has a $20 million budget.""She warns, ""There's a co-dependency between the exploding diversity bureaucracy and these narcissistic, delusional students who act out little psychodramas of oppression before an appreciative audience of diversity bureaucrats.""Really? I pushed back. ""Psychodramas of oppression?""""Do we believe in objective reality?"" she replied. ""These students ... are among the most privileged human beings in human history. To be at an American college with educational resources available to them that the Renaissance humanists would have killed for. (Yet they) think of themselves as victims. That, to me, is a very sad state of delusion.""These ""victims"" now feel entitled to censor other people's speech, but differences won't be resolved without debate.

801,SEE,"The ""news"" you see at night on broadcast television is defined by what ""outrage"" has been perpetrated by President Donald Trump.Last week, ABC, CBS and NBC devoted an enormous chunk of their airtime to parents who immigrated to the country illegally being separated from their children by federal agents — 128 minutes, almost half of their total nightly airtime not including commercials, according to the Media Research Center.By contrast, other parts of the nation's business are nearly invisible. Take, for one example, America's war in Afghanistan, which is obviously not a new topic, since it started in 2001 and is now the longest war in American history. If it doesn't feel like that, it's because it's out of sight, out of mind.Last week, U.S. Central Command said it conducted 591 airstrikes in Afghanistan in May, the most of any month this year. And more bombs were dropped in April and May than over all of 2015.But from January through June 22, the networks only mustered 32 minutes between them, barely 10 minutes each. ABC led the pack with a measly 12 minutes and 49 seconds, and CBS (11 1/2 minutes) and NBC (seven minutes and 11 seconds) were even worse.One reason should be obvious: The number of dead Americans is very low. Only two American soldiers have died in combat in Afghanistan in 2018. Those men, Sgt. 1st Class Mihail Golin and Spc. Gabriel Conde, each drew about 20 seconds of airtime on each network when they were killed.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA second reason is less obvious: The networks don't have many reporters overseas anymore, and certainly not reporters covering ""forgotten wars"" with few casualties. The networks are, by nature, more likely to cover American military action when it goes wrong, as in when civilians die in the bombings.But neither reason is an excuse. This is not how war is meant to be covered — when it's your country at war.The networks haven't been any more interested in the war on terrorism in general. Trump can largely vanquish the Islamic State group as a territorial power and you can hear the crickets.Try this: On May 9, The New York Times, to its credit, reported that ""a complex cross-border sting carried out by Iraqi and American intelligence"" concluded with the capture of five senior Islamic State group officials. On CBS that night, this triumph drew 35 seconds. ABC and NBC did nothing. But all three offered full stories on the black Yale University student who was upset because someone called the police when she was found napping in a dormitory common room.So let's go back to the big picture of 2018. What did the networks obsess over instead of spending more than 32 minutes on Afghanistan? In the same time period, ABC, CBS and NBC offered 442 evening-news minutes on the still-unproven allegations of the Trump campaign colluding with the Russian government in 2016. (That's in addition to the 1,234 minutes on this subject in 2017, adding up to a whopping 1,676 minutes total.)The hush-money scandal with porn star Stormy Daniels has received 107 minutes of evening-news attention. That's not counting another 81 minutes devoted to the exploits of Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen (who wrote the check to Daniels) and whether the FBI raid on his office will uncover nefarious Trump-enabling secrets.The American Army at war in Afghanistan is 30% as important as a two-bit prostitute.Whatever might cause the end of the Trump presidency is ""news."" Whatever might cause the re-election of Donald Trump is treated like it belongs in a deep, dark cave like containers of radioactive waste.Whatever is news is not news if it doesn't fit that narrative.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

803,SEE,"What can Democrat Chuck Schumer, Republican Marco Rubio, and President Trump agree on? Almost nothing, but they agree China is robbing America blind and has to be stopped.When the President slapped a punishing 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods starting July 6, his least likely GOP ally, Sen. Rubio, applauded the tariffs as a ""theft tax."" Sen. Schumer backed them too, warning that allowing China's massive stealing to continue will cause ""long-term real damage to America.""Within hours of Trump's announcement, China retaliated with $50 billion in tariffs on U.S. imports. Trump shot back with tariffs on another $200 billion in Chinese goods.   China accuses Trump of ""provoking the trade war.""Provoking?China's been fighting dirty against American business for years. China steals $225 billion to $600 billion worth of fashion designs, pharmaceutical formulas, and new technologies from U.S. companies every year, according to the Commission on Theft of American Intellectual Property. Previous U.S. presidents did nothing but negotiate. That's like watching a burglar strip your house and asking him ""can we talk?"" At last, an American president picked up a weapon — tariffs — to fight back.Not a minute too soon. The stealing is getting worse. Politicians naively said admitting China to the World Trade Organization in 2001 would push it toward a free-market economy observing the rule of law. Magical thinking.From the start, China violated WTO rules, knocking off American products and selling them as the real deal. A staggering 88% of counterfeit goods seized are from China and Hong Kong, according to Homeland Security. "" Like the Chinese thought ""free"" market"" meant steal what you want.Steal it or extort it.   American companies doing business in China are pressured to transfer proprietary technology to a local partner.

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNow China is abandoning any pretense of respecting intellectual property. President Xi Jinping's official economic policy, called Made in China 2025, elevates technology theft to official status. The government politely calls it ""the assimilation and absorption of imported technology."" China plans to steal its way to economic dominance and end dependence on foreign suppliers.American companies can't thrive under this threat. Our advantage in world markets isn't cheap labor or cheap materials. It's ideas.American Superconductor Corporation was almost put out of business, its stock value driven down 96%, when a Chinese wind turbine maker stole its technology and flooded the Chinese market with copies.Tariffs are the U.S. response to "" forced technology transfer and intellectual property theft by the Chinese,"" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said on Monday.Industries profiting from the status quo are nervous.General Motors sells more vehicles in China than in the U.S. Multinational companies look at China's middle class — now the world's largest — and see huge sales ahead.But if Beijing's plan proceeds, these U.S. companies will be shut out of China in a decade, and will have to compete in the rest of the world against Chinese companies that stole their technology and enjoy low cost financing from Chinese state banks. Nice work if you can get it.Are tariffs the best weapon against this plan? Trump is threatening a third tranche, bringing the total to $450 billion. China only imports $130 billion worth of American goods, and won't be able to keep up tit for tat. Advantage, U.S.Critics claim tariffs raise consumer prices, clobbering American households. That's exaggerated. You might have to pay slightly more for a laptop or cell phone. But a whopping 88.5% of goods and services consumers buy are domestically produced, according to the Federal Reserve of San Francisco. The criticism also disregards the uncalculated price Americans are paying for Chinese intellectual property theft.The real question is whether anything can make China stop stealing its way to the top.   Trump may win concessions, only to see China shamelessly pursue other criminal ploys. In China, ""free"" market"" means steal what you want.Other columns by Betsy McCaugheyMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

808,SEE,"World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) stock exploded Wednesday after pinning down bigger-than-expected deals with 21st Century Fox (FOX) and Comcast (CMCSA) to broadcast its shows.The leading name in sports entertainment announced the closing of a five-year deal late Tuesday that will see ""SmackDown Live"" debut on Fox on Oct. 19, 2019. The two-hour live show will air on Fridays every week on a year-round schedule.It also announced that Comcast's USA Network will continue to air the flagship ""Raw"" show for another five years. The channel had contractual first right of refusal on both programs, but opted to concentrate its resources in securing the more popular, at least at the moment, show.WWE said the agreements increase the average annual value of its U.S. distribution to 3.6 times that of the prior deal with Comcast's NBC Universal arm.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe deals form a core part of what the company calls its ""key content agreements,"" from which it made approximately $235 million in 2018. WWE forecasts that this figure will increase to $314 million in 2019 and $542 million in 2021 with Fox and Comcast. The firm is hoping to have completed new deals in the U.K. by year-end 2018; and in India during the first half of 2019.""WWE and Fox are a perfect match. Moving 'SmackDown Live' to broadcast TV and having the ability to leverage Fox's extensive portfolio of world-class sporting events will expand the reach of our flagship programming,"" CEO Vince McMahon said in a news release.He also hailed the Comcast deal, saying his ""Raw"" brand is ""synonymous with USA Network and we are excited about what the future holds for WWE's flagship program.""WWE shares jumped 6.35% to close at a fresh record high of 70.85 on the stock market today, after soaring by 12% in premarket trading. Fox stock rose 2.35%, while Comcast fell 1.5%.WWE stock has a group-leading IBD Composite Rating of 95, and broke into the top-10% club in April. Its Relative Strength Rating is even more impressive, a best-possible 99. Earnings growth has been improving in recent quarters, but consistent growth has been hard to pin down.MKM Partners managing director Eric Handler said the lucrative deal was a ""giant step up for WWE.""""Based on a $2.3bn overall value and what appears to be ~6.5% annual escalators, we estimate there will be a 170% step-up in revenue for WWE in the first year of its new domestic contacts,"" Handler said in a research note. ""This step-up should produce revenue in Year 1 (4Q19-3Q20) of approximately $400mn, up 170% from $150mn in the last year of the prior contract.""While Handler is holding a 68 price target for now, he said a valuation move towards 100 per share following adjustments is beginning to look ""very reasonable.""KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Evan Wingren also said the new TV rights came in above revised expectations. He also believes there is still more potential upside from the stock.""With successful renewals in the United States under its belt, and likely more to come, we believe WWE is in the process of being re-rated to reflect the dramatic changes of its brand and profitability profile,"" Wingren said in a research note. ""The terminal implications imply that with execution, WWE has the potential to invest and set itself up for even more lucrative TV renewals and accelerate international (internet media) growth.""The move to network TV with Fox will be exciting news for fans of the ""sport,"" in which oiled, muscle-bound men, and some women, parade around in tight outfits and pretend to fight each other.""SmackDown Live"" is the second-longest running weekly episodic cable TV show in U.S. prime-time history. It is second only to stablemate ""Monday Night Raw,"" which has aired over 1,300 episodes to date.Subscriptions have also increased for WWE's digital streaming service. This is a big part of the company's move to stay relevant to cord-cutters.Back in April, the company said subscriptions to WWE Network hit a record 2.12 million subscribers following April 8's ""WrestleMania,"" the event that often marks the annual boiling point for WWE's drama. That 2.12 million figure was up 9% on April 3, 2017, following last year's ""WrestleMania.""And in May the firm forecast a ""meaningful increase"" in second-quarter sales due to new content distributed internationally.WWE has successfully undertaken a move from its wrestling roots to movies, publishing, music, online streaming and various other business ventures. Its film company helped launch the career of Hollywood star Dwayne Johnson, who first shot to fame under his wrestling moniker of ""The Rock.""

809,SEE,"U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy announced he will retire, letting President Donald Trump nominate a successor who could create the most conservative court in generations and put the landmark Roe v. Wade abortion-rights ruling at risk.XThe court said Wednesday he will retire effective July 31.Kennedy, an 81-year-old Ronald Reagan appointee, has been the court's pivotal vote for the last decade, joining liberal justices to legalize same-sex marriage and voting with conservatives to throw out campaign-finance restrictions.""Please permit me by this letter to express my profound gratitude for having had the privilege to seek in each case how best to know, interpret and defend the Constitution and the laws that must always conform to its mandates and promises,"" Kennedy said in a letter to Trump. The court said Kennedy told his colleagues of his decision Wednesday.By naming his successor, Trump could leave an enduring mark on the court, giving it a solid five-justice conservative majority. The court could shift to the right on the death penalty, racial discrimination and gay rights, all areas where Kennedy at least sometimes joined the court's liberal wing. Chief Justice John Roberts may now become the swing vote.Potential nominees include Washington-based federal appeals court judge Brett Kavanaugh, a former Kennedy law clerk with close ties to the retiring justice. Trump could also consider three federal judges he interviewed before selecting Neil Gorsuch to fill an earlier vacancy: William Pryor of Alabama, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania and Amul Thapar of Kentucky.Other possibilities include federal appellate judges Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, who was considered for the Gorsuch seat but didn't get an interview, and Amy Coney Barrett of South Bend, Indiana.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAll are on a list of 25 prospective justices the White House has developed with input from the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation.Republicans hold a 51-49 advantage in the Senate, so they could approve Trump's nominee without any Democratic support. In confirming Gorsuch, Republicans eliminated the 60-vote requirement to advance a Supreme Court nomination.Even so, Kennedy's position in the court's center guarantees a fierce confirmation fight. Trump vowed during the campaign to appoint justices who would vote to overturn Roe, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion nationwide, and his appointment to replace Kennedy could make that a reality.In addition to Gorsuch, the court has three members — Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — who have consistently voted to uphold abortion restrictions. All are Republican appointees.Kennedy voted this week with a 5-4 conservative majority to uphold Trump's travel ban as a legitimate move to protect national security, rejecting arguments that the president targeted Muslims.Kennedy joined the court in 1988 and replaced the previous swing vote, Justice Lewis Powell. The California native got the nod after Reagan's first two choices, Robert Bork and Douglas Ginsburg, failed to win confirmation. Bork lost a Senate vote after a divisive fight, and Ginsburg withdrew after the revelation he had smoked marijuana as a law professor.Kennedy's centrist position meant he wrote some of the court's most important opinions. He disappointed conservatives in 1992, when he co-wrote an opinion reaffirming the constitutional right to abortion. Although he later backed some restrictions — voting to uphold a federal ban on some late-term abortions — he cast the decisive vote to strike down Texas regulations on clinics and doctors in 2016.Kennedy became a champion of gay rights and wrote the 2015 ruling that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide, using the type of sweeping language that characterized his opinions.""No longer may this liberty be denied,"" Kennedy wrote. ""No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice and family.""Kennedy also wrote the 2010 Citizens United ruling, which opened the way for a torrent of new campaign spending. He equated campaign-finance laws with censorship, writing that ""the First Amendment confirms the freedom to think for ourselves.""He was the quintessential swing vote on racial issues. He joined the conservative wing to strike down a core provision of the Voting Rights Act in 2013 but voted with the court's liberals in 2016 to back university affirmative action programs.Kennedy voted to overturn then-President Barack Obama's health-care law. He was one of five justices in the majority of the 2000 Bush v. Gore ruling, which sealed George W. Bush's election as president over Democrat Al Gore.His departure puts the Supreme Court at a tipping point. Another Gorsuch-type nominee could create the most conservative court since the justices blocked a number of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs in the 1930s.It could also create a lasting majority. Thomas, at 70, is the oldest of the court's remaining Republican appointees.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

820,SEE,"Baozun, a May 2015 new issue, has waged a terrific run-up ever since it cleared a super-deep bottoming base at 9.99 during the week ended Aug. 26, 2016. How long can its rally last?And more importantly, how much impact could the China-U.S. trade dispute have on the company's fundamentals?To answer the first question, it's really key to learn how to count bases.After a stock breaks out of a sound chart pattern, watch to see if rises 20% or more. If it does, the next serious decline begins the process of a new base.What if a stock rises just 15% from the proper buy point, then settles into a new base? Put another way: You find a stock that launches out of a cup with handle, breaks out, goes up 15%, but then forms a flat base on top of that cup? In most cases, both bases count as one entire base. IBD calls it simply a base on base.Going back to Baozun (BZUN), the stock nearly doubled in price and hit all-time highs after that first breakout in 2016. Base No. 2 was also quite deep, but Baozun cleared a 17.68 entry during the week ended May 5, 2017. That breakout spawned a 130% advance.Baozun formed two more bases, one from September 2017 and another from March 2018. These two bases showed big weekly price swings. But the breakout from these bases showed hefty volume, a good sign.Some late-stage breakouts can work, even if there's higher risk of failure, when a company has truly excellent fundamentals and solid institutional sponsorship.This week, the stock has fallen to the 10-week moving average for the first time since its May 17 breakout. A first or second rebound off the 10-week line offers investors a fresh opportunity to buy shares. Risk is higher now with the market's outlook downgraded by IBD on Monday to ""uptrend under pressure.""During a rally off the 10-week line, look for a swell in turnover. A strong price gain in heavy volume signals solid institutional demand. Try to buy as close as possible to the 10-week line, or in this case, near 55.70.Contrast Baozun's action to fellow Sector Leader ServiceNow (NOW). The latter dropped briefly below its 50-day moving average on Friday, then closed beneath the line on Monday. Volume hasn't been overly intense, however. On Monday, ServiceNow saw trading volume increase merely 3% above average.To answer the second question, on the U.S.-China trade dispute, it's key to study recent numbers.Baozun, the expert in e-commerce markets in the second largest economy, has superior earnings gains. According to IBD Leaderboard, the average EPS increase over the past three quarters is 58%. The Street sees earnings rising 27% in the second quarter.In Q1, the Shanghai-based firm reported a profit 0f 9 cents per share, a penny above the consensus forecast. Revenue has jumped 24%, 19%, 31% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters.According to a May 17 news release, Baozun said the number of its brand partners rose to 156 as of March 31 from 125 the same time a year earlier. Officials do not make clear how many of those partners are American corporations. One can surmise that many of its brand partners are East Asian companies. For instance, Baozun established a wholly owned subsidiary in October 2014 to expand its e-commerce services to the Taiwan market.In October 2015, Baozun started a 100%-owned unit aiming to introduce more Japanese brands to Chinese consumers. And in September 2016, it launched a joint venture with a division of the South Korean culture and lifestyle conglomerate CJ Group ""to introduce highly sought-after Korean brands to Chinese consumers,"" according to a filing with the SEC.Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.RELATED:The Bull Market Gets A Bloody Nose; Watch For This Critical Sell Signal5 Reasons Why This Market Uptrend Is Still StrongThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner: This Should Happen On Breakout DayHow Many Chinese Companies Make The IBD 50 Today?

824,SEE,"There are 2,127 exchange traded funds in the U.S. with $3.6 trillion in assets under management. Only 234 are actively managed ETFs holding just $57.2 billion, according to ETF.com, a leading information source on the industry.To be clear, active ETFs, which have been around 10 years, make up 11% of the funds but hold only 1.6% of its assets.At ETF.com's Inside Smart Beta & Active ETFs Summit earlier this month, industry insiders discussed ""Active Management: Why This Time Is Different.""Dave Nadig, managing director of ETF.com asked, ""How did we get here?""""Low costs vs. high costs,"" said Richard Powers, head of ETF Product Management at Vanguard. ""Too many active managers charging high fees and not delivering what they offer. Investors are going to go the passive route. It's not that active doesn't have a future — but can you do it in a low-cost way?""Equity mutual funds in the U.S. hold $15.9 trillion in assets under management. About 79%, or $12.5 trillion are in actively managed funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, the industry trade group. Last year, $151.2 billion flowed out of active equity funds, while index equity funds received inflows of $223 billion. This year through April 30, active equity had outflows of $43.2 billion and index equity posted inflows of $72.7 billion, said ICI.Meanwhile, last year and this year, both active and index ETFs posted inflows. In 2017, actives took in $15 billion; indexes gobbled up $454 billion. Through April 30 this year, active inflows were $7.4 billion, while index inflows were $77.3 billion, according to ICI.""If you talk about all fund types, you see flows cascading out of expensive (and) into cheap,"" said Eric Balchunas, senior ETF Analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence. ""Right around 40 basis points is where outflows stop and inflows start.""Balchunas explained how his group did analysis and broke down all ETF and mutual funds into expense-ratio buckets separated by increments of 10 basis points (bp): 0-10, 10-20, 20-30, etc.He said it didn't matter if the structure was active or index. Even index funds that charged 30 bp or 40 bp saw outflows, while index funds charging less than 10 bp saw inflows.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""No matter which bucket you looked in, you saw the same exact trend: people migrating south,"" Balchunas said. ""I call low-cost migration the mother of all trends. The whole thing is, people just want cheap. They don't want to pay for their investments anymore. So, no actives over 40 bp.""He said the average fee for active ETFs is 81 bp. On average, smart beta ETFs are less than half the cost of active ETFs.""I think active ETFs are ripe for a fee war,"" said Balchunas.However, all agreed that if an active ETF significantly outperforms the market, it could charge whatever it wants. They pointed to ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK), which surged 85% last year and was up 27.9% through June 19. It charges an expense ratio of 0.75%.But so far, that all seems like an acceleration of old news.""What is different is mostly a bit of desperation,"" said Nadig. ""There's a growing realization that traditional equity shops need some response to ETFs. The choice is to put your head in the sand and watch your assets go away or wade into some nontransparent structure and hope the Security and Exchange Commission approves. The nontransparency which they are desperate to keep is the big bugaboo.""Vanguard's Powers said active managers are loath to come out with transparent products because they ""don't want to reveal their secret sauce."" So most active mutual fund shops have filed with the SEC to create ETFs with a nontransparent structure. They have not received approval yet. But, if the SEC does approve such a structure, Powers expects to see many more active ETFs. If the SEC denies them, Powers said, they would still get into the ETF space with smart beta products.""I worked for traditional asset management companies before joining the ETF space five years ago,"" said Linda Zhang, chief executive of Purview Investments, a New York RIA specializing in ETF managed portfolios. ""Many don't know how to deal with the changing environment. There's an inherent discomfort for these companies to transform from traditional products to ETFs because of the fear of losing margins. It's a completely different business model: How ETFs are managed, traded and distributed. It's not as easy as people think — that you can just transform the traditional mutual fund business into ETFs.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:These 3 Stock Sectors May Fare Well In The Current Economic CycleSmall-Cap Stocks Rocket Higher; Top China Fund Nears Buy PointIndex Funds Performance: Dow Lags As This Blue-Chip Stock Weighs

833,SEE,"Russia Investigation: After Congress threatened impeachment, the Department of Justice and FBI reluctantly handed over classified documents related to the Russia investigation. But they still haven't fully complied with Congress' request. Is this just more deep-state obstruction?Of course, that's a loaded question. Sure, the bureaucrats at DOJ and the FBI have a responsibility to keep the nation's secrets and to maintain the integrity of their own investigations. But they don't have a right to hold back information legitimately requested by Congress for its investigation into the highly questionable behavior of both the DOJ and FBI during the Russia-Trump investigation.""A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan said Saturday that the department (of Justice) has partially complied with subpoenas from the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees after officials turned over more than a thousand new documents this week,"" the Associated Press reported.It's that phrase ""partially complied"" that sticks in our throat. Imagine ""partially complying"" with a judge's order to tell the whole and complete truth in a court case. Or ""partially complying"" with your requirement to file you taxes. Or ""partially complying"" with a police officer's lawful order to stop.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Partial"" compliance isn't enough. Congress has repeatedly requested documents for its investigation, but has been denied. And we need to be absolutely clear here: Congress has oversight authority over both the Justice Department and FBI. So saying ""No"" to Congress' request, unless it's grounded in serious national security concerns, is not acceptable. Period.Try impeding an investigation by DOJ or the FBI and you'll immediately be charged with obstruction or worse, with the possibility of going to prison for many years. Why should DOJ and the FBI be exempt from the law?Some in Congress aren't happy about all this. Republican Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina is one of them.""New reports of DOJ-FBI compliance with document requests are NOT accurate,"" he tweeted. ""While they have turned over additional documents, the new documents represent a small percentage of what they owe.""""The notion that DOJ/FBI have been forthcoming with Congress is false,"" he wrote.The problem is, Congress needs to get to the bottom of what looks to be a massive conspiracy within the FBI and DOJ to boost Hillary Clinton's election chances, while impeding Trump's. If true, and certainly evidence amassed so far indicates it is, it would be the biggest government scandal in at least 100 years. Bigger, yes, than Watergate.That's why Congress has sought so much documentation from FBI Deputy Director Rod Rosenstein. They demand more than 1.4 million documents, a large amount to be sure, but have only received roughly 800,000 pages. Last week's delivery amounted to just 1,400 pages or so. So you can see why some investigation-minded representatives, such as Meadows, aren't satisfied.The Justice Department and FBI had a Friday deadline to hand over the documents. They only partially complied. Yet the vow by Rep. Devin Nunes ""there's going to be hell to pay"" if they didn't comply seems to have fallen on deaf ears.The questions about the Russia investigation launched by the FBI and later picked up by Special Counsel Robert Mueller are many.Congress, for instance, wants access to transcripts of conversations between ""confidential human sources"" — spies — and Trump campaign officials.Congressional Republicans also seek to understand how former British spy Christopher Steele, who compiled the now-infamous Trump dossier, came to be paid by the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the FBI.

835,SEE,"EVERETT, Wash. — After months of delays and billions in cost overruns for Boeing (BA), the Air Force and the aerospace giant have agreed on a delivery schedule for a new aerial refueling tanker, but there is still critical work to be done.XBoeing will deliver the first KC-46 tanker in October with 17 more to arrive by April 2019. That compares to Boeing's contractual obligation to deliver the initial 18 aircraft by August 2017. The Air Force will eventually receive 179 tankers under a deal worth more than $40 billion.The agreement comes after Boeing had said the first delivery would happen this summer while the Air Force said by the end of the year. Even though they are now on the same page, the Air Force acknowledges there is still some unfinished business.""While the KC-46A flight test program is nearly complete, significant work remains,"" said Air Force Under Secretary Matthew Donovan in a statement.The KC-46 tanker still has 4% of its certifications left, according to Boeing, but the refueling boom has been a particular headache.In fact, the last major hurdle is getting the boom, cameras the the operator all working together smoothly, Sean Martin, Boeing's chief refueling operator for the KC-46, told IBD at the massive plant where the company builds the planes.""The boom is fully capable, has exceptional handing qualities,"" he said. ""I think it's the combination of the human interface to the system and the camera to the boom we are working through right now""For example, the cameras have issues if the sun is at a certain angle, he explained.While the air frame is a modified 767 commercial jet that has rolled off Boeing's production lines countless times, the boom was designed specifically for the KC-46 and not a carryover from earlier tankers.""Only the outer mold line of the boom is the same, and we did that for air stability since we had flight tested that boom on KC-10,"" Martin said. ""The components in the boom are redesigned.  Multiple redundancies and control engineering is state of the art and leverages the lessons learned on international tanker development.""Boeing shares closed up 0.5% at 342.69 on the stock market today.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe camera system is also new. Legacy tankers required operators to lay flat and watch the boom as it was inserted into the plane needed refueling.Now operators sit in the middle of the cabin and use the new remote vision system to steer the boom.The tanker delays have been costly for Boeing as the aerospace giant is under a fixed-cost contract that puts it on the hook for any cost overruns.So far, Boeing has booked nearly $3 billion in pre-tax charges on the program due to the technical problem and delays.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBoeing Super Hornet Appears To Be The New 'Top Gun' — Not Lockheed F-35IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock Lists

837,SEE,"PTC Therapeutics (PTCT) spiked Wednesday after an analyst suggested it and Roche (RHHBY) could rout Biogen (BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) in treating spinal muscular atrophy.At the close on the stock market today, PTC shares popped 7.2%, at 35.64. Ionis climbed 1.4%, at 44.03, recovering from an earlier 4.3% pitfall. Biogen lifted 1.7%, to 296.86. Roche advanced 2.1%, to 27.09.Barclays analyst Gena Wang upgraded PTC to an equal weight rating and lifted her price target to 40 from 26. She cited data PTC issued from a recent study of its drug dubbed risdiplam in treating babies with spinal muscular atrophy.""Given initial comparable if not better (effectiveness) data, similar therapeutic approach and oral delivery, risdiplam could be disruptive to Ionis/Biogen's Spinraza, in addition to (being a) gene therapy threat,"" she said in a report to clients.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn a study from PTC, more than 90% of babies with spinal muscular atrophy treated with risdiplam achieved a greater than four-point increase on a measure of motor milestone development at day 182. A video showed the babies controlling their heads, rolling or sitting.""The survival data and (motor milestone development) scores are very promising since babies with Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy typically do not experience functional motor milestone improvement based on natural history,"" PTC Chief Executive Stuart Peltz said in a prepared statement.Risdiplam works by restoring a piece of RNA missing in spinal muscular atrophy patients. It's taken orally, giving it an advantage over Biogen and Ionis' Spinraza, which is delivered via an injection. Still, Spinraza remains the only drug approved to treat spinal muscular atrophy.Wang expects risdiplam to get rapid adoption in treating spinal muscular atrophy after it hits the market, likely in 2020. Though she notes it will also experience competition from the likes of a gene therapy by Novartis (NVS). Novartis acquired Avexis for its gene therapy, AVXS-101.So far, AVXS-101 ""still showed better (effectiveness) in young patients,"" she said.Meanwhile, Biogen and Ionis saw flattening Spinraza sales in the first quarter. That's likely due to the way Spinraza is dosed. Patients start out with four loading doses and then move to less frequent maintenance doses.""In addition to AVXS-101 gene therapy threat, we see potentially quick erosion of Spinraza revenue upon risdiplam launch, which could occur in 2020,"" Wang said. She downgraded Ionis to an underweight rating and cut her price target to 45 from 52.PTC, though, is likely to face other challenges, Wang said. The biotech company is also working on a treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Shares toppled 30.6% on Tuesday after Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) had strong data for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene therapy.RELATED:Chart-Reading Basics: How A Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityHow To Build Long-Term Profits In Stocks?

843,SEE,"Wondering how the U.S. stock market keeps skirting disaster? It's not complicated. For all the drama at their doorstep, trader positioning remains overwhelmingly bullish.It's visible in manager surveys, which last week showed equity funds only a trifle less long than at the height of January's euphoria. It's in markets for call options, where individual investors are engaged in a buying binge of historic dimensions. It's in tech IPOs, stocks favored by short sellers and ones with shaky balance sheets, all of which recently surged.For traders so inclined, each trauma is just another test, even as their frequency quickens. In Tuesday's version, Donald Trump's threat to slap tariffs on $200 billion more in goods from China sent the S&P 500 down as much as 1.1%, while the Dow Jones industrial average fell for a sixth day, the longest streak since March 2017.""We've had more negative catalysts and more negative pull this year than we've had for a long time, but the positives continue to prevail in the investor's mind,"" Jeff Carbone, a managing partner at Cornerstone Wealth in North Carolina, said by phone. ""They're shrugging off the negativity and taking the positive to a greater extent that this is not the end.""It's not that people haven't been warned. They have their memories of February and March, and strategists at banks from Morgan Stanley to Goldman Sachs have repeatedly urged investors to rein in optimism, citing everything from politics to peak earnings and monetary tightening. Earlier today, Citigroup flagged a potential bubble in growth stocks.But the caveats have gone unheeded. In one example, smaller options investors, defined as those who typically trade 10 contracts or fewer in one transaction, last week purchased to open more than 4.5 million calls, an amount that before this January was unprecedented in records going back to 2000, data compiled by Sundial Capital Research showed.While the rush to bet on higher share prices has helped the market stay buoyant this month amid an interest-rate increase from the Federal Reserve and growing trade tensions, it also sets bulls up for pain should things quickly reverse in coming months.""This is fine for now, but we think by year end such a 'risk on' hierarchy will be misplaced given the more uncertain outlook posed by 'peaky' growth rates and ever tightening financial conditions,"" Mike Wilson, chief U.S. equity strategist at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients Monday. He urged investors to go defensive in anticipation of a rotation out of companies whose growth is tied to economic growth and upgraded utility stocks.Wilson isn't alone among analysts who see trouble brewing. The rally in growth stocks brought flashbacks of the internet bubble to Citigroup strategists led by Robert Buckland, even as valuation premiums are less than half of those almost two decades ago. A collapse would bode ill for a market whose gains have been increasingly anchored on tech giants such as Amazon.com (AMZN) and Facebook (FB).""Price action of the U.S. growth/value trade looks ominously similar to late 1999,"" the strategists wrote. ""Watch out for a growth bubble.""Bulls have been unfazed, emboldened — as always — by a bedrock of earnings expectations that keeps getting stronger. Estimates compiled by Bloomberg show equity analysts see S&P 500 profit rising 24% in 2018 then 10% in each of the next two years.Numbers like those make it easier to bid up companies that recently went public and those with weaker finances. An exchange-traded fund that tracks newly listed stocks, the Renaissance IPO ETF (IPO), last week posted its second-best gain this year while a Goldman Sachs (GS) basket of companies with flimsier finances outpaced their stronger counterparts.To Matt Lloyd, chief investment strategist at Advisors Asset Management, all the anxiety over geopolitical turmoil will eventually fade.""People, rightfully so, are just basically saying this could happen, that could happen, but those are 30 or 40 really bad decisions in a row that have to happen for those to come to fruition,"" he said. ""We always confuse hiccups for heart attacks when we're adjusting to the news — just what could happen versus what does happen usually.""As bulls press ahead, bears have been retreating. A Goldman basket of 50 heavily shorted companies jumped more than 3% last week. In the options market, small traders have reduced their bearish wagers. As a result, more than two calls were bought at open for one put that changed hands, one of the highest ratios on record, Sundial data showed.While options are often employed as a hedging tool by large speculators, small traders typically use them to make a direct bet on market directions, said Jason Goepfert, president of Sundial Capital. The latest buying in calls stood out in a market where broad equity trading remained anemic, triggering a spike in its ratio as a percentage of NYSE volume.Coincidentally or not, such indications of retail euphoria flared up in January, just before the S&P 500's first 10% correction in two years. It also accompanied the bull market peaks in 2000 and 2007.""What's most remarkable about the jump in call volume is that it comes during a time of overall suppressed volume,"" Goepfert said. ""That doesn't exactly seem like a good sign.""With the price of call options now trading above historic average, investors should sell them to reap extra returns in a market whose upside appears limited with valuations stretched, according to Rocky Fishman, an options strategist at Goldman Sachs. The firm predicted that the S&P 500 will end next year at 3,000, or an 8% increase from the last close. That'd be below the 45th percentile in the index's history over any 18-month period.""The potential for upside surprises in U.S. equities is lower than the compensation received from elevated call prices,"" he wrote in a note.

Qualcomm (QCOM), whose merger with NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) appears tied up in U.S.-Chinese trade negotiations, fell 1%.Just a month ago, Trump was crowing about a China trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.That deal only came close to happening due to Trump's pledge via a tweet to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department had ordered ZTE's U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate voted on Monday to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a must-pass defense funding bill. The White House has said it opposes the ZTE provision, but a Trump veto of a defense bill to save Chinese jobs would be awkward.Rather than looking weak with a veto, Trump's threat of dramatically escalating tariffs is a show of strength that has scared investors and may also scare Republican senators into backing down.Trump already showed his cards with the underwhelming China trade deal he touted last month. He has no stomach for a trade war that makes American farmers pay the price. He also reportedly told Apple CEO Tim Cook that he won't impose tariffs on Apple iPhones assembled in China. Trump had seemed set to sign onto a deal that would have done relatively little to narrow the massive U.S. trade deficit with China.While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action vs. ZTE was separate from talk talks, it's clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping didn't agree.After Trump's leniency prompted a backlash and left the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators frustrated their American counterparts seeking to finalize an agreement and win more concessions. That strengthened the hand of Trump officials who have advocated a hard line vs. China and had Trump's first round of threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of high-tech Chinese imports all ready to go.Any time such threats are made and deadlines are set, there's risk involved. Beijing has a reputation for refusing to back down from a threat. If talks go nowhere before a July 6 deadline for imposing 25% tariffs on $34 billion in Chinese imports, the trade spat may spiral into something more serious. Yet if Trump follows through on his ZTE rescue, the negotiating environment is likely to improve, and there's probably a deal Trump will accept, at least in the short term.Any trade agreement is likely to please Wall Street, but it's sure to be just a cease-fire in what promises to be a longer term U.S. technological cold war with China.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Forget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarIf You Missed These Explosive China Stocks, Here's How You Could Get InBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

This is one of the eight key chart patterns that IBD identifies as platforms in which leading stocks jump off and rise into new highs.The 5% buy zone for Alphabet goes up to 1,237.17.As noted in this earlier Stock Market Today column, Alphabet also formed a nice seven-day handle on the double-bottom pattern.

The second sell-off must be deeper than the first one. In other words, PayPal's low of 70.22 undercut the first low of 71.63. That's good.

858,SEE,"You can take this to the bank: Millennials are optimistic about how to become rich. Exhibit A? Fifty-three percent of millennials expect to become a millionaire — or are one already. That self-confidence about how to become rich is even more pronounced among male millennials. An astounding 73% of them expect to become millionaires or already have reached that goal. Still, there's nothing wrong with aiming high. So the key question is, How can millennials achieve their aim of amassing $1 million?Experts do in fact offer roadmaps for how to become rich. One way that millennials — who range from 21 to 37 years of age, brokerage TD Ameritrade (AMTD) says — can build their wealth is by investing in assets that grow — not just park them in a piggy bank, where they do nothing. Another step millennials should take, one expert says, is to limit how much advice they take from the, you know, ""experts.""""You can learn a lot from your peers, not just from older 'experts',"" said Ian Rosen, CEO of StockTwits, an online community of nearly 2 million investors and traders, the bulk of whom are millennials. StockTwits members help educate each other by sharing more than 200,000 messages per day about markets and investing.Rosen says that many millennials are jaded about so-called experts, who were the high priests of the financial industry and nearly broke the global economy during the Great Recession, enriching themselves while financially hurting millennials' parents and grandparents.

They're custom-tailored for millennials, but they work just as well for savers of any age who are seeking the answer to that age-old question, how to become rich:""Millennials need to change their saving priorities,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief marketing strategist for TD Ameritrade. ""Retirement is more important than vacations. It's that simple.""Why does that matter? ""Time is money,"" Benjamin Franklin said. One reason that's true is because of compound earnings. The more time something can grow, the more it can compound. ""Time is one of your easiest and most powerful investment tools,"" Kinahan said. ""Don't waste it.""""Paying off debt is essential to becoming a millionaire,"" Kinahan said. Since credit card debt charges very high interest, shop around for a balance-transfer card that would charge you less. Also, pay down the balance on whichever credit card charges the highest interest. And if you pay off debt in minimum monthly installments, be sure to pay down principal as well as interest so that you eventually get rid of the balance.Yet 50% of millennials don't invest in the stock market. ""Many millennials don't realize that investing in an equity mutual fund means you're investing in stocks,"" Kinahan said. ""And broad ETFs and mutual funds are a good way to start.

860,SEE,"Oil prices and stocks, led by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), Marathon Oil (MRO) and California Resources (CRC), surged after OPEC agreed to increase production next month, though the vagueness of the deal underscored the fissures in the oil group.XOPEC producers and allies like Russia will aim to increase output by about 1 million barrels per day, Saudi Oil Minister Khalid al-Falih told reporters, though the actual increase is likely to be smaller as countries like Venezuela struggle to ramp up. S&P Global Platts expects a net output increase of around 700,000 bpd, largely met by Saudi Arabia.But OPEC's official statement on the decision didn't provide a specific number for the production increase. Instead, the statement said producers will more closely adhere to an earlier deal to reduce production by 1.8 million barrels per day. Since that deal was struck in 2016, participants have substantially overshot that target, with the reduction estimated at 2.8 million bpd.Despite the mixed signals coming from OPEC, the highly awaited policy decision Friday is bullish for oil prices as the planned output boost will bring markets closer to balance, said Edward Jones analyst Brian Youngberg.But he also found the contentious run-up to Friday's decision telling, as Iran had threatened to veto proposals to boost output.""OPEC is not the unified group it once was, they are all different interests and different capabilities,"" said Youngberg, who sees the introduction of electric vehicles and rise in U.S. shale production further crimping OPEC's leadership in the years ahead.He added that politics are more of an issue within OPEC now, with Russia playing both sides of the Iran-Saudi Arabia geopolitical rivalry.Last week, Saudi Arabia and Russia, which isn't an OPEC member, notably began looking at forging their own, separate agreement on energy cooperation.U.S. crude oil prices jumped 4.6% to settle at $68.58 a barrel, and Brent crude rallied 3.4% to $75.55 a barrel. Royal Dutch Shell spiked 4.4% on the stock market today. Marathon Oil leapt 8%, and shale producer California Resources soared 10%. Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.1%, Chevron (CVX) gained 2%, and BP (BP) surged 3.7%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOther details from Friday's agreement were left vague, such as how the increase will affect member countries at the individual level, focusing instead on a collective target.""It's an elegant solution to the problem they have had, where some countries have not been able to increase and some have lost production,"" said Roger Diwan, energy analyst at IHS Markit. ""They don't have to renegotiate quotas,"" bypassing a thorny issue and avoiding antagonizing OPEC members who can't produce, he added.What OPEC achieved, he added, ""is trying to keep (Brent crude) prices in a narrow range and not to cross $80+.""Ahead of OPEC's policy meeting in Vienna on Friday, divisions within the oil cartel threw the outcome into uncertainty up to the last minute.OPEC's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, and Russia sought to boost output again. But Iran was stubbornly opposed to a boost, as renewed U.S. sanctions would prevent it from selling more oil anyway. Other OPEC members like Venezuela and Iraq also signaled they weren't on board with an increase.OPEC was able to overcome objections by Iran and others to production increases by framing their decision as a return to the originally agreed 1.8 million bpd cuts, S&P Global Platts noted.""The fact that we dealt with overcompliance (on cutback commitments) that was worrying the industry … this is what made the deliberations meaningful,"" OPEC President Suhail Mohamed Al Mazrouei of the United Arab Emirates said in a press conference Friday.On Saturday, OPEC and its non-member partners will hold another meeting to ratify today's agreement.Meanwhile, the OPEC decision is unlikely to drive any strategic shift from American shale companies in the near term, Youngberg said.In the past year, many companies have promised to prioritize spending discipline over production expansion after previously rushing to pump more oil when prices recovered.""Shale plays are focused really on living within their cash flow and returning excess cash to shareholders,"" reflected in their debt reduction, dividends and buybacks, he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry News: Oil, Gas, Solar, CoalIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

861,SEE,"Climate change advocates are undoubtedly frustrated that they cannot succeed in getting legislation or regulation that is broad enough to satisfy their policy preferences. So, with the support of some lawyers who see the possibility of a big payday in judgments or settlements, climate change advocacy is increasingly moving to the courts.In 2017, several California municipalities were induced by trial attorneys into filing lawsuits against a number of energy companies. These lawsuits are based on novel tort litigation theories that purport to establish liability for climate change harms.The lawsuits allege responsibility based on decades of past behaviors and try to extend common law public nuisance and similar claims in tenuous new ways to paint past lawful activities as legal wrongs.The reform that these policy advocates seek should not be accomplished outside the democratic processes and deliberation of legislative bodies. Despite all the ills of the world, we must maintain the limits of the law, and we should appreciate what courts can and cannot do effectively.Public nuisance claims are very rarely brought and even more seldom won. It is hard to prove that someone has engaged in unreasonable or unlawful conduct that interferes with a right common to the general public, especially as each of those elements has been interpreted. Conduct which is lawful is seldom unreasonable and by definition not unlawful.Furthermore, the hurdles for establishing the elements of a traditional public nuisance claim are purposefully high because it is usually seen as an extreme remedy. But, here, the municipal plaintiffs seek to break down these time-tested limits that have kept public nuisance claims narrowly tailored.At the very least, public nuisance lawsuits are certainly not intended to allow a remedy for now-presently observable undesirable conditions by retroactively identifying the standards that should have been imposed, had we only known. To the contrary, public nuisance is a tort designed to contemporaneously address existing, known and knowable harms traceable to clearly identifiable sources.Tort law should not be a vehicle for changing the definition of what is or is not unlawful, especially not with retroactive effect. That is simply not how a system committed to the Rule of Law operates.And, one's inability to convince the legislature or the regulators to change the meaning does not greenlight judicial policymaking.Consider our history with air pollution in the late 1960s and 1970s. Once we all realized that the air was getting too polluted across the United States and particularly bad in places like California, we engaged in a legislative debate about how we might change standards and impose future regulations to prevent harm and restore air quality.When we decided we wanted higher standards, we then used normal legislative processes to create them and normal regulatory processes to impose them. We did not resort to legitimizing regulation by litigation to get more than what was possible through legislative means.The Clean Air Act and other pieces of legislation and the regulations that followed were the result of intense policy discussions, legislative debates, and, yes, compromise between competing economic and environmental values.As a society, we did not decide that any deficiencies we saw in prospective remedies made it wise or even legitimate to open the courthouse doors to lawsuits against everyone who might have been a lawful past contributor to the air quality conditions we now disliked.And, that is precisely what we should do with climate change issues. We should debate new standards and should implement new policies by legislation, if needed.But we should not deputize courts to create new law and fashion new standards of tort liability as a way to circumvent the legislative process or as an escape when we are unsatisfied with the speed or depth of the legislative response.I have no interest in debating climate science. Nor should the courts. It is not what either of us do well.The expertise of judges is suited to police the Rule of Law and to decide actual cases based on concrete facts and identifiable, existing legal standards. And the duty of judges is to avoid the temptation to create new torts or assist the mutation of existing ones beyond recognition rather than leave that creative enterprise to the legislative branch.

868,SEE,"Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA) led four top stocks pulling back to their 50-day moving averages on Friday. A strong rebound from that key technical level can offer a chance to add shares to your position. But with the Nasdaq composite and other leading stock market averages tumbling Monday on trade war fears, Apple stock and Nvidia stock plunged below that key support level. Nvidia also sold off below its buy point. Financial stocks E-Trade Financial (ETFC) and SVB Financial (SIVB), well extended from their last buy zones, also undercut their 50-day lines.XWhile Apple stock is clearly the most popular name in the group, it lags with a Composite Rating of 84 out of 99. E-Trade leads the group with a 99, and is closely followed by SVB with a 98 and Nvidia with a 97. Top stocks typically have strong Composite Ratings when they launch big moves.When looking for stocks to buy, in addition to strong technical action, it's important to look for top fundamentals. The Composite Rating combines factors such as earnings and sales growth, profit margins, return on equity and price performance.Apple stock is back below a three-weeks-tight buy point of 190.47 as it pulls back to the 10-week moving average. Shares are back in buy range from a double-bottom entry at 179.04, closing Friday at 184.92. Apple stock fell 1.5% to 182.17 in Monday's stock market trading, below its 50-day line.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA 10-week-line pullback represents an add-on buying opportunity when the moving average is above a buy point. However, you want to ensure that the stock is finding support at this level, rather than losing it. You also want to buy as close as you can to a rebound off the line is sound strategy.It's key to remember that a rebound off the 10-week line represents a chance to add shares to an existing position, rather than initiate a new one.A stock falling through its 50-day line, especially in high volume, is not good action. Investors should examine their portfolios and consider sell rules.As for investors on the sidelines, look to see if these stocks rebound by the end of the week. A brief foray below the 50-day line, by itself, is OK. But you should wait for a strong rebound.Nvidia stock was 5% from a double-bottom entry at 239.35 on Friday even as it pulled back toward its 10-week line. But keep in mind that Nvidia's base is later stage whereas Apple's double-bottom is an early-stage base. Later-stage bases can work, but they have a higher chance of failing since they form after a stock has already been on a big run.Nvidia tumbled 4.7% to 239.12 on Monday, knifing below its 50-day line and the 239.35 entry in above-average volume. The stock has now roundtripped a 12% gain from the buy point, a strong sell signal.E-Trade stock is finding support at the 10-week line after trading in a relatively tight range over the past several weeks. Shares closed Friday 16% extended from a late-stage consolidation first cleared on March 9.This represents the stock's first pullback to the 10-day line above the buy point. Investors can add shares to their positions at the first two pullbacks, but after that — without the formation of a new base — the stock would be considered too extended.E-Trade stock fell 3.4% Monday, below its 50-day line.Lastly, SVB Financial stock is pulling back to its 10-week line too.

869,SEE,"The stock market rarely finds equilibrium — a balance between supply and demand. In fact, CAN SLIM investing is partially based on pinpointing instances on a stock chart that are furthest from equilibrium — where demand is most likely to outstrip supply. So when you want to locate the big market winners, knowing the role of volume is key.This is the S in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-letter acronym for great investing: It stands for supply and demand. And it is the prevailing reason why IBD discusses volume action regarding the overall market, and tracks volume trends and percentage changes in the number of shares trading hands in individual stocks.Supply, in stock trading, is gauged at several different levels. The term outstanding shares refers to all of a company's shares, even restricted shares and those held by company executives or long-term investors and which in most cases aren't likely to see the light of day anytime soon.Another term, the float, subtracts closely held shares from the shares outstanding. This gauge more accurately reflects a stock's liquidity and is more closely related to the action in both price changes and turnover.IBD'S TAKE: Demand from institutional investors — the I in the CAN SLIM methodology — drive winning stock runs. Investors can track that demand using a stock chart's volume characteristics.A couple other key terms are important in a stock's supply/demand relationship: the average daily volume and the average daily dollar volume.  The first averages the number of shares traded over 50 days.  In general, seek a minimum average of 400,000 shares for a leading stock. This level of volume helps make the stock more resistant to manipulation by large-scale investors.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe average daily dollar volume combines a stock's price and daily volume to gauge the amount of capital moving in and out of a stock each day. CAN SLIM rules generally call for potential leaders to trade a minimum dollar volume of $25 million per day.  That is equal to a $63 stock averaging 400,000 shares a day, or a $25 stock averaging a daily turnover of 1 million shares.Used in combination, those measures help investors track the behavior of institutions acting on a single stock.Alibaba Group (BABA) offered a good example. The September 2014 IPO consolidated for 27 months before its breakout in the first quarter of 2017.With a float of more than a billion shares, the stock's supply overwhelmed demand, dragging shares off their high in November 2014 and into a correction more than 50% deep.Throughout the consolidation, large stabs of buying moved upward from 70 million shares per day (1). As more of those shares fell into the hands of investors set to hold, the big-volume buying gradually began to contain the stock's supply.Volume levels started to settle as the stock swung into a five-month cup-with-handle base in September. When the stock began forming a handle in January, volume levels dropped to below average (2) — exactly what you want to see: The sellers have what they want, and the buyers have established their positions.The supply is tight, so that any subsequent demand will drive prices higher. Alibaba found a stasis for almost a month and a half, bumping up against its correct entry price at 104.67. The stock climbed past its buy point in March (3), advancing in 11 of 12 weeks through May 16.Through the end of May in 2018, Alibaba has rallied as much as 102% from the proper buy point.A version of this column was first published on May 19, 2017.RELATED:Top Growth Stocks Today: Inside IBD 50A Stock Breaks Out; How Far Up In Price Can You Buy Shares?Also In Investor's Corner: What Does A ""Base On Base"" Look Like?Global LeadersHave You Mastered This Key Chart Pattern That Many Great Stocks Form Before They Break Out?Sector Leaders

870,SEE,"When Occidental Petroleum (OXY) packed up its Los Angeles, Calif., headquarters and shipped out to Houston in 2014, few investors had heard of the Permian Basin. At the time, Occidental was the largest oil producer in Texas. It was the largest producer of natural gas in California.By 2017, the almost century-old company was the third-largest oil play in Texas. That put it just behind EOG Resources (EOG) and Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD). It is also among the largest holders of acreage and producers of oil in the Permian Basin. That is the west Texas redoubt that Bloomberg has said is on track to ""become the world's largest oil patch over the next decade.""Occidental shares slipped 2.4% in weak trade Monday, edging just below the stock's 50-day moving average. The move technically put the stock back into a buy range above a 78.18 buy point in a cup base. Investors probably don't want to enter a stock that high in the buy range. But a rebound off the 50-day line could produce a follow-on buying opportunity.Many Permian producers face a musical chairs-type shake out, as production outpaces the available capacity of pipelines to transport the oil to market. But Occidental owns its own gathering systems within the basin, the pipelines that take oil and gas from the wellhead to larger pipelines or to separation facilities.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlso, Occidental has locked down contracts giving them capacity of 470,000 barrels per day out of the Permian, according to a CNBC interview with chief executive Vicki Hollub in May. At that time, that was roughly double the company's output within the basin, she said.In mid-June, capacity bottlenecks trimmed prices for oil coming out of the Permian to about $10 below West Texas Intermediate crude priced at Cushing, Okla., the transaction location for the WTI benchmark. The International Energy Agency believes take-away capacity from the Permian fields will ""become insufficient by midyear, with a deficit possibly reaching as much as 290,000 barrels a day during the first half of 2019.""In addition, Occidental is expanding the loading capacity of its Ingleside oil export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. It is adding loading arms and dredging the terminal to a depth of 66 feet, allowing it to load VLCC tankers — the largest class of oil tanker afloat — with oil headed for markets in Europe and Asia. Crude exports out of Corpus Christi are expected to reach 1 million barrels per day by 2020.In 2013, just before its move to Texas, Occidental began exiting locations in the Bakken shale of Montana and North Dakota. It spun off its operations in California, and divested four international operations. As a result, production decreased 40% — just as the global oil glut was swinging into gear. Earnings per share dropped by 98%, to 12 cents, in 2015, followed by a $1-per-share loss the following year.Earnings recovered to 89 cents per share last year. They are projected to rebound to $4.61 for 2018, with a 673% jump projected by the consensus estimate for the second quarter.Occidental operates in three segments: oil and gas, chemicals and midstream and marketing. In 2017, the oil and gas unit produced about 63% of revenue. Chemicals were another 35%. The oil unit generated 55% of total earnings. Chemicals were 41%.The strength of diversification was apparent in the segment numbers. For 2017, Occidental's operations outside the U.S. accounted for more than 100% of profit, because domestic operations and oil exploration efforts both lost money.An increasing number of analysts are questioning how much longer the Permian basin can continue to increase its total output, and at what point the Permian's localized glut might began to spread.Hollub said she expects additional pipeline capacity will be built, easing the take-away restrictions. More crucial, she told CNBC, are labor shortages plaguing the industry.She said companies attempting to ramp activity much above current levels are in for a struggle, and face rising costs.""We're really at the activity level we want to be,"" she said, pointing to Occidental's current output from the field. ""If you are a company that is not trying to ramp up significantly, you have a significant advantage.""Occidental has delivered uninterrupted quarterly dividends since 1975, with annual increases each year since 2002. The current annual rate is $3.08 per share, which yields about 3.7% on an annualized basis.RELATED: Dow Giant Triggers Sell Signal As China Trade War Boosts RivalIBD Stock Of The Day: This China Internet Gives Back All Its GainsPermian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersTop Shale Oil Names See Profits Soar As Crude Passes $70Divergence In The Stock Market Is A Worrisome Sign

875,SEE,"Magna International (MGA) plans to engineer and build electric vehicles in China, marking the first time North America's largest auto parts supplier is expanding its car manufacturing capabilities beyond its 20-year-old Steyr venture.XThe Aurora, Ontario-based company is forming two joint ventures with China's largest EV maker, Beijing Electric Vehicle Co., known as BJEV. The engineering and manufacturing ventures are set to take over an existing factory in Zhenjiang with the intention of producing vehicles by 2020, Magna said in a statement Monday. Bloomberg News reported in February that Magna was in talks with BJEV's parent for an EV pact.China surpassed the U.S. in 2015 as the largest market for EVs, helped by government subsidies and stringent emissions rules. A local facility in China helps Magna enter the fast-growing market while potentially helping it to lessen the impact of any increases in export costs resulting from the intensifying trade spat between the U.S. and China.Owned by Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co., the parent of BJEV, the Zhenjiang plant has the capacity to build 180,000 vehicles a year and it will also offer engineering and complete vehicle manufacturing services to other customers.

877,SEE,"Taxes: Whatever you think about the issue of taxing internet sales, the simple fact is that the Supreme Court has just guaranteed that people across the country will now be paying more in state taxes. It's hard for us to see how this is good news.In its 5-4 decision on South Dakota v. Wayfair, the court overturned two previous rulings that prevented states from taxing sales of out-of-state companies. That meant a catalog company based in Maine didn't have to navigate 45 state sales-tax laws to figure out how much each customer owed, and then remit that money to the right states.Brick-and-mortar stores have been trying to lift this ban for decades, because, they say, it unfairly tilts the playing field in favor of catalog and online retailers. According to the Government Accountability Office, this break cost states up to $13.4 billion in lost revenue last year alone. And, retailers say it cost jobs and hurt local economies.Not surprisingly, Amazon.com  (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), Etsy (ETSY), Wayfair (W) and other e-commerce stocks dropped on Thursday.The Supreme Court ruling was notable not just because it did something it rarely does — namely, overturn previous decisions. (The most recent, Quill v North Dakota, was in 1992.) The court also split in a highly unusual way.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the majority side were rock-ribbed conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch, who sided with Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion. But so did stalwart liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Kennedy argued that the explosive growth of online retail rendered the court's previous rulings outdated.Three of the other liberals on the court, Justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, sided with Chief Justice Roberts' dissent. Roberts argued that it should be up to Congress to make a change like this.Whatever the merits of the decision, the Court's ruling means not only higher taxes for consumers, but higher prices.Keep in mind that despite online retail's explosive growth, the internet still accounts for less than 10% of all retail sales in the U.S., according to the Census Bureau. Plus, at least some of that growth represents entirely new sales that never would have occurred in an offline world.At the same time, the ruling means that online retailers — large and small — will soon have to comply with nearly 10,000 different tax jurisdictions across the country in the 45 states that impose sales taxes. That means different rates, varying definitions of products, and a variety of exemptions. The resulting complexity is mind-boggling.In New York, for example, clothing and footwear costing less than $110 is exempt from state sales tax, but not in some local jurisdictions. New York taxes shower caps and walking boots, but not swimming caps or hiking boots, says Avalara (AVLR), which makes automated tax software.Some states treat diapers as a health care item exempt from taxation, and others treat them as clothing. A few years ago, Wisconsin issued a 1,437-word bulletin explaining how the state taxed different forms of ice cream cakes. Then there are the various state tax ""holidays"" meant to goose sales.It is true that some states have tried to simplify their sales taxes to reduce compliance costs. And there are consulting firms that can help companies navigate this minefield.But there can be no doubt that this ruling means a higher cost of doing business. In fact, Avalara stock shot up 13.5% after the court's ruling. Tax complexity is always good news for tax consultants.In addition, smaller online firms will now be at a disadvantage, not only with local brick-and-mortar businesses that only have to comply with one state's sales-tax laws, but against online giants that can easily absorb the extra compliance costs.Worse still, the court may have opened the door to letting states impose other taxes on out-of-state firms.Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform argues that states could use this ruling to impose corporate taxes and even income taxes across state lines.""If physical nexus is no longer required for sales taxes ,then it is no longer required for personal or corporate income taxes,"" he said. ""Now, California (or any state or city that loses population through exit) can tax people and businesses who do their best to avoid that state or city.""If you think that's a fanciful prediction, you haven't been paying attention. State governments will take every opportunity they can to raise taxes — especially if their own residents aren't the ones paying them.In the end, it makes Supreme Court Chief Justice Roberts' dissent look all the wiser.As he noted, the online retail industry has thrived up until now based on the existing rules regarding sales taxes.""Any alteration to those rules with the potential to disrupt the development of such a critical segment of the economy,"" he wrote, ""should be undertaken by Congress.""Anyone Notice That Trump Is Now Tied With 'Popular' Obama On Job Approval?The Economy Is Not An Engine — So Stop Describing It Like OneTrump Didn't Sign G-7's Leftist Agenda — Smart MoveMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

Three in four consumers say highly personalized ads, as well as marketers' requests for personal information, are ""creepy.""Despite the risk of spooking customers, most marketing departments still closely monitor customers' purchase and browsing histories. For more than a decade, this has been the only way to construct accurate customer profiles and send them relevant ads.Fortunately, there's now a better way. Thanks to artificial intelligence, marketers can create targeted ads based on just a few anonymous data points. This ""probabilistic"" marketing model generates strong sales without creeping out customers or exposing firms to legal and reputational risk in the event of data breaches.For years, marketing departments have been caught in a Catch-22.If they didn't collect enough data to personalize customers' shopping experiences, they'd forego billions in revenue. In 2016, businesses collectively missed out on $756 billion in sales by failing to personalize, according to Accenture.But if they did collect customer data, firms risked losing customers' trust. Consider what happened to Facebook (FB) when 87 million users learned that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, secretly scraped their data from the social media site.After the story broke, the company lost $50 billion in market value in just a few days. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was dragged to Capitol Hill to testify before Congress.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBrands can escape this no-win situation by changing how they target customers.Right now, most companies use ""deterministic"" data modeling. When a customer logs into a site with his username and password, a brand can follow his actions and suggest future purchases.With probabilistic data modeling, brands don't digitally stalk the customer. Instead, they create an anonymous profile of a person with a few known preferences.For example, they may know that a certain customer is a 26-year-old male who enjoys science fiction. Based on that information, the brand can use artificial intelligence to infer what that anonymous customer will probably also like.AI can be used to analyze millions of podcasts, books, hotels, designers, artists, and cafes and generate billions of cultural correlations. For instance, Spotify could use AI to learn that anyone who listens to a particular artist is also likely to shop at H&M.Spotify could then sell H&M the right to run ads whenever people play songs by that artist.Probabilistic data keeps consumers' identities secure and also allows brands to gain insights from a much wider array of consumer-related topics and interests.Chipotle could find out which podcasts its users probably enjoy. American Express could predict where a subset of customers will travel this summer on vacation. Nike could predict which Hulu shows its customers probably watch.Probabilistic cultural correlations are highly reliable.Consider Amazon's ""you may also like"" recommendation engine. By leveraging probabilistic, anonymous data, Amazon can expose consumers who have clicked on certain products to similar products that might interest them. The engine drives over 30% of the tech giant's sales.Or consider my company Qloo. Given specific preferences in one cultural domain, say food or music, Qloo's cultural AI can accurately infer relevance for a given entity in a different domain 55% of the time, on average. With two known preferences, that number jumps to 75%, and with three, more than 90%Soon, using anonymized probabilistic data may become a financial imperative.The European Union's General Data Protection Regulations, which went into effect last month, aim to ""give citizens back control of their personal data"" by implementing a higher standard for data protection and privacy.In theory, the rules only apply within the EU. But in practice, all multinational companies with a significant European presence must adhere to them, since it'd be difficult to separate the data of EU users from non-EU residents. The EU plans to fine companies up to 4% of their global annual revenue if they refuse to comply.Luckily, aside from probabilistic data, companies have another modern data privacy tool at their disposal — blockchain.Blockchain decentralizes databases ranging from title insurance to social identities, so that no single corporate entity owns the data.Essentially, it gives consumers private keys to their own data in a public domain. It won't be long before consumers will have complete control over which companies see data on their tastes and preferences and when, perhaps even rendering GDPR regulations moot.Consumers don't like it when brands stalk them and pinpoint who they are, even if it eventually leads to a cool llama lamp. Eventually, blockchain will give consumers full sovereignty over their data. Until and even after then, companies can use AI to better divine consumers' preferences without ever collecting terabytes of data on precise identities.Zuckerberg Starts Talking, And Makes Facebook's Problems Even WorseCould Blockchain Be A Bigger Disrupter Than The Internet?The End Of Money As We Know It?More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

880,SEE,"Dropbox (DBX), Zscaler (ZS) and Carbon Black (CBLK) are new software IPO stocks that staged powerful breakouts earlier this month. But with the Dow Jones, S&P 500 and now the Nasdaq composite retreating, these IPOs have given up all of their gains. Dropbox stock fell back into the 5% buy zone on Thursday, along with Zscaler and Carbon Black. Meanwhile, blistering China IPO stocks iQiyi (IQ) and Huya (HUYA) suffered double-digit declines Thursday.Dropbox stock closed below its buy point Friday, a big red flag. Zscaler and Carbon Black also undercut entry areas intraday. IQiyi and Huya continued to swing wildly, but still have most of their gains.Should you hold or cash out of these volatile stocks? That depends on your investing horizon and your conviction in these names. But you should have a plan. Here are investing guidelines to consider:If a top stock rises more than 10% from the buy point, you really don't want to see that double-digit gain turn into a loss.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDropbox blasted 24.5% from a 34.93 buy point, but has tumbled all the way to 35.69, losing 4.3% in Wednesday's stock market trading. Zscaler ran up 26% from its entry, also 34.93, but has since retreated to 35.21, diving 7.1% on Wednesday. Carbon Black vaulted 35% from a 25.94 entry. But it fell 26.67, off 7.5% on Thursday.On Friday, Dropbox sank 5.5% to 33.72, round-tripping its run. Zscaler fell to 34.25 intraday, round-tripping its run-up, though it did rebound to close up 4% at 36.63  Carbon Black sank 2% to 26.14 after falling as low as 25.69, just below its 25.94 entry.If a stock pulls back to a breakout area, does it find support at its buy point? Dropbox stock didn't seem to find support at the buy point. Zscaler stock did find support around its buy point, ultimately. So, to a lesser extent, did fellow security software IPO stock Carbon Black.While IPO stocks Dropbox, Zscaler and Carbon Black have fallen sharply, those sell-offs have come in volume that, though heavy, was generally lighter than on the run-up.Do you think this stock and company are going to be big long-term winners? Perhaps you let the stock pull back further. If it's a more speculative, short-term trade, you might be quicker to take partial or total profits.That's a question not only for the software IPO trio, but the Chinese livestreaming IPO duo of iQiyi and Huya.IQiyi, a Baidu (BIDU) spinoff, tumbled 12% on Thursday. Huya, a YY (YY) spinoff, plunged nearly 14%. Both are sharply higher over the past several weeks. IQiyi stock and Huya stock had vaulted far above their fast-rising 10-day moving averages, so they were due for a pullback. On Thursday, Huya fell below its 10-day line for the first time ever, while iQiyi ended just above that line.Livestreaming is booming in China, and Huya has turned profitable. However, even if the future is bright for the livestreaming business, that's no guarantee that these two IPO stocks will be among the big long-term winners.If you are confident in these stocks, you might hold tight. Otherwise, you could trim or cash out your position.Huya stock fell 8% Friday morning, closing down 6.5%. Meanwhile, iQiyi stock sank 5.7% after plunging 9% earlier.Whatever your investing strategy, have a plan. How far are you willing to let a stock fall before you act? When a serious pullback occurs, follow your coolheaded strategy and not your emotions.Remember, if a stock falls 7%-8% below a buy point, that's an absolute sell signal.If a stock falls and you sell, you can always get back in when a new buying opportunity appears.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:These Five 99 Composite Rating Stocks Are In, Near Buy ZonesWhy These Explosive China Stocks Are Due For PullbacksIf You're Long Netflix Or Square, Read ThisThese 5 Biotech IPOs Jump In Debuts

881,SEE,"Scandal: Two agents and an attorney at the heart of the FBI's Clinton email ""investigation"" expose flagrant political bias at the heart of that probe. So why won't the FBI release their names to the public? And given what these key players said, how did the inspector general come to conclude that the ""investigation"" was unbiased? Were changes made to water it down?Before the Justice Department's inspector general report came out, virulently anti-Trump texts between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page had already become public — except for a particularly troubling exchange revealed by the IG for the first time. That's the one, sent in August 2016, in which Page says Trump's ""not ever going to become president, right? Right?!"" To which Stzork promises: ""No. No he's not. We'll stop it.""Less discussed, but just as important, are the texts between FBI agents identified by the IG only as ""Agent 1"" and ""Agent 5.""Both played key roles in the Clinton email ""investigation,"" both were at Clinton's interview, and both repeatedly admitted their utter disdain for Trump and their belief that the Clinton probe was a huge waste of time. In addition, there's the mysterious anti-Trump Attorney 2, who was involved with both the Clinton email and Trump Russia investigations.At a hearing on Tuesday, IG Michael Horowitz said the FBI wants the names. (Rep. Mark Meadows claims that names of two of them — Agent 5 and Attorney 2 — are Sally Moyer and Kevin Clinesmith.)After reviewing their texts, the IG concluded that all five ""brought discredit to themselves, sowed doubt about the FBI's handling of the Midyear investigation, and impacted the reputation of the FBI."" (""Midyear"" was the code name used for the Clinton email probe.)Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTheir conduct was serious enough the IG wants the FBI itself to investigate.No kidding.Here, for example, are texts sent by Agent 1 throughout FBI's alleged Clinton investigation.Just before Agent 1 interviewed Clinton, he sent a text saying: ""We have nothing — shouldn't even be interviewing. My god ... I'm actually starting to have embarrassment sprinkled on my disappointment ... Ever been forced to do something you adamantly opposed.""After conducting that interview, Agent 1 texted: ""I'm done interviewing the President"" — referring to Clinton.There's also the fact that Agent 1 found what he believed to be instances of people lying to the FBI — including Hillary Clinton — but did nothing.The IG report says that Agent 1 interviewed ""a witness who assisted the Clintons at their Chappaqua residence."" Here's the exchange after the interview:FBI Employee: ""boom ... how did the (witness) go""
"
882,SEE,"Agent 1: ""Awesome. Lied his ass off.""In addition, after interviewing Clinton, Agent 1 admitted that Clinton's claim that she didn't know what the ""C"" marking meant on a classified document was ""hard to impossible to believe.""In other words, he believed she lied.As to Agent 5, she's just as bad. At one point she texts Agent 1 referring to Trump's ""supporters like the ones from ohio that are retarded"".On Election Day, she texted that Clinton ""better win ... otherwise i'm gonna be walking around with both of my guns … and likely quitting on the spot"". Later she sent a text saying ""f(---) trump.""The IG report unearthed other such nuggets, such as the text from ""FBI Attorney 2,"" who said after the November election: ""Viva le resistance.""So who are these FBI officials? Why do they get to remain anonymous when others, like Page and Stzork, are already public? Are they still at the FBI? If so, what are they doing?This week, eight lawmakers sent a letter to the IG demanding the names.""These individuals need to be held accountable and only transparency will ensure that action,"" the letter states.Naturally, when the IG confronted these FBI officials with their texts, they all denied up and down that their views about the investigation or about Clinton and Trump in any way, shape, or form colored their efforts.Right.Yet, somehow the IG swallowed their excuses so it could report finding no bias in the investigation, a claim that stretched credulity with increasing strength the closer one looks at the report itself.Which leads to the next burning question about this report: Was it watered down by officials at Justice and the FBI who were able to review it before it got published?Earlier this month, Rep. Andy Biggs sent a letter to the IG asking to see original drafts of the report.""We are concerned that during this time, people may have changed the report in a way that obfuscates your findings,"" the letter, signed by two other congressmen, says.Meadows says he believes the FBI officials also may have altered documentation of witness interviews.Given the recent track record of these highly politicized agencies, these lawmakers are right to want to see any such changes.Meanwhile, the IG says it found ""instances where FBI employees improperly received benefits from reporters, including tickets to sporting events, golfing outings, drinks and meals, and admittance to nonpublic social events.""But the report simply states that an investigation into that troubling revelation is still ongoing. So who are these employees? And just as important, who are the journalists who were apparently buying information from them?The IG report answered plenty of questions about the FBI's Potemkin investigation into Clinton's illegal use of a private email server.But plenty of questions remain.The IG Report Shows That The Fix Was In From Start Of The Clinton Email InvestigationAnyone Notice That Trump Is Now Tied With 'Popular' Obama On Job Approval?Separating Families At The Border: The Hysteria Overlooks Some Key FactsMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

It would also help Stryker to differentiate its portfolio of technologies and compete with large companies like J&J and Medtronic (MDT).In Boston's case, the deal would cap a five-year turnaround, allowing it to ""end on a high-note,"" Canaccord analysts said.""In sum, we definitively think Boston Scientific is game to do a fair deal here,"" they said.But RBC analyst Glenn Novarro viewed the deal ""unfavorably,"" though acknowledged from a strategic rationale the it would make sense. It's also likely Boston won't OK any deal for less than $40 per share.""It would combine two of the premier growth companies in the (medical device) space, and there would be limited product overlap,"" he said. However, ""the bar for value creation is set high given the potential valuations of both companies.""A combined Stryker-Boston Scientific would have 2019 revenue of around $25 billion. It stands to grow at a sustainable 6% or higher compound annual growth rate in the medium term, Novarro said. It would have an enterprise value of about $61 billion.Canaccord analysts called the potential deal a ""merger of equals."" Stryker is only about a third larger than Boston. It could also lead to further med-tech consolidation.""If consummated, this would create four $100 billion behemoths in (medical devices) with Stryker/Boston Scientific joining Abbott (ABT), J&J and Medtronic,"" they said.

895,SEE,"For a Federal Reserve meeting where a rate hike is seen as a given, the stakes are still huge for bond traders heading into Wednesday's decision.Investors have piled into front-end wagers and curve plays betting on the timing and pace of rate increases in the second half of the year and beyond. That leaves plenty of room for market moves depending on what Fed officials signal in a few key areas. Namely, their updated dot-plot projections and a potential change to the rate paid on excess reserves.""The importance of this meeting is to get a clear picture of the what-if scenarios for 2018, as there are a lot of balls up in the air,"" said Todd Colvin, senior vice president at futures and options broker Ambrosino Brothers in Chicago.Here are the corners of the market poised for the biggest post-Fed reactions.After May's Federal Open Market Committee minutes suggested that officials might only raise the interest on excess reserves (IOER) rate by 20 basis points at an upcoming meeting, volumes across fed funds and eurodollar futures spiked as implied rates tumbled. After retracing somewhat, the July contract is now printing about 22 basis points above the Fed effective rate of 1.70%. That suggests traders see about an 80% chance of the Fed opting for the smaller IOER increase, according to John Brady, a managing director at R.J. O'Brien & Associates in Chicago.If officials do tinker with the IOER rate this week, traders will also look to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's press conference for hints as to whether policy makers intend to use that approach again, or if this time would just be a one-off.If traders are wagering on any change in the FOMC's' median projection for tightening this year, there's a good chance they're doing it using the January 2019 fed funds futures contract. It's currently trading at 97.74, or an implied rate of 2.26%. That puts it squarely between three and four hikes by year-end.Should officials' updated dot plot forecasts show them leaning toward four hikes for the year, up from the three they flagged in March, the contract should see an immediate re-pricing as the market brings its expectations more in line with the Fed's. And if the dot plot stays at three hikes for 2018? Look for the January 2019 fed funds contract to rally.In the cash market, the shape of the yield curve is riding on the meeting's outcome too.After a mid-May pause, the flattening that dominated the Treasuries market for months has roared back, sending the gap between two- and 10-year yields toward 40 basis points once again. Tom di Galoma, managing director of government trading and strategy at Seaport Global Holdings, is among those favoring flatteners heading into the Fed decision. He says it's likely the Fed will signal rates hikes for both September and December.That view has been gaining traction in the markets even as some policy makers have warned that the threat of an inverted curve may cause the Fed to dial back its tightening plans.Traders continue to be stubbornly dovish on the pace of rate increases beyond 2018 relative to policy makers' projections. With the spread between December 2018 and 2019 eurodollar contracts now at about 35 basis points, traders are pricing in roughly one-and-a-half hikes next year, should FRA-OIS remain stable. That compares to the three that policy makers are signaling in the dot plot.If firming inflation and near-record low unemployment prompt officials to forecast a steeper path of hikes down the line — just as they did in March — traders would be in store for a major shakeout.

897,SEE,"You'd think one of the oldest mutual funds would have figured out by now how to beat its benchmark on a consistent basis. And you'd be right. The $55.7 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund (PRGFX) notches top results by holding leading growth stocks like Amazon.com (AMZN), Booking Holdings (BKNG), Alibaba Group Holdings (BABA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL).Growth Stock Fund, which opened in April 1950, has beaten the S&P 500 Index for the one-year, three-year, five-year, 10-year, and 15-year annualized periods as of May 31 of this year, according to Morningstar.com. Since inception, the fund has posted an average annual return of 11.06% through May 31. That compares to an 11.3% return for the S&P 500. In the first five months of this year, the fund was up 8.54% vs. the S&P's 2.02%, and 6.73% for the large-cap growth mutual funds that are its direct rivals.Joe Fath, who's managed the fund since 2014, says holdings like Amazon, Booking, Alibaba, Microsoft and Alphabet share one key trait. ""We're looking for innovative disruptors,"" Fath said. ""It's a unique time. We're going through a powerful information revolution. Massive platform businesses are being built on top of powerful technology, and building a powerful network effect between users and platforms.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFath seeks large-caps that can become megacaps because their growth is accelerating on a very big base of business.""Google is a good example of that,"" Fath said, referring to Google's parent Alphabet. ""They've been able to grow their top line 20% (annually) for a long period of time and that continues even as the company becomes much larger. The other big thing is they don't rest on the profit pool they've created. They continue to invest and break down barriers to new areas.""So far this year, Alphabet is up about 9% while Amazon is up about 46%. Gains by Alibaba, Booking and Microsoft range in between.The fund is large-cap focused, all $10 billion or more, mostly domestic with only 8% in foreign stocks as of March 31. Still, the fund has additional international exposure through its large-cap U.S. stocks, many of which have multinational operations.To bring a stock into the fund, Fath needs to see double-digit growth in earnings and free cash flow year-over-year.Fath assesses a company's total addressable market by asking: Is it in an area ripe for disruption? Who are the new entrants? He looks for stocks where the market under-appreciates the speed, pace and durability of a company's growth.Online retailer Amazon is the fund's top holding because it's the ""perfect example"" of the innovative disruptor.""It's going into many different directions at the same time and disrupting many different parts of the marketplace,"" Fath said.The biggest area is e-commerce, driven by its Prime membership. The second is its cloud offering, Amazon Web Services. But it has other irons in the fire. The two biggest are advertising and hardware. Amazon is doing more advertising for third-party merchants that use Amazon as their storefront. It's also moving into home devices with the Alexa speaker system to compete with Google and Apple (AAPL).Fath said Booking, the online travel agent that runs Booking.com, has a powerful business model. He said it's accumulated an inordinate amount of supply in Europe by adding a lot of branded and independent hotels, as well as alternative vacation homes and bed-and-breakfasts.He said it's put pressure on aggregator travel sites such as Trivago by being more efficient with its marketing spend to drive people to its own site.Another big holding is Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. Fath said it has probably one the best business models and is very cash-flow generative. It's at the epicenter of taking advantage of China's rising middle class, which can buy more and more goods and services.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) has seen its shares rise more than 60% over the past year. First-quarter earnings per share jumped 43% as revenue and profits topped expectations. The company makes the robotic da Vinci Surgical System. Its profitability is based on the classic razor-razor blade business model. It makes money on its robotic surgical system, then creates a recurring revenue stream with additional profits through sales of service contracts and disposable items like surgical blades and other instruments and accessories.Fath also likes Nike (NKE), which has been out of favor as competitor Adidas (ADDYY) hustled its way to a resurgence in the U.S. He said Nike is beginning to ramp up its innovation engine, and will soon pump up a number of products, including its React sneaker line. Going forward, Fath said, ""We feel very good about the fundamentals.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeNew ETF Aims To Provide A steady 7% Annual Distribution Rate

898,SEE,"Peter Strzok is an FBI agent with a career spanning more than two decades. He was section chief of the counterespionage section in 2016 and thus in a position to oversee both the Hillary Clinton email investigation and the Russian election interference investigation. And he was supposedly perfect for the job: a Georgetown University graduate with a master's degree, married to a Securities and Exchange Commission official. Strzok was qualified and patriotic. He was a lifelong civil servant.He was also a heavily biased, blatantly political bureaucrat.Strzok, it turns out, was cheating on his wife with then-fellow FBI agent Lisa Page. Page and Strzok traded thousands of texts — so many that one is tempted to ask when they ever found time for their affair. The texts were extraordinarily political. Strzok hated President Trump and loved Clinton; his paramour felt the same. After the 2016 election, Strzok wrote, ""Omg I am so depressed.""Among those texts, a few stood out. First, one from Strzok to Page suggested that the Russia investigation could serve as an ""insurance policy"" against a Trump presidency. Second, in a text from Page to Strzok, she questions whether Trump would actually be president, and a response from Strzok reads, ""We'll stop it."" Third, a text from Strzok to Page after the election cycle and upon his involvement in the Robert Mueller probe reads, ""For me, and this case, I personally have a sense of unfinished business.""All of these texts — and Strzok's conduct during the election cycle — led the Department of Justice inspector general to conclude that he couldn't exonerate Strzok from the charge of bias in his investigation. The IG report stated that Strzok's texts were ""not only indicative of a biased state of mind but, even more seriously, implies a willingness to take official action to impact the presidential candidate's electoral prospects. This is antithetical to the core values of the FBI and the Department of Justice.""Here's the thing: Strzok wasn't alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt least four other FBI agents sent pro-Clinton messages throughout the Clinton investigation. One agent stated that nobody would prosecute Hillary Clinton ""even if we find unique classified"" material on former Rep. Anthony Weiner's laptop. Another texted, ""Vive le resistance"" after the election.And the IG report subtly slips in this rather shocking revelation: ""We identified numerous FBI employees, at all levels of the organization and with no official reason to be in contact with the media, who were nevertheless in frequent contact with reporters."" That contact included employees receiving ""benefits from reports,"" such as golf outings, drinks and meals.This is how bureaucratic agencies lose legitimacy: not with overt acts of evil but through the echo-chamber mentality that exists in every social setting. We all live within cliques; we all deal with a select group of people. If that select group of people thinks alike, the group tends to radicalize over time. And if there are no checks in place — if that clique has enormous power — it's easy to see how cases can get botched.This is the problem with unelected, unaccountable, nontransparent bureaucracies: They are subject to ideological perversion that they themselves may not even notice until it is too late. That's why they should be extraordinarily careful in how they wield power.Unfortunately, our law enforcement agencies aren't, and the result is a dramatic loss of trust that they can ill afford.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:The IG Report Shows That The Fix Was In From Start Of The Clinton Email Investigation

900,SEE,"When you start learning how to read stock charts, you'll have plenty of questions. What is a stock chart? What's in a chart? What's the best way to approach stock chart reading for beginners? Why even use charts?Learning how to read stock charts may seem intimidating at first. But with some basic tips and a little practice, you'll soon be using them to find winning stocks, to see how to buy stocks and to spot the right time to sell.In this first installment of our series on chart reading basics, you'll learn what's inside a stock chart. You'll also see why it's important to make chart analysis part of your regular investing routine, which can help you find breakout stocks like Nvidia (NVDA). And by using charts, you'll be able to run all your stock ideas and stock picks through a buying checklist and selling checklist.In the second installment, we cover the three key factors to look for in a chart. And in Part 3, you'll see how to spot the three most profitable chart patterns.Tip: See our free Stock Charts Decoded webinar for an overview of how to read stock charts.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe first thing to understand about charts is that they tell you a story.Is the stock being heavily bought by mutual fund managers and other large investors? Or are these so-called institutional investors dumping shares as fast as they can?Is the stock finding a floor of support from which it can keep climbing higher? Or does it keep bumping its head against a ceiling of resistance?You can literally ""see"" that story as it unfolds once you learn how to interpret the price and volume action. By the end of this series, you'll be able to do just that.The second thing to understand about charts is that if you don't use them, you're essentially investing with a blindfold. You won't be able to see what's really happening with the stock.We all know share prices go up and down every day. But it's only by using charts that you can keep those fluctuations in perspective and understand whether it's time to buy, sell or hold.An investor who doesn't use charts is the same as an orthopedic doctor who doesn't use X-rays, or a cardiologist who doesn't hook up patients to an EKG machine.Doctors use these tools to spot patterns and anomalies, and to make a proper diagnosis. Savvy investors use charts for essentially the same reason. They help you understand the true health of a stock, and to spot timely buy and sell signals.So be sure to arm yourself with the tools of the trade. As IBD founder William J. O'Neil says, ""Fortunes are made every year by people who learn to properly read charts.""Here's a quick overview of the basic chart elements and related concepts. As you go through them, be sure to scroll down and check out the charts below for an explanation of the main elements you'll find inside IBD stock charts.Price And VolumeIBD charts are divided into two main areas: price and volume (i.e., the number of shares traded).It's critical that you look at price and volume together in order to understand the ""story"" a chart is telling. If you only look at changes in the share price, it doesn't tell you how serious the buying or selling is.For example, if a stock falls 2% one day, you might get nervous. But if the volume is far below average, it could be a sign that the larger investors who really drive the market are not selling aggressively. They're sitting tight, and maybe you should, too.Conversely, if a stock shows a nice gain but the number of shares traded is unusually low, that could mean it's just a head fake. If big investors were aggressively scooping up shares, you'd see a big spike in volume.These types of telltale clues — which you can only spot by using charts — let you see what is really going on with the stock.Moving Average LinesThe moving average lines simply track the share price movement over a set period of time. But they are absolutely crucial to understanding if a stock is being enthusiastically supported — or aggressively sold — by large investors.It's the big mutual fund managers and other institutional investors who have the buying power to push a stock sharply higher — or lower. And these money managers often use the moving averages as a point where they step in to protect and add to their positions.But watch out if a stock fails to find support at a key moving average like the 10-week or 50-day line. When a stock crashes below those benchmarks in heavy volume, it often means the stock has fallen out of favor with the big players.So always watch how your stocks behave when they're trading around their moving averages. Based on how they act, you'll know if it's time to buy, sell or just sit tight.Relative Strength LineWant a quick way to instantly see if your stock is a leader or a laggard? Check the relative strength (RS) line, which compares a stock's price performance to that of the S&P 500.A sharply rising RS line tells you the stock is outperforming the general market. An RS line that's trending down shows the stock is lagging the market.When a stock is nearing a potential breakout, look for the RS line to be rising and approaching or in new-high ground. Such action is a bullish sign of market leadership as a stock tries to launch a new run.What's In A Weekly Stock Chart?What's In A Daily Stock Chart?Newer investors often ask, Should I use daily or weekly charts? What's the difference between the two?The short answer is use both.The weekly chart gives you a longer-term perspective on the stock and its underlying trend. It also helps smooth out the daily price fluctuations so you can stay grounded and not get overly swayed by day-to-day volatility.The daily chart gives you a valuable look at the price and volume action at specific, time-sensitive moments, such as on the day of a breakout or when a stock is testing its 50-day line. On those occasions, the shorter-term daily charts help reveal the current ""story"" and what action you should take.So be sure look at both the weekly and daily charts. You can easily switch between the two using IBD Charts.In the next installment in this series on how to read stock charts, we'll go over in more detail the three key factors to look for in a chart: current trend, price and volume action, and support and resistance.Once you understand those concepts, you'll be ready to spot — and profit from — chart patterns like the cup with handle, double bottom and flat base.In the meantime, use the links below to immediately start improving your chart reading skills:Chart Reading For Beginners: 3 Telltale Clues To Look For In Your StocksChart Reading For Beginners: How To Spot The 3 Most Profitable Chart PatternsHow To Buy Stocks | When To Sell StocksImprove Your Investing Results With This Simple 3-Step RoutineRelated Books: How To Make Money In Stocks — Getting Started | Success Stories

901,SEE,"BofI Holding (BOFI) won't stop evolving — simply because it can't afford to stand still.XAs online banking booms, BofI's roster of rivals now spans everything from credit unions to other banks. The roster includes stalwarts such as Ally Financial (ALLY) and CIT Group (CIT), as well as the upstart Marcus brand from venerable Wall Street brokerage Goldman Sachs (GS).Analyst Gary Tenner at D.A. Davidson commends BofI's asset strategy. It has grown from ""rate shoppers"" to encompass a diverse mix of spread-income and fee-income businesses.""BofI is always evolving, always eliminating bottlenecks from a process and cost perspective,"" Tenner said. ""This is a company that has very effectively navigated the last several years of growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs an example, San Diego-based BofI decided six years ago to expand from mortgage lending to commercial lending. Other banks had made similar moves after the housing crisis, but BofI quickly shifted. It moved from cash-flow-based loans, which offer little downside credit protection. And it went to real-estate-backed and asset-backed lending, which provide 40% to 50% downside protection.BofI then expanded into equipment financing for construction companies and bridge lending for real estate developers. Commercial and industrial loans jumped from $46 million as of June 2012 to roughly $1.4 billion as of March. That's 17% of BofI's total $8.2 billion loan portfolio. Single-family and multifamily mortgage lending account for a combined 72% of that fast-growing portfolio.""The growth of our (commercial and industrial) lending has enhanced our asset generation capabilities without compromising our pristine credit profile, and has provided another bridge to a more diversified loan portfolio in the years ahead,"" BofI's 2017 annual report said. The company did not respond to an interview request.Tenner highlights BofI's ability to ""pivot"" as one of its strengths. He noted it is in the midst of a rebranding exercise, for which few details are known.BofI Holding roots reach back to Bank of Internet, a pioneer of online consumer banking. It was one of the first banks to ditch brick-and-mortar stores entirely, greatly reducing costs. It's now a full-service financial institution, serving both consumers and businesses. Its BofI Federal Bank holding finances single and multifamily homes. It also targets small to medium businesses.BofI stock sits 4% below a record high of 45.18, pegged on June 11. Shares were off 1.4% to 42.93 in afternoon trades Friday, just below buy range with a 43.60 flat-base entry. They found support at the 50-day moving average last week after longtime partner H&R Block's (HRB) flat-to-lower revenue guidance for 2019 sparked a sell-off.Year to date, the small-cap BofI stock has surged 46% and earns a stellar IBD Composite Rating of 95. By comparison, S&P 500 financials are down 2% so far in 2018, including an 11% loss for Goldman Sachs.In a June 13 note to clients, Tenner described the recent BofI stock sell-off as likely overdone. While BofI offers refund advance loans to H&R Block customers, he does not see ""outsized risk to BofI's tax season revenue"" from the growing trend of do-it-yourself tax preparation. Borrowers repay the interest-free loans — a new product and growth driver for BofI — using their tax refunds.BofI has grown from under $950 million in assets in 2007 to just shy of $10 billion. It's done so by adding distribution channels and making acquisitions such as H&R Block Bank in 2015. It's also launched new businesses and products.Asset quality remains strong, with total nonperforming loans and leases at 0.39% of total assets as of March. But the company significantly jacked up its loan loss provision in the March quarter. The bank says that was due almost entirely to reserves for refund advance loans.In its April quarterly report, BofI posted a 27% jump in earnings to 80 cents a share on strong consumer and commercial loan production. Assets swelled to $9.9 billion as of March, up 15% from a year ago. Net income hit $51.3 million, up 25%, and deposits reached $7.9 billion, up 17%.Analysts on average expect earnings of $2.51 a share for fiscal 2018, ending in June. It's seen ramping up 29% to $3.23 in fiscal 2019, according to Zacks Investment Research. Revenue should grow 13% to $505 million over the same period.Tenner forecasts earnings of $3.20 a share in fiscal 2019, with BofI's growth outpacing like-sized banks. This underpins his buy rating and $50 price target over the next 12 to 18 months.So, too, does the macro outlook for financial companies.""We are in a banking environment that is certainly much more friendly than it has been in the better part of a decade,"" Tenner said in a phone interview with Investor's Business Daily on June 13. On that day, a hawkish Fed raised interest rates and signaled two more hikes this year, citing inflation. For banks such as BofI, rising rates accompanied by economic growth are good news. As interest rates rise, so does the spread between long-term and short-term rates. That boosts profits on both cash holdings and loans to customers.In fact, BofI's net interest margin expanded to 4.77% in the March 2018 quarter vs. 4.24% a year ago, on the back of refund advance loan growth.Still, the road ahead could be bumpy for BofI stock.""Deposit gathering is probably their biggest challenge,"" said Scott Valentin, managing director at Compass Point. Valentin noted the number of online rivals has ""dramatically"" increased.As it fends off intense competition, the company continues to invest heavily in product development, hiring talent and branding, analysts say.While Ally Bank and CIT Bank pose a threat, Goldman Sachs' Marcus is undergoing rapid growth that mimics BofI. Marcus an online banking platform racked up more than $3 billion in loans and $22 billion in deposits since its October 2016 launch. But it's consumer-focused, for now.Meanwhile, websites such as Bankrate.com have made rate comparison shopping easier than ever. With interest rates ticking up, Valentin is watching how BofI will offset the rising cost of deposits.""BofI will continue to be an asset growth story, I'm confident about that,"" he told IBD. ""The bigger question is the margin story, the cost-of-funds side in a rising-rate environment."" For now, based on soaring BofI stock, investors may be focused on the loan growth story. BofI is growing loans in the ""low-to-mid-teens"" rate, while the industry average is in the low single digits, according to Valentin.BofI stock posted only one down week as the market corrected in February. More recently, it has continued to hold up, while JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and the nation's biggest banks struggled amid rate-hike uncertainties.However, D.A. Davidson's Tenner ties some of BofI's rally to short covering, saying negative blog coverage made it a ""heavily shorted"" stock. Short-sellers try to profit from a decline in a company's shares.BofI faces a number of whistleblower and shareholder lawsuits, contending Bank of Internet engaged in wrongdoing as it grew at breakneck pace. In a 2015 interview with the New York Times, Chief Executive Gregory Garrabrants called the allegations groundless.The shareholder lawsuit suffered a setback in May. The company heads back to court a year from now in the original whistleblower case, according to a recent update from the law firm Proskauer Rose.Meanwhile, Valentin downgraded BofI stock to neutral in May.He called that primarily a valuation call, saying the discount at which BofI trades vs. high-growth peers had narrowed.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:PayPal Buddies Up To Visa, Mastercard — And New Accounts Roll InBest HSA Providers By Fees, Features And Investment OptionsHow To Invest In Stocks For Free: New Apps Aim For Beginners

906,SEE,"Biotech funds tacked on $76 million this week, adding to more than $500 million in net inflows over the past two weeks — a phenomenon biotech stocks haven't seen in nine months.But activity within exchange-traded funds lent a heavy helping hand. Outside ETFs, the flow of biotech funds was negative, Raymond James analyst Laura Chico said. Still, overall biotech net assets increased 0.11% as ""all equities"" saw net outflows representing 0.13% in total assets.Chico questioned whether three weeks could make a trend. The once red-hot biotech group stood eighth out of 197 industry groups tracked by Investor's Business Daily just 13 weeks ago. It slid to the 32nd slot four weeks ago and today it's ranked No. 17.""Staying in the black for yet another week,"" Chico said in a note. ""This follows two consecutive weeks of net inflows of about $546 million, a trend not seen since September 2017.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UsePiper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond noted the three-week trend in net inflows could signal a change in biotech stocks' fortunes. The data represent 101 healthcare and biotech funds with $73 billion in collective assets.""As we see it, this is a key dynamic to monitor as periods of net inflows historically correspond with biotech outperformance while periods of net outflows correspond with sector underperformance,"" he said in a report.Amid the biotech stocks' performance, all equities saw outflows for the second week running, he said. This marks the third week of outflows across all equities out of the past nine weeks.But year to date, biotech funds remain negative with net outflows at about $2 billion, Raymond James' Chico said. Quarter to date, biotech funds have seen about $34 million in net inflows.""The second quarter historically has been a more variable period for biotech fund flows with $2 billion in net outflows in 2016 and $1.3 billion in net inflows in 2017,"" she said.Activity within biotech ETFs didn't change this week. Considering the breadth of ETF activity in the biotech group, this is ""a key metric to watch,"" Chico said.The ProShares Ultra Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (BIB) climbed 1.9% this week. It's consolidating with an entry point at 69.72. The iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology Index (IBB) rose 1%, moving closer to a buy point at 119.40. Shares of the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) were flat this week.On the stock market today, biotech stocks tracked by IBD were close to flat. Shares within three major biotech ETFs dipped less than 1%.Excluding the impact of ETFs, biotech funds have seen just four weeks of inflows since the start of 2018. None of those weeks were in the second quarter, Chico said.""We continue to see biotech sector being influenced by several drivers: data readouts, commercial execution, (mergers and acquisitions) potential and capital market accessibility,"" she said. ""Biotech fund inflows — including ETF activity — remain a key driver to watch.""RELATED:Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

910,SEE,"In the wake of Comcast (CMCSA) making a higher, all-cash bid for 21st Century Fox (FOXA), Disney (DIS) is expected to add cash to its offer for the entertainment conglomerate, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, Pivotal Research Group downgraded Disney stock to sell from hold, citing the risk from paying more for Fox.Disney agreed in late 2017 to acquire Fox's entertainment and studio assets for over $52 billion. But Comcast's $65 billion cash bid represents a 19% premium to Disney's bid. Comcast is more confident that its deal would pass antitrust muster after AT&T (T) got a federal judge's OK last week to close its Time Warner acquisition.Disney shares finished 1.6% lower at 107.06 in the stock market today. Disney stock remains above its 50-day and 200-day averages after retaking both lines in recent weeks.Comcast stock sank 3.8%, testing its 50-day and still well below its 200-day line. Fox stock dipped 0.2%.Comcast is in a separate sparring match with Fox over Europe-based broadcaster Sky: Comcast in April offered $31 billion for Sky, in which Fox holds a 39% stake. Fox had in late 2016 bid 10.75 euros a share for the remaining part of Sky that it did not already own.The battle for Fox's assets includes its movie and TV studios, certain TV networks such as FX and National Geographic, Fox's regional sports networks, certain international properties, as well as Fox's current stake in Sky and Hulu.Both Disney and Comcast see the need for more content to compete with Netflix and others. Disney plans to launch a streaming channel in 2019, taking on Netflix (NFLX). Meanwhile, Disney and Comcast would hold a majority share of Hulu via a Fox purchase.Fox said in December that it will spin off its remaining news and sports networks — including Fox News, Fox Business, Fox Sports and Fox Broadcasting Company — into a new ""Fox.""Analysts at Pivotal Research Group downgraded Disney on the Fox negotiations.If the Fox purchase price rises due to the Disney-Comcast bidding war, then ""Disney's value would be negatively impacted as it would reduce the incremental value the company should be able to generate from synergies associated with the acquisition,"" wrote Pivotal's Brian Wieser, in a note acquired by Fast Company.Elsewhere in the media realm, Viacom (VIAB) shares advanced 1%.

913,SEE,"SAN FRANCISCO — A top SEC official said Thursday that Bitcoin and Ethereum are not securities, adding that a key point in deciding whether a coin is a security is whether a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized.XNot being securities means transactions in Bitcoin and Ethereum aren't subject to SEC rules.""(When) purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security,"" said William Hinman, the head of the SEC's division of corporate finance, at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.However this also means that initial coin offerings, which have in the past been launched by centralized teams, could fall under SEC rules.This is because initial investors could be buying coins in the belief they can profit when they go public and increase in value. In addition, at such an early stage they are not sufficiently decentralized.Bitcoin, which has been falling in recent days, was up 5.5% at $6,645.48 late Thursday, according to Coindesk. Ethereum jumped 9.1% to $519.51. Among Bitcoin-related stocks, Riot Blockchain (RIOT) rose 3.9% on the stock market today, Overstock.com (OSTK) gained 3.3%, Marathon Patent Group (MARA) added 2.5%, and Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied 9.25%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe SEC had indicated in the past that Bitcoin was not a security, but this was the first time an official has said the same about Ethereum, whose status was in question after it was launched by a core group of creators.""Putting aside the fundraising that accompanied the creation of Ether, based on my understanding of the present state of Ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of Ether are not securities transactions,"" Hinman said.He also said applying the disclosure regime of federal securities laws to current transactions in Ethereum ""would seem to add little value.""Meanwhile, TruStory founder and CEO Preethi Kasireddy, whose young company uses tokens to incentivize users to uncover ICO scams, thinks the SEC has made the correct decision.However, she said there will be more trouble in the future, as she believes the SEC will have a ""hard time figuring out what's a security and what's not.""And she predicted cryptocurrency prices have much further to fall, and the drops so far this year are ""minor"" compared to what is to come.""I thought correction would be a lot more,"" she said. ""I think there'll be an even bigger correction.""Legal experts at the event welcomed the SEC's clarification. Grant Fondo, who chairs the digital currency and blockchain practice at the Goodwin Procter law firm, said it will help him structure potential token sales.He also believes more clarification will help America become more competitive in the cryptocurrency space.""I do think now more token sales (will) stay in the United States,"" he said. But ""it's a long way to see how it plays out. In the last six months there has been a big push offshore; hopefully this will help people come home.""However, it still remains an open question whether cryptocurrencies are actually good investments.Venture capital giant Keith Rabois, who is known for startup investments and his executive roles at the likes of PayPal (PYPL) and Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn, said there are ""no clear use cases at the moment.""The Kholsa Ventures managing director also said it is difficult to pick the best digital currency just now, when it is still unknown which has either a clear use or the best underlying technology.He added that it has been clear for a ""very long time"" that large swathes of ICOs have been violating U.S. securities laws.But Baiju Bhatt, co-CEO of the Robinhood investment app, said he believes that in the future cryptocurrencies will be an ""awesome store of value,"" though he said it is too early to pick a winner.""Don't believe the hype, pay attention to the details. There is going to be a lot of good that comes out of this,"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency News And TrendsIBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

928,SEE,"The majority of America's biggest banks are expected to pay shareholders more than they earn for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis, despite this year's tougher stress test, and the likes of JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Wells Fargo (WFC) are leading the charge.XThe Federal Reserve will report Dodd-Frank stress-test results on Thursday, showing which banks' capital holdings passed or failed regulators' scenarios of economic downturns. The following Thursday, June 28, the Fed will release the results of its Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which determines how much capital the banks are allowed to return to shareholders.While individual banks have paid out more than they earned, this would be the first time since 2008 that it has happened at a majority of the top banks. Analysts at Goldman Sachs expect 13 out of the 25 banks it follows to be approved to pay out more than they earn over the next four quarters. Credit Suisse and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods also forecast the majority of banks will be allowed to hand over more capital than they make in profit.Goldman expects State Street (STT), Wells Fargo and Northern Trust (NTRS) to be able to increase payout ratios the most among large-cap and trust banks. Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America are seen increasing capital return dollars the most vs. 2017.Analysts expect banks to spend more on dividends and buybacks despite the Federal Reserve's stricter stress test this year.Under this year's scenario, the decline in the nation's GDP would bottom out at 7.5% below the pre-recession peak, compared with 6.5% last year. Stock prices would plunge by 65% early next year, while last year's tests outlined a 50% drop through 2017.Shares of JPMorgan were up 0.3% on the stock market today despite a broad sell-off. Bank of America added 0.4% and Wells Fargo rose 0.2%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNot everyone is quite so bullish, however, with the likes of Barclays, Jefferies and Raymond James seeing the average payout approaching the 100% mark but not exceeding it.But this would still represent a bumper increase in payouts. In addition, analysts widely see the average dividend as coming out at around the 30% mark.Barclays has estimated that shareholders of 22 of the top banks will receive $170 billion in dividends and buybacks, about a quarter more than in 2017.There are three main reasons cited for the increased payouts: large excess capital cushions, low payout ratios in 2017, and large positive earnings impacts from tax reform.Financial institutions have been raking in billions of dollars in additional profits thanks to lower taxes and rising interest rates.It had been expected when the stress-test guidelines were released in February that the GOP's new tax law would be a beneficial offset to the stricter demands.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Why Tougher Bank Stress Test May Not Hurt Dividends, BuybacksIBD Stock Of The Day: Bank To The Tech Stars Sets Up Swing Trade, Add-On Chances Stock Indexes Shake Off Trump's Trade War, Trim LossesStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

929,SEE,"Sellers still held the upper hand in stocks today as the Nasdaq composite and the Dow Jones industrial average fell between 0.6% and 0.7%. At 3 p.m. ET, the S&P 500 dropped 0.5% and is poised to make its first weekly loss after rising four weeks in a row. But New York Times defied the sell-off with a new breakout.Hot new China IPO iQiyi (IQ), meanwhile, sold off sharply. The video streaming firm fell more than 10% to 39.51, showing its biggest single-session point loss since breaking out of a narrow IPO base at 20.60.When stocks have made many months of gains and are in a climax run, that would be a sell signal. IQiyi's advance doesn't quite fit that profile, but its slide today is reason to take at least some profits in an offense-minded way.IQiyi also gave short-term traders a potential sell signal after the stock dipped below its 10-day moving average near 38.78 for the first time since its breakout. At one point, iQiyi fell as much as 14.5% to a session low of 37.80. You can see the 10-day moving average as a thin green line on a Leaderboard chart.Among fast-rising growth stocks, the 10-day line often acts as a better indicator of when a leader is ready to take a pause. When a stock has risen more than 10% from a proper buy point, then sharply undercuts the 10-day moving average, it can act as a timely sell signal for short-term traders.The small-cap S&P 600 did slightly worse than the major averages, falling roughly 0.8%. But at 1044, the S&P 600 continues to outmatch the S&P 500 in year-to-date gains, up 11.5% vs. a 3% advance since Jan. 1 for the large-cap benchmark.With less than hour to go in stocks today, volume is running a touch lower on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Wednesday and roughly 5% lower on the NYSE.One small cap in the media space broke out. New York Times (NYT) rallied nearly 5% to hit a high of 26.50. Shares cleared a four-month flat base, a key chart pattern for growth stock investors, at 25.80 in average trade. The permissible buy zone goes up to 27.09.Buying too far extended in price puts an investor at higher risk of being shaken out during a normal pullback by the stock after it breaks out.According to IBD Stock Checkup, NYT's Composite Rating has improved to a respectable 86 on a scale of 1 to 99. Plus, that score is tops within the Media-Newspapers industry group. The next best company is New Media Investment Group (NEWM), owning a mediocre 71 Composite score.NYT logged an 8% increase in the top line to $1.68 billion in 2017. That marked only the second time in at least nine years that the company's sales increased on a year-over-year basis. More recently, NYT has shown a big turnaround in earnings.Profits grew 64%, 117%, 30% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. Easy comparisons helped the cause. Revenue grew 9%, 6%, 10% and 4% over the same time frame. That falls well short of the C factor in IBD's CAN SLIM seven-point investment paradigm. The best stocks tend to show earnings and sales increases of 25% or higher in recent quarters.New Media Investment recently broke out of a 10-week flat base with an 18.05 buy point. At 18.82, the small cap is 4% past that correct entry, or still within the proper buy zone.New Media has grown revenue by 18% and 11% in the prior two quarters, the biggest gains since the first quarter of 2016.Retail internet companies got thumped after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states have broad authority to enforce the collection of sales taxes by online retail companies doing business in their jurisdiction. Stamps.com (STMP) slid more than 11% in quadruple normal share turnover and briefly undercut its 50-day moving average.Leaderboard name Etsy (ETSY), the global online marketplace for arts and crafts entrepreneurs, hit a new high of 45.88 but reversed to a 1.6% decline. Volume is running twice its 50-day average.Big declines in heavier than normal volume are a telltale sign of pronounced institutional selling.Etsy, which holds a top-notch 99 Composite Rating, has already rallied more than 45% since vaulting off its 50-day moving average near 29.18 in late May.Shares are also up more than 108% since clearing a cup without handle at 21.96 on Feb. 21, one week after the market staged a Day 4 follow-through and signaled a new market uptrend was possibly in play.The automaker group fared among the 10 worst performers in IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups.Ferrari (RACE) gapped lower at the open and skidded 2%. At 140.32, the maker of luxury sports cars is now slightly below a 141.66 buy point in a five-week flat base.Tesla (TSLA) fell nearly 3% but is still finding a floor of potential support at the 350 level. Shares of the electric-vehicle pioneer continue to sail well past its rising 50-day moving average, which has recently risen back above 300.The stock continues to work on a large first-stage base.While the Street sees the company losing $6.82 a share this year, it also expects Tesla to turn a profit of $2.52 a share in 2019.In other financial markets, investors bought back long-dated U.S. Treasuries.

GE stock, leaving the Dow Jones after 111 years, has lost half its value over the past year as the industrial conglomerate slashed its profit outlook and halved its dividend. A long-awaited decision about GE's future could come this month, CNBC said Thursday, as GE stock made a new longtime low of 12.61. As GE looks to shrink its portfolio, slash costs and shed $20 billion in assets, it could even split off core divisions, such as power, health and aviation, into separately traded companies.Micron Technology and Smart Global Holdings (SGH) both topped estimates for their fiscal third quarters. But while Micron guided higher for the current quarter, Smart Global gave a mixed outlook with in-line earnings on better-than-expected sales.

The cartel will increase the official production target by 1 million barrels per day. The actual boost will likely be around 600,000 bpd as some members like Venezuela are unable to ramp up. Oil prices and stocks, which had trended lower ahead of the meeting, rebounded Friday. Crude futures rose more than 5% for the week to $68.58 a barrel, with the most of the gains coming Friday.

But Disney followed with a $38-a-share offer of $71 billion in cash and stock, up from an all-stock bid of $28 a share. Comcast is expected to counter again.

Martin Tripp , who worked at the Nevada Gigafactory as a process technician, claims he is a whistleblower.

Rising mortgage rates have hit affordability and seem to have slowed the increase in home prices. The FHFA house price index edged up just 0.1% in April and 6.4% from a year ago, slowing from 7.4% earlier this year.

931,SEE,"SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft (MSFT) believes 2018 will be the year when blockchain finally goes mainstream.XMark Russinovich, chief technology officer for the software giant's Azure cloud platform, said a whole range of industries are on the cusp of introducing the electronic ledger technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.""People have been saying for the last couple of years it will be the year of production blockchain for enterprises, and I think this year we're actually starting to see them go into production,"" he told IBD Thursday at the Yahoo Finance All Markets Summit: Crypto.Blockchain stores information chronologically in ""blocks"" to allow for the efficient and nearly instantaneous processing and transfer of data. According to Russinovich, just about every enterprise will be using it in one way or another in the years to come.""I think this is the beginning of the point where now these technologies are becoming mainstream enough, people understand it enough, that they can begin to deploy it,"" he said. ""I expect this to grow pretty rapidly in the next couple of years.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe sees the key benefits for businesses as being the reduction in the chance of fraud (as the technology is extremely difficult to hack), the reduction of waste and the elimination of middlemen.The executive said his firm has been working with ""dozens of companies""to develop usable applications for blockchain, including Wall Street giants such as Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). The company has now rolled out tools to simplify the process of deploying the technology for customers.And he highlighted two companies that have been making great strides in blockchain: industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM) and Australian travel firm Webjet.""3M are doing it to track the provenance of pharmaceuticals, to make sure that when a customer gets it they can verify it came from a reputable source. There's so much fraud in the pharmaceutical industry,"" Russinovich said during a speech at the Yahoo Finance event.Blockchain offered Webjet a way to streamline a typically cumbersome process. The firm found that during a single transaction, like a hotel room going to an end user, five smaller transactions are involved. And that is only the beginning of the problems.""They found that roughly 1 in 10 of those transactions require some kind of manual intervention because of a problem along the way. In roughly 1 in 25, someone on that chain doesn't get paid. So there's a lot of loss, and there is also a lot of fraud,"" Russinovich said. ""They've turned to operationalizing blockchain on top of an Ethereum platform on Azure and created a network called Reschain. It's a reservation blockchain network that they say reduces, for their internal properties, the level of intervention by over 90%.""Microsoft has two key products for the deployment of blockchain at the enterprise level. The first is the Workbench platform, which provides an interface that allows business users to construct solutions that suit their needs. It provides prebuilt networks and infrastructure.The second product is the Coco Framework, which allows companies to use blockchain while keeping their data private. This is important, as it allows companies to retain the confidentiality of their dealings with various suppliers and customers.Russinovich believes Microsoft is leading the way on blockchain over cloud space rivals such as Amazon.com (AMZN), and he said customers have provided encouraging feedback on their offerings.""Response has been great. It's been really resonating because this is exactly what they have been looking for,"" he said. ""It's Software-as-a-Service basically.

935,SEE,"""This,"" exclaimed Margaret Thatcher, thumping Friedrich Hayek's 500-page tome ""The Constitution of Liberty"" on a table in front of some Conservative Party colleagues, ""is what we believe."" It also is what Bill Weld believes, which is why he aspires to be the Libertarian Party's 2020 presidential candidate.The former twice-elected Republican governor of Massachusetts has been visiting Libertarian Party state conventions and will be in New Orleans at the national convention June 30 — July 3. There he will try to convince the party, which sometimes is too interested in merely sending a message (liberty is good), to send into the autumn of 2020 a candidate representing what a broad swath of Americans say they favor — limited government, fiscal responsibility, free trade, the rule of law, entitlement realism and other artifacts from the Republican wreckage.Once when a Democrat noted that Weld's ancestors had arrived on the Mayflower, Weld replied, ""Actually, they weren't on the Mayflower. They sent the servants over first to get the cottage ready."" He was the 19th Weld — the first was in the Class of 1650 — to graduate from Harvard. Since then, the 20th and 21st have attended — two of the five children he had with his first wife, Theodore Roosevelt's great-granddaughter. Two Harvard buildings are named for Welds. One of which John Kennedy lived as a freshman.Bill Weld, who majored in classics, took philosophy classes from Robert Nozick, whose ""Anarchy, State and Utopia,"" a canonical text of libertarianism, argues that ""the minimal state is inspiring as well as right."" Weld served in Ronald Reagan's administration for seven years, five years as U.S. attorney for Massachusetts. He was recommended for this position by then-Associate U.S. Attorney General Rudy Giuliani, which was not Weld's fault. Next, Weld was head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. There he brought from San Francisco, as his replacement in Massachusetts, a man ""who might be the straightest guy I've ever met,"" Robert Mueller.Weld's sandy-reddish hair is still abundant and, at 72, he is eager to build on his 2016 experience as the Libertarians' vice-presidential nominee. During that campaign, ""I carried around with me every day"" the 10th Amendment: ""The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people."" Noting that the Articles of Confederation excellently referred to powers not ""expressly"" delegated, Weld says, ""I might have been an anti-Federalist."" Imagine having a president who knows that there were anti-Federalists.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe top of the Libertarians' 2016 ticket was another ex-governor, New Mexico's Gary Johnson, who was too interested in marijuana and not interested enough in Syria to recognize the name Aleppo. Weld, however, is ready for prime time.During a recent breakfast at the Hay-Adams hotel across Lafayette Square from the White House (the Adamses reached these shores shortly after the Welds), Weld recalled how as governor he taught agencies to not expect ""last year's appropriation plus 5%."" He cut taxes 21 times and raised none. A believer in freedom for what Nozick called ""capitalist acts between consenting adults,"" Weld says his most satisfying achievement was cutting the 6% tax on long-term capital gains by 1 point for each year the asset is held.If the florid face of today's snarling GOP wants to be re-nominated, he will be. Five-hundred days into his presidency he had 87% approval among Republicans, 10 points above Ronald Reagan's rating at 500 days. And in the autumn of 2019, upward of 20 Democratic presidential aspirants might clog the stages at ""debates"" that could become contests to see who can most arrestingly pander to activists — a disproportionate slice of the nominating electorate — who are enamored of ""Medicare for all,"" government-guaranteed jobs, and generally gobs of free stuff (college tuition, etc.).If in autumn 2020 voters face a second consecutive repulsive choice, there will be running room between the two deplorables. Because of its 2016 efforts, the Libertarian Party will automatically be on 39 states' ballots this fall and has a sufficient infantry of volunteers to secure ballot access in another nine.So, if the Libertarian Party is willing, 2020's politics could have an ingredient recently missing from presidential politics: fun. And maybe a serious disruption of the party duopoly that increasing millions find annoying. Stranger things have happened, as a glance across Lafayette Square confirms.Other columns by George WillMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

940,SEE,"Tesla kept charging higher and continued to work on its new base, while software companies also helped sustain the Nasdaq composite's leadership in stocks today. Meanwhile, the market presents at least four new reasons why investors should stay bullish on growth stocks.The tech-rich Nasdaq composite gained more than 0.5%.At that level, the premier index for growth stocks has now climbed 509% from its March 2009 low of 1265.The S&P 500, hampered by sell-offs in the ship transport, meat, oil drilling, mortgage services, and aerospace and defense industries, was mostly flat after rising nearly 0.3% intraday. The Dow Jones industrial average edged about 0.2% lower. Volume was running mildly higher vs. the same time on Monday on both main exchanges.Kirby (KEX), part of IBD's fourth-ranked Transport-Ship industry group, sailed sharply lower. Shares dropped as much as 4.7% to an intraday low of 86.05 and undercut the key 50-day moving average for the first time since it broke out of a seven-week flat base at 81 in April.The stock is a member of the IBD Leaderboard stock-picking service and one of two Leaders list stocks that are linked to the oil and gas industry. The other stock, Marathon Oil (MRO), is a half-position stock on Leaderboard and is treading sideways after rising 18% past an 18.76 proper buy point.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

This Investor's Corner discusses how a big undercut of the 50-day moving average (see a daily chart) or the 10-week line (weekly chart) can present a timely sell signal to lock in gains.The positive step forward toward a goal of a nuclear-weapon-free Korean Peninsula is hurting names such as Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and L3 Communications (LLL).Raytheon, down 2.5%, has been cooling off beneath its 50-day moving average. Watch for a new potential base to form.Meanwhile, futures traders are counting a virtually 100% probability that the Federal Reserve will execute another quarter-point hike in short-term interest rates on Wednesday. The U.S. central bank has been raising rates since December 2015, when the fed funds rate rose to a target range of 0.25%-0.5%.Tesla (TSLA), as noted in this recent Stock Market Today column, is still fashioning the right side of a brand-new base. However, the stock is still feeling the overhead supply of sellers near 350, a critical level of upside price resistance. At 341, the stock is now less than 13% below its all-time peak of 389.61.Sentiment appears to be warming to the high possibility that the electric-vehicle pioneer is getting past serious difficulty in ramping up Model 3 production. On Tuesday, CEO Elon Musk announced a 9% cut in total staff, centered on salaried employees. A company memo to employees said that no production associates got laid off.The company seeks to get profitable while also meeting the tremendous demand for its entry-level all-electric car. The planned staff cuts should reduce total headcount to 37,000.Tesla shares show a terrible Relative Price Strength Rating of 25 on a scale of 1 to 99. But as seen in IBD Stock Checkup, the Accumulation/Distribution Rating has improved to a B on a scale of A to E. A rating above the neutral C grade means that over the past 13 weeks, institutions have likely been accumulating the stock on net.In IBD's automakers group, only Ferrari (RACE) and General Motors (GM) show better Accumulation/Distribution ratings than Tesla at A- each. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see Tesla swinging from a net loss of $6.82 a share in 2018 to a net profit of $2.46 a share in 2019. Both estimates have recently moved up.Meanwhile, the market is showing at least four new reasons why the stock market's six-year bull run (after a 20%-plus correction in 2011) may have more room to run.One, market breadth continues to improve. The Nasdaq's advance-decline line has been climbing for five straight weeks. This means that more stocks are advancing than declining. This also means that more high-rated stocks stand a chance of breaking out.Two, the new highs list remains robust. As seen in Monday's IBD-screened list, a total 325 stocks on the Nasdaq and NYSE hit 52-week or all-time highs, swamping the 42 names making new lows. More stocks hitting new highs boost the probability of breakouts.Three, leading stocks are outperforming the major indexes.Among the top 10-ranked names in the IBD 50, the average gain approached 3%.Four, investor sentiment is not wildly optimistic. On Tuesday, the put-call volume ratio stood at 0.68. During the March 2000 tech market top, this ratio of bearish put options to bullish call options sank beneath 0.4. Such a low ratio pointed to a severe evaporation of bearish sentiment among options traders.The Investors Intelligence report on newsletter editors also shows the bullish ratio at 52.9%, well below its mid-January peak of 66%. That high reading preceded the early-February sell-off.RELATED:Key Psychological Market IndicatorsThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerWhich Stocks Are New To Sector Leaders, IPO Leaders, IBD 50?

946,SEE,"Americans' long-running joke about a Starbucks (SBUX) on every corner may be nearing its end.The coffee behemoth is retrenching in its home market as it contends with sales growth that Chief Executive Officer Kevin Johnson acknowledges isn't fast enough. The cafe chain said Tuesday it expects comparable sales to rise just 1% globally for the current quarter—the worst performance in about nine years. That's well below the 2.9% analysts were expecting, according to Consensus Metrix.Starbucks also plans to close about 150 company-operated stores in densely penetrated U.S. markets next fiscal year, three times the number it historically shuts down annually.""Our growth has slowed a bit,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""I expect better, I think our shareholders deserve better, and we're committed to address that.""At the same time, the company appears headed for a tough quarter in China, with comparable sales flat or slightly negative in the current period, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw said in a presentation. China remains a key market for Starbucks, with the chain betting that revenue there will triple over the next five years.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlthough business abroad has been booming and the chain has been opening more and more cafes, U.S. sales growth has stalled for the company that brought espresso to the masses. With about 14,000 stores domestically, Starbucks is now pumping the brakes on licensed and company-operated locations, with a renewed focus on rural and suburban areas—not over-caffeinated urban neighborhoods where locals already joke that the next Starbucks will open inside an existing store.The closing stores are often in ""major metro areas where increases in wage and occupancy and other regulatory requirements"" are making them unprofitable, Johnson said. ""Now, in a lot of ways, it's middle America and the South that presents an opportunity.""For the ubiquitous chain, moving slower and shutting unprofitable stores may trigger some deja vu. In 2008, longtime leader Howard Schultz returned to the company that was struggling after expanding too quickly across the U.S., giving competitors like McDonald's (MCD) a chance to elbow back into breakfast. Investors cheered as Schultz retook the helm and closed some underperforming stores, and share prices at the chain have been up eight of the last 10 years. So far this year through Tuesday's close, shares have been essentially flat.But now, with Schultz stepping back from his beloved company, the task of the righting the ship will fall to Johnson, who took over as a CEO just over a year ago. Schultz, who had already transitioned away from running the coffee chain's day-to-day operations, announced earlier this month he'd be leaving the company, fueling speculation he could be gearing up for a political career. Veteran retailing executive Myron Ullman is taking over as the new head of the board as Schultz departs.While Schultz had been trying to expand the Seattle company's premium business, dubbed Reserve, along with Italian bakery Princi, analysts have speculated that these may be put on the back burner under the new leadership. The company is also facing a resurgent McDonald's, which has been advertising $2 cold-brew coffees, along with other steep discounts from fast-food rivals.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S. and a lot of that is the fast-food chains really improving the quality and breadth of their offerings in terms of hot beverages and breakfast,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus. Americans can ""get that same flavor profile at a much lower price somewhere else. That becomes an area of concern for Starbucks.""Starbucks has also faced backlash this spring after two black men were arrested at one of its stores in Philadelphia while waiting for a meeting to begin. The company and Johnson apologized, calling the arrests ""reprehensible."" Last month, Starbucks closed about 8,000 cafes so its employees could undergo racial-bias training, which did hurt sales in the quarter, Johnson said. After stores reopened following the May 29 training, sales have started to rebound at U.S. locations, with the chain expecting domestic same-store sales growth of around 3% in June, according to the company.The company now expects to report adjusted earnings of between $2.39 and $2.43 per share this fiscal year, down from an earlier forecast of $2.48 to $2.53, according to an investor presentation.""The competitive environment has really become a lot stronger in the U.S.""Starbucks says it can attract more diners in the U.S. with new menu items and will focus on its expanding tea business, as well as capitalizing on health and wellness trends. Starbucks just added a new mango-dragon fruit iced drink to its permanent menu in the U.S. and Canada. And it's focused on improving its food lineup with sous vide egg bites, plus a new line of lunch salads and sandwiches that it's expanding across the nation.""We're putting more of our energy into that afternoon day part and the portfolio of beverages that are offsetting some of the declines we're seeing in Frappuccino beverages,"" Johnson said, citing a consumer shift away from sugary drinks. The company is also preparing to ""lean into more plant-based beverages,"" he said, noting that a new plant-based protein cold-brew drink will be introduced this summer.The chain is also relying on its digital initiatives to contribute between 1 and 2% to comparable sales next fiscal year. There's going to be a new way for non-rewards customers to earn stars and rewards starting next spring, allowing visitors to cash in on loyalty without fully signing up.On Tuesday, Starbucks said that it will return more cash to shareholders—about $25 billion in buybacks and dividends through fiscal 2020, representing a $10 billion increase from the previous guidance. Additionally, it plans to cut general and administrative costs, and has hired a consultant to help in this area. It's also exploring options to license some company-operated stores ""in other appropriate markets,"" it said.The company earlier this year said the cash it got from a licensing deal with Nestle SA would go to support the company's growth in the U.S. and China, where its expansion has been explosive. Starbucks plans to more than triple revenue in China in the next five years and open a new store every 15 hours through 2022 in that market. Johnson confirmed Tuesday that China may one day be a larger market for Starbucks than the U.S.""The China market still offers a lot of potential,"" Bartashus said. ""But the current political environment with trade wars looming or the governments picking at each other—it definitely casts a shadow over the long-term prospects for large western brands that are in China.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:IBD Stock Of The DayBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

949,SEE,"Two stocks that recently leapt from the oil patch to the Spotlight screen are raising interesting questions.The issue with oil explorer WildHorse Resource (WRD) differs depending on how the individual investor handled the stock. Those who bought shares from the base entry of 21.53 enjoyed a move into the 20% to 25% profit-taking zone from April 30 to May 2.Taking profits there made sense. Research shows that most stocks will begin to consolidate after a 20% to 25% gain.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAn investor who held in the hope of gaining more than 20% to 25% saw a gain of almost 38% on May 10. However, it's unlikely an investor would've nailed down that fleeting gain. Two days after hitting the 38% profit level, WildHorse closed at the 15% profit level.From there, WildHorse consolidated further. On Friday, the stock broke under the 50-day line.Potential investors who have not yet bought shares could buy if several elements were in place. First, the stock market must stay in a confirmed uptrend. Without that, an investor has nothing. Second, the stock needs to bounce off the 50-day line in strong volume. Third, it would helpful if the relative strength line was rising rather than falling as it is now.The RS line compares a stock's action to the S&P 500. WildHorse's falling line means it's lagging the market.WildHorse is a December 2016 initial public offering. The company lost money in 2014-16 but turned a profit of 45 cents a share in 2017. The Street expects a profit of $2.03 a share in 2018.Another Houston-based oil explorer, Oasis Petroleum (OAS) cleared an 11.49 buy point in a six-month consolidation. The stock rose as much as 19% after the breakout, but now is showing uncertain action.The stock is now only 6% above the proper buy point.

Perhaps Adobe will pull back modestly on Friday. But the stock could show a sharper loss or close with a gain.The Justice Department won't seek a stay to Tuesday night's federal court ruling.

Levels of management will be reduced to six from eight, according to an internal company memo.Investors have applauded the company's move to transform itself into a leaner operation, with shares rising about 70% since Easterbrook took over.

961,SEE,"Illegal Immigration: The latest outrage by the Trump administration is its policy of ""ripping"" children away from parents who've crossed the border illegally. As with so many other things involving Trump, there's plenty of emotion but precious little in the way of facts.The furor reached critical mass after the Department of Homeland Security said on Friday that 1,995 children had been separated from their illegal border crossing parents from mid-April through May. That number included, DHS said, cases where the adults were arrested for illegal entry, immigration violations, or possible criminal conduct.The practice has generated a rising storm of protests, including from Republicans, ever since Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the administration's ""zero tolerance"" for illegal border crossers. Laura Bush took to the Washington Post's op-ed page to decry it as ""cruel"" and ""immoral."" Trump supporter Franklin Graham called it ""disgraceful.""Trump himself says he doesn't want to see families separated while the legal process works its way out, and then went on to blame Democrats for the problem.So what's going on here?First, it's important to note that many of the ""separations"" don't last long at all.As Rich Lowry explains in a detailed article in National Review, ""when a migrant is prosecuted for illegal entry, he or she is taken into custody by the U.S. Marshals,"" in which case, as when other adults are incarcerated in the U.S., they are separated from their children.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLowry notes that ""The criminal proceedings are exceptionally short, assuming there is no aggravating factor such as a prior illegal entry or another crime. Migrants generally plead guilty, and then are sentenced to time served, typically all in the same day.""The Los Angeles Times reports that Rio Grande Valley border agents prosecuted 568 adults and separated 1,174 children since the administration announced its ""zero tolerance"" policy in early April. However, it only took a matter of hours to reunite more than a third of these children with their parents.That hardly constitutes an inhumane policy of ""ripping"" children away from their parents.Most of the concern about family separations centers on the administration's handling of asylum seekers who've crossed the border illegally.In the past, the practice has been to simply detain these families for a short time in an ICE facility. But rather than return for their asylum hearing, many just disappeared into the country.Under the ""zero tolerance"" policy, Trump has tried to put an end to this ""catch and release"" policy, by arresting every adult caught illegally crossing the border.If parents choose to seek asylum, they can end up separated from their children for months while the asylum process plays out.The administration is right to point out, however, that there is a legal process for seeking asylum that won't involve facing such a choice — just show up at a port of entry to make the asylum claim.""As I have said many times before, if you are seeking asylum for your family, there is no reason to break the law and illegally cross between ports of entry,"" Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted over the weekend.Critics complain that the legal process just takes too long, as a way to justify illegal border crossings. But illegal border crossers are not only jumping the line. Under the old system they could vastly increase their chances of staying in the country — with or without gaining asylum status.Is it wrong for Trump to try to close this unfair and potentially dangerous loophole?Another fact conveniently overlooked amid all the hysteria is that just because a group claims to be a family, doesn't mean it's true. The Department of Homeland Security says that from October 2017 to February 2018 it saw ""a 315% increase in the number of cases with minors fraudulently posing as 'family units' to gain entry.""Presumably that's because they think posing as a family will improve their chances of avoiding deportation. Whatever the reason, those children's separation from their parents occurred long before the border patrol showed up.To be sure, the administration's bungling response to the outcry over its policies has made it harder to understand, much less defend, what's going on.But those protesting family separations should at least acknowledge that there are reforms available that don't involve returning to the days of ""catch and release,"" while still keeping families together — which is the ideal solution — such as letting children stay in detention centers for more than 20 days, and boosting funds for family shelters at the border.Getting such reforms done in today's massively polarized environment, however, is unlikely. The question is, who's to blame for that?Lost Children?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBob McNally, president of the Rapidan Energy Group consulting firm, believes the upcoming meeting could rival a contentious 2011 meeting, which then-Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi called ""one of the worst meetings we have ever had,"" in terms of discord.The 2011 meeting fell apart after Venezuela and Iran gathered enough support to block Saudi Arabia's effort to boost output, as the Arab Spring created tensions between traditional Persian Gulf allies.Political discord is rising again in the region and Iran and Venezuela might be able to block another official output increase. This time, Trump's recent bashing of OPEC over its effort to curb production and boost oil prices is deepening fissures.Iran's OPEC governor, Hossein Kazempour Ardebili, said he objected to an increase after Trump blamed the cartel for high oil prices. Ardebili said that Iran, Iraq and Venezuela are prepared to veto a production increase from Saudi Arabia and Russia.""Three OPEC founders are going to stop it,"" Ardebili told Bloomberg. ""If the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Russia want to increase production, this requires unanimity. If the two want to act alone, that's a breach of the cooperation agreement.""And Kuwait reportedly believes its traditional close ally Saudi Arabia isn't looking out for OPEC but is instead trying to appease Trump, who has backed the kingdom's hard-line stance against Iran.""Trump has made him a target of the hawks, Iran, Kuwait,"" McNally said. ""It will be harder for hawks to agree to increase if it looks like it was partly caused by President Trump's pressure.""But Russia could have some sway over Iran, said Thomas O'Donnell, a senior energy analyst at the consulting firm Wikistrat. Russian President Vladimir Putin played the intermediary between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran in 2016, when the deal to curb production was reached.""It will be interesting to see if he (Putin) has good relations with the Iranians,"" O'Donnell said. ""I do expect down the road when the campaign against Iran gets more intense, Putin will essentially sell them out.""But production will likely increase no matter OPEC's official stance.""It is pretty clear that the countries participating in the Vienna group, those that can increase production, will,"" McNally said, referring to OPEC and its nonmember partners.Saudi Arabia already reported an increase in production in the latest OPEC monthly report. And Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said June 14 that an agreement to boost production was ""inevitable.""Meanwhile, even the countries that want to raise production don't agree on how much. Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies want to raise total output by 300,000 barrels per day, but Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said the group should boost production by as much as 1.5 million bpd. Reuters sources said the two sides are looking at raising production by 1 million bpd. McNally expects an increase of 400,000-500,000 bpd.While Saudi Arabia, Russia and the United Arab Emirates might unofficially agree to boost production, the official communique, if there is one, will likely be vague, McNally said.This could create further cracks in OPEC and lessen its effectiveness.Top oil producers and emerging allies Saudi Arabia and Russia are already looking at their own, separate agreement. In a statement released Thursday, the two countries announced they would develop a ""comprehensive bilateral agreement"" on energy cooperation.Congress is also adding pressure to the already contentious OPEC meeting. On June 13, the House Judiciary Committee submitted the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act bill to the floor of the House. The NOPEC bill would allow the Treasury Department to sue OPEC countries under the Sherman Antitrust Act.McNally said the bill has ""overwhelming"" bipartisan support. Presidents Bush and Obama pushed back on similar bills when they came up in the past. But McNally isn't sure Trump would oppose the latest one.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Permian Oil Prices Dive As Gas Prices Rise, Boosting These RefinersWhy The Next Oil Bonanza Could Be Deep Under WaterOil Stocks And Industry News

970,SEE,"A new threat by President Trump to apply 10% tariffs on an additional $200 billion in Chinese imported goods put the U.S. stock market on a slicker path to a potential market correction on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average and the NYSE composite battled to stay above their key 50-day moving averages.Volume rose on both main exchanges vs. Monday, according to early data readings. That implied unusually heavy institutional selling.The Dow industrial average and the NYSE composite slid 1.1% and 0.6% in stocks today, respectively, but both rebounded off their session lows. The Dow industrial average, finishing at 24,700, is now down about 0.1% since Jan. 1.Those losses, however, were not as frightening as the sell-offs among China mainland indexes. Hong Kong's Hang Seng benchmark dropped 2.8% overnight  and cut its long-term 200-day moving average for the first time since December 2016. The Shanghai composite skidded 3.8% lower, hitting lows not seen since June 2016.Meanwhile, Netflix (NFLX) and other high-octane growth stocks that are leading the digital transformation of the global economy continued to flex strength.Netflix, the eighth largest company on the Nasdaq exchange by market cap, jumped 3.7% to a new high of 404.98 in brisk volume, 84% above its 50-day average. The big move helped the Nasdaq composite cut its early 1.4% drubbing to less than a 0.3% decline by day's end.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on Dec. 6, 2016, as the stock was forming a base next to a much larger set of bases. Then the stock broke out past a correct entry point at 129.39 in early January 2017. The stock has since advanced 208% and is currently extended from a proper buy point.At 7725, the Nasdaq holds a 12% year-to-date gain. The Nasdaq 100 also hustled off its intraday low, slipping just 0.3%. Both the Nasdaq composite and the Nasdaq 100 are trading less than 1% below their all-time highs.The S&P 500 chopped its early decline to 0.4% as strength in defensive stocks, including utilities, offset weakness in automaker, steel, construction and farming machinery, chemical and coal stocks. Biotech, movie, drug store chain and auto parts firms also rallied.The small-cap S&P 600 outperformed, losing just 0.1%. At 1044, the index is up 11.5% since Jan. 1.Also within IBD Leaderboard, at least three top-shelf retailers seem to be feeling less of an impact on the escalating tit for tat between the world's two largest economies.Discount and variety store chain Five Below (FIVE), premium yogawear retailer Lululemon (LULU) and online marketplace Etsy (ETSY) are all holding up well since their excellent breakouts in recent months.All three Leaderboard names show strong double-digit earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Etsy soared 28% last week on news that it's adding new services for sellers while also raising transaction fees.Etsy grew its top line by 19%, 21%, 24% and 25% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street expects Q2 revenue to jump 25% to $127.1 million and earnings to rise 150% to a nickel a share.

C stands for current earnings growth of 25% or more in the latest quarter. An acceleration in the rate of year-over-year growth? Even better. Institutional investors highly prize companies that are able to post bigger profit gains vs. recent quarters.Lululemon, a member of the IBD 50, still sees the majority of its revenue coming from North America. The Vancouver-based firm has posted EPS increases of 3%, 19%, 33% and 72% in the past four quarters. In other words, it's shown growth acceleration in the bottom line for three periods in a row.The Street sees earnings rising 26% to 49 cents a share in the July-ending fiscal second quarter.Financial payment, credit history and transactions-related firms are also holding up well. TransUnion (TRU), Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) are keeping their solid long-term uptrends intact. The former, also in IBD Leaderboard, reversed from mild losses to gain 0.6%.Square (SQ), the innovator in point of sale technology and financial services for small and medium businesses, doesn't seem to be perturbed by Trump's aggressive tariff policy. The San Francisco-based company dropped 4% in the early going before shaving the loss to less than 0.4%.At 65.94, the stock is holding on to a 15% gain past a 57.29 entry in a nine-week cup with handle.That base also shows elements of a double bottom, one of the eight key chart patterns that growth investors can use to time their market buys during a confirmed uptrend in the stock market.Wall Street forecasts Square increasing its earnings by 70% to 46 cents a share in 2018, then doing it again to 78 cents in 2019.No doubt, commodities are being targeted by Chinese government officials with less than six months to go before critical midyear U.S. elections take place in November.Nucor (NUE), the largest U.S. steelmaker by market value, dropped as much as 4% and flirted with its rising 50-day moving average before rebounding some to end at 65.47.The Charlotte, N.C., firm has been locked in a trading range of 59 to 70 since January. Yet the stock is also building a new base and stands just 7% below the 70.48 peak.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings vaulting 86% to $6.67 a share this year, then easing 7% to $6.18 in 2019. Sales growth has been powerful lately, rising 14%, 30%, 22%, 21%, 29% and 16% in the past six quarters.Tesla (TSLA) led the automakers down more than 4% as a group on a price-weighted basis. Autos finished worst among all 197 industry groups tracked by IBD each day.But Tesla, the electric vehicle pioneer, actually needed to catch its breath following strong gains the past three weeks.Shares closed down nearly 5% to 352.55 in heavy turnover. Watch to see if the 350 round number level offers a floor of support. Tesla also now has a nice air cushion above both its 50- and 200-day moving averages.For now, Tesla continues to work on a huge base that stretches all the way back to September 2017. In the week ended Sept. 15 that year, the stock broke out of an 11-week cup with handle at 370.10, but reversed sharply lower the next week. The negative action triggered the golden rule of investing — keep your losses small in every investment, preferably at 8% or less.In other financial markets, crude oil rallied amid some hopes that OPEC and Russia will agree to either no change in their production quotas or raise output only by a little. Investors will be watching the results of a Friday meeting closely.The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond fell 3 basis points to 2.89%. Yields fall when bond prices rise.

971,SEE,"Fidelity Investments has long been known for its top-performing portfolio managers like Peter Lynch of Fidelity Magellan Fund (FMAGX) and Will Danoff of Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX).But in recent years, the Boston-based fund giant has increasingly focused on building a name for itself in the universe of exchange traded funds. In 2003, it launched its first ETF, Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index Tracking Stock Fund (ONEQ). Since Greg Friedman came on board in 2013 as head of ETF management and strategy, Fidelity has really beefed up its offerings.With its Thursday launch of two factor-based funds in the fixed-income space, Fidelity now has 10 factor ETFs in its lineup. It launched six domestic factor ETFs in September 2016 and added two international factor ETFs in January 2018. The two new funds, Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor (FLDR) and Fidelity High Yield Factor (FDHY), target the fixed-income space.""With a quantitative, rules-based methodology at its core and an active liquidity overlay, Fidelity High Yield Factor ETF leverages our extensive high-income capabilities to offer an enhanced exposure to the high-yield market for ETF investors,"" Friedman said in a statement. ""Fidelity Low Duration Bond Factor ETF is unique in its category because it seeks a balance between credit risk and interest rate risk, on top of pursuing higher income potential than a money market with lower volatility than a short-term bond fund.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseFidelity now offers 25 ETFs in its lineup, including the 10 factor ETFs mentioned above, three actively managed bond ETFs and 11 passive equity-sector ETFs. It also offers investors access to 70 passive iShares ETFs. Fidelity has more than $11 billion in ETF assets under management. Its ETF assets under administration is more than $380 billion.IBD touched base with Friedman to learn more about Fidelity's new funds, as well as what trends the mutual fund and ETF provider is seeing in exchange traded funds. The full interview with Friedman, previously an ETF product management executive at iShares and Russell, follows:IBD: Why did Fidelity start offering ETFs?Fidelity entered the ETF market with one of our biggest differentiators — distribution power. Today, we combine the power of our distribution capability with our asset management capabilities. Investors and advisors on our brokerage platform can access a broad range of industry-leading ETFs commission-free. Where we manufacture is in the active and smart-beta areas, where we are confident we can innovate and deliver real value for our customers.IBD: Do you think the ETFs have been taking some inflow (or interest) away from Fidelity's mutual funds?Friedman: Mutual funds and ETFs do not need to be an either/or proposition. Many investors and advisors use both to help meet their financial goals. A good example is our sector lineup, which includes sector mutual funds and ETFs. Since launching the sector ETF lineup in 2013, one of the widest sector offerings in the industry, we have seen assets grow in both areas.IBD: What sets Fidelity's ETFs apart from the competition?Friedman: We seek to bring the best of Fidelity and a strong value to our clients in our ETF offerings. More than 90 ETFs are available commission-free on our brokerage platform. We bring Fidelity's world-class investment insights to market through our active bond ETFs and our equity factor ETFs. Lastly, we also offer some of the lowest-cost passive sector ETFs in the industry.IBD: Which ETFs have seen the biggest inflows this year?Friedman: Our low-cost sector ETF offering has been seeing the most flows, and Fidelity MSCI Information Technology ETF (FTEC) has gained nearly $500 million in assets thus far in 2018. But we've also seen interest in our income-oriented ETFs, such as Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR) and Fidelity Total Bond ETF (FBND).IBD: What are some of your biggest and best-performing ETFs over the past three to five years?Friedman: Our largest fund is Fidelity MSCI Information Technology, with over $2 billion in assets. Our next three largest funds are Fidelity MSCI Health Care Index (FHLC), Fidelity MSCI Financial Index (FNCL), and Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index (ONEQ). All these funds are over $1 billion in assets. For the three-year period, three of our best performing funds were FTEC (18.2%), FNCL (14.3%) and ONEQ (13.8%).IBD: Factor-based funds (smart beta) have been popular among investors. Do you think that's still the case?Friedman: Yes, clients use factor-based funds strategically as well as tactically to solve for investment needs. We see people using factor-based strategies in a few different ways. The most obvious is to generate strong returns. Strategies such as value, quality and momentum have historically produced strong performance. Another is to manage risk with a low-volatility strategy. Additionally, someone might be looking to achieve a specific outcome, such as generating higher dividend income. IBD: Fidelity last week launched two new factor-based bond funds — FLDR and FDHY. Could you tell us more about each fund and why Fidelity decided to roll them out?Friedman: Sure, I'm really excited about these new ETFs. To answer the why, we are constantly evaluating our ETF product offerings and soliciting feedback from our customers to ensure we're meeting their needs, particularly in areas where we can innovate. We've received strong interest from our customers for fixed-income factor strategies. This led us to create two new ETFs that are different from what's currently in the market, Fidelity High Yield Factor ETF and Fidelity Low Duration Bond ETF.The Fidelity High Yield Factor ETF leverages Fidelity's high-income capabilities to bring innovation to the high-yield-ETF space because it has a quantitative, rules-based methodology at its core and an active liquidity overlay. Fidelity Low Duration Bond ETF is also unique in that it seeks a balance between credit risk and interest-rate risk, on top of pursuing higher income potential than a money market with lower volatility than a short-term bond fund.IBD: Are there any particular trends you're seeing currently in the ETF space (sector, style, etc.)?Friedman: We are seeing a continuation of growth in factor and smart-beta investing. In addition, ETFs continue to be used as core positions in model strategies. We also see the industry anticipating development of active equity ETFs.IBD: Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates comes to mind as a potential rising-rate play. Could you please explain FDRR's investment strategy?Friedman: Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates targets high-dividend-paying stocks while trying to mitigate the effect rising interest rates often have on other dividend ETFs. That happens through two pieces of the index methodology. First is that in addition to dividend yield, payout ratio and dividend growth, we include the stock's correlation to 10-year Treasuries in the stock ranking process. Second is its sector composition. Many dividend-focused funds and ETFs have high exposure to historically interest-rate-sensitive sectors such as utilities and REITs. By keeping sector weightings similar to the broader market, it should avoid overexposure to those rate-sensitive sectors.IBD: Anything else about Fidelity's ETFs you'd like our readers to know?Friedman: We are committed to bringing the best of Fidelity to ETF form, by delivering choice, value and innovation to our clients.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:From AI To Social Media And Beyond, This ETF Pioneer DeliversChina, Solar Among Hot Stock Picks As S&P 500 Targets 3000AI-Powered Stock Picks, Internet Giants Among New ETF Launches

So the Chinese use platforms like WeChat and Alibaba.Now the Chinese government takes data from those platforms to assign all people who use them a ""social credit score.""In other words, the government monitors your web activity and gives you a grade. Your purchases, social interactions and political activity will determine what privileges you get.Having a low score — because you smoke, are slow to pay bills or criticize a government official — could get you barred from flying, using certain hotels or sending your kids to better schools.Li Schoolland grew up in China.

People complain because Facebook is irresponsible about sharing our data. But to that I say, so what? I voluntarily give Facebook that information. I'd rather see targeted ads than random ones, and no one forces me to use Facebook.I worry more about what my government does. Facebook and Google cannot use force. Government can. Governments do.Already, there are new surveillance programs.Los Angeles police brag that they now practice ""predictive"" policing. They pay a company called Palantir to analyze social media, trace people's ties to gang members and predict the likelihood that someone may commit a crime.That makes some people feel safer.But ""I think they are giving government too much power,"" says Schoolland. ""They didn't realize this is going to lead to more and more.""I might like to know people's ""trust score"" before interacting with them, I tell her.""Yes, we want to know who we can trust when we do business,"" she responds, ""but those are market behaviors. We don't need the government to get involved.""For now, the internet, and other new technology, enhances my freedom.My son complains that it distracts us so much that we can't focus on what matters. That's true also, but I say, on balance, it's wonderful. It helps me band together with others who think like I do. It makes it easier for me criticize the government and business practices I consider unfair. Heck, that's what I do every week in my videos.But we should be on guard against use of technology to curtail our freedom. Government was dangerous enough — before it could spy on us so easily.

986,SEE,"Recently, it was revealed that Amazon bans customers who return too many items. Amazon should be free to do business how it pleases and with whom it pleases; however, this is one of the gigantic companies pushing so-called ""Net Neutrality"" while also engaging in business practices that supporters of the Obama-era internet regulation complain about.Amazon, of course, reserves the right to block awful actors from their system, yet actively lobbies for rules that prohibit companies like Comcast from doing the same. There's nothing neutral about that and the hypocrisy doesn't end there.Like many other websites pushing for rules which prevent internet service providers from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing certain customers and users, such practices are the foundation of Amazon's business model — indeed the business models of other major pro-neutrality websites as well.Under the theory of Net Neutrality, internet service providers — Comcast, Verizon, AT&T, and the like — would be prohibited from prioritizing and offering their own web products and services at lower prices, charging other companies extra for prioritized access to users, charging consumers extra for exclusive access to additional and better web services, and slowing delivery unless you pay more.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIs this not exactly how Amazon runs its business?Amazon prioritizes its own products and sells them at a lower price than competitors. Amazon has an entire line of AmazonBasics products which are often much cheaper generics listed and highlighted in product search results before name-brand products.Looking for an Apple iPhone charging cable? I searched for ""iPhone charger"" and the third result was an AmazonBasics charging cable tagged as a ""Best Seller.""The sixth result was also an AmazonBasics charging cable tagged as ""Amazon's Choice."" The first Apple-brand charging cable made the second page of results, sixteen spots down. Clearly, Amazon is prioritizing its own products on its system.The first two results in the search were not AmazonBasics products, but were instead third-party products both listed as ""Sponsored."" Here again, Amazon violated the principles of neutrality by charging other companies for better access to its system's users.Of course, the most flagrantly nonneutral aspect of Amazon is AmazonPrime. Net Neutrality advocates shudder at the thought of their internet service provider charging them an additional fee to access additional content or websites or have their data delivered faster than others.Yet, Amazon Prime features all of the above. AmazonPrime membership, an additional $12.99 a month, grants free express shipping, lower prices, and prioritized access to certain items and services among countless other benefits. It is a great service, but it's the antithesis of neutral.Net Neutrality advocates claim that if internet service providers have the ability to deliver their service to all consumers without prioritization and charging extra for access and higher speeds, then they should have to do so. Amazon clearly has the ability to provide the discounted and expedited delivery that comes with Amazon Prime, but no one in their right mind would demand Amazon grant these benefits as a quasi-right.To be fair to Amazon, they aren't the only company preaching neutrality while practicing quite the opposite. Social media giants and search engines all violate the principles of neutrality as cornerstones of their business. There's a reason certain items pop-up first in your feed or results and it's because of paid prioritization.These sites, like Amazon, also reserve the right to block you from using their service should they feel you are abusing it. Again, there's nothing neutral here but most people don't see it as a problem either.It's truly a shame that Amazon and other web giants are pushing so hard for Net Neutrality. These companies have revolutionized the world, generated trillions of dollars in wealth, and improved the lives of countless people. They were able to do so because the government didn't prevent them from monetizing the systems they created in ways they best see fit.Again, Amazon should be free to conduct its business however and with whomever it chooses. If someone is abusing the system in a way that harms their ability to offer great products and services at lower prices, they should be free to kick that person off the system in the same way a brick-and-mortar store should be free to kick out and ban any customer causing a nuisance or bouncing checks.Before Amazon or any other web giants again throw their weight behind Net Neutrality, they ought to AmazonPrime themselves a pair of an internet service provider's shoes, walk a mile, and ponder government and separate industries dictating how they use the systems and infrastructure they've created.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

991,SEE,"The Fed hiked its key interest rate a quarter-point, as expected, on Wednesday, but surprised financial markets by signaling two more rate hikes this year to counter tax cut-fueled economic strength.The consensus Fed rate hike outlook shows a total of four increases this year, up from a prior view for three. Policymakers continue to see three more rate hikes in 2019. Bottom line: The Fed had been on the cusp of a hawkish shift and just got off the fence.After release of the policy statement and quarterly economic projections at 2 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 index and Nasdaq composite pulled back modestly, then recovered lost ground during Chairman Jerome Powell's uneventful news conference.Powell indicated that the rate-setting committee was cognizant of the risk of moving too quickly or too slowly, adding that policymakers also aren't overly worried about inflation exceeding 2%. ""The economy is great shape,"" Powell said.While the Fed continues to see economic risks as balanced, Powell seemed to emphasize a stance of gradual tightening to ""sustain that expansion"" by keeping things from overheating.Yet, the market's initial, limited reaction masked an ominous sign: a flatter yield curve. Firming inflation and Fed rate-hike expectations have pushed up short-term government bond yields. But the narrow gap between short-term and long-term Treasuries signals growing doubts about the durability of the economy's momentum.While Powell spoke, the 2-year Treasury yield pared its rise to 2.57%, closing to within 40 basis points of the 2.97% 10-year Treasury yield. That's the narrowest yield gap since 2007, when long-term rates fell below short-term rates, a reliable precursor of recession.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAhead of the meeting, Wall Street has worried on and off that recent economic indicators would compel policymakers to tighten too much. Inflation is near the Fed's 2% target, wages are finally perking up, and the unemployment rate is hovering around a 50-year low.At the May meeting, the Fed tried to tamp those fears by stressing that their inflation target is ""symmetric,"" meaning that exceeding 2% for a time is no more reason to panic than modest undershoots.The Fed, under new chair Powell, faces an unprecedented policy challenge. Fiscal stimulus has always been ordered up during a recession or at the start of a recovery. This time, President Trump and Congress are delivering a double dose of major tax cuts and spending hikes deep into the expansion, when growth was already firm and labor markets tight. The challenge is that policy works with a time lag. So almost as soon as the Fed adjusts policy to respond to economic strength, stimulus will be fading.""2019 is setting up to be a dangerous year, as the fiscal stimulus rolls off while the impact of the Fed's tightening will be peaking,"" Greg Jensen, co-chief investment officer of hedge fund behemoth Bridgewater Associates, wrote recently.Investors shouldn't take the quarterly economic projections to the bank. For one thing, some of the members, including a couple of doves, don't have votes, and the makeup of the committee will change as new Trump appointees are confirmed. More critically, if wage growth keeps accelerating, policymakers will update their views.While every signal the Fed sent was hawkish on Wednesday, it's worth noting that the consensus doesn't appear that firm. Only eight policymakers projected four 2018 rates hikes, while seven still expected three.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:These 4 Top Stocks In Buy Range Boast Rising Profit EstimatesAT&T Can Buy Time Warner; Court Ruling To Ignite Comcast, Disney BrawlIBD Stock Of The Day: Hot New China IPO iQiyi Flashes This Key Technical SignWhy This Biotech Company Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

1009,SEE,"THE TAKE-AWAY: What is the Dow Jones industrial average? It gauges the stock performance of 30 really big, household-name U.S. companies deemed to be representative of the U.S. economy.If you watch the news, perhaps you know that the Dow Jones industrial average, or the Dow, is a thing that rises, falls, swoons, surges, plunges, rallies or tanks. When it tanks, it's very bad and very important. It drives men in decorated sport coats, the vibe of which is somewhere between executive and airline captain, to bury their heads in their hands and leave paper all over the floor.You'd be forgiven for not knowing the finer points of what the Dow Jones industrial average actually is. The Dow Jones industrial average is an index that gauges the stock performance of 30 large, well-known companies. A stock index is a compilation of any number of stocks — with different prices, moving in different directions — represented by a single number.You already know many of the stocks that are part of the Dow. Apple (AAPL), Nike (NKE) and McDonald's (MCD) are part of the Dow. General Electric (GE), the last original member, will be replaced by Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) on June 26, 2018.Created in 1896 to bring more transparency to the stock market, the Dow intends to offer a big-picture view of how the economic, business and political climate might affect big companies seen as bellwethers for the U.S. economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow is not a physical place, like a trading floor, where people go to buy or sell stocks. When you see pictures of traders pointing, yelling or despairing, they're probably on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.The ""Dow"" in ""Dow Jones"" is also completely different Dow from the Dow in the chemical giant DowDuPont. However, DowDuPont (DOW) is a Dow Jones Industrial Average stock.A committee made up of three representatives from S&P Dow Jones Indices and two from the Wall Street Journal meets twice a year to consider if any changes are needed to the Dow index.There are no explicit numerical requirements that companies must meet for their stocks to become part of the index. But there are broader, qualitative benchmarks for Dow companies, according to Jamie Farmer, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.A company needs to have a strong reputation, have a history of weathering economic storms, and its shares need to be widely owned by investors, he said. Companies on the Dow also need to get a lot of their sales from the U.S. — at least a plurality, Farmer said. The companies also generally have to trade on the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq.""Dow"" is for Charles Dow. ""Jones"" is for Edward Jones. The two were journalists who founded Dow Jones & Co. in 1882, along with another reporter, Charles Bergstresser. In 1889, they created the Wall Street Journal. On May 26, 1896, the Dow Jones industrial average began measuring stocks — at first, only 12.""Its initial purpose was really just kind of an editorial function,"" Farmer said. ""They wanted a way to describe what was going on in the stock market on a daily basis.""That wasn't always easy in the U.S. stock market's early days.As Charles Geisst's book ""Wall Street: A History"" describes, prices for transactions on the New York Stock and Exchange Board, founded in 1817, weren't always public, let alone available to the area's newspapers.Regulations were also flimsy. Markets were easily manipulated. The 1800s were marked by cycles of wild speculation, panic and bank implosions that swallowed the economy — a process that played out multiple times over the century. Predatory tactics abounded.The daily publication of the Dow Jones industrial average numbers helped investors follow stock market movements more clearly, easing some investor fears, Geisst writes.And just what is the Dow Jones industrial average's justification for being ""industrial"" and an ""average""? That's a little more complicated.When the Dow Jones industrial average first launched, the 12 companies that it tracked were companies in the industrial sector: American Tobacco, Tennessee Coal & Iron, U.S. Leather, U.S. Rubber. General Electric was on there too, initially, before it was removed from the index and later restored in 1907, before ultimately getting removed again in 2018.Many of those companies were broken up, absorbed by others, or morphed into different businesses over time.In the beginning, the Dow was a pure ""average"" of the stocks in it. The prices of those 12 stocks were added up, divided by 12, and then you got the singular price for the whole thing.Today, that's not the case. The Dow uses a mechanism called a ""divisor"" to help calculate that singular, representative price of the index's stocks. The divisor is there to smooth out the bumps in price that come from things like stock splits or the addition or removal of stocks from the index. The Dow is also price weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have a bigger influence on the index than lower-priced ones.Over the decades, the Dow has become less ""industrial,"" per se, though it includes big names like GE, 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX). But the index has evolved to include large tech and financial-services players, which are more representative of the economy today.In the prior tweak, DowDuPont replaced DuPont in Sept. 1, 2017, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, after it merged with Dow Chemical.Before that, Apple replaced AT&T (T) on March 19, 2015. And on Sept. 23, 2013, Goldman Sachs (GS) replaced Bank of America (BAC); Visa (V) replaced Hewlett-Packard, which split up; and Nike (NKE) replaced Alcoa, which also split up.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:What Is The Stock Market And How Does It Work?

Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWith the decision to retire its key crisis-fighting tool, the ECB is betting that the euro-area economy is robust enough to ride out an apparent slowdown amid risks including trade tariffs and nervousness that Italy's populist government will spark another financial crisis.The announcement comes only hours after the Federal Reserve raised U.S. interest rates for the second time this year, highlighting how a decade of easy money globally is gradually coming to an end. The People's Bank of China opted not to follow the Fed in raising borrowing costs, and the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its stimulus when it meets on Friday.Draghi will provide updated economic projections at his news briefing, which may help him address any questions over whether policy makers have acted too hastily given a spate of disappointing data in recent weeks. While almost a third of economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted he'd set an end-date for purchases after the Riga meeting, 46% said he'd wait until the next policy session in July.It is four years to the month since the ECB became the first major central bank to cut one of its key rates below zero.

1015,SEE,"General Electric (GE) shares wallowed near multiyear lows Tuesday as two Wall Street analysts soured on the industrial giant's worsening fundamentals, including its credit and earnings outlooks.XJPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa wondered how long credit-rating agencies can ""remain on the sidelines with their commentary, seemingly giving GE precious time to work their way out,"" given a host of problems.Problems dogging the 126-year-old industrial giant include ""material changes in fundamentals,"" little progress on asset sales, delays in revenue recognition restatements, a lack of ""clean numbers"" and an SEC investigation, according to Tusa. The analyst also pointed out that during the Great Recession, GE was AAA-rated and needed a bailout.""So we scratch our heads as to the repeated inertia"" from ratings watchdogs, which should start to get more attention, Tusa wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.He remains cautious on the stock, finding GE's fundamentals are ""worse than expected"" and calling out its ""currently unjustified rating."" The recent appointment of a Moody's board member to its own board should raise investors' eyebrows, in Tusa's view.Moody's cut GE's long-term debt rating in November, citing ""extreme deterioration"" in its energy business. The cut from A1 to A2 still kept the company's bonds in the investment grade category. Also in November, Fitch cut its rating to A+ from AA-, still in investment grade.Tusa, however, has an underweight rating on the stock with an 11 price target, down from 14 a month ago.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMeanwhile, Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy cut his 2018 EPS estimate for General Electric to 95 cents from 98 cents and his 2019 EPS estimate to $1.05 from $1.10. He pointed to continuing challenges in GE's core power segment, expectation for slower overall growth across long-cycle businesses, and material challenges on price or cost inflation.Given GE's current cash priorities, he submitted a ""modest proposal"" that management consider capping supplemental cash pension benefits for the highest-level, longest-tenured executives. This, McCarthy said, would send out ""the appropriate 'virtue' signaling.""Shares fell as low as 12.80 but closed up 1 cent at 13.13 on the stock market today. GE stock has lost more than half its value in the past year despite ambitious turnaround plans outlined by new leadership at the Boston-based company in November.A spokesperson responded to the analysts by referring to comments made by CEO John Flannery during a Jan. 24 earnings call.""We will maintain a disciplined financial policy targeting 2.5 times net debt to EBITDA and A1/P1 short-term ratings,"" Flannery said.Additionally, management affirmed they are focused on improving the strength of the company's balance sheet within a disciplined capital allocation framework.They also noted GE ended 2017 with $11 billion cash from its industrial operations and added, ""We plan to increase our cash balance in 2018 and exit the year with $15 billion-plus of cash.""Among GE's industrial peers, 3M (MMM) and Honeywell (HON) added 1.7% and 1.3%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX) advanced 1.1%. Siemens (SIEGY) lost 0.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Why General Electric May Be Most At Risk From Trump TariffsIn Market Correction, Look For Stocks Like Lululemon With These 3 TraitsCan You Spot The Next Big Stock Market Top?

But leading up to the Trump-Kim summit, Pygonyang signaled it wouldn't make the drills a sticking point.South Korea was reportedly surprised by the concession and said it needed ""to find out the precise meaning or intentions"" of Trump's announcement. Seoul and the U.S. had scheduled their drills to start in August.Kim pledged to denuclearize North Korea, but the agreement signed in Singapore lacked key details likes timelines and a verification process.Trump said halting the joint military exercises would save money. He previously has complained about the amount of money the U.S. spends stationing troops in South Korea and Japan.Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan have deployed missile defense systems from defense stocks Raytheon (RTN) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) to counter the North Korean threat.After reporting Q1 earnings in April, Raytheon said it expects missile defense demand to remain strong, in the Asia region specifically, regardless of what happens in expected U.S.-North Korea talks.Still, Raytheon led defense stocks lower, tumbling 2.8% to 206.64 on the stock market today.

1017,SEE,"GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) popped to an 11-month high Thursday after its two-drug HIV treatment proved non-inferior to a three-drug regimen using medicine from Gilead Sciences (GILD).On the stock market today, Glaxo shares jumped 1.9% to close at 41.94. Glaxo stock is forming a cup base with a buy point at 44.63. Gilead shares lifted 0.6% to close at 71.15.But analysts say Glaxo is unlikely to get much share from Gilead in HIV. A dual regimen looks competitive under ideal circumstances. In the real world, even very sick patients don't always take their medicine. This means they could become resistant to the drugs.""We think concerns over potential for resistance emergence with real-world use will limit the adoption of this dual regimen,"" RBC analyst Brian Abrahams said in a note to clients. ""We do not see much incentive for physicians to prescribe dual HIV cocktails and take any chances.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseGlaxo and ViiV Healthcare tested a combination of their drugs Tivicay and Epivir, respectively, in a group of never-before-treated HIV patients. It compared that regimen to another using a two-drug combo from Gilead called Truvada plus its own Tivicay.Tivicay plus Epivir was not inferior to the three-drug regimen at 48 weeks. None of the patients who experienced virological failure developed treatment-related resistance, Glaxo said in a news release. Virological failure occurs when the treatment doesn't sufficiently suppress the virus.But ""key details such as the rates of virological failure, which would be important to understand how competitively this regimen behaves, were not yet disclosed,"" Abrahams said. Glaxo said to expect further data at an upcoming medical conference.From a real-world perspective, it will be important to look at patients who didn't always take their medicine, Evercore analyst Umer Raffat said in a report.Abrahams notes it's in ViiV's best interest to push a two-drug regimen. The biotech previously tested a three-medicine combination that included abacavir. Abacavir had safety issues including hypersensitivity and the potential for cardiovascular risks.""Gilead's triple regimens, such as Biktarvy, do not share these liabilities,"" he said. ""And with the advent of (Gilead's tenofovir alafenamide), long-term renal/bone safety issues for Gilead's regimens have been mitigated.""Further, there have been questions regarding liver toxicity and birth defects tied to Glaxo's drug Tivicay.

1027,SEE,"Oil prices careened lower Friday as several key pieces of news preceded what promises to be a critical OPEC meeting on June 22.Weekly rig count data showed a mild decrease in overall U.S. drilling activity. But gas drilling accounted for the pullback. Oil-focused drilling actually added one rig for the week. But oil and energy stocks began their sell-off long before the data were released. The cause appeared to be a raft of early news potentially affecting the oil supply outlook.U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate dropped 2.9% to below $65 a barrel, snapping a four-day rebound from its early-June lows. Europe's Brent crude benchmark dived 3.5%. Even so, WTI oil prices had climbed 0.2% for the week through Thursday. The advance came despite concerns that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries planned to increase its production quota.The Times of India reported on Friday that India and China had launched discussions in Beijing exploring the idea of a buyers' cartel. The partnership reportedly aimed at countering OPEC's market manipulation. The two countries accounted for nearly 17% of global oil consumption last year, the report said.

1038,SEE,"Less than a month after the Trump administration declared that the China trade war was ""on hold,"" it appears to be back on. And this time, there may be no turning back.President Trump on Friday imposed tariffs on $50 billion worth of mostly high-tech imports that will be subject to 25% tariffs. Some $34 billion will go into effect on July 6. China on Friday announced tariffs on $34 billion worth of U.S. goods, including agricultural goods. It's vowed to match U.S. tariffs swiftly and dollar for dollar.Trump had threatened more tariffs if China retaliates.What happens next will determine how big of a deal Trump's China trade war is for the economy and stock market. Yet there's clear risk that the conflict will escalate into a technological cold war.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe Dow Jones, down more than 1% at one point, pared its loss to 0.3% on the stock market today. The S&P 500 index slid 0.1% and the Nasdaq composite 0.2%.Tariffs on $34 billion in goods will take effect July 6. The other $16 billion are still subject to review.Once shots are fired, trade talks will get more difficult. The Trump administration says it has almost finished drawing up a list of another $100 billion of Chinese goods that could also face tariffs.Commodities prices for soybeans, corn and wheat have taken a hit ahead of the expected imposition of tariffs, while shares of Deere (DE), which thrives when American farmers are doing well, slid close to 5% in the past two days. That's quite a reversal after Trump's May 21 tweet touting an emerging trade deal that would see China ""buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural products"" from the U.S.So what happened? Trump may have concluded that the deal would have done relatively little to meet his goal of shrinking the U.S. trade deficit. After his meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un, Trump might feel his denuclearization push isn't so dependent upon China.Here's another possibility: Trump may have been bullied into the trade war. While the Trump administration has insisted that the enforcement action against Chinese communications equipment supplier ZTE was separate from the trade negotiation, it's not clear that Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed.The brief but favorable turn in China trade relations came after Trump tweeted that he and Xi were working to get ZTE ""back into business, fast."" That's after U.S. sanctions forced the Chinese telecom gear maker to cease operations. As punishment for continuing to doing business with Iran and North Korea in defiance of U.S. sanctions against those regimes, the Commerce Department ordered ZTE's key U.S. component suppliers to cease doing business with the firm.But Trump's leniency prompted a backlash. The Senate appears certain to attach a provision denying relief to ZTE to a defense funding bill. While the White House opposes that provision, it's unclear that Trump would veto must-pass defense legislation over the matter.With the fate of ZTE hanging in the balance, Chinese trade negotiators have frustrated their American counterparts. That, in turn, has strengthened the hand of Trump administration officials who have advocated taking a hard line against China and had the tariffs all ready to go.One ray of hope that a damaging trade war can be averted: China has reportedly granted approval to Qualcomm (QCOM) to buy NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). Chinese regulators appeared to delay approval amid the ZTE furor. But some reports said that China hasn't yet OK'd Qualcomm-NXP Semi.Qualcomm rose 0.7% Friday while NXP advanced 0.1%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Dow Jones Futures Fall As Trump Steps Up China Trade War; Watch These Key StocksIBD Stock Of The Day: Dropbox Breaks Out As Software IPOs SurgeWhy This Biotech Is Bounding Closer To A BreakoutChart Reading For Beginners: What's In A Stock Chart?

Concentration matters.Want to hitch your portfolio to companies that gallop past the major equity benchmarks?

They include Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Baozun (BZUN), Adobe (ADBE) and new Leaderboard name Veeva Systems (VEEV). Another six stocks lead the electronics sector. The internet, medical and retail sectors each count five names.You don't necessarily need to trade exclusively in just one or two sectors. That would be like going full bore on margin.

But if a top sector suddenly goes out of favor, you'll need to act very fast to lock in gains and limit the damage.But as you gain more experience with the CAN SLIM seven-point stock selection system, you'll grow more comfortable investing a greater percentage of your assets in the top sectors.Always make sure you are paying close attention to defense-type sell signals.

""In fact, the most recent releases confirm our key take-away that homebuilders are seeing higher pricing gains, but lower order unit growth.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseHe singled out KB Home (KBH), Taylor Morrison Home Corp. (TMHC) and Toll Bros. (TOL) as stocks that could struggle amid market challenges. The sector's recent struggles also saw LGI Home (LGIH) drop out of the prestigious IBD 50 stock list.However, D.R. Horton (DHI), due to its more diversified offerings and geographical markets, could flourish.Homebuilder stocks were the top market group in 2017, nearly doubling in value. But they've been stock-market laggards in 2018 as mortgage rates have climbed along with Treasury yields, which are getting a boost from expectations for faster inflation.The Building-Residential/Commercial group now sits in 184th place among the 197 industries that IBD tracks, after topping the list in 2017.According to Leon, order growth will have to rebound from mid-single digits to high-single-digit-to-low teen range in both units and order value to suggest the market is as robust as 2017. However, he is skeptical due to the late stage of the economic cycle.Government data suggest new-home sales are slowing down. In addition, confidence among homebuilders is falling, despite higher pricing gains helping to at least partially offset lower order unit growth.Mortgage rates are another headwind. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage has hit 4.6%, an eight-year high.There is still a chance the booming jobs market could help buck the trend. Since President Donald Trump took office, the economy has added 2.7 million jobs, and since his tax cuts took effect there has been an average 200,000 new jobs each month. There has yet to be an accompanying jump in wages though.""Risks to our more cautious views on the housing market and new home starts would be strong job and wage income growth with mortgage rates flat to down, near 4.5%, in the next twelve months,"" Leon said. ""A slower rate of price increases would also be relief to affordability, especially in more expensive coastal markets like Seattle and (California).""And while homebuilders are skeptical, last month consumer confidence in housing was at an all-time high, according to Fannie Mae.The government-sponsored mortgage provider's Home Purchase Sentiment Index showed the confidence of those who think home prices will move even higher rose the most, while those who think it is a good time to sell came in second.The only group that reported a drop in confidence was those who think it's a good time to buy.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Analysts Bullish On Homebuilder Stocks Despite Dip — Here's WhyLGI Homes Crushed Earnings Views With Stock Already In Buy ZoneStill Bullish On Bitcoin?

1051,SEE,"Congress recently passed, and President Trump signed, the ""Right to Try"" bill that gives dying patients limited access to drugs that have not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.Our Founders would be astonished that we need such a bill. Nowhere does the U.S. Constitution give the federal government the authority to regulate the practice of medicine. And it is a very good thing that federal intervention and standards didn't begin in 1789.Standards are always based on what the authorities think are ""best practices."" Until rather recently, most medical treatment was ineffective and often quite harmful: e.g. bleeding, purging, and toxic medications like calomel (mercury). Those were nevertheless the ""standard of care,"" accepted by the American Medical Association. The chances that a patient would benefit from seeing a doctor were probably no better than 50-50.Then came scientific medicine and modern medical miracles. Antibiotics conquered many infectious diseases. I may have seen one of the last patients with a thoracoplasty — his chest wall caved in from removing ribs to collapse a tuberculous lung. Leukemia used to be incurable. Kidney failure meant rapid death.We have many wonderful treatments today. But people are still dying. Their cancer, for example, may not respond to available chemotherapy. They may have heard of a promising new remedy. But it can't possibly be approved for years, after at least a billion dollars' worth of testing. It might not work for them — but there's nothing else. It might be very toxic — just like other anti-cancer drugs. It might even kill them — but they are dying anyway.What have they got to lose?Unfortunately, they might not have much to gain from this bill. It simply expands access to drugs already in clinical trials, for which a patient might not qualify, possibly because of being too sick.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOpponents of this bill, and similar ones in various states, focus on the potential harm to society by weakening the gatekeeper role of the FDA. Patients might be enticed to spend money on ""false hope."" Potential subjects might be less willing to volunteer for clinical trials — in which there is a chance they will be ""randomized"" to not receive the new drug. ""Quacks"" might take advantage of the law. Patients who are not wealthy wouldn't be able to get experimental drugs not covered by insurance. Worst of all, future patients might not be willing to wait for the FDA — and the willingness of somebody to spend billions to win approval of a cheap or nonpatentable product that will never turn a profit.All treatments are potentially dangerous, and the dangers may not appear until many have been exposed. This is why many doctors are not ""early adopters."" The patients enrolled in formal trials are just as likely to suffer harm as those who are not. The goal is to make the world aware of the danger sooner — which will happen only if unfavorable studies are honestly published instead of being covered up. Unfortunately, the evidence base for highly touted ""evidence-based medicine"" may be highly corrupted.The ""most vulnerable"" need to be protected, we often hear. But who is actually being protected? Patients? Or the academic research establishment? The prestigious organizations that write the ""guidelines"" and determine the ""standard of care?"" The medical journals that publish the approved research? The companies that sell the extremely expensive products that have no competition? Insurers that profit more from higher premiums to cover these treatments? Pharmacy benefits managers who collect a bigger ""rebate"" on higher priced products?As Goldman Sachs pointed out, curing disease is bad for business.With speedy innovation, such as adult stem cells, ""regulators have not been able to keep up,"" according to a May 17 editorial in Nature. Therefore, scientists should consider slowing down?This ""cruel sham"" and ""ugly placebo"" powerful enough to do grave harm to the current regime won't do patients any good, it is argued. It might harm them by shortening their last 4 weeks of life or making them sicker. Should patients not be allowed to choose to take that risk, at their own expense?One must suspect that the real fear is that the treatment might actually work. If innovators were allowed to take risks, our descendants might view 2018 medicine the same way that we see the treatments of 1789. And how the modern medical equivalents of buggy-whip manufacturers would suffer!YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Health Care Premiums Will Soar Again In 2019 — Thanks, ObamaMedicare Is On Death's Door ...

1052,SEE,"Scandal: The long-awaited report from the Justice Department's inspector general about the FBI's handling of the Clinton email scandal seems to absolve the bureau of any political bias. What it really shows, however, is that the FBI — under pressure from President Obama — was just going through the motions the whole time.Most of the focus of the report in the news has been on its criticism of then FBI director James Comey. The IG says that some of his actions were ""extraordinary and insubordinate"" — a scathing indictment if there ever was one. It is another black mark on Comey's already badly tarnished reputation, and well deserved.However, the report also finds that there was ""no evidence that the conclusions by department prosecutors were affected by bias or other improper considerations.""Naturally, that's what Democrats have seized on as proof that, aside from Comey's bungling, the FBI did its job.But look at the report in its totality and you see that time and again officials made ""judgment calls"" that weakened their investigation. In other words, from the range of options available to them, they consistently chose the less aggressive course of action.It says, for instance that ""We questioned why the Midyear team"" — referring to the ""Midyear Review"" code name given to the Clinton investigation — ""did not serve subpoenas on or seek to obtain search warrants related to the last known persons to possess devices that the team was never able to locate.""At another point it says that the FBI had considered obtaining permission from the Department to review certain classified materials that may have included information potentially relevant to the investigation."" And while ""the Midyear team drafted a memorandum to the Deputy Attorney General in late May 2016 stating that review of the highly classified materials was necessary to complete the investigation and requesting permission to access them, the FBI never sent this request to the Department.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAt another it says that ""The Midyear team did not obtain or review some evidence that we found might have been useful to the investigation.""And the IG report notes that ""several members of the FBI Midyear team, including Comey, expressed concerns that the prosecutors had not been sufficiently aggressive.""It says ""the decision to allow the Clinton interview to proceed in the presence of two fact witnesses, who also were serving as Clinton's counsel, was inconsistent with typical investigative strategy and gave rise to accusations of bias and preferential treatment.""The report also notes that the reasons given for why the FBI sat on news about Anthony Weiner's laptop for almost a month were totally unconvincing. One of them was that FBI resources had been redirected to the Trump-Russia probe. But as the IG notes, the FBI had enough resources to prepare speeches, talking points and other material defending their earlier decision to drop the case.Plus, the IG did find evidence of bias.As the IG report notes, one of the agents involved in both the Clinton and Russia investigations — Peter Strzok — was texting FBI attorney Lisa Page saying things like how ""we'll stop"" Trump from being elected. This, the IG says, meant that his decisions regarding the Clinton email investigation might not have been ""free from bias.""Then there's the text from Page, regarding the interview with Clinton, saying that ""One more thing: she might be our next president. The last thing you need (is) us going in there loaded for bear. You think she's going to remember or care that it was more doj than fbi?""To that the IG said ""suggesting that investigative decisions be based on this consideration was inappropriate and created an appearance of bias.""But underlying all of this is the fact — made clear throughout the report — that the FBI never thought there was a case here to begin with.""As early as September 2015,"" it says, ""FBI and Department officials realized that they were unlikely to find evidence of intent.""And at several junctures, decisions made during the investigation were colored by the fact that the FBI had already decided they wouldn't pursue any legal action against Clinton.One example involved getting laptops from top Clinton aides.""Decisions concerning the laptops were occurring at a time when Comey and the Midyear team had already concluded that there was likely no prosecutable case and believed it was unlikely the culling laptops would change the outcome of the investigation.""The report also, whether intentionally or not, makes it clear why the FBI had concluded early on that there wasn't a case against Clinton: President Obama had already cleared Hillary of any wrongdoing.The IG report recalls how, during a 60 Minutes interview on October 11, 2015, Obama ""characterized former Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server as a 'mistake,' but stated that it did not 'pose a national security problem' and was 'not a situation in which America's national security was endangered.' Obama also stated that the issue had been 'ginned up' because of the presidential race.""It goes on to say that ""Obama's comments caused concern among FBI officials about the potential impact on the investigation.""Former EAD John Giacalone told the IG, ""We open up criminal investigations. And you have the President of the United States saying this is just a mistake ... That's a problem, right?""Obama repeated his absolution in April 2016 — right around the time Comey was starting to draft his statement dropping the case against Clinton.""Obama stated that while former Secretary Clinton had been 'careless' in managing her emails while she was Secretary of State, she would never intentionally do anything to endanger the security of the United States with her emails.""So, while the IG might not have found smoking-gun evidence of political bias in the investigation, the report makes it clear that the entire investigation was biased from the start.From Obama on down, no one ever wanted or intended to do what should have been done: Prosecute Clinton for gross negligence in her handling of highly classified material. The entire investigation was just for show.Sorry, But Obama White House, Not Dossier, Was Behind Trump InvestigationAs Evidence Piles Up, The Media Ignore The 'Other' Trump-Russia ScandalComplete coverage of the Clinton email scandal

1056,SEE,"In any given year, there's no shortage of conferences for advisors. The big question is whether to attend, given the time and expense.Sponsored by professional associations, financial services firms, tech suppliers and other groups, these multiday conferences often feature prominent speakers, training workshops and vendor booths. Advisors may also get continuing education credit for attending certain programs.Advisors rarely take the decision to attend lightly. Because they often need to travel long distances, they miss opportunities to confer with clients and run their operation if they're out of the office.""It costs you money to go, the time off work and the lost momentum of your business,"" said Tom Mosley, an advisor in Anaheim, Calif. ""So you need to make sure you get the most out of it.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMosley estimates that he's attended more than 125 conferences over his 23-year career. A former football coach, he creates what he calls ""a game plan"" before every trip.In the weeks beforehand, he reviews the conference's calendar of events along with the roster of attendees and vendors. Then he drafts a written list of individuals he wants to see and specific questions to ask them.""It takes reflection to decide what you want to accomplish when you're there,"" he said. ""Your day can get so cluttered, so it helps to have an agenda going in.""If he knows a digital marketing firm will have a booth, he will visit with a prepared set of questions. Or if a representative from a particular life insurer will attend, he might seek information on a new product from that carrier.When weighing whether to go to a conference, many advisors assess their likely return on investment. That's especially true if they run their own firm and pay for team members — from junior associates to marketing specialists — to attend as well.For Mosley, the decision involves two steps. He starts by reviewing his annual goals for his firm. If a conference promises to help him advance any of those goals, he's more apt to show up.In 2018, for example, he has three goals revolving around marketing and lead generation, staffing additions and refining internal processes. As he scans conference descriptions, he says he evaluates to what extent he ""can move the ball downfield"" on his three current objectives.When traveling to the East Coast, he arrives a day ahead. This enables him to spring into action the next morning with a full night of sleep, as sessions or breakfast meetings often start early.To retain what he learns throughout the conference, Mosley brings a stack of index cards. When he hears a great idea, he writes it on a card.""I may have 30 index cards with me after a conference, so on the plane home I'll read through them and add notes on how we can implement an idea,"" he said. ""Then I discuss them with my staff and we commit to follow through on what I've learned.""If you want to extract the most knowledge from a conference, stay alert. Drink lots of water and listen with curiosity to presenters. Ask questions and huddle afterward with experts to clarify how you can apply learning points.For many advisors, the highlight of a conference is mingling with peers from around the country. They share best practices, discuss industry trends and compare notes on tech tools.After a long day of meetings and presentations, Mosley gathers with other advisors to socialize. He finds such interaction invaluable.""It's great to listen and learn and work through some of the challenges you face,"" he said.Informal chats with advisors — as well as guest speakers and other attendees — can produce both professional insights and personal friendships.""It can be tempting to go from one speaker to the next and ignore everybody around you,"" said Alvin Carlos, a certified financial planner in Washington, D.C. ""But I like to use the breaks between sessions to talk with the people sitting next to me. And at meals, I'll sit with others and try to have meaningful conversations.""Carlos usually attends one or two conferences a year. While he earns continuing education (CE) credit in some sessions, he chooses topics based on overall relevance to his business.""Don't just focus on CE credit,"" he said. ""I've found sessions very valuable where I don't get CE credit, like focusing on ways to delegate to staff and provide more value to clients.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:Building A Successful Financial Advisory Practice?

1057,SEE,"The final day of the Morningstar Investment Conference 2018 (MIC) got underway in Chicago with a panel discussion of the pros and cons of investing in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, and blockchain, the computer-based record keeping system that underlies digital currencies.XThe four panelists ranged from advocates like Jim Sinegal, Morningstar equity analyst for banking and payments, and Adley Bowden, vice president of market analysis at PitchBook, to cryptocurrency skeptic Philip Straehl, head of capital markets and asset allocation for Morningstar's Investment Management group.Straehl said he bases investment worthiness on an asset's valuation as determined by the worth of its future cash flow — and cryptocurrencies have zero cash flow. The only thing that can raise their prices is willingness of other investors to pay more than you did, he said.Depending on what he called ""the greater fool"" to raise an asset's value makes the asset speculative, he said, and it's not something he would recommend to a client.In a press briefing before the panel session, Sinegal said cryptocurrencies may be volatile, but so are works of art by recognized artists. ""I tried to sell (Straehl) my Monet, but he said no — it has no cash flow,"" Sinegal joked.In the panel discussion, Straehl said that blockchain will likely spawn companies that benefit from that technology's development. But it is too early to identify companies whose stocks will benefit in that way.Likewise, it is also too soon to know which stocks will lose business from the growth he expects to see in blockchain. Investors should short those losers once they are identifiable, he said. Winners and losers may come from banks, securities exchanges, credit reporting companies and marketplaces, Sinegal said.In a later Wednesday morning session, David Herro, portfolio manager and chief investment officer of international equity at Harris Associates; and Diana Strandberg, director of international equity at Dodge & Cox, participated in a discussion of global equities.Herro said that as a general rule it is important for an investor to distinguish between good companies and good investments. Valuation is the key to doing that, he said.It is more difficult to determine valuation in some markets than others, the two noted investors agreed. ""We're not huge fans of certain countries, like Russia,"" Herro said.Still, investors can find good stocks in markets they are otherwise wary of, Strandberg said. Brazil's Itau Unibanco Holding (ITUB) is one such stock she likes. It was a top-five holding of $61.2 billion Dodge & Cox International Stock Fund (DODFX) as of March 31.Itau's dividend yield is 2.14%.

1072,SEE,"The headline writers adore the word ""historic."" It was ubiquitous in reporting on the April meeting between Kim Jong Un and Moon Jae-in. Kim shook Moon's hand and then guided him over the military demarcation line to step onto North Korean territory. This prompted swoons. What rot. If that was a bona fide gesture of peaceful intent, time will tell. In the meantime, let's assume it was a stunt.So, too, with the summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, though in this case the media hype couldn't compete with Trump's own. He has basked in talk of a Nobel Peace Prize and predicted that he and the butcher of Pyongyang were ""going to have a great discussion and a terrific relationship."" Obviously panting for a meeting, Trump was reportedly livid with national security adviser John Bolton, whose May comments about a ""Libya solution"" to the nuclear weapons problem apparently spooked Kim into withdrawing from the summit. Trump insisted that it was he who cancelled, just as he did with the Philadelphia Eagles' White House visit.But he showed quite a lot of ankle in his note. ""I felt a wonderful dialogue was building up between you and me,"" he cooed, closing with words conceding that it was Kim, not Trump, who had actually cancelled. ""If you change your mind having to do with this most important summit, please do not hesitate to call me or write."" Kim reeled in his catch. He sent an oversized letter Trump could pose with, grinning like a winner of the Publishers Clearing House sweepstakes.Why is our president smiling? You can always argue that democratic leaders must treat with dictators and even villains of various stripes for the sake of winning a war or securing the peace. You can even argue that sometimes presidents flatter unsavory leaders to build trust and ease tensions. But no historical comparisons can illuminate Trump's ricochets between hysterical threats (""fire and fury"") and pusillanimous praise (""very talented"") without any substantive change on the part of the dictator. What has changed since the State of the Union address in which Trump honored the memory of Otto Warmbier and detailed the atrocities of the North Korean regime? In gratitude for the exchange of pleasantries, the release of a few hostages and vague offers of ""denuclearization,"" Trump has made himself Kim's doormat.As a matter of substance, the Singapore summit achieved less than nothing. It was a profound defeat for U.S. world influence and for democratic decency, arguably the worst summit outcome since Yalta. Kim promised to consider ""denuclearization,"" exactly as his father and grandfather had done repeatedly over the past several decades — breaking their promises each and every time. For this puff of cotton candy, Trump agreed to halt ""U.S. war games"" (using the North Korean term for joint military exercises with South Korea), which Trump himself called provocative! He invited Kim to the White House. He also issued the risible tweet announcing, ahem, peace in our time: ""There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIt's difficult to determine just how stupid Trump thinks the American people are. But there is no question that Trump's affection for strongmen and thugs, evident before in his praise of the Chinese murderers of Tiananmen and his warm words for Vladimir Putin, Rodrigo Duterte and Xi Jinping, has now extended to the worst tyrant/killer on the planet. Trump did far more than overlook Kim's atrocious human rights abuses; he became Kim's PR man: ""He's a very talented man, and I also learned he loves his country very much."" He has a ""great personality"" and is ""very smart.""Trump granted Kim's legitimacy: ""His country does love him. His people, you see the fervor. They have a great fervor.""In 2014, a United Nations report concluded that North Korea's crimes against humanity ""entail extermination, murder, enslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other sexual violence, persecution on political, religious, racial and gender grounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced disappearance of persons and the inhumane act of knowingly causing prolonged starvation.""What of all that? Trump is understanding, even impressed. ""Hey, he's a tough guy. When you take over a country — a tough country, tough people — and you take it over from your father, I don't care who you are, what you are, how much of an advantage you have. If you can do that at 27 years old, I mean, that's one in 10,000 that could do that. So he's a very smart guy. He's a great negotiator.""What was Trump's chief argument in 2016? The U.S. had been the victim of ""bad deals"" with other countries and he was the great deal-maker. He fingered the Iran deal as the worst deal in history. His defenders will excuse the truckling to Kim as a clever gambit to extract concessions. But Kim has offered absolutely nothing. All of the concessions have come from the United States, including the most crucial one: We've put ourselves on the same moral plane as North Korea. That's what Make America Great Again has achieved.Trump's High-Risk Game Of Nuclear 'Deal Or No Deal' With North Korea's KimTrump Gets High Marks For Handling North Korea: IBD/TIPP Poll
"
1073,SEE,"When PayPal (PYPL) split from online auction site eBay (EBAY) in 2015, Wall Street wondered whether the digital-payments provider would truly find its place in the world of ushering money between people online.XCould it stand up to Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA), they wondered. Would it be able to justify its existence alongside Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google? Could it compete with basically any of the large banks, who had plenty of reasons to offer payment services themselves?Rather than go to war, PayPal has reached truces, of sorts, with those and other companies since the spin-off from eBay. The strategy has sent its stock on a marathon run higher. It's also extended the company's reach online, into the muscle memory of smartphone users, and into any moment where someone might think to pay for something. It has also given PayPal a foothold in actual, physical stores, which still make up the vast majority of retail.Today, PayPal users can draw on a Mastercard or Visa card or their bank account to pay for something via their phone in such retail locations. In May, PayPal said users would be able to pay for stuff on Gmail, YouTube and other locations in the Google ecosphere. PayPal last year struck a deal with Facebook that allowed someone to send money via Facebook Messenger.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""That's really helped them become much more of a partner, obviously, than a competitor with a lot of these companies,"" Edward Jones analyst Josh Olson said. ""I think that's helped ease Wall Street's concerns about whether a big tech company would just leapfrog them or make their technology obsolete.""The company also counts Bank of America (BAC) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) as partners, and is trying to attract more people without bank accounts. In moves abroad, the company last year struck a deal with Chinese search giant Baidu (BIDU) to let Baidu Wallet holders buy things from PayPal merchants.In May, it announced the $2.2 billion purchase of iZettle, a Stockholm-based company sometimes called the Square (SQ) of Europe. The deal is likely to put PayPal's technology into retail outlets across that continent as well as Latin America.How sustainable these partnerships are over the long term remains an open question. Competition from Square, best known for the card readers often used by small businesses, is nothing to sneeze at. PayPal's margins have been under pressure as it chases bigger customers, Olson says. EBay's decision this year to eventually handle more payments on its own — rather than PayPal — is a big deal.But for now, analysts suggest that more freedom from eBay has allowed PayPal to come into its own. The collaboration-over-competition approach, along with the growing ease and popularity of online payments, has sent its stock up 126% since the company's 2015 spinoff. Over the past year alone, the stock is up nearly 60% and maintains an IBD Composite Rating of 96. Shares were down fractionally to 85.31 Friday.Even as competition escalates, the company in May said it was targeting around a 20% compound annual earnings per share growth rate over the next three to five years. Over that time, it also forecasts expanding adjusted operating margins and 17%-18% compound annual sales growth, when factoring foreign exchange fluctuations.In years past, the firm tried to encourage customers to link their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts. The practice helped the company avoid paying fees to the credit card networks, making those companies dyspeptic. Visa's chief executive in 2016 warned that the card network could try to compete with the payments company ""in ways that people have never seen before.""PayPal eventually backed off, agreeing later that year to partner with Visa. The agreement expanded the ""acceptance for PayPal's digital wallet to all physical retail locations where Visa contactless transactions are enabled,"" according to a statement announcing the deal.The deal also allowed customers to instantly move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via a Visa debit card, that statement said. Shortly after, PayPal and Mastercard announced a similar pact that expanded an existing partnership.""It just made it a lot easier for individual consumers to sign up for PayPal,"" William Blair analyst Bob Napoli said of its increased flexibility.The company's active customer accounts grew 15% last year. In the first quarter, reported in April, it added 8.1 million active accounts, with payment transactions up 25%. The company has 218 million active users in more than 200 markets. It processes around one in every six dollars spent online, according to Edward Jones.""Embracing the traditional payment ecosystem was a positive in many investors' eyes,"" Baird analyst Colin Sebastian said.What's more, analysts say, the company's technology is good, and it works on lots of things with which you can make payments. Its One Touch technology allows customers to buy things online without entering their password and other information. The company rolled out its own cash-back credit card last summer. The company was testing a Venmo debit card, Recode reported earlier last year.As PayPal makes it easier to pay for things, businesses have taken notice. The company has some 19 million merchant accounts, most of them small to midsize businesses.""I think, (they) have signed up, and continue to sign up, more merchants post-spinoff from eBay that maybe wouldn't have been able to sign when they were part of eBay,"" Napoli said.Still, a big chunk of PayPal's financials hinge on eBay's auction activity. EBay acquired the company in 2002 to make it easier for eBay's buyers and sellers to pay or get paid online. Last year, PayPal drew around a fifth of its revenue from customers on eBay's Marketplaces platform.But in January, the online auction platform said it would begin managing payments on its own. It said that process will be a ""—multiyear journey."" EBay also said it would use Adyen, a Netherlands-based company, as its payments processor. PayPal's stock crashed on eBay's announcement. PayPal will remain a payment option on eBay until mid-2023.The payments company seems likely to compensate by reeling in bigger retailers elsewhere. But Olson notes that its pursuit of larger customers has weighed on margins. Those companies have more bargaining power to negotiate lower fees, he says.Analysts also debate whether it has the upper hand on Square, the payments company best known for its credit-card readers used by small businesses. Square also is stepping up efforts to compete with PayPal via acquisitions.On one hand, PayPal has a massive network of millions of users. The purchase of iZettle would unite PayPal's immense digital platform with iZettle's card readers and software tools for small businesses. But small businesses comprise the turf upon which Square has built much of its reputation.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) still has Apple Pay, although PayPal last year landed a deal to allow iTunes users to buy things with PayPal. The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon (AMZN) was looking into developing something similar to a branded checking account. As long as tech and financial companies work in the payments business, friction could wear at PayPal's partnerships.""Long-term, it's harder to say,"" Sebastian said of how those partnerships will hold up. ""PayPal still has many elements of duplicating what a credit card offers.""So there's always the prospect, if PayPal were to potentially turn (to) a competitive angle vs. a partnership angle,"" he said. ""But I certainly don't foresee that in the near term or the medium term.""RELATED LINKS:Square, PayPal Lead These 5 Financial Stocks In Or Near Buy ZonesBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStock Spotlight List Adds 8 For Your Best Stocks To Buy And WatchSquare Rival Testing Buy Zone After Biggest Acquisition Since eBay Spinoff

What managers aren't sure of is whether the pace of corporate earnings growth — and thus the outlook for growth stocks — will continue to speed up.""We continue to see a constructive environment for earnings,"" said Charles Shriver, lead manager of $2.5 billion T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $437.4 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. ""But earnings may have hit a peak in the first quarter. We do still see opportunities. But they will be driven more by individual names.""But John Wilson, lead manager of $3.8 billion Columbia Large Cap Growth Fund (LEGAX), sees an ongoing clear runway for growth stocks in the technology space, where he finds the bulk of his opportunities. ""We continue to have a strong earnings backdrop,"" he said. ""In technology in May, we saw a continuation of many of the same trends we saw in 2017: strength as companies moved to digitize their business operations, and an ongoing move to more digitization moving forward.""And digitization is getting a boost from federal government policy. ""A lot of companies have additional cash flow from tax reform last year, so we see companies deploying that within technology and other capital projects to improve their competitiveness,"" Wilson said. ""That helped outperformance in May by technology stocks and growth stocks more broadly.""The S&P 500 gained 2.41% in May.

""When there is concern about overseas events, U.S. small caps tend to outperform,"" Wilson said.Reflecting that tilt toward U.S. stocks, world equity funds lagged U.S. diversified stock funds, losing 1.09% on average last month.China region funds were the only foreign stock fund category to gain in May, climbing 2.82%. In sharp contrast, Latin American funds plunged 12.48%.Among sectors, science/technology funds outpaced all other categories, gaining 6.29% in May. Global sci-tech funds were close behind, rising 6.12%. Health/biotechnology funds tacked on 4.82%. The energy sector was also strong.Wilson said the digitization trend benefits growth stocks that enable customers to shift to cloud computing from on-premise software. It also benefits companies that are involved in digital advertising and marketing, he said. ""Whether it is Microsoft (MSFT) or Adobe (ADBE) or Salesforce.com (CRM) or ServiceNow (NOW), we're seeing strong end demand drivers based on the need for a lot of corporate America to take important steps to make themselves part of the growth in the digital economy,"" Wilson said.Microsoft continues to benefit from growth in its Azure cloud computing service. ""Microsoft is doing a strong job of using their legacy enterprise relationships to help companies migrate their business processes and operations to the cloud,"" Wilson said.Wilson added that corporate America sees the shift to the cloud as a key strategy for survival.

1097,SEE,"Utility stocks ran at the top and the bottom of the S&P 500 in an unusual session Monday. Sempra Energy (SRE) soared 15%, spurred by interest from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. PG&E (PCG) tanked almost 5% on liability concerns related to last year's Northern California wildfires.Both are diversified utilities, dealing with both power generation and natural gas. (For updates on this story and other market coverage, visit Stock Market Today.)Only one other utility stock in the 34-stock diversified industry group, Allete (ALE), moved more than 2%. Duluth, Minn.-based Allete dropped 2.5%. The result left the overall Utility-Diversified group up 0.4% for the day.A letter from Paul Singer's Elliott Management to Sempra's board outlined changes that the activist investor would like to see in order for the company to unlock investor value. Those changes included replacing six board members, as well as launching a strategic review of operations and assets.Elliott Management is a hedge fund with $34 billion in assets under management. The fund had played a key role in guiding Sempra, based in San Diego, to pay $9.45 billion to acquire Energy Futures Holdings. EFH held an 80% stake in Dallas-based power producer Oncor.At the time of the sale, Oncor reported more than 11 million customers. That lifted Sempra's total to more than 43 million. Elliott Associates, Elliott International and partner Bluescape Resources reportedly hold a 4.9% stake in Sempra. The letter to Sempra estimates that the utility can unlock between $11 billion and $16 billion in value. That would translate roughly to a $139 to $159 per share boost to the utility stock.In San Francisco, PG&E said Monday that it anticipates a ""significant liability"" after a California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection report released Friday found PG&E equipment had caused at least 12 of the 24 blazes that tore through California's wine country in October. The fires killed 44 people and caused an estimated $10 billion in damage.The state is still investigating the Tubbs Fire. The largest fire in California's history, Tubbs was part of the overall October conflagration, responsible for 24 deaths. PG&E claims that fire was started by a power line installed and owned by a private property owner.Uncertainty over liabilities led PG&E to suspend its dividend in December. On Monday, Wells Fargo kept its market perform rating on the stock, and lowered the price target to 46, from 48. Investment research firm CFRA carved its price target to 36, from 46, and downgraded the stock to strong sell, from hold.PG&E dived more than 8% in opening trade, then eased to a 4% loss. That put shares down 45% since September 15.RELATED:This Tool Is An Investor's Best Friend; Do You Know How To Use It?Mining Giant Makes These Big Moves On Car Battery MetalsThis Stock May Go Totally Bonkers When Earnings Come Out LateRussia Hacks U.S. Nuclear Plants, Infrastructure 'Hundreds Of Thousands Of Times A Day'Energy Future Holdings, One Of The Largest-Ever Energy Bankruptcies, Nears Finish

HealthEquity stock, which ranked No. 19 on the IBD 50, has rocketed by more than 60% since the start of the year, and is extended from a five-week flat base. A good earnings beat could see it smash through into profit-taking zone, though poor results would see it pare gains.

Several alternative versions of Bitcoin, so-called alt coins, appeared to have been stolen by the hackers.The exchange said it is cooperating with a police investigation into the hacking. Trading has been suspended since the attack.The South Korean news outlet, Yonhap News Agency, estimated that about $37 million worth of the digital currency was taken during the heist, Reuters said.While many major Korean cryptocurrency exchanges adopted measures to protect users in January, this was not one of them.""Coinrail is not a member of the group that promotes self-regulations to enhance security,"" Korea Blockchain Industry Association representative Kim Jin-Hwa said. ""It is a minor player in the market and I can see how such small exchanges with lower standards on security level can be exposed to more risks.""Hacking has been a consistent problem for cryptocurrency exchanges, despite the purported security of Bitcoin itself.

And fellow Japan-based exchange Mt. Gox filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing another $500 million worth of Bitcoin. At its height, the exchange had handled more than 80% of the world's trades in the cryptocurrency.According to Coinmarketcap.com, Coinrail was the 98th largest cryptocurrency exchange.Meanwhile, short-seller James Chanos has warned that cryptocurrencies could have their value wiped out by a financial crisis.""For those who believe that you need to own digital currency as a store of value in the worst-case scenario, that's exactly the case in which a digital currency will work the least,"" Chanos said in an interview with the Institute for New Economic Thinking.

Oil rallied sharply.Meanwhile, software stocks dropped en masse, pressuring the Nasdaq. Chip equipment firms, including Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT), also took it hard on the chin. Both of these former big winners in 2017 are now in basing mode.At 2:15 p.m. ET, the tech-centered composite fell 0.9%, slightly cutting early losses. The Nasdaq 100 slumped 1.2%, poised to halt a four-day winning streak. The S&P 500 traded virtually flat, down 0.1%.

Over the same time frame, the Nasdaq composite has gained 13%.However, please check out the MarketSmith daily chart on Tesla, and you'll see that Tesla is having some trouble climbing back above the 200-day moving average.The 200-day line traces the average closing price of a stock over the past 200 trading sessions, or roughly 10 months' worth of action. As a growth investor, you want to see a stock rise not only above its 50-day moving average but the 200-day line as well.Most of the top dogs in the IBD 50 show such a trend. They're hitting new highs, leading their 50- and 200-day moving averages higher.On the positive side, Tesla now stands just 17% below its 52-week and all-time peak of 389.61. That price represents a fantastic gain since the transportation innovator initially broke out of a stage-one base near 40 back in April 2013.The current base is first stage. Watch to see if the stock can keep muscling higher, slashing through a very visible overhead supply of willing sellers at the 350 to 360 price range.Tesla's sales jumped 68% last year to $11.76 billion, breaking the $10 billion barrier. But the Palo Alto, Calif., company also lost $8.66 a share.

The global car and truck titan had $265 billion in sales in 2017, up 4%.Toyota shares are forming a saucer with a droopy-looking handle. In a bull market, the handle should show a maximum decline of 8% to 12% from high to low. In Toyota's case, the correction within its three-week handle is an acceptable 9%.

1102,SEE,"Through Thursday's close, the medical sector ranked No. 5 among the 33 broad sectors that IBD tracks for middle and long-term performance. The sector has rallied 16% since Jan. 1. So, IBD readers will likely not be surprised to see as many as four of the 16 individual stocks that hit the Sector Leaders screen come from this key section of the economy.With unemployment near record lows and consumer spending revving up, medical care firms stand to benefit. Americans are more willing to spend on improving their health. In IBD's rankings of 197 industry groups (please see Page B7 in IBD Weekly), the medical products group ranks No. 1 in six-month progress, up from 11th six weeks ago. The group has risen 24% since Jan. 1. One of the group's big winners, Abiomed (ABMD), has vaulted 118%.When was the right time to pick up shares in the innovator of heart pumps? A true market leader will storm out of bases throughout its run. Bases are nothing more than periods of time when a stock peaks, corrects in price, bottoms out, rises back near the old highs, and breaks out to new highs.For Abiomed, a five-week flat base with a 200.38 correct buy point produced a breakout on Jan. 5. In April it broke out of another flat base at 304.38.If a good stock has broken out, look for rebounds off the 10-week moving average. The first two instances offer a secondary opportunity to establish a position or add a small amount of shares to an existing one. Abiomed bounced off its 10-week line near 290 during the week ended April 27. Volume increased above the 10-week average. Then the next week, turnover really shot up as the large-cap medical device firm rallied 16% and hit new highs.Align Technology (ALGN), HealthEquity (HQY) and Supernus Pharmaceuticals (SUPN) have also gone on steep run-ups after their breakouts.Notice on a weekly chart how Align, developer of the Invisalign orthodontic braces, has staged a seven-week winning streak. Along the way, the stock cleared a 280.33 entry within a base that showed the essential elements of a cup with handle. Align is very close to rising 25% past that prime buy point.Taking most of your profits by selling winners at 20%-25% is smart portfolio management. You can hold shares longer in high-conviction plays.

1105,SEE,"IBD Leaderboard play Netflix and other FAANG stocks helped the Nasdaq limit losses in stocks today after the Federal Reserve boosted short-term interest rates for the second time this year.The U.S. central bank has now raised the cost of borrowing money by a quarter point for the seventh time since it began doing so in December 2015.The Nasdaq composite gained around 0.3% and hit new all-time highs Wednesday before cooling off on the Fed's 2 p.m. ET announcement.In its statement, the FOMC committee expressed confidence that the U.S. economy is growing stronger, as ""activity has been rising at a solid rate."" In the Fed's May 2 news release, the central bank noted that the U.S. economy was rising at ""a moderate rate.""At the session high of 7748, the index has now marched 12.2% higher since Jan. 1. On IBD Leaderboard, the year-to-date gains have been steeper.Lululemon (LULU), which initially joined the Leaders list on Leaderboard on Feb. 7, has jumped 61% since Jan. 1. Shares in the premium-priced yogawear and sports apparel firm have also ramped up more than 50% since it roared off the 10-week moving average in late March, triggering a buy signal. On Wednesday, the stock backtracked into slightly negative territory after rising 1.9% to as high as 127.34.Fast-growing Etsy (ETSY) and Five Below (FIVE), two more consumer spending-oriented names on Leaderboard, have also scored market-smashing gains.The S&P 500 fell 0.2% as declines in wood products, homebuilding, mortgage service, paper, auto parts, department store and oil and gas machinery stocks offset strength in wholesale drug supply, movie, gaming software, drugstore chain and computer networking firms.The Dow Jones industrial average eased less than 0.2%. The Dow Jones utility average fell fractionally, but at 665 the sector index has dropped more than 8% so far this year. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond rose 3 basis points to 2.99%, still below its May 17 peak of 3.11%.Volume is running sharply higher on both the Nasdaq and the NYSE vs. the same time Tuesday.Going back to Netflix, shares bolted more than 4% higher and got as high as 384.25. Volume is running at a 127% faster than usual pace after Goldman Sachs reportedly boosted its long-term price target to $490 from $390. Analyst Heath Terry forecast that in 2019 the video streaming firm would garner 32.5 million net new subscribers. That well exceeds Wall Street's consensus estimate of 26 million net new adds.The very best companies in terms of fundamentals and stock price strength are able to launch breakouts from third, fourth, and even fifth stage bases. But later-stage bases always carry a higher risk of failure and a significant price correction.Netflix hauled out of a first-stage base at 107.07 in October 2016, then broke out again in the week ended July 21, 2017. Shares cleared a 166.97 buy point in a six-week cuplike base, then ramped up more than 20% before forming a third-stage base.More recently, Netflix surpassed a 338.92 follow-on entry point after testing support at the 10-week moving average in both March and April.In the year 2009, Netflix scored $1.67 billion in annual revenue. Last year, the top line grew 32% vs. the prior year to $11.69 billion. So over the past eight years, Netflix's revenue has not only risen 600%, but it's also achieved a compounded annual growth rate of 27%.Earnings have climbed from 28 cents a share to $1.25 over the same time frame.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters see the Los Gatos, Calif., company growing earnings 129% this year to $2.86 a share on a 38% jump in revenue to $16.1 billion.The Street also sees Netflix's top line shattering the $20 billion barrier in 2019.Other FAANG stocks continue to act well.Alphabet (GOOGL) edged up 0.2% for a third up day in a row. The Google search engine owner has formed a seven-day handle on its new double bottom.In Alphabet's double bottom base, the second sell-off took shares down to 984, undercutting the early February sell-off low of 997.An undercut of the first low is good action within this type of base, and the middle peak in between the two sell-offs plus 10 cents offers a standard buy point.So in Alphabet's case, the buy point of 1,178.26 offers a proper entry for growth investors. But the new downward slanting handle, formed in light volume, offers a lower buy point at 1,161.20.Microsoft (MSFT), part of the so-called ""FAAMG"" megacap tech clan, continues to inch higher and is near new highs. At 101.33, the cloud computing, business software and computer and video game console giant remains within the 5% buy zone after a breakout past 97.34 in a six-week flat base.In the March-ended fiscal third quarter, Microsoft posted a 16% boost in earnings to 95 cents a share. That's on top of a 30% increase in the year-ago quarter. Fiscal Q3 revenue accelerated 16% to $26.82 billion. That marked the biggest year-over-year top-line increase in 14 quarters.In other stocks today, TAL Education (TAL), ranking No. 9 in the IBD 50, fell sharply on reports that short selling firm Muddy Waters said it's sold shares short. The Carson Block-led firm reportedly accused the for-profit school operator of overstating its earnings from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2018, ended in February that year.The stock slumped as much 16% to a session low of 38.41 before recouping some of those losses. The stock undercut the 50-day moving average but quickly gained institutional buying support.On May 10, TAL broke out of a six-week cup without handle, but heavy volume was absent. Ideally, a breakout should involve a minimum 40% to 50% increase in volume vs. the 50-day average.All daily charts in Investors.com and MarketSmith show the 50-day average turnover as a red line drawn across the volume bars at the bottom of each chart.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on growth stocks, charts, buy points, proper sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:How Are The Top Growth Stocks Faring?

1107,SEE,"In fall 2015, a friend of mine suggested that we go see Trump at a rally in Richmond, Virginia. Back before Beltway boys like me took him seriously, it still seemed like he was just doing it for publicity. So why not go, just for the joke of it all?But when we got to the rally, I realized it wasn't a joke at all. The enormous crowd in Richmond wasn't there for entertainment value. The crowd included folks from all walks of life, not just crackpots. Old people and young people. Men in suits. Bikers with tons of tattoos. Nurses still in their scrubs.While I was still skeptical, the event forced me to realize that I didn't understand large parts of the country as well as I thought I did: globalization had not been as generous to everyone as it had to guys like me; America was genuinely not as great as it had been or could be for many people.Conventional, conservative economic wisdom has always been that free and open trade is mutually beneficial to trading partners. America's prosperity stems in part from the fact that nothing barred the exchange of goods, capital, and labor across state borders. In its role as a super power it carried that lesson around the world and championed today's global trading system.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNot only is trade good for prosperity, but it's good for peace. As Thomas Friedman wrote, in a contemporary twist to Bastiat's maxim ""when good cross borders, armies don't,"" no two countries with McDonald's have ever gone to war. (Still mostly true.)But just because open trade is mostly good for most people, doesn't mean that it's all good for all people. After 70 years of putting conventional wisdom into practice, it is apparent that trade deals that helped my S&P index fund could have had unintended consequences for people in the Rustbelt or Richmond. Elites now know the peril of condescendingly dismissing their fellow citizens' frustration with the consequences of increasingly imbalanced trade policy.So when the President announced that he wants to re-examine modern trade arrangements, such as the recent move on tariffs on steel and aluminum, I have learned to exercise a measure of humility, just as I did a rally in 2015. Questioning the status quo, if Americans' livelihoods are on the line, hardly presages a trade war death spiral into the second Great Depression. Although I have disagreed with specific protectionist sentiments on solar technology, airline travel, and washing machines,  challenging the status quo on trade policy has merit.Getting less attention than the threat of tariffs on metal is the current call for the same on newsprint paper made in Canadian. The Commerce Department has imposed stiff duties on Canadian newsprint, not in response to displaced workers in America's heartland, paper mills in Maine, or other forest product companies, but at the behest of a single Washington State paper producer seeking protection from competition.NORPAC has demanded duties of up to 32% on the purchase price of Canadian paper used in newsprint and other publications. This duty is needed, supposedly, to offset subsidized paper being dumped into American markets. While Commerce is already assigning preliminary countervailing and anti-dumping duties at the border — some more than 50% from the combined cases — the International Trade Commission will investigate, vote and issue the ITC reasoning in September.But this entire request is, in the parlance of our time, problematic.U.S. law provides remedies for workers against unfair or illegal trade practices, but this is hardly an example of that. NORPAC has cried foul yet failed to demonstrate that Canadian imports are harming the domestic industry.More than 90% of Canadian newsprint comes into the Midwest and Northeast, according to the ITC's preliminary investigation, and only 4.6% enters the Pacific Northwest, where NORPAC operates. Transportation costs are too high to ship newsprint produced in the Northwest as far as the Midwest or Northeast.Indeed, helping NORPAC with these tariffs would hurt the U.S. businesses that buy Canadian paper. Paper duties against Canada are opposed by state economic development departments; chambers of commerce; a wide range of local, state and federal officials; the American Forest and Paper Association; and lots and lots of newspapers.One-off tariffs on Canadian newsprint are not in line with Trump's trade policy overhaul. Frivolous claims like this undermine a more serious re-evaluation of larger policies. Owned by a New York equity fund, NORPAC doesn't represent the printing industry or mom-and-pop stores pushed out of business by globalization.This isn't a remedy to help struggling workers; it's crony capitalism to help a handful of investors trying to manipulate trade laws.

1109,SEE,"In a tune-up for this week's U.S. Open, Tiger Woods played at the Memorial Tournament two weeks ago.  Peyton Manning and Woods were paired in the Memorial's pro-am.On the face of it, the celebrity combination was hardly news.  This is the norm ahead of upper tier golf tournaments.  Except that there was arguably greater meaning to it well beyond golf. Manning and Woods are a reminder that the nature of work keeps changing, and always for the better.For background, two years ago Manning hung it up after a Hall of Fame NFL career capped by a Super Bowl victory.  His retirement press conference was notable for him fighting back tears as he talked about giving up a profession about which he was intensely passionate.As an emotional Manning put it at the time, ""I revere football, I love the game, so, you don't have to wonder if I'll miss it. Absolutely, absolutely I will ...""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseDifficult as it was for his millions of fans to see Manning call it quits, it was even more difficult for Manning.As for Woods, it wasn't too long ago that his ability to continue playing competitive golf was very much in question.  Persistent back troubles had many thinking his career was over.That Woods is back is a big deal for golf fans, but an even bigger deal for Woods himself. He described his return as a ""blessing"" since even his back surgeon felt the golf in his future would at best be weekend rounds with friends. Woods wasn't sure himself.Thankfully he persisted.  With a work ethic that is unrivaled, Woods fought his way back to a level of play that has many thinking he'll soon resume his winning ways.  This includes the ""Grand Slam"" tournament victories that were long his signature.What's intriguing about all this is that Manning didn't want to retire as much as age forced him to. Woods didn't want to stop playing golf as much as nature caught up to him.  Though each can claim financial wealth that can be measured in the nine figures, neither lost his herculean work ethic.Since football and golf reinforced the individual brilliance of each, the idea of retirement was something neither wanted to contemplate.  Work was too much fun, and too fulfilling.That Manning loved his work and Woods loves his is a reminder of the genius of capitalism.  Lest readers forget, individuals born in the U.S. 150 years ago faced 50/50 odds that they would spend their working lives on a farm, six days a week. There was very little thought among young people back in the 19th century about what they would do when they grew up.  Their career paths were very much a given, regardless of whether they loved or loathed agricultural toil.And then ""robots"" came along.  The labor-saving devices that were the back hoe, tractor and fertilizer made it possible for more and more food to be raised and grown with fewer and fewer hands.  But as opposed to putting tens of millions of ""displaced"" American workers into breadlines, these advances freed them up to do work more associated with their unique skills and intelligence.Some cured disease, others got to work on cars and airplanes and computers, and still others found opportunity in entertainment. With technology having rendered the provision of food less backbreaking and time consuming, there was growing demand for activities associated with leisure as the six day work week shrank to five.The professions of Woods and Manning are very much an effect of economic progress that has relentlessly destroyed the jobs of the past so that individuals could increasingly specialize. While Woods and Manning are most definitely outliers, it's a testament to prosperity that if able, they would never retire.The latter is a certain triumph of free enterprise, and it's increasingly the norm away from professional sports too. Indeed, all of us know people who regularly proclaim their desire to work forever. All of us know people who don't take all the vacation allotted to them simply because work is where they get to be superstars.It's all a reminder that robots and other forms of automation won't put us out of work as much as they'll cause a growing number of us to fall in love with it.  Just as the division of labor among humans elevates us all through increased specialization, automation will enhance the latter in exponential fashion.The result of this technological advance, as opposed to sloth, promises more and more Mannings and Woods, working feverishly each day to elongate the fun that is work.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

To strengthen your observational skills:Get ready. Lay the groundwork to absorb more details by mentally priming your brain. Filter sensory input so that you're ready to focus on what matters most.Before entering a meeting, for example, ask yourself, ""What people do I need to pay the most attention to?""

""Prethought helps you be more present and heightens your overall awareness.""Stay in the moment. If you tend to dwell on past incidents or fret about the future, you can wind up overlooking what's happening now.

1150,SEE,"Is a break below the 10-week moving average a key sell rule? Yes. But there are times when you shouldn't sell.Using good sell signals properly to turn paper gains into concrete profits is a cornerstone of IBD-style investing. But you also don't want to sell prematurely when a stock's terrific run-up is simply taking a pause.If a stock is truly poised to etch its ultimate peak or go into a full-blown correction, it will certainly fall below the 10-week moving average. But the stock should undercut the 10-week line severely. And IBD's founder Bill O'Neil has said he wants to see weekly volume pop at least 40% higher vs. the 10-week moving average of volume before taking action.So, what if volume in the down week was dull? If you have a big enough profit cushion, hold. Give it some rope. Great stocks rebound quickly. Or they may be building a new base. If the stock finishes in the upper half of the weekly price range, you can infer that big institutions are swooping in to grab shares at what they deem to be reasonable prices. They are quietly expressing confidence in the company's long-term course.Here's an outstanding example. See the weekly chart of Abiomed (ABMD). The heart pump innovator broke out of a long cup with handle at 126.49 in April 2017 and rallied 58% in 31 weeks.During that nifty run, how many times did the stock finish the trading week beneath the 10-week moving average? Zero.It finally happened during the week ended Dec. 15. Abiomed closed at 188.71, losing 1.4% that week. The 10-week moving average, which graphs the average weekly closing price over the past 10 weeks, stood at 188.84. But volume was whisper-like, 25% below average. The mild price-and-volume action signaled to holders that one could sit tight.The Danvers, Mass., firm soon completed a five-week flat base. Shares broke out past a 200.38 buy point on Jan. 5. Volume after the new year holiday was light. But trading picked up. On Jan. 16, Abiomed climbed past 218; volume surged 88% above the 50-day average.Back in June 2017, Grubhub (GRUB) may have disappointed some investors when it flipped 8.6% lower during the week ended June 30. A week prior, shares bolted 10% higher. A big drop like that after a big gain like that sure leaves a sour taste in the mouth, no?But let's look at the volume.In that week, Grubhub traded 14.4 million shares, 15% higher than its 10-week average. (On IBD and MarketSmith weekly charts, the volume bars also feature a line that shows the 10-week moving average.) That's active, but it falls short of the 40% minimum jump that would normally spur a sell decision.The Chicago-based mobile food ordering giant also held a mild gain above a 42.35 buy point in an elongated double-bottom base. Right move? No move. Grubhub spent the next week mildly beneath the 10-week line, then made savory gains over the next five weeks.Another pullback beneath the 10-week line during the week ended Sept. 22 proved mild. Volume rose just 19% above average, and Grubhub nearly finished in the upper half of the week's price range. Grubhub broke out of a cup without handle at 57.71 in October and has climbed more than 90%.IBD Leaderboard name Five Below (FIVE) sank 6% during the week ended Feb. 2 as the major indexes began their first intermediate correction in 2018. But volume was light, 13% below average.The 33% swan dive by Kemet (KEM) during the week ended Nov. 3 marked a good time to sell, especially if your gains were limited.

1151,SEE,"Think of Red Hat (RHT) as a technology company that has reinvented itself not just once, but twice in 15 years.There aren't too many of those around — Netflix (NFLX) comes to mind. And the payoff can be huge for companies that manage to pull it off.While Netflix morphed from DVD renter to movie streamer to new-age Hollywood powerhouse, Red Hat's reinvention is tied to the rise of cloud computing. Like many traditional suppliers of information technology, it has been pressured to adapt.""Red Hat has gambled on a couple of significant cloud technologies or trends,"" said Dennis Smith, an analyst at Gartner Group. ""One of them has come up aces. That's container technology and container adoption. The other bet is on a multicloud strategy. The jury is still out on that.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe software maker's original claim to fame: It led the commercialization of Linux open-source software. Its Linux operating system runs servers in data centers operated by most large U.S. companies.Two years ago, bearish analysts said Red Hat faced a day of reckoning as Corporate America shifted more business workloads to cloud-computing specialists like Amazon Web Services, part of Amazon.com (AMZN).""Public"" cloud service providers rent customers shared computing infrastructure, including servers and data storage systems. Aside from AWS, the biggest cloud players are Microsoft's (MSFT) Azure, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google and IBM (IBM).Bearish analysts warned that companies would buy less of Red Hat's software for their private data centers and that it could be shut out from the cloud. One worry was that Amazon Web Services offered customers its own version of open-source Linux for free.But Red Hat already pivoted from its core Linux business. The company aimed to build a cloud-friendly app development platform.It also charged into a new cloud technology called containers. By using Red Hat's software containers, corporate developers build custom apps in private data centers and move workloads to public clouds.Red Hat's OpenShift platform combines Linux, container technology, cloud automation tools and software-defined networking for data storage. The OpenShift cloud product is priced 10 times higher than Red Hat's enterprise Linux software.""Our software runs everywhere, (in) on-premise and multiple public clouds. That's part of the story,"" Chief Executive James Whitehurst told Investor's Business Daily in an interview.""The other piece of the story is that, oh, Red Hat isn't dead. It has a much larger addressable market opportunity because Linux is only so big but this next thing is potentially 10 times larger,"" Whitehurst added. ""That combination — Red Hat is not dead and its addressable market — is why you're seeing so much interest in Red Hat and the stock.""Cloud computing marks the latest evolution in Red Hat's business model. In the early 1990s, Red Hat developed its own version of Linux, open-source software. The company gave the software away for free, then sold shrink-wrapped boxed versions in hopes of making money from technical support.A decade later, the Raleigh, N.C.-based company released Red Hat Enterprise Linux for corporate customers. With additional features, RHEL targeted computer servers in on-premise data centers.RHEL enabled the software maker to shift to a subscription-based business model. The company provided customers with software updates via the web.Red Hat next moved into virtualization, or software that enables servers to share business workloads. In that market, it took on powerhouses VMware (VMW) and Microsoft.As the tech industry slowly bounced back from the 2008-09 global recession, Red Hat stock did OK. But it never caught on fire like that of Salesforce.com (CRM), the leader in software-as-a-service. One investor concern was that Red Hat's Linux-related growth might be limited as new rivals leveraged open-source software.In 2017, Red Hat showed signs of gaining traction in cloud computing. Analysts focused on its early lead in container technology. Shares shot up 71% in 2017 and have gained 40% this year.Revenue rose 21% to $2.98 billion in the year ended Feb. 28. Adjusted profit increased 31% to $2.98 a share.At its analyst day in May, the company said its emerging technology segment now has an annual $200 million run rate. Most of that comes from cloud revenue, such as OpenShift.""While RHEL still stands at Red Hat's core, it is clear that OpenShift is its future,"" Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron said in a report to clients.Gartner's Smith says that large RHEL customers have given OpenShift a boost. He says it's unclear if OpenShift will keep its momentum with smaller RHEL users.Red Hat isn't alone in aiming to make it easier for companies to develop apps that can run on multiple public clouds. It competes with Pivotal Software (PVTL), spun off by VMware, Docker and Rancher Labs.Red Hat has an edge, Smith says, as companies steer away from proprietary technologies that could lock them into one vendor for years. The Linux leader's tools enable companies to develop applications that run on cloud infrastructure, a market called platform-as-a-service, or PaaS.""Red Hat provides the most flexible PaaS environment from an infrastructure standpoint, allowing users to runs its solution on private data centers or in any public cloud,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Adam Holt said in his note to clients. ""Pivotal has a similar offering to Red Hat, but not as broad or deep.""Red Hat partnered with AWS, by far the biggest cloud service provider, in 2017. They aimed to make it easier for OpenShift customers to move workloads to the AWS cloud platform.At its investor day in May, Red Hat and Microsoft announced they will jointly offer OpenShift as a managed service on the Azure cloud platform.""While not a needle-mover short term, the Microsoft partnership represents a sizable call option for future growth,"" Matthew Hedberg, a RBC Capital analyst said in a report.Reports surfaced in March that Google's cloud-computing unit was eyeing an acquisition of the Linux leader to boost its presence in the corporate market.""I could see why any cloud provider might say owning Red Hat has value because it would give them more ability to move workloads to their cloud,"" Redhat's Whitehurst said. ""But any cloud provider would also have to recognize that we are neutral and weigh the benefits of having an edge moving workloads with the dis-synergy associated with us losing our Switzerland status.""The company also has been a steady acquirer of startups.In 2006, it bought JBoss for $350 million. With the purchase, Red Hat gained popular enterprise application development tools. In 2015, the company bought cloud automation specialist Ansible for a reported $150 million.In January, Red Hat acquired container platform developer CoreOS for $250 million, marking its largest deal since buying JBoss.""OpenShift will be more formidable once it integrates the recently acquired CoreOS,"" said a Cowen & Co. report on container technology. ""Although we estimate that OpenShift was only 3% of total Red Hat billings (a sales growth metric) in fiscal 2018, we forecast that it will eclipse $300 million in 2020 billings, equating to 7% of total.""The report went on to say: ""Given its financial resources, container focus, and strong recent track record with (mergers), we believe that Red Hat will perhaps uniquely, continue to act as a consolidator of some of the very best innovation in the container market.""Shares of Red Hat gained 1.1% on Friday to 171.06.RELATED LINKS:Sell And Take Profits Or Hold?

1153,SEE,"The explosion of ""smart-beta"" exchange-traded funds last year was the latest gold rush to hit the fast-growing, $3 trillion ETF industry.But as investors gather in New York City for the second day of a two-day conference focused on smart-beta ETFs, fund issuers find themselves facing a few emerging realities.First, there are only so many ways to mine these shiny strategies that now total more than $745 billion in assets and promise to outsmart the market by building indexes around themes, called factors, such as momentum or value. Second, very few who do it actually strike it rich. And third, if you want to differentiate yourself, you probably should focus on bonds rather than stocks, which are more tapped out.""There's clearly a lot of clutter,"" said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhile assets continue to pour into factor-based strategies, the issuance of new equity portfolios has screeched to a halt. In 2017, there were 100 new smart-beta ETFs, while in the first five months of 2018 the number shrank to 20, according to Bloomberg data. And that includes products that provide exposure to a single factor, like stocks exhibiting low volatility, or indexes tracking firms that fall into a category known as ESG for their focus on environmental, social and governance issues.Why is this happening? While there are many options available, investors are crowding into a few products that hold the bulk of the assets in their respective categories. For example, when it comes to ""dividend"" strategies there are 95 funds, but just two of them — the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation (VIG) and Vanguard High Dividend Yield (VYM) — account for almost one-third of the combined assets.One tried-and-true method for attracting assets to smart-beta strategies is to compete on price, according to Rolf Agather, managing director for North America research at FTSE Russell. In the firm's fifth annual global institutional smart-beta survey, 31% of respondents said cost played a role in their evaluations, more than doubling the share who said that in 2014.""The real story here is that, in the early days, smart-beta was a replacement for traditional passive products by doing something beyond traditional market-capitalization,"" he said. ""Smart-beta is now increasingly being used as an alternative for active management since they've become cheaper than active strategies.""Another finding in the FTSE Russell survey is that multi-factor combinations have become the most commonly adopted strategy among institutional investors, who are increasingly comfortable with single-factor products.""We didn't even include (multi-factor) as a choice in the first year,"" Agather said. ""What we're seeing now is clients are moving toward not just trying one particular factor, or even buying individual factors and then trying to combine them. They're actually looking to buy those all in one product.""While issuers continue to launch splashy marketing campaigns for single-factor funds and are busy trying to find the next big multi-factor idea, most of them agree that the next frontier for smart-beta can be summed up in a single word: Bonds.""This is almost a chicken and egg scenario,"" Agather said. ""In the fixed-income space there just isn't a lot of product, so naturally you don't see a lot of demand.""Big ETF managers, like Invesco's PowerShares unit, see debt funds as ripe with opportunity. The firm's recent acquisition of Guggenheim Investments' $39 billion of ETFs not only made Invesco the fourth-largest issuer but also secured a bond buddy for the smart-beta driven issuer, according to Dan Draper, global head of ETFs at the firm.In today's environment, investors are itching to understand how fixed-income investing works with factors to be more precise with their bond bets, he said.""That's one of our big synergies with Guggenheim in bringing over their fixed income-focused BulletShares series,"" Draper said. ""We're really accelerating our thinking process around fixed-income factors. That's where a lot of our internal research and development work is focused right now.""YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:AI-Powered Stock Picks, Internet Giants Among New ETF LaunchesAre You Missing Out On This Surprise Sector's Big Stock Gains?Broker, Exchange Stocks Mixed, But This Fund Maintains Steady Climb

1156,SEE,"In the stock market, a great company is like a high-performance Porsche, and volume is the stock's fuel. You can blather all day about the company's potential, its fabulous new product, its incredible CEO. But if the company's stock, after making a great run, begins to hit new highs in low volume, it will likely cease to act like a high-performance roadster.In fact, the stock may be beginning to put on the brakes on its spectacular run.When new highs keep occurring in low volume, it's prime time to be watching for serious sell signals.IBD has shared dozens of proven sell rules to help you keep most of your hard-earned investment gains in individual stock market winners and leadership-quality ETFs on Wall Street. After a stock sees a volume dry-up at the peak, be ready to sell at least some shares when a stock drops very hard through the 50-day moving average in gigantic volume. Or the stock may shatter a long-term trend line.Did the stock have a pair of 2-for-1 stock splits recently? Or did the stock get socked really hard after breaking out of a badly formed late-stage base? If the answer is yes to any of these questions, it's time to get your defensive game on.Please go to a daily chart at IBD and look at the bottom part of each chart. Each thin vertically-aligned bar represents how many shares a stock traded each session. It's easy to tell on any given day whether trading increased vs. the prior day, decreased, or stayed virtually the same.Now look at those volume bars again. See the 50-day average volume line, drawn in red, draped across the high end of those volume bars? The level of that line shows how many shares exchanged hands each day over the 50 most recent trading days. It's called a ""moving average"" because after a session on Wall Street is over, a new daily volume figure has been born. Thus, a new average over the past 50 days is created; the average keeps moving.The 50-day moving average makes it easy to spot trends in turnover. The same goes for the 10-week moving average, which shows typical weekly turnover over the past 10 weeks, on a weekly chart.A stock's volume often tracks above its 50-day average when a stock's price climbs to new high ground. This is where this stock has never been before. There is no overhead resistance, and buyers should be luring offers with their increasing bids.If this doesn't drum up increased volume, you have a problem. Remember, too, that the uptrending stock already has had institutional support behind it. That's how it got to be an uptrending stock.What do you think would happen if the big-money funds stopped buying? The stock would fall under its own weight.And if you see that stock consistently making new highs without solid volume, that's a sign that the tide may be turning. That is, sellers may have more influence over the stock's future prices than the buyers.CME Group (CME) shows how volume served as a gauge for the stock's health.The operator of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange futures and options market built a cup from August 2003 to January 2004. The base showed just a few weeks of high-volume selling during the stock's descent, and more weeks of high-volume buying on the right side of its base.CME ran up five weeks in a row in mostly heavy volume (1). That great price-and-volume action not only put the finishing touches on the base, but it also sparked a fine breakout. Even after the stock got extended from a 79.40 buy point, the gains in high volume continued. In the week ended Feb. 27, 2004, CME shot up 9.7% to new highs in volume that jumped 67% above the weekly average (2).Now look at CME's two-week-long dip near its 10-week moving average in late March (3). The declines were mild, and volume in one of those two weeks dried up. Volume then really picked up in the ensuing four weeks as CME lurched into new highs (4).A cup with handle formed from July to September 2004. The breakout in the week ended Sept. 24 shows another volume surge (5).Now compare all this positive price-volume action with CME's behavior in December. CME hit new highs, but volume settled into an eerie quietness (6). You could have taken that as a serious warning from a well-behaving stock.At the time, its IBD ratings were fantastic: a 99 EPS, a 97 Relative Price Strength. But this Porsche, which had taken you so far for years, had run out of gas.The stock peaked at 230.25 in early January 2005, dropped hard through the 10-week moving average, triggering a defense-type sell signal. CME fell 29% in three months, setting the stage for a new base to form.CME broke out of a large double-bottom base with a 220.59 buy point during the week ended June 3, 2005, and posted an amazing run. It rallied 214% by October 2007. A new base formed, a five-week flat base. CME broke out past the correct entry point of 693.10 in early December that year.The rally lasted all of three weeks. CME made a closing high of 710.75 in the week ended Dec. 21, 2007. But volume really dried up. On a weekly basis, 2.3 million shares exchanged hands, 23% below the 10-week average.Over the next four weeks through January of 2008, CME dropped more than 24% off its peak of 714. By the end of 2008, the futures and options exchange traded at 208, 71% below its all-time high.(A version of this column first appeared in the Jan. 10, 2011, edition of IBD.

1189,SEE,"Marijuana stocks Canopy Growth (CGC) and Cronos Group (CRON) were mixed on Friday, even after President Trump said he would ""probably"" back marijuana-friendly legislation in the U.S. and Canada's senate voted a day earlier to legalize recreational marijuana — with conditions.XBut one analyst suggested the slide in some marijuana stocks could be simple profit-taking following the clearing of a big obstacle in Canada.Trump on Friday made the remarks outside the White House in response to a question from the media on whether he would support a bill that would keep the federal government from intruding on states' efforts to regulate marijuana. Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Cory Gardner, R-Colo., introduced the bill on Thursday.""I support Senator Gardner,"" Trump said, according to Politico. ""I know exactly what he's doing, we're looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that, yes.""Trump's remarks put him at odds with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who once said ""good people don't smoke marijuana."" Sessions in January rescinded Obama-era guidance that essentially instructed the federal authorities to take a more laissez-faire approach to states that voted to legalize usage of the plant. Some analysts, and much of the industry, at least publicly, shrugged off the move.The bill from Gardner and Warren could help speed expansion of the marijuana industry in the U.S., where pot is still federally forbidden.Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) CEO Jim Hagedorn last month called for more ""states' rights"" as patchwork regulations, particularly in California, weigh on its hydroponics business.In particular, he called for ""a solution that allows the players in the space to have adequate access to banking and to pay a fair tax rate like other businesses.""Banks have to comply with federal regulations. But since the federal government outlaws pot, many marijuana businesses operate on cash, or depend on good relationships with the banks that will take them.U.S. marijuana producer MedMen, in a recent regulatory filing in Canada, noted that its banks ""are fully aware of the nature of the Company's business and continue to remain supportive of the Company's growth plans."" MedMen's dispensaries currently accept cash and debit cards.The company, which has been valued at $1.65 billion, went public in Canada last week.On Thursday, Canada's senate voted 56-30 to legalize recreational marijuana use, amid resistance from the nation's conservative lawmakers. The bill cleared by the senate came with some four dozen amendments that now need to be weighed by the House of Commons.The House of Commons will consider the amendments to the bill and send it back to the Senate.Legislation to legalize recreational marijuana in Canada was first introduced last year. It would allow users to have 30 grams of marijuana. Medical marijuana is already legal in Canada.The amendments in the measure cleared by the senate, among other things, placed tougher advertising constraints on marijuana businesses. Marijuana companies would not be able to advertise on T-shirts, hats and other items under that amendment.Another would let Canada's provinces decide whether people can grow their own marijuana at home. Young adults would also get a ticket for sharing small amounts of weed with a minor.""On a longer-term basis, as the market develops, we would expect these rules to be relaxed as unintended consequences do not materialize (which largely has been the case in the U.S.), and the market ultimately migrates more toward an alcohol model,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in a research note dated Friday.The bill, if passed, would give Canada's marijuana businesses a leg up on the U.S. Already, the marijuana industry in Canada has seen a wave of consolidation, as companies try to position themselves for recreational legalization.Canopy Growth, a big Canadian pot producer whose shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange last month, fell intraday but closed up 0.4% at 30.40 in the stock market today. Canopy trades in Canada under the ticker WEED.Cronos Group, another such producer in Canada, lost 5.6%. Cronos listed on the Nasdaq in February, after trading in Canada.""Our publicly traded cannabis stocks have reflected significant strength heading into this announcement,"" Azer said. ""We are not surprised to see modest profit taking with this catalyst largely behind us."" Cowen covers Canopy, MedReleaf and Kush Bottles.Marijuana-focused exchange-traded fund ETFMG Alternative Harvest (MJ) lost 0.85%. AdvisorShares Vice ETF (ACT), which also has exposure to cannabis, ticked up 1.1%.U.S. and Canadian marijuana companies have found new ways to raise money as they chew away at the legal barriers at their shared border. But areas that have relaxed their marijuana laws have stumbled as they try to bring their sales and business infrastructure online.Scotts Miracle-Gro climbed 1.5% Friday.

Emerging market local currency debt funds plunged 4.58% in May. Emerging markets hard currency debt funds fell 2.18%. International income funds slid 1.89%. World income funds as a group slipped 2.06%.""The Federal Reserve really has driven much of the fixed-income commentary on a year-to-date basis; this has really been a focus in terms of tightening and the transition to [new Fed Chairman Jerome] Powell,"" said Janelle Woodward, global co-head of income strategies at BMO Global Asset Management. ""But, what we saw in May really takes center stage with the balance between overall economic performance, which continued to be fine, if not good, and then the balance against overall geopolitics and policy concerns.""Woodward said strong U.S. economic data pushed yields higher. Then geopolitical risk from a number of factors took a toll. The ending of the Iran nuclear deal, President Trump threatening a trade war,  new tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and economic turmoil in Italy and Spain led to a flight to quality, which pulled U.S. Treasury rates lower.Woodward said the 10-year yield had made a big jump from the end of 2017 when it was 2.4%. It reached 3.1% in early May on talk of rising rates and the economic data that supported it.""But with strong geopolitical tensions,"" she said, ""you realize there's still a lot of headline risk, and there still can be this flight to quality environment. So we saw people buying Treasuries and selling risk assets.""""Municipal bonds outperformed Treasuries on the long end,"" said Susan Courtney, head of the municipal bond team at PGIM Fixed Income. ""In addition to the rally in rates, another reason munis have done well from a technical standpoint, is supply in the muni market has been down about 20% year-to-date.""Courtney said the summer months (June, July and August) are big months for reinvestments in terms of money coming back into the market. That may create even more demand and help push up the price of munis.""In terms of things that could possibly derail that scenario, one is if we get a situation where you have a significant backup in interest rates, i.e. higher yields,"" said Courtney. ""It's a retail-driven market, and the retail investor is more concerned with rising rates and what that means for their investment.""The Prudential Muni High Income Fund (PHIZX) jumped 8.1% last year and is up 0.57% year-to-date.Going forward, Don Ellenberger, head of multisector strategies at Federated Investors and portfolio manager for the firm's flagship Multisector Bond Fund (FTRBX), which earned 4.4% last year and is down 1.76% year-to-date, said things like Italy pulling out of the European Union and the euro are what keep him up at night.""We were surprised when Brexit happened, and now we are trying to determine how real is this risk that Italy might leave the EU or drop the euro as a currency,"" said Ellenberger.

1192,SEE,"The U.S. exit from the Iran nuclear deal could pose a ""material risk"" to profits at airlines, while Boeing (BA) and Airbus (EADSY) could see more demand for newer, more fuel-efficient jets, according to an analyst.XMajor U.S. carriers like Delta Air Lines (DAL), American Airlines (AAL) and United Airlines (UAL) already face rising fuel costs, as prices rebound from the oil crash in 2014. Delta's fuel costs jumped 20% in the first quarter. For American, they rose 26% over that time.In a research note on Tuesday, Canaccord Genuity's Ken Herbert said that if crude prices rise too fast airlines could spend less on ""older aircraft (negative for the aftermarket) and be positive for the demand for new, fuel efficient aircraft, unless the overall impact on airline profitability was substantial.""Fuel and labor are the airlines' two biggest costs. Withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the reimposing of sanctions, announced by President Trump on Tuesday, will likely constrain Iran's oil exports, tweaking global oil prices higher.On Wednesday, U.S. crude prices jumped 3.1% to $71.17 a barrel, and Brent crude surged 3% to $77.12, with both hitting the highest levels since November 2014.Delta fell 1.4% in the stock market today, as shares make their way through a consolidation.

He said the return of tougher sanctions would not have a ""material negative impact"" on Boeing's backlog.""The risk for Boeing and Airbus is if fuel prices rise too fast, or too much, that it materially impacts airline profitability, which could be a natural headwind for order activity or backlog strength,"" he added.

1193,SEE,"What is it about our entertainment elites that makes them think they are so much wiser than everyone else? Why do they seem to think that comedians like Samantha Bee and Donald Trump impersonators like Alec Baldwin are going to save America with their rants?The arrogance of the late-night ""comedians"" overflowed when Bee called Ivanka Trump a ""feckless c---."" See how Bee's old boss Jon Stewart came rushing to her defense: ""You could not find a kinder, smarter, more lovely individual than Samantha Bee. Trust me; if she called someone a ..."" (Translation: The person deserved it.)How hard would it be to find someone kinder and smarter than Bee? Most Americans could do it in 10 seconds.

They are above them. Thus, they viciously carve up conservatives in a way they would never dream of talking about their liberal heroes. (Rewind to Bee hugging Hillary Clinton and crying out, ""It should have been you!"")Bee's arrogance was self-evident in her lame ""apology"" that began with a sarcastic ""Sorry for breaking America.""

1194,SEE,"The cup-with-handle chart pattern is to serious investors what the single is to a baseball fan. It's the starting point for scoring runs and winning the investing game.Among the eight principal base patterns — including the flat base, double bottom, saucer, base on base, ascending base, IPO base, and high, tight flag — the cup with handle remains to this day one of the most successful.Why? Simple. Over the centuries, human nature hasn't changed. Greed, fear, hope, despair and other emotions drive stock prices. So do the laws of supply and demand.This is why sifting through the charts of the market's greatest winners is time well worth spent.As you'll see, the general shape of the cup with handle and other critical chart patterns appear over and over again. That's why they give the prepared investor an edge in the stock market. (You can sift through more than a century of history among the greatest stock market winners by going to the fourth edition of William O'Neil's classic, ""How To Make Money In Stocks,"" and studying Chapter 1.)So let's dissect this base. This is something you should know inside out. You need to know if that cup with handle is as it should be, or if it has flaws.The stock needs to show a 30% uptrend from any price point, but it must be before the base's construction. Or, the stock must show a minimum 20% increase from a prior breakout.The cup with handle must be at least seven weeks long. If there is no handle, then the cup itself must stretch a minimum six weeks.The handle alone needs at least five days to form, but it could go on for weeks. Make sure it doesn't exceed the cup portion in time or size of decline. A good cup with handle should truly look like the silhouette of a nicely formed tea cup. The handle always shows a smaller decline from high to low; it represents a final shakeout of uncommitted holders, sending those shares into sturdier hands in the market.In most cases, the decline from high to low should not exceed 8% to 12%. During bear markets, some good cup with handle bases show a large, double-digit decline within the handle. But again, it should not exceed the drop within the cup.The handle usually begins with a down day in price. Be aware that the handle itself, which must stretch for a minimum five trading sessions, can morph into a base of its own in certain cases. That's not a problem; it's often a stock's way of offering a buy point that's clearer or lower than that suggested by the larger pattern.The handle should form in the upper part of the entire pattern. If it's too low, it's flawed.One way to check if that handle is proper: use the simple midpoint test. Add the highest price and lowest price within the handle and divide by 2. That number should be greater than the midpoint of the actual base itself.Let's take the cup with handle fashioned by Baidu (BIDU) (see the chart below) in 2007. In the cup base, the high was 134.10 and the low was 92.80. Add the two prices together and divide by 2 and you get a base midpoint of 113.45. The handle showed a high of 132.80 and a low of 120.25, and its midpoint of 126.53 easily exceeded the cup's midpoint.The handle should also show a downward slope along at least a portion of its price lows, not an upward one.An upward-sloping handle is flawed; it represents weak demand as new buyers move into the stock at a trickling pace. During the stock's actual breakout, you want to see a new wave of buyers coming in at a torrid pace, not a trickling one.Also, a steep, high-volume decline should put you on alert. You don't want to buy a stock that institutional investors couldn't wait to unload at any price.The cup should form smoothly, without major price declines on the left side. Sharp gains on the right side aren't necessarily good, either. You might think that the opposite of a panic-driven exit would be a good thing. Likely not.Try to limit your picks to cups that are no more than 30% or 33% deep, except for those built during a bear market. In that case, an exceptional growth stock can fall 40%, 50% or more and still make a successful breakout.Still, shallower is better. It shows that the big hands are catching the stock.Look for volume to dry up along the lows of the base. Volume should be light in the handle, too.Tighter price action is better. This is true of almost all bases. A loose, choppy base shows the stock needs to go far for price discovery. If institutions are holding on to the stock, it won't fall too far.This, of course, is where all the above parameters lead if they appear correctly. The buy point from a cup-with-handle base appears at the highest point of the handle, plus 10 cents. In the case of former big winner Baidu, the proper buy point during its May 14, 2007, breakout was 132.90, a dime above the handle's intraday high of 132.80.Less than six months later, the leading Chinese web search engine rocketed to 428, up 222%.Even if all other parameters come together, you should avoid stocks that break out below their 10-week moving average.Also, when the stock is breaking out, you should generally see a rush in turnover. Volume should ideally rise at least 40% above its 50-day average. For small and midcap stocks, expect breakout volume to double or triple.The daily and weekly charts at both Investors.com and MarketSmith make heavy turnover easy to spot. Simply compare the day or week's volume with the moving average line drawn across the volume bars. An Investors.com chart will also tell you in real time how volume is running in comparison with typical level at that time of the trading session.For the weekly chart, the moving-average line traces 10 weeks' worth of turnover.What should you do if volume on breakout day is much lighter than usual? Sometimes volume will pick up in the next few sessions. Light volume in the market in general may also be a factor. Also consider that the breakout may have started later in the day.O'Neil has often said at past IBD seminars that after a stock breaks out, he wants to see weekly volume rise vs. the prior week. This signifies a sudden shift in demand for shares that could continue to build up.Are quarterly results coming up? If so, traders often hesitate before the news. But if the stock fails to make much headway in price, the relative strength line is fading, and the market itself is not showing positive action then something may be wrong with the timing of the breakout.At that point, it makes sense to exit the stock, even if the 7%-8% loss-cutting sell rule has not yet been triggered.(Editor's Note: A version of this column was first published in the July 9, 2010, edition of IBD.

1201,SEE,"ObamaCare enrollees should brace themselves for another year of double-digit premium hikes.Average premiums for plans sold through the state and federal insurance exchanges will jump as much as 32% next year, according to a recent report from actuarial firm Milliman. Consumers in some markets could face 80% rate hikes, according to a separate analysis from Blue Cross Blue Shield.Democrats have pounced on these projections to blame the GOP for ""marketplace sabotage."" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., remarked that ""Republicans and the Trump administration own any and all increases in health care premiums for American consumers.""Sorry Chuck, but GOP malfeasance isn't the problem. ObamaCare's burdensome mandates are driving the premium hikes. The only ones who ""own"" these rising rates are the politicians who continue to prop up this disastrous law.Next year, premium increases will vary wildly between states. Some Virginians could see their premiums skyrocket by 64%. Golden State residents using the Covered California exchange are expected to face an 11% hike.It's true that Republicans have made significant changes to ObamaCare in recent months.In October, President Trump halted a massive insurer bailout known as ""cost-sharing reduction subsidies."" ObamaCare requires insurers to provide assistance on copays and deductibles to consumers with certain exchange plans who earn less than 250% of the poverty level. Insurers lose money with this deal, obviously — but the CSR payments effectively reimbursed them for those losses.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTrump cut the spigot off in October, and last month the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld an earlier ruling deeming the payments unconstitutional.Democrats warned that insurers would raise premiums to offset the lost subsidy revenue, which totaled $7 billion in 2017.In December, Congress repealed ObamaCare's individual mandate penalty — which fined Americans for not purchasing insurance — as part of their massive tax reform. Democrats say that, without a penalty, healthy people would drop out of the exchanges. The remaining enrollees would be sicker, on average. So insurers would need to hike premiums to compensate for the higher costs.And in February, the Trump administration proposed a rule to undo President Obama's limitations on short-term health plans, which are much cheaper than exchange plans because they're not subject to the same costly regulations. Prior to 2016, Americans could purchase short-term coverage for just shy of a year.In his last year in office, President Obama cut the period to just 90 days. He deliberately made short-term plans less attractive to force people into the exchanges. President Trump is merely rolling back the clock to the status quo during most of the Obama administration.The Trump administration has also proposed another rule that would enable small businesses and sole proprietors to band together to purchase cheap, less-regulated coverage through association health plans, or AHPs. These two rules, if implemented, would enable 6 million additional people to purchase coverage, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Democrats claim the short-term and AHP rules would enable healthy people to flee the exchanges.Because of these reforms, the left-leaning Center for American Progress predicts that benchmark premiums for the average 40-year-old will rise by more than $1,000 nationwide in 2019. In states like Nebraska and Wyoming, annual benchmark premiums will increase by more than $2,000, according to CAP.President Trump and Congress aren't to blame for these increases. ObamaCare premiums were rising well before Republicans took over Washington. Average individual market premiums increased 99% from 2013, the year before the exchanges opened, to 2017, when President Obama left office. And last fall, before these changes were implemented, insurers hiked 2018 individual plan premiums by an average of 34%.They've repeatedly raised premiums because ObamaCare's burdensome regulations cause insurers to lose money year after year.For example, the law's community rating mandate prevents insurers from charging older enrollees more than three times what they charge younger ones — even though the average 64-year old is nearly five times more expensive to insure than the average 21-year old.ObamaCare's guaranteed issue mandate prohibits insurers from denying coverage based on health status. That's even true if customers have costly chronic conditions that will cause insurers to hemorrhage money.And the essential health benefits mandate requires all plans to cover 10 broad categories of medical care — including pediatric dental services, maternity care, and substance abuse treatment. All enrollees must pay for these benefits, even if they don't want them.Without any real ability to control costs, insurers are forced to raise premiums across the board. The Department of Health and Human Services commissioned a study in 2017 to analyze the effect that ObamaCare's regulations had on insurance premiums. It found that these mandates were the ""chief driver of premium increases.""Specifically, the study analyzed premium hikes in Georgia, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Tennessee from 2013 to 2017. Researchers found that ObamaCare's mandates — including the community rating and guaranteed issue rules — were responsible for up to 76% of the increases during that period.If anything, President Trump and Republican lawmakers have made insurance more affordable. Thanks to their efforts, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that 6 million more people will be insured in just five years.It's intellectually dishonest to blame Republicans for premium hikes. ObamaCare's architects and proponents are the ones who sabotaged America's insurance markets. By scrapping the individual mandate and expanding access to short-term and AHP plans, Republicans are simply giving Americans affordable alternatives to budget-busting exchange coverage.Medicare Is On Death's Door ...

1204,SEE,"It was Jan. 17, 1991. America was at war in Iraq. The mission: Operation Desert Storm. Lockheed's F-117 Nighthawk, the first stealth fighter, showcased America's superior air power to Saddam Hussein and the rest of the world.The unconventionally shaped stealth plane would make 1,300 sorties, hitting 1,600 high-value targets during the campaign. It accounted for 40% of all targeted damage, without a single hit by enemy fire.Stealth played a key role in the military's second offset strategy, where a small number of high-tech platforms could beat the massive military hardware the Soviets boasted. Stealth marked a new era in air warfare and is a foundation of U.S. air supremacy to this day.But the game-changing F-117 wouldn't have been possible without Ben Rich, the second director of Lockheed's secretive Skunk Works, who took a major risk despite the discouragement of some of the brightest minds in aerospace.Rich was born on June 18, 1925, in Manila, Philippines, to a British hardwood lumber mill superintendent and a French linguist.As tensions rose in the Pacific, his family moved to Los Angeles just months before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. There he went to work with his father in a machine shop to help support the family during the war years. His shelved his dream to go to college to become a doctor.At 21 Rich was finally able to attend college. He graduated in 1949 with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He later received a master's degree in aerothermodynamics from the University of California, Los Angeles, where he met his first wife, Faye.The postwar recession made jobs scarce. But Rich managed to find an engineering job at Lockheed (LMT) in 1950. Because he wasn't earning enough to support his growing family, he gave notice after just four years of employment. He was all set to take over his father-in-law's bakery-delicatessen. At the last second, Rich changed his mind. Truth was, he liked building airplanes better than selling deli meats.Soon after deciding to stay at Lockheed, he joined Skunk Works at the request of founder Kelly Johnson.Skunk Works, formally called the Advanced Development Programs, is Lockheed's legendary research and development lab. Created in 1943 to develop the company's top-secret technology during World War II, it was the birthplace of the P-38 fighter. Employees at the secretive unit refer to themselves as ""Skunks.""The division started in a circus tent outside the main Lockheed building in Burbank, next to a smelly plastics factory. Their unique moniker comes from a stinky concoction make by a bootlegger in the ""Li'l Abner"" comic strip.Under Johnson, Rich worked on the highflying U-2 spy plane, which the Air Force plans to keep flying for more than 100 years.He also designed the air-inlet control system for the SR-71 Blackbird, which can fly three times the speed of sound. In his autobiography, ""Skunk Works: A Personal Memoir of My Years at Lockheed,"" Rich called his contribution to the SR-71 the most ""exhausting, difficult and nerve-wracking work"" of his career.Rich won the American Institution of Aeronautics and Astronautics Award in 1972 for the Blackbird's propulsion system. His work on the F-117 would win Rich aerospace's top award, the prestigious Collier Trophy, in 1989. Kelly Johnson tapped Rich as his replacement in 1975. Rich was a popular choice. Most of the Skunks chose to stay during the major transition.""Tip your hat to someone like Ben keeping an operation going after such a strong leader like Kelly,"" said Larry Pellett, the current director of major projects at Skunk Works. Rich asked Pellett to join Skunk Works after seeing him give a presentation in 1989.Johnson was an autocratic leader. He was very hands-on with his technical workers. He reworked submitted designs, striking fear into some of the younger employees. But Pellett said Rich's success resided in the fact that he never tried to be like Johnson. Instead he adopted his own managerial style.""There is a joke among Skunks that Kelly managed with his bad temper, and Ben managed with bad jokes,"" Pellett said. ""He was the cheerleader, the facilitator that built the team up.""Other employees felt the same way about Rich's brand of leadership.""Ben kept a close eye on all our problems, but he was never a second-guesser,"" Alan Brown, Rich's program manager, said in Rich's autobiography. ""Rich let us do our thing and smooth our way with the Air Force and Lockheed management.""Rich took the reins during a tumultuous time for Lockheed. Spending on the unpopular Vietnam War was winding down. And the company found itself in the midst of a bribery scandal.To add to the company's woes, Lockheed hadn't won a fighter contract since the F-104 Starfighter, built during the Korean War. But a major breakthrough was on the horizon.The aviation community considers Rich the father of stealth. But the idea came from an unlikely source. Pyotr Ufimtsev, a Soviet scientist, theorized about stealth technology in a 1962 paper called ""Method of Edge Waves in the Physical Theory of Diffraction."" The paper outlined equations on how to calculate radar cross-sections, an object's ability to reflect radar. But the Soviets deemed the paper impractical and of little use. Ufimstev's discovery would have stayed buried in a Soviet library, if not for Rich.Denys Overholser, a radar specialist, brought the research paper to Rich just six months after Rich took the helm at the Skunk Works. Overholser suggested the company use the equations to build their own stealth plane that could evade the Soviet Union's radar.""I take credit for immediately recognizing the value of the gift I was handed before it became apparent to everyone else, and for taking major risks in expanding development costs before we had any real government interest or commitment,"" Rich said in his autobiography.The result was a model made from a series of flat surfaces that looked like a cut diamond. It was nicknamed ""Rich's Folly"" and ""Hopeless Diamond,"" among other things. The oddly shaped plane is now sometimes compared to a flying Darth Vader.Despite having a working model, Lockheed hadn't been invited to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) competition to build a stealthy plane. All development contract money had been awarded by the time Rich heard of the contest.Rich convinced DARPA head George Heilmeier to let Lockheed join the competition. Rich also smartly rejected DARPA's pro forma $1 offer. Instead he submitted his proposal for free, ensuring the technology would remain the property of Lockheed.Never straying too far from Skunk Works, Johnson caught wind of the stealth plane. He furiously told Rich to shut down development. Johnson erroneously believed missiles were the future of warfare. The ugly, flat-paneled airplane would never fly, he thought.Larry Kitchen, Lockheed's president at the time, was also a skeptic. He said the company needed ""real projects, not pipe dreams,"" Rich recalled in his autobiography.But Rich persevered despite the naysayers. He believed in the game-changing technology. Rich spent nearly 1 million dollars of Skunk Works' development cash on the stealth project. He envisioned huge military and financial returns in the future.""I never wavered from believing that stealth could create the biggest Skunk Works bonanza ever,"" Rich wrote.Despite being shut out of the DARPA competition at first, ""Rich's Folly"" eventually beat Northrop's submission. After two successful experimental prototypes, built quickly from off-the-shelf items at Skunk Works, the F-117 program was born.But while Rich was about to make a major military breakthrough, he suffered a major personal loss. His wife Faye passed away in 1980. Rich pressed on in his work to manage his grief.The F-117 first flew in 1981 and entered service in 1983. Kept in the dark, the plane wouldn't see its first mission until 1989 in Panama. It wouldn't become an international sensation until the Gulf War. And as the first F-117s took to the skies over Iraq in 1991, Rich and his Skunks celebrated his retirement.Rich had some setbacks during his time at the Skunk Works. Lockheed lost out on the B-2 bomber contract to Northrop (NOC) because he refused to overpromise on price and capabilities. The B-2 would become a casualty of a ""death spiral,"" where decreased military spending by Washington led to less planes being purchased, leading to a higher cost per plane. The B-2 would eventually go on to cost billions of dollars more than first budgeted as Congress kept cutting the number of planes ordered.""I never lied to a customer or tried to dodge the heat when we screwed up,"" he wrote. ""I knew how other companies operated, and I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures. And I was right.""Rich died of cancer on Jan. 5, 1995, but his legacy lives on at Skunk Works. Stealth brought Lockheed back into the fighter jet business. The company built the F-22 and F-35 stealth fighters. The latter accounts for a quarter of Lockheed Martin's yearly revenue.Following Rich's belief in the need to find the next revolutionary advancement, Skunk Works is developing the next disruptive technologies, from hypersonics to artificial intelligence, in an effort to stay ahead of growing advances by U.S. adversaries like Russia and China.Engineer who believed stealth technology would be a game-changer on the battlefieldOvercame: Skepticism and the shadow of his revered mentor.Lesson: Recognized the power of a new technology and stuck to his project despite doubts from respected members in his field.""I was convinced that our reputation for integrity would gain more business than we would ever lose by turning away questionable ventures.""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsWhat Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

1219,SEE,"Things are going well with your swing trades and the money seems to be pouring in. What do you do? Some people get more aggressive. They want to take advantage of their ""hot hand."" Others get fearful. They don't want to see their gains go away. Charts and rules can guide you when to take profits as Westlake Chemical (WLK) stock demonstrates.Reversals are worthwhile patterns to recognize. Rather than waiting for prior areas of resistance, you can get an earlier and better price. When Westlake Chemical showed a reversal (1) on March 2, it missed on a few elements. It was a solid bounce from the 50-day moving average line but the high fell just short of clearing the previous day's high and the volume was weak (1). The next day, however, saw a huge increase in volume, an RS line at new highs, and it cleared resistance at 112.43 (2). This was the day Westlake joined IBD's SwingTrader ahead of a higher level at resistance at 115.19.Four days later, we were up 5% on the trade and we took half profits (3). It's our custom to take profits at that level and raise the stop to 1% profit from our entry. This ensures we end the trade with a gain. No reason to let worthwhile profits slip away. But at the same time, we give the stock some room for further gains. The partial sell was more critical because of action in the Nasdaq composite. The index hit new all-time highs on the same day, logging a 14% gain from its February lows. It was also the sixth consecutive daily gain for the Nasdaq. We always use the context of the market to inform us on our individual trades.The next day Westlake Chemical showed a bearish reversal (4). It was an opportunity to take profits on the remaining position. We don't expect to exit at the very top, but we did manage to exit on the top day in this case, good for an overall gain of 4.76%. Again, the extended nature of the market led to the sell decision. As a result, we missed a two-month correction in Westlake Chemical. The breach of the 5-day moving average (5) a few days later was another rule that could be employed to protect profits but the market analysis saved us a couple of extra percentage points.Selling into strength and taking profits on the way up often avoids corrections and areas of consolidation, at least in the short term. What do you do with the money from the sell? There could be another setup to play and a chance to compound your gains. Or just keeping the cash can take the risk off while you wait for more setups and a more favorable market.As always, you have to be prepared for some stocks to go up without you after you take profits. That's OK. These rules can still keep you ahead with less risk over the long run.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED: Stay For The Stock Gains, Avoid Corrections With Swing TradingHere's How Swing Trading Strategy Helped Avoid A Stock Market CorrectionSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1220,SEE,"This week, the Supreme Court ruled on the Masterpiece Cakeshop case. That case involved a religious Christian man, Jack Phillips, who decorates cakes for a living. Two men came into his shop one day and demanded that Phillips decorate a cake for their same-sex wedding. Phillips refused.For this grave breach of civic duty, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission referred his case for prosecution, ruling that he had breached the customers' rights to receive service.The Supreme Court ignored the key issues of the case. It refused to countenance whether First Amendment speech rights could be violated in favor of nondiscrimination laws — whether, for example, a gay songwriter could be forced to perform work for an evangelical Christian choir looking for a tune to liven up Leviticus 18.It refused to consider whether First Amendment free association rights could be completely overthrown by reference to nondiscrimination laws — whether any business could be told to serve anyone for any reason at any time.Finally, it refused to consider whether First Amendment freedom of religion could be overturned in favor of nondiscrimination law — whether religious practice stops at the front door of the home and the church.Instead, the court ruled that the baker didn't have to bake the cake because the members of the Colorado Civil Rights Commission were unduly mean.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseYou see, the commission pilloried the man's religious viewpoint rather than giving it a respectful hearing; it compared his viewpoint to pro-slavery and pro-Holocaust viewpoints. This was extreme and nasty.Thus, Justice Anthony Kennedy concluded: ""The commission's hostility was inconsistent with the First Amendment's guarantee that our laws be applied in a manner that is neutral toward religion. ... The outcome of cases like this in other circumstances must await further elaboration in the courts.""I must have missed the ""be kind; rewind"" section of the First Amendment.Of course, the Supreme Court likely ruled on narrow grounds in order to achieve a 7-2 majority including liberal Justices Elena Kagan and Stephen Breyer. But the ruling bodes ill for the future: It doesn't protect religious Americans, nor does it protect freedom of speech.In reality, the founders would have been aghast at this issue ever rising to the level of the judiciary.Freedom of speech, and, by extension, freedom of association, were designed to allow private individuals to live their lives as they see fit, free of the burden of an overreaching government.Freedom of religion was to be guaranteed by a small government unconcerned with the day-to-day matters of business. Free markets were considered enough incentive to prevent mass discrimination in public accommodations.Now, however, the courts have decided that the government can tell you what to say, who to say it to and how to act out your religion. The only holdup is that they have to be nice about telling you what to do.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Supreme Court Decision On Rights Was Correct, But Half-BakedMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1223,SEE,"Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) will likely keep 75% of its Soliris market in the U.S. even as rivals like Amgen (AMGN) try to make competing copycat drugs, an analyst said Tuesday in a bullish note.Blockbuster Soliris treats two rare blood diseases and a neuromuscular disease. Credit Suisse analyst Martin Auster says it's protected by patents in the U.S. until 2027. Patents pending in Europe could protect it through 2024.Meanwhile, Alexion is working on a next-generation version of Soliris called ALXN1210. That should offer another buffer to protect Alexion's rare-disease portfolio of drugs. Investors seem focused on Soliris patent worries in Europe and the solidity of long-term growth drivers.But it's likely Alexion will only face Soliris biosimilar competition for one of the blood-disease uses, Auster said. And he sees Alexion finding a ""good fit"" acquisition from a field of highly competitive companies to help drive long-term growth.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""(The) biosimilar impact seems overstated,"" he said. ""There is substantial uncertainty over biosimilar timelines. Our base model assumes a blended probability scenario and assigns a 2024 Europe/rest of world launch.""Auster sees Amgen as the only ""credible player"" with the potential to come up with a Soliris biosimilar over the next three to four years. Even then, it's likely Amgen and others could see delays in their timelines for Soliris copycats.In a ""max stress scenario"" featuring a 2022 launch of a Soliris biosimilar, Alexion would have to share all new patients with a rival.

1224,SEE,"China's Shanghai Composite peaked in October 2007. So did the U.S. stock market. Unlike the U.S. stock indexes, though, the Shanghai never regained its peak.The Shanghai Composite is down 48% since Oct. 31, 2007. Compare that to the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, which respectively gained 167% and 78% in the same period.Initial public offerings have an advantage in these kinds of situations. They don't carry the baggage, the old scars and the overhead supply that the suffering stocks deal with.Instead, three recent China IPOs enjoy a place in the Sector Leaders list, a powerful IBD screen with the most stringent criteria.Online marketplace Alibaba (BABA) launched its IPO on the NYSE on Sept. 19, 2014. The stock immediately began to consolidate.A consolidation is exactly what an IBD-style investor wants to see in an IPO. Alibaba formed an IPO base (which can be shorter than normal) and scored a 20% gain in a couple of weeks.The next base was a long time coming. In August 2016, the stock completed a base and broke out. More consolidations and breakouts followed.Going into Tuesday's session, Alibaba was in the 5% buy zone from a recent breakout. The pattern, though, is late stage.The gain from the Sept. 19, 2014 close: 122%.Social networking provider Momo (MOMO) launched its IPO on Dec. 11, 2014. An early base and breakout gained 13%. Then the stock formed a series of consolidations.In December 2017, the low in a consolidation undercut the low in the previous base, which reset the base count to first stage. The stock is too extended to buy.The gain from the Dec. 11, 2014 close: 191%.E-commerce solutions provider Baozun (BZUN) launched its IPO on May 21, 2015 with an IPO price of 10.The going was initially tough. Baozun did not shape a base above $10 a share until October 2016 through May 2017. But then things turned up. Baozun eventually delivered three post-breakout gains of 117%, 28% and so far 21% after its most recent breakout.Admittedly some of the price progress came in a choppy fashion, making the stock tough to hold.The gain from IPO's May 21, 2015 close: 505%.A bear market will weigh on everything. But recent IPOs that skipped the tough years, and debuted in a friendlier phase, have better prospects.RELATED:IBD's Stock Of The DayBest Marijuana StocksIPOs Can Result In Rich Gains

1225,SEE,"Leading indexes nosed lower in premarket trade Friday, as concerns about the G-7 meeting in Quebec and next week's Fed meeting kept a lid on investor optimism. Zumiez (ZUMZ) wowed investors in Thursday's after-hours trade, with DocuSign (DOCU) not far behind, while Broadcom (AVGO) traded narrowly higher after besting quarterly expectations.XThe Dow Jones industrial average eased, with futures dipping 0.2% below fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures slumped 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures slipped to a slight loss.Positive trade news held the Dow above 25,000 on Thursday, as the Nasdaq withdrew 0.7% and the S&P 500 wrestled with a fractional decline. The losses snapped a four-day run up by both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500. But it left both indexes with solid gains for the week heading into Friday's session.The Dow clearly has the market's favor for the week, riding a 2.5% gain heading into Friday's session.The G-7 confab of top global leaders begins Friday in Quebec. The gathering typically doesn't generate market-moving news. But leaders this year wade into a labyrinth of trade uncertainties and contests tied both to the U.S. restructuring of its trade norms and to Britain's fast-approaching exit from the European Union.Markets may also be hunkering down ahead of next week's Fed meeting. Investors fully anticipate a rate target hike, but will be keenly interested in whether the general Fed mood is for one or two additional hikes before the end of the year. Bonds reversed course and gained early Friday, with the 10-year yield down 5 basis points to 2.92%.Chipmaker Broadcom was the heavyweight earnings report delivered after Thursday's close. The San Jose, Calif.-based company easily outpaced analysts' fiscal second-quarter targets, and hoisted Q3 revenue guidance past consensus views. Shares edged up 0.4% — too small a change to indicate what direction they might head at Friday's starting bell.Teen retail has been a niche worth watching this week. On Thursday, youngster-geared dollar store Five Below (FIVE) bolted 22% higher after reporting earnings late Wednesday. On Thursday afternoon, skate and surf wear shop Zumiez carved a 16% advance after reporting a narrower-than-forecast first-quarter loss and revenue growth above expectations. The stock was in a buy range after breaking out Tuesday above a 26.30 buy point in a cup-with-handle base.Enterprise software IPO DocuSign inked an 10% after-hours gain. The San Francisco-based developer reported earnings of a penny per share — its first profitable quarter. Revenue rolled ahead 37%. Both numbers were above expectations, and the company reported a 33% surge in bookings, far above consensus views. The stock is extended after clearing an IPO base in late May, and ended Thursday's session up 93% from its April IPO price.On the downside, LED chipmaker Cree (CREE) dumped 3.5% following its announcement that CFO Mike McDevitt planned to retire. McDevitt will remain until a successor is appointed, and will remain available as a consultant in the future. Cree also affirmed its fiscal Q4 guidance, with revenue ranging from $390 million to $410 million, and EPS between 5 cents and 9 cents. Cree shares are extended after clearing a two-month cup base in late May.Oil prices eased early Friday, with West Texas Intermediate down 0.5%, but holding well above $65 per barrel. Oil was boosted on Thursday by data showing a drop in Venezuela crude exports and by concerns that Saudi Arabia and Russia might maintain their two-year production cap. West Texas Intermediate has swung 1.9% higher, to just below $66 a barrel, a fraction higher for the week. Europe's Brent crude benchmark climbed 2% to above $77.Oil prices — particularly WTI — could see some effect Friday when Baker Hughes (BHGE) releases its weekly rig census at 1 p.m. ET.Also on the economic calendar, wholesale inventories data for April are due from the Commerce Department at 10 a.m. ET Friday.RELATED:The 'Most Dysfunctional G-7 Meeting' Ever: Investing Action Plan Chip Stocks To Watch And Semiconductor Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Next Nvidia?

1231,SEE,"Entitlements: Social Security is like the classic children's tale, ""The Boy Who Cried Wolf."" So many warnings have been made, no one listens anymore. Well guess what? The wolf's now at the door. Are you listening now?For the first time in 36 years, Social Security will take money out of its ""trust fund"" — an accounting fiction that would get you jailed for fraud in the private sector — to pay retirees. The truth is, Social Security is for all intents and purposes bankrupt.Since 2010, Social Security has been spending more than it took in, making up the difference by tapping into the interest paid on a $2.9 trillion government bond fund. That ""interest"" is really your tax dollars. Congress, you see, spent the actual money that came in through your payroll taxes and left IOUs. Now, even the interest on those entitlement IOUs is no longer enough. So they're going to have to start selling off assets to pay what they owe. Last year, it was $41 billion. It will only grow.By 2034, the entire pile of IOUs will disappear. Everything. It will require slashing benefits by at least 21%, or raising payroll taxes by 31%. That's for workers who are today 50 years of age. It is a devastating fiscal picture, one that has profound meaning for our society going forward.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs Cato Institute economist Michael D. Tanner estimated in 2015, Social Security faces a long-term funding shortfall of $25 trillion and Medicare of $48 trillion. Yes, that's trillion with a ""t."" No doubt, it's far bigger today. To do nothing is tantamount to an irresponsible declaration of national bankruptcy over entitlements.The sad fact is, we've known this was coming for years. It's only getting worse now because of the substandard economic growth during the Obama years, which reduced the amount of payroll taxes going into both Social Security and Medicare. So our financial Armageddon is coming earlier than expected.Putting an end to this latter-day Ponzi scheme won't be easy. Americans have been told repeatedly the only ""fix"" we need is to raise taxes on the rich to close the gap. But even taxing America's most wealthy won't be enough. Gen-X and the following generations will pay for the massive group of now-retiring Baby Boomers, with nothing left for them when they retire.This is not just bad finance. It's immoral.It's time for all of us, politicians and citizens alike, to consider real, workable alternatives to fix the problem. That would entail modest changes in future Social Security benefits, coupled with private Social Security accounts that would be tied to positive market returns, not to politicians' absurd promises.More socialist solutions — higher taxes, more benefits — not only won't work, they will drag down the world's most productive economy.

1232,SEE,"Back when the Soviet Union had a first-rate nuclear arsenal but a ramshackle third-world economy that produced no consumer goods other than vodka and caviar that anyone elsewhere would buy, the nation was disparaged as ""Upper Volta with rockets."" Today the question is: Would North Korea like to become Upper Volta without rockets and without exportable vodka or caviar?This question is central as the president undertakes to bring about the ""complete, verifiable and irreversible"" dismantling of the nuclear weapons program that has been the North Korean regime's obsession for more than 60 years. This regime has been run exclusively by and for the Kim family since 1948, during which time it has demonstrated an unswerving willingness to immiserate its people to ensure the regime's survival.The regime has wagered that nuclear weapons would guarantee the loyalty of the only possible internal threat to the family, the armed forces, and would immunize the nation from external threats. It also has wagered that the weapons, when wedded as they soon might be to intercontinental ballistic missiles, extort from other nations, especially the United States, attention, and economic benefits intended to wean North Korea from the nuclear weapons that are the only reason anyone pays attention to it.North Korea has repeatedly won this wager. To wager is to put something at risk, but it is strange to say that North Korea's regime takes risks recklessly. Although vicious, it has been methodical and more or less predictable.Much has been made of the relevance, as North Korea might see it, of the fact that after America toppled Iraq's Saddam Hussein (which would not have happened if he had had nuclear weapons), Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, responding to U.S. pressure, dismantled his pursuit of nuclear weapons — and later was toppled by U.S.-backed insurgents. Not enough is made of this: In 1994, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union left Ukraine in possession of the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal, it gave this up in exchange for U.S. and British — and Russian — security guarantees. Crimea was then part of Ukraine.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSpeaking in Prague in 2009 at the dawn of his presidency — six months before he harvested the first purely anticipatory Nobel Peace Prize — Barack Obama embraced the goal of ridding the world of nuclear weapons. Six years later he was seeking $348 billion for a 10-year modernization of the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Today there are fewer nuclear weapons in the world than there were during the Cold War. This, however, adds less to global security than is subtracted from it by the fact that there are two more nuclear powers (Pakistan, North Korea) and there will be a third if, as seems certain, Iran is determined to be one.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has listed 12 ""basic requirements"" Iran must fulfill in order to avoid ""the strongest sanctions in history"" — assuming, perhaps fancifully, that Russia, China and other nations will tug their forelocks and comply with Trump administration ukases. Pompeo's demands include halting all uranium enrichment and development of ballistic missiles, openness to unfettered inspectors, ending aid to terrorists and the Houthi rebels in Yemen, withdrawing Iran's troops from Syria, and behaving neighborly toward its neighbors. It would have been fun — a maraschino cherry atop Pompeo's sundae of a dozen demands — if he had included a 13th: Iranians must become Methodists.Pompeo presented his demands as ""shifts in Tehran's policies."" Actually, they are more akin to asking a leopard not merely to change its spots, but to become a vegetarian. Perhaps Pompeo is mimicking his master.The ""art of the deal,"" according to the supposed Rembrandt of this art (a six-time bankrupt), seems to be this: Ask for the universe, settle for one of Jupiter's minor moons, claim that the moon is actually the center of the universe and was the real goal all along, and that only he — not Metternich, not Kissinger — could have plucked this flower, safety, from the nettle, danger.However, the common denominator in most mishaps of governing — in both domestic (Prohibition, 1930s protectionism, the Great Society, 1970s wage and price controls, etc.) and foreign policies (Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, the Bay of Pigs, Vietnam, Iraq, Libya, etc.) — is the belief that the world is more malleable than it is, that inertia is less powerful than it is, that social variables can be made to vary as we wish them to. But, then, such mishaps were in the era B.R. — Before Rembrandt.Other columns by George Will

1235,SEE,"Work: For decades experts proclaimed that technology was reshaping the workplace, and a ""gig economy"" was taking over. But a funny thing happened in the years since. Nothing.Along with the advent of personal computers, broadband internet and smartphones came predictions that the traditional employer-worker relationship would soon be a thing of past. Workers would increasingly become freelancers, and companies virtual. Telecommuting would be routine.In 1999, the Department of Labor predicted that the ""traditional work arrangement (is) giving way to something fundamentally different"" as companies shift to ""just in time"" workers.Kiplinger predicted in 2000 that 100 million U.S. workers would be telecommuting by 2010.The RAND Corporation said in 2004 that we'd see a shift toward ""less permanent, even nonstandard employment relationships.""Intuit predicted in 2010 that, by 2020, 40% of the US workforce will be ""contingent workers.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn 2011, the Atlantic called the transformation to a gig economy ""nothing less than a revolution. We haven't seen a shift in the workforce this significant in almost 100 years when we transitioned from an agricultural to an industrial economy.""When running for president, Hillary Clinton warned that the gig economy was ""raising hard questions about workplace protections and what a good job will look like in the future.""So, what actually happened?Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that, contrary to all those predictions, the ""gig economy"" shrank in size over the past two decades.In 1995, there were 6 million ""contingent workers"" — those with short term or temporary jobs — representing 4.9% of the workforce. Last year, there were 5.8 million, or 3.8% of the workforce. That's a long way from the 40% Intuit predicted.The share of the workforce made up of independent contractors barely budged in all those years, going from 6.7% in 1995 to 6.9% in 2017.Overall, the share of workers in ""traditional arrangements"" has remained exactly the same as it was 23 years ago — at 90% — BLS data show.In other words, there has been no transformation of the workplace at all, despite the dramatic technological changes that swept over the economy in the past quarter century.Even the prediction that vast multitudes of workers would telecommute proved wildly inaccurate. Instead of 100 million as Kiplinger forecast, fewer than 6 million worked at home in 2010, according to the BLS.Sure, the work is different. The internet and the vast industries it has spawned barely existed, for example.

1242,SEE,"Straining for high yields is one of the most dangerous things an income investor can do. Dividend stocks are conservative instruments. But push too much for high yields, and investors are no longer operating in the conservative world.An investor can see this right now with oil stocks. Going into Tuesday's session, IBD's Dividend Leaders screen featured 16 stocks. Seven were oil stocks.Yet some oil stocks carry more risks than others.Of the seven oil stocks, five pay an annualized dividend that is greater than estimated earnings for 2018. The situation isn't dire, but it's not ideal over the long term.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSome dividend investors don't worry too much about earnings vs. the payout. Many things can affect earnings. They focus more on the payout vs. cash flow per share.The seven oil stocks look better from that perspective. Only two stocks are paying out more than cash flow per share.Which is the most conservative oil stock in the Dividend Leaders screen?Chevron (CVX) wins easily. The blue-chip oil company's annualized dividend payout is $4.48 per share. The payout represents about 58% of the $7.77 estimated earnings per share for 2018. Even better, the payout is only about 32% of cash flow per share.Chevron, a member of the Dow Jones industrial average, will have no problem paying the dividend. Management also will have no problem raising the dividend, if the board so chooses.The current annualized dividend yield is 3.7%.The dividend growth rate, though, is only 3%. Dividend increases have been irregular. In 2014-16, Chevron went as long as 10 quarters without a dividend increase.Chevron recently retreated to its 10-week line in mostly below-average volume.

1245,SEE,"Each month, the IBD/TIPP Poll, a collaboration between Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, produces an exclusive Presidential Leadership Index. In addition to tracking President Trump's job approval rating, the index combines results from several questions in the monthly IBD/TIPP Poll to gauge how well the president is viewed when it comes to leading the country, both domestically and internationally.The index includes questions on presidential approval, favorability measures on the president's handling of domestic and foreign policy issues, and whether the president is providing strong or weak leadership.In addition, IBD/TIPP each month asks questions focused on the public's outlook overall. These questions gauge satisfaction with the direction of the country, respondents' quality of life, and the United States' standing in the world.IBD/TIPP also produces the Economic Optimism Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.View Questions And Full ResultsThe IBD/TIPP Presidential Leadership Index dropped 2.4% to 41.1 in June, breaking a three-month stretch of gains. The highest reading Trump has scored on this index was in his first month in office, when it stood at 49.2. The lowest came in August 2017, when it was 35.9.The Leadership Index comprises three subindexes measuring the president's favorability (down 1% in June), job approval (down 3.2%), and whether he is providing strong leadership (down 2.9%).The June poll found that 36% of the public approves of the job President Trump is doing, which is down two points from last month. Fifty-five percent say they disapprove of the job he's doing.The Direction of the Country Index climbed almost another point in June to reach 45.3, adding to the sharp increase in May. This is the highest the index has been since Trump's first month in office. And the index is now well above its 17-year average of 41.6, and even further ahead of the 37 average during President Obama's eight years in office.The Quality of Life Index dipped 2.6% to 61.1 in June. As the chart indicates, this index has been climbing under Trump, and even with the June decline it is still close to its all-time high level of 63.1, which it reached in January 2004. The average under President Obama was 53.7. Unlike other measures, the Quality of Life Index has been relatively steady over the past 17 years.The Standing in the World Index posted a 5.7% decline in June, to 45. That puts it just slightly below the 17-year average for this index of 45.5, and above the average 42.6 under Obama. Over the past 17 years, the highest this index ever reached was in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, when it hit 74.9.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Economic Optimism IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsMay 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

1256,SEE,"More than $1 billion a day. That's the price tag for a Permian Basin pipeline crunch that's increasingly affecting investors as much as it is West Texas oil drillers.Eight of the top explorers focused on the booming U.S. shale region have lost $15.6 billion in combined market value in about two weeks, as shipping constraints devour the profit they can fetch for a barrel of crude. Parsley Energy (PE) shares have wilted 16% in that time; Diamondback Energy (FANG) has been defanged, down 18%.Even as production soars, dwindling pipeline space and a rail and trucking shortage have raised shipping costs, boosting the discount Permian producers take to offload their oil. The bottleneck benefits refiners who can buy cheaper crude and pipeline owners with extra space, but it's dragging down explorers.""You just don't want to touch these Permian names,"" said Gabriele Sorbara, a Williams Capital Group analyst in New York. ""They are falling off a cliff.""Relief may not come until 2020, when new pipelines are expected to be up and running. For now, here's a rundown of winners and losers amid the space crunch:Being a ""pure play"" shale producer, even a Permian stalwart, is no longer the ticket to success for energy equities.Since May 21, the price of benchmark West Texas intermediate crude has fallen about 10% and companies focused primarily on the Permian have been shunned. The hardest fall: Concho Resources (CXO), which has lost $4.1 billion off its market capitalization as of Tuesday.As of Wednesday, oil in Midland, Texas, was trading for about $19 a barrel below Brent crude, the global benchmark price.Even Pioneer Natural Resources (PXD), with relatively strong finances and secure pipeline contracts, has been swept up, Williams Capital's Sorbara said by phone. It's lost $3.2 billion in market value, or 9%, since May 21.While the shortages are real, he deems much of the market sell-off ""overblown,"" since even discounted Permian crude is selling for well above where many producers set their budgets earlier this year.Investors, though, are fleeing to the relative safety of larger names with more diverse portfolios such as Occidental Petroleum (OXY), whose shares are flat over the past couple weeks. The Permian's biggest oil producer also pumps in the Middle East and Colombia, with roughly 40% of its output this year based on higher international crude pricing, Capital One Securities said in an analyst note.The company also operates pipelines and a Gulf Coast export terminal that will benefit from cheaper U.S. crude prices. ""The largest companies or companies with diverse portfolios can rotate capital around,"" Sorbara said. ""If you're a pure play, the only thing you can do is step on the brakes.""With bottlenecks between the Permian and major Gulf Coast refiners, operators in other parts of the country served by less-congested pipelines have a relative advantage, analysts say.That includes Delek US (DK), CVR Refining (CVRR) and HollyFrontier (HFC), with refineries in New Mexico, Arkansas and northeastern Texas, among other locations, according to Barclays. Delek gets about 78% of its crude from the Permian, HollyFrontier gets 39% and CVR gets 14%, the bank said in a June 5 analyst report.Delek shares have climbed 7.5% in the past two weeks while CVR is up 3.3% and HollyFrontier is up 1%.""Simply put, we think U.S. refiners win big with lower input costs,"" analysts including Justin Jenkins at Raymond James & Associates said in a June 4 note.Enterprise Products Partners and Magellan Midstream Partners also stand to benefit from the blowout in Midland prices as they own crucial pipelines in the Permian and dock space on the Gulf used for exports — and have plans to add more.""The very idea of congestion is beneficial,"" said Sandy Fielden, director of oil research at Chicago-based Morningstar. ""If I'm going to pitch my new pipeline or expand my pipeline, and I'm going to hold my open season, I can expect to see a full crowd there anxious to sign up quickly.""Enterprise started full service in April on its 416-mile Midland-to-Sealy pipeline, which can carry some 575,000 barrels per day of crude from the heart of the Permian to key export facilities in Houston. They also own the lion's share of crude storage tanks and docks along the Gulf.Magellan operates and owns part of the 400,000-barrel-a-day BridgeTex pipeline, transporting oil from the Permian to Corpus Christi, Texas. That route is scheduled for expansion in early 2019 because of added interest. The company said last month that almost all existing customers on its Longhorn pipeline, connecting the Permian to Houston, have renewed their contracts for two years.

1267,SEE,"Mylan (MYL) surged to a nearly eight-week high Tuesday after the Food and Drug Administration approved its knockoff of Amgen's (AMGN) bone marrow stimulant Neulasta.On the stock market today, Mylan popped 3.8% to close at 39.98. Earlier, the stock rocketed as much as 8.1% to touch a high last seen in mid-April. Meanwhile, shares of Amgen dipped 2 to 181.73. Shares are forming a buy point at 192.72 out of a cup base.This is the first Neulasta biosimilar approved, but it likely won't be the last, Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a report to clients. Coherus Biosciences (CHRS) and Novartis (NVS) are also working on biologic copies of Neulasta. Coherus shares jumped 5.6% to 16.05. Novartis was off 1.1% to 74.90.He expects the approval to challenge near 20% of Amgen's top line. After the first U.S. approval in 2017 of a biosimilar of Neupogen — the short-acting version of Neulasta — Amgen's product revenue fell by 30% annually due to volume and price erosion, he said.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""A similar erosion pattern for such an important product would unlikely be offset by the company's growth product portfolio and the new launch of (migraine drug) Aimovig, and Amgen's top-line revenue would be at risk for a potential decline,"" he said.For Amgen, U.S. Neulasta sales were $3.93 billion in 2017, representing 17% of its total revenue. Porges says Mylan's Neulasta biosimilar, a drug called Fulphila that was codeveloped with privately held Biocon, shouldn't hurt Amgen's 2018 revenue outlook for $21.9 billion to $22.8 billion.Further, Amgen could work to push its Neulasta Onpro medical device, which automatically injects the drug into a patient's body, RBC analyst Kennen MacKay said in a report. In the first quarter, about 62% of Neulasta's $1 billion in U.S. sales came from Onpro.But MacKay cut his price target on Amgen by 1 to 183, and kept his sector perform rating. He called for weakness in shares and trimmed his U.S. 2018 sales expectations for Neulasta to $3.56 billion from $3.61 billion. The Street expects $3.81 billion.Next up, Coherus' Neulasta biosimilar will go before the FDA in November. Later, Novartis and its partner Apotex will have updates. A second U.S.-approved biosimilar of Neulasta would create increased competition and potential price headwinds, MacKay said.Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler sees Mylan generating $100 million in 2018 revenue from its Neulasta biosimilar. That will climb to $554 million in 2022, its peak year, she estimated in her report to clients.""Realistically, sales may outperform our expectations as Neulasta's profiled syringe currently generates sales of about $1.4 billion per year, and Mylan is thus far the only approved biosimilar, and may therefore fill the channel ahead of competition,"" she said.Leerink's Porges noted Amgen and Mylan are fighting a patent battle. Amgen claims Mylan's Neulasta biosimilar infringes of two of its patents for methods of purifying proteins used in biological products. A trial will likely begin in mid-2019.""We view these manufacturing patents as weak protection for Amgen, and we are not surprised to see Mylan launch at risk against them,"" he said. Mylan expects to launch Fulphila within a few weeks.RELATED:How Do You Spot A Major Market Top?

1271,SEE,"If you haven't had a colonoscopy, you're not missing much, except a chance to save your life.Colon and rectal cancer rates are soaring among young and middle-aged adults. In response to the alarming data, last week the American Cancer Society called for screening beginning at age 45, instead of waiting to 50. And they recommend getting tested even sooner if you have bowel problems. Adults born in 1990 face twice the risk of colon cancer and four times the risk of rectal cancer as people born in 1950.The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force is pushing back on earlier screening and many health insurers are likely to deny covering it. That's a mistake. Some 16,450 patients under age 50 are expected to get a colon or rectal cancer diagnosis in the coming year. A colonoscopy every 10 years reduces the danger of dying from colorectal cancer by 67%.But be careful where you get the procedure.Infection risk from contaminated equipment is a hundred times what the medical community previously thought, according to a Johns Hopkins and McKinsey & Co. investigation in the current issue of the medical journal Gut. An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 patients a year are getting infected from dirty scopes. The scope — a tube with a camera and light on the end — is complicated to clean. Worse, in many health care institutions, the staff get careless.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNew research in the American Journal of Infection Control documents technicians cleaning soiled scopes and then handling clean scopes without changing gloves, wiping down scopes with used towels, and turning off reprocessing machines before the cleaning is complete to ""save time.""An ominous 71% of scopes used on a variety of procedures, including colonoscopies, tested positive for bacteria. The bacteria were not killer superbugs, but these findings are a red flag. Since 2013, at least 35 patients have died from superbug infections traced to especially complex, hard to clean scopes called duodenoscopes. Inadequate cleaning is a broader problem — affecting scopes of all types.Infection rates after colonoscopies vary widely from one outpatient center to another and one hospital to another. Before deciding where to have a colonoscopy, you can check with your state health department website or the federal website Hospital Compare, to see safety data for hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers.Don't let infection risk or the yuck factor of sitting on the toilet for hours emptying your colon before the test dissuade you from getting screened. Colorectal cancer is the second-biggest cancer killer for men, and the third-biggest for women. When diagnosed early, when the cancer is local, it is 90% curable, but patients diagnosed with late-stage disease have only a 14% chance of living five years. That's happening to many young people.Dr. John L. Marshall of Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center says he expected his patients would be elderly. ""All of a sudden I have a bunch of young people, young adults, in my clinic with colon cancer.""Why the rising danger? Scientists don't know all the reasons. But obesity is a major factor, according to Massachusetts General Hospital findings unveiled last week. Adult women who gain even just 17 pounds or more after age 18 are more likely to get colon cancer than women who manage to stay close to their teenage weight.One-third of patients diagnosed with it before 35 have a hereditary form of the disease, says Eduardo Vilar-Sanchez of Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center. Family history is a good reason to get screened at an early age.Looking ahead, researchers are developing a blood test to identify who has precancerous polyps in their colon, making colonoscopies unnecessary.Meantime, the American Cancer Society and other advocates should push hard for cleanliness in hospitals and outpatient facilities to minimize infection risk from a colonoscopy. Worries about dirty instruments shouldn't scare patients away from getting the test they need to beat colon cancer.Other columns by Betsy McCaugheyMore Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1272,SEE,"""Are you on the take?""When I tried to get Edgewater, New Jersey, politicians to answer that question, the mayor wouldn't discuss it, ultimately telling me, ""You may sit down.""The town of Edgewater is right across the Hudson River from Manhattan. Anyone fortunate enough to live there gets a spectacular view of New York City's skyline.But the Edgewater city government wants to seize a choice piece of waterfront land for itself.The spot in question is owned by a developer, the Maxal Group. Maxal bought the property for about $26 million and then spent millions more to clean it up. They planned to build apartments and, to please the town, parks, a school and a ferry stop for commuters.""This whole pier would be open to the public,"" says Thomas O'Gara of the Maxal Group, showing off the spot in my latest YouTube video.In addition, Maxal's development would generate about $12 million a year in taxes for Edgewater.Sounds good to me, or at least good enough to see how the market responds. But Edgewater's politicians just said no. Now they're using eminent domain law to try to seize the property and spend taxpayer dollars to put Edgewater's Department of Public Works there — a department of just thirteen people.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseWhy would they do that?""The unsuccessful bidder is a fellow named Fred Daibes,"" says Maxal's lawyer. After Maxal bought the property, ""Daibes told us, 'you will never be able to develop this property!'""Apparently, Fred Daibes knew something they didn't.Daibes is the biggest apartment developer in the area. He told a reporter, ""You can't be in Edgewater and not be affiliated with me.""I suspect that means that Daibes controls Edgewater's politicians.A lawsuit filed by Maxal Group says four city council members got loans from a Daibes-controlled bank, and Mayor Michael McPartland pays below-market rent to live in a Daibes apartment building. (The mayor told a reporter that he doesn't pay below-market rent.)Of course, the politicians give a different reason for seizing Maxal's land. They said Maxal's project was too big.But they approved an even larger project nearby! That one happens to be controlled by — you guessed it — Fred Daibes. Daibes' development will have 250 more apartments than Maxal's and buildings twice as tall.I tried to ask Daibes about all this, but he declined to be interviewed.Edgewater's mayor and the city council would not agree to talk either.So I went to the Edgewater city council meeting and asked, ""Are you on the take ... rejecting one building in favor of the one owned by the guy where you live?""A town lawyer quickly spoke up, ""Mr. Mayor, as your legal counsel, I'm going to suggest and recommend that you don't answer the question from this gentleman ... certainly not with that tone, that objectionable tone.""I asked, ""Is it true that four of you are getting loans from Mr. Daibes' bank, and is it true that you (Mayor McPartland) get a discounted apartment in Mr. Daibes' building?""The lawyer spoke up again, ""Mr. Mayor, I don't think it's appropriate."" Eventually the mayor, without answering my questions, closed the meeting. The lawyer said, ""He's done.""And that was that.Maybe we'll get more answers from Edgewater after my video about this circulates.People everywhere should ask questions of politicians who hand out favors to well-connected big shots.A great thing about capitalism is that the only legitimate way to get rich is to serve your customers well. Customers have choices. To make money, businesses must offer something better than competitors offer. Developers can't tell other developers ""you can't build here"" because they cannot use force.Unless they have cronies in government. Governments can use force. They have the power to ban some developments while approving others. They can use eminent domain law to seize property.That's what's happened in Edgewater.When politicians favor their friends, that's not capitalism, that's crony capitalism. Crapitalism. Corruption.Maxal's lawsuit alleges ""corrupt transactions"" by Edgewater's politicians.I think Maxal is right.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1273,SEE,"Starbucks (SBUX) Chairman Howard Schultz will leave the coffee chain later this month, bringing to a close a nearly four-decade run at the company that ushered coffeehouse culture into mainstream American life and carved out a global restaurant empire to rival McDonald's (MCD).XSchultz, 64, who helped grow Starbucks from 11 stores to more than 28,000 in 77 countries, will become chairman emeritus on June 26. Myron Ullman will take over as the new head of the board, the company said in a statement.His exit will likely fuel speculation he could be gearing up for a presidential bid. In a letter to employees announcing his exit, he said that he is ""thinking about a range of options for myself, from philanthropy to public service, but I'm a long way from knowing what the future holds.""Schultz's announcement was calculated to make a big splash. He gave an extended interview to the New York Times in advance, with an interview on CNBC scheduled for Tuesday morning. If Schultz decides to make a bid for the presidency, he could lean on the experience of one of a longtime board member, the former presidential candidate and ex-Senator Bill Bradley.Schultz is leaving a Starbucks that is still growing in the U.S. -- but not at the spectacular rates of the past. The company, now one of the world's largest restaurant chains, is betting big on China, where it plans to more than triple revenue in the next five years. But investors have been underwhelmed by the company's new outlook, with the shares falling about 11% in the last year.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coffee chain also recently faced backlash after two black men were arrested at one of its Philadelphia cafes while waiting for a meeting to start. The chain closed about 8,000 company-owned stores for an afternoon of anti-bias training last week, a decision that some shareholders questioned for the expense.Last April, Schultz transitioned from chief executive officer to executive chairman, where he oversaw the company's social impact initiatives. He also was working on growing the chain's premium Reserve brand that includes flagship roastery locations, as well as the partnership with Italian bakery Princi. His top lieutenant Kevin Johnson took over the CEO role last year.New chairman Ullman is a retail executive, who left the helm of J.C. Penney (JCP) in 2015 after stints at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA and what's now Macy's (M).Schultz will be spending more time with his family this summer, as well as working on a book about the chain's social impact, the company said.Shares fell as much as 2.8% in late trading after the announcement.

1296,SEE,"Discipline and persistence are keys to learning leadership skills. That, says Martin Lanik, CEO of Denver-based leadership development firm Pinsight, is because he sees it as vital for leaders to practice those skills, just as an athlete or musician would.Here's how to do it.Rote is right. Lanik, author of ""The Leader Habit,"" tells leaders to identify the traits and characteristics they need to be successful and then constantly work at aspects of them.""Do it so often that you don't think about it,"" Lanik told IBD. ""Make it like your morning routine.""Take small steps. It'll take too long if a leader focuses on a big task, Lanik says. Break it down into pieces so you can focus on one thing and make it a habit. Say you want to get better at delegating tasks. Rather than focus on that broad goal, start with one aspect, such as confirming that the person to whom you're delegating actually wants to do it.""Ask as you're delegating if that's something the person would like to do,"" Lanik said. ""If you keep practicing that, after a couple of months it'll become automatic.""Win faith. It's vital for the leader to be disciplined because that consistency creates stability that shows the team members they can believe in the person at the top.""Then there's a lot of pride and trust in the leader,"" said Bette Price, who runs the Price Group, her Dallas-based management consulting firm.Find opportunity. Persistence is vital because problems are always going to pop up. Things rarely go the way you planned. Take the attitude that you won't give up, Price says.""See obstacles as steppingstones,"" Price said. ""It's the old idea of either earn or learn. Obstacles are an inherent, realistic part of business.""Make less effort. You probably want to try harder, but Lanik gives the opposite advice. Practice traits that aren't as complex and that are achievable.""You can be persistent by minimizing effort,"" Lanik said. ""Cramming behaviors into a day is not sustainable. Keep it simple and focus on one step at a time. That's actually sustainable.""Focus on your strengths. You're better off paying attention to improving areas where you have natural talent, Lanik says. If you're an introvert, it'll take so much energy and effort to force yourself to do public speaking that it's unlikely you'll become successful at it. Instead, replace it with something you have a knack for, such as active listening.""You can fake that you like it and learn to do anything,"" Lanik said. ""But is the time and effort you put into it worth what you'll get out of it?""Stay positive. Avoid negative people. They're never going to overcome problems, Price says. Get people with a can-do attitude who can get past challenges.""No leader can do it alone,"" Price said. ""You have to trust your team.""Seek input. Don't just look for help from your executive team when trying to bring discipline and perseverance to the company's culture. Listen to all of your people. The best ideas often come from front-line workers.""They know that whatever part they play, they'll feel involved,"" Price said.Make end results clear. When people know how important their role is, they'll have a stronger sense of purpose, Price says. As she's researched millennials she found one person who had to compile papers for a presentation. It seemed like a menial task but he later found out it was for the sales team trying to close a big deal.""He said if he knew that he would've felt important,"" Price said.Track progress. Gauge how you're progressing in hitting your leadership practice goals.""Think about leadership development as a continuous process and have a system that keeps people accountable,"" Lanik said.

1309,SEE,"Will the current creep up in interest rates slow demand in the vacation-resort time share market? One executive answers an emphatic, ""No.""Mike Flaskey, CEO of Diamond Resorts, says his firm is ""very bullish"" and aims to keep expanding in hot leisure destinations such as Hawaii. One piece of proof: the company's recent $225 million purchase of The Modern Honolulu in Oahu.Diamond will upgrade it to meet customers' demands for luxury-style suite accommodations that feature full-size kitchens and one- or two-bedroom formats.""It's a four-star property. We're going to go through it floor by floor,"" Flaskey told IBD during an interview Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, Calif.Flaskey said that Diamond Resorts generates roughly $100 million in annual sales centered on its collection of membership-based hotels across the entire Hawaiian isles. While Las Vegas is Diamond's top sales market, Flaskey believes Hawaii will in time take the top spot.One leg of Diamond's business is financing the purchase of customers' points-based time share ownership. Flaskey says the typical customer makes a 15% down payment on an average transaction of $24,000. Then he or she borrows to pay off the rest via a loan from Diamond.""Middle America is our customer. The usual household income is between $110,000 and $140,000,"" Flaskey said. ""They are very comfortable with making a regular payment"" to fund the buy. Plus, 30% of Diamond's customers pay off the outstanding loan before maturity.Flaskey's bullish sentiment dovetails with the rising fortunes in recent years among publicly traded hotel companies.The lodging industry veteran foresees the total public market value of timeshare-oriented companies rising to nearly $37 billion within a couple of years. That's up nearly fourfold since the fall of 2013, when Diamond Resorts and competitor Marriott Vacations Worldwide (VAC) totaled less than $10 billion in market cap.Marriott Vacations fell more than 8% in big volume Monday. Plus, shares undercut the 200-day moving average on news it's buying Miami-based ILG (ILG). The operator of the Interval International ""exchange network"" allows timeshare owners the opportunity to access other properties.IBD's Leisure-Lodging group has faded within rankings of 197 industries for six-month price performance. Through Monday, the 15-member group ranked 79th, down from 64th six weeks ago. But seven companies, nearly half of the total, carry a Relative Price Strength Rating of 80 or higher. They include Hyatt (H), Hilton Worldwide (HLT) and Marriott (MAR). All three stocks are forming new bases after decent run-ups since the fourth quarter of last year.In the same group, China Lodging (HTHT) shows the best ratings from IBD Stock Checkup, including a best possible 99 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The diversified hotel chain broke the $1 billion sales barrier in 2017, growing the top line by 25% to $1.22 billion. China Lodging earned a record $2.66 a share, up 46%.The best stocks in the market tend to break out of well-formed bases, such as the cup with handle, while having strong RS ratings. In the same lodging group, Hilton Grand Vacations (HGV) shows a 79 RS score and an 85 Composite on IBD Stock Checkup. The stock has risen as much as 75% since its debut in January 2017.Diamond Resorts had traded on the NYSE from its July 2013 debut until September 2016, when private equity giant Apollo Global Management completed its $2.2 billion acquisition.The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury bond hit 3% last week for the first time since January 2014. The yield has more than doubled from a July 2016 low near 1.37%.The Federal Reserve is not expected to hike the cost of money at the end of two-day meeting Wednesday. Futures traders, though, are seeing a nearly 50-50 chance that the fed funds rate will reach a 2.25%-2.5% target level by December. That implies three more rate hikes of a quarter point each for the rest of the year.The current fed funds target is 1.5%-1.75%.RELATED:Where Is The Stock Market Headed Right Now?

1311,SEE,"Economy: Have Donald Trump's policies had a big impact on the U.S. economy and its competitiveness? The answer, we think, is an obvious yes. Now comes a new report, based mainly on ""hard"" data, that confirms that.The report comes from the IMD Competitiveness Center in Switzerland. Each year it ranks countries by 256 different variables to come up with its global competitiveness rankings.For 2018, there was a surprise: The U.S. leapt three places to take over the top spot in global competitiveness — just ahead of Hong Kong, Singapore, the Netherlands and Switzerland. That jump was based on its ""strength in economic performance and infrastructure,"" ranking first in both areas.That this is so shouldn't shock anyone with any knowledge of what's going on in the economy.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseSince Trump took office, GDP growth has averaged 2.9%, up from 2% under President Obama. Unemployment now stands at 3.9%, and jobless rates for African-Americans, Asians and Hispanics are at or near all-time lows.Inflation, at about 2%, remains under control. Business investment is surging, and a big reason for that is that corporate taxes are low, thanks to Trump's tax cuts.Meanwhile, Trump continues to slash away at the thicket of regulations that strangles the U.S. economy, costing us collectively nearly $2 trillion a year. All of this has helped to fuel an economic renaissance of sorts. U.S. households are $7.1 trillion richer since Trump entered office, thanks to rising share prices and strong real estate markets.Just to be clear, we're not citing this one report as a be-all and end-all for competitiveness or even for the fate of the economy. Nor are we in the forecasting business.But others are, and among them have been some of Trump's fiercest critics. To read what they wrote and said, the U.S. returning to No. 1 in competitiveness wouldn't just be unlikely — it would be impossible.Just last November, for instance, a blog post on the Economic Policy Institute's website informed us that ""Republican tax plan will reduce American competitiveness."" That was, to be kind, wide of the mark.Similarly, the liberal Brookings Institution opined in March of last year that ""Trump's 'America First' budget will leave the economy running behind."" Didn't happen.Going back even further, many economists and pundits were wrong — dead wrong — about Trumponomics. But to this day they can't bring themselves to admit it. Imprisoned by the illogic of their own liberal ideology, they all saw not just failure, but instant disaster. They still do.We've run the following quotes in IBD before, but in light of this new report they bear repeating:""We are probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,"" said New York Times columnist and Nobelist Paul Krugman, just one day after Trump won the election.""Under Trump, I would expect a protracted recession to begin within 18 months. The damage would be felt far beyond the United States,"" said Larry Summers, the former top economist for Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, speaking in the summer of 2016.""If the unlikely event happens and Trump wins you will see a market crash of historic proportions,"" agreed MSNBC's Steve Rattner, a former Obama administration official, speaking in October of 2016.As we said, when it comes to the economy, past performance is no guarantee of future results. And sure, Trump or Congress or the Fed could make big mistakes that would cause an economic hiccup or even a recession.But let's focus on policies, not personalities, and facts, not opinions, when it comes to performance. And in doing so, by any economic measure you might make, the U.S. is doing better today than it was when Trump was elected.Moreover, Trump might be on the verge of another big win over his critics in the media and economics profession.Recall that when Trump promised 3% growth, he was roundly criticized and even ridiculed for what many claimed was pie-in-the-sky political hyperbole. Some even said such growth would be impossible.But, as we noted, GDP growth has averaged 2.9% since Trump moved into the White House, just a hair under 3%. If the Atlanta Fed's GDP ""Nowcast"" — which uses current data to make up-to-date forecasts — is correct, 2018's second quarter could see growth of as much as 4%.That would push average growth above 3% for Trump's term. If so, that would be yet another ""crazy"" idea that Trump had that turned out to be true.While all those dire prognostications we mentioned proved false, the media continue to quote those who made them uncritically.It seems that among the media and the Beltway and coastal elites, no distortion of Trump's many successes ever gets corrected — only repeated. And facts are never acknowledged — only ignored or distorted.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:Say Hello To 3% GrowthIs Trump's Goal Of 3% Growth Realistic?

1320,SEE,"The monthly IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index, a collaboration of Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica, gauges how confident consumers, workers and investors are in the pace and direction of the U.S. economy. As with all of IBD/TIPP's proprietary monthly indexes, a reading above 50 signals optimism, below 50 pessimism.The IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index is made up of three subindexes, including one for the respondent's outlook six months into the future, the respondent's personal financial outlook, and how the respondent views current federal policies. The goal each month is to give as accurate a reading of the current state of the economy as possible.The average for the index over the past 17 years has been 49.4, or slightly pessimistic. The index high of 62.9 was reached in March of 2002, six months after the 9/11 attacks, as Americans rallied behind the U.S. response to the terrorist attacks and confidence grew that the post-9/11 economy would not go into recession as widely feared. The index bottomed in August 2011 at 35.8, as the economy struggled to emerge from the financial crisis and key initiatives to boost economic growth had yet to have an impact.IBD/TIPP also produces the Presidential Leadership Index at the beginning of each month.See the schedule of upcoming IBD/TIPP poll releases.View Questions And Full ResultsThe IBD/TIPP Economic Optimism Index eked out a 0.6% gain to 53.9 in June from 53.6 in May, the second straight gain for the index after posting two monthly declines. In February, the index hit its highest reading since October 2004. It's now the 21st straight month that it has been over 50 — which signals overall optimism about the economy. It is also above its long-term average of 49.4. The index stood at 44.4 in December 2007, the month that the U.S. officially entered a recession.The Six-Month Outlook is a forward-looking gauge that looks at how consumers feel about the economy's prospects over the next half year. The index fell 0.2% to 51.2 in June from 51.3 in May after rising 3.2% in May. The volatile gauge surged 11.4% in January, and then bounced up and down for several months. The reading for this index remains in optimistic territory and well above its long-term average of 46.3. This index stood at 32.1 in December 2007, the month the economy fell into recession.The gauge of how Americans feel about their own finances in the next six months rose 1.8% to 62.1 in June from 61.0 in May. The index's all-time high of 65.3 was set in January 2004, when the Bush-era tax cuts began to kick in. The Personal Financial Outlook is the most consistently optimistic index in the IBD/TIPP data set. It remains above its long-term average of 57.1.A measure of Americans' confidence in government, the Federal Policies component dipped 0.4% to 48.3 in June from 48.5 in May. It's down from its level of 50 in March. Still, it remains above its 17-year average of 44.8. This index briefly moved into optimistic territory in February 2017 for the first time in 10 years, and in March returned to that feel-good zone. But it has flagged during recent debates over the budget, tariffs and Fed rate hikes. Intended to gauge how Americans view government policies put in place by the president, Congress, the courts and the Federal Reserve, the Federal Policies Index has consistently been the least optimistic of the three subindexes that make up the Economic Optimism Index.RELATED:Main IBD/TIPP Poll PageIBD/TIPP Presidential Approval IndexIBD/TIPP Election 2016 Tracking PollPast ResultsMay 2018April 2018March 2018February 2018January 2018December 2017November 2017October 2017September 2017August 2017July 2017June 2017May 2017April 2017March 2017February 2017January 2017December 2016Media ContactTerry Jones

1326,SEE,"SpyGate: Just as fiery volcanoes have erupted in Guatemala and Hawaii, a volcano of another kind looks set to blow in Washington: The ""investigation"" into alleged Trump campaign collusion with Russia, amid new revelations of possible FBI and Justice Department deceit and misconduct and the anticipated release of the Inspector General's report.It might not end like the investigators had hoped.Recent developments suggest that the long-running Trump-Russia-collusion investigation, now in its third year, could be coming to a spectacular, perhaps explosive, end. Consider these recent developments:Moreover, the Senate released emails between Strzok and FBI lawyer Lisa Page, Strzok's lover, suggesting that the FBI's investigation into Trump began as early as December of 2015. That contradicts sworn testimony by former FBI Director James Comey that it began in July of 2016.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIf true, this means the FBI ran a sting operation on Trump to disrupt his campaign — that the supposed ""investigation"" was a sham to cover up for an illegal act. Sources told ABC News that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz's draft report on the FBI's Clinton email investigation calls former FBI Director James Comey ""insubordinate"" and says he ""defied authority"" in investigating the Hillary Clinton email scandal.So what do all these things suggest? That the Mueller investigation is unraveling fast. For more than two years, both the FBI and the Special Counsel's office have investigated the alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.They have found nothing. In Mueller's case, the big fish is Manafort. But he has not tied anyone in the Trump campaign, including Manafort, to any efforts by the Russians to meddle in the 2016 presidential election with the Trump campaign. Manafort's charges have nothing to do with that, and show how absurdly broad Mueller's investigation has been.He cast a net on the waters and caught nothing.Meanwhile, revelations that the FBI spied on a major presidential campaign using information supplied and paid for by that campaign's political opponents has the potential to send FBI and DOJ officials to prison.This is the kind of shameful behavior you see in Zimbabwe, Venezuela and other tin-pot, one-party dictatorships. But not in the world's oldest true democracy. In our country, such behavior is illegal — considered both election tampering and a subversion of our democracy.This enormously complex U.S. intelligence scandal is difficult to follow, even for the media who do so for a living. But the revelations have been adding up. As they do, they create an ever-clearer picture of massive political corruption at the DOJ, FBI and CIA.That is, ""deep state"" collusion by our three main intelligence agencies, not collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians.As much as anyone, former CIA Director John Brennan, an admitted former Communist sympathizer whose questionable past behavior clearly should have disqualified him from a senior intelligence post in the U.S., worked assiduously to undermine the campaign and later the very presidency of Donald Trump.On whose behalf was he doing this? His own? Or someone else's? Was it part of an Obama administration scheme to torpedo any chances that Trump would win the election?Indeed, in recent weeks, the rationale for the Trump investigation — alleged concern about Russia hacking our election — has been shredded.What's left is a major scandal, SpyGate as some call it. It makes Watergate look like a two-bit burglary conducted by political amateurs. Which is what it was.That rumbling you now hear?

1336,SEE,"On Friday, the British police arrested Tommy Robinson, founder and former leader of the English Defence League, a far-right anti-Islam group. Robinson is a controversial character, to be sure, a sort of Milo Yiannopoulos lite. His chief focus is on the threat of radical Islam, which he believes threatens the integrity of the British system.You don't have to like Robinson. But whatever you think of him, his arrest is absurd by any measure. You see, Robinson was arrested for standing outside a court building and reporting on a trial involving the alleged grooming of young girls for sexual assault by radical Muslims.Now, what would be illegal about that, you ask? It turns out that Robinson was given a suspended sentence last year for filming outside another court building, where a trial for alleged gang rape by radical Muslims was taking place. He wasn't inside the courtroom.Nonetheless, the judge believed he was somehow biasing the jurors. According to the judge, Robinson was sentenced thanks to ""pejorative language which prejudges the case, and it is language and reporting ... that could have had the effect of substantially derailing the trial.""This time, Robinson was again arrested for prejudicing a case, only he wasn't inside the court building. He was outside. And the media were originally banned from reporting on his arrest so that his trial wouldn't be biased.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseIn other words, Britain has now effectively banned reporting that actually mentions the Islamic nature of criminal defendants for fear of stirring up bigotry — and has banned reporting on reporting on such defendants. It's an infinite regress of suicidal political correctness.But at least the Europeans have their priorities straight: While it's perfectly legal to lock up a provocateur covering a trial involving Muslims, the European Union is now considering a ban on products like cotton buds, straws and other plastics for fear of marine litter. And just as importantly, it's now perfectly legal to kill unborn children again in Ireland, where voters — with the help of a cheering press — decided to lift the ban on abortions until the 20th week, condemning thousands of children to death.This is how the West dies: with a tut-tut, not with a bang. The same civilization that sees it as a fundamental right to kill a child in the womb thinks it is utterly out of bounds to film outside a trial involving the abuse of children, so long as the defendants are radical Muslims. The Europeans have elevated the right to not be offended above the right to life; they've elevated the right to not be offended above the right to free speech, all in the name of some utopian vision of a society without standards.Discarding those standards was supposed to make Europeans more free; it was supposed to allow Europeans to feel more comfortable. But the sad truth is that no society exists without certain standards and Europe has a new standard: enforcement of its ""tolerance"" via jail sentence, combined with tolerance of multiculturalism that sees tolerance itself as a Trojan horse. The notion of individual rights sprang from European soil. Now they're beginning to die there.Other columns by Ben Shapiro

Alibaba, ServiceNow, Red Hat, Grubhub all boast best-possible IBD Composite Ratings of 99. Tal Education has a 98 Composite Rating. Big stock winners often have a Composite Rating of at least 95 near the start of their runs.All of these stocks are recent breakouts, but they have had some trouble holding in buy areas. That reflects the sideways stock market action of the Dow Jones, S&P 500 index and, until last week, the Nasdaq composite.Also the breakout volume generally has been light-to-lackluster, with the partial exception of Alibaba. That suggests a lack of conviction buying by mutual funds.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAlibaba rose 3.2% to 204.34 in Friday's stock market trading, moving above a 201.60 double-bottom buy point. Volume was 33% above normal.

The top Chinese stock had been finding resistance at the 200 level for several weeks.Alibaba rose 2.3% to 208.95 Monday.The cloud-based software firm is known for its business management products, but has expanded into other fields. ServiceNow moved back a 176.66 flat-base buy point last week, closing Friday at 181.51.ServiceNow initially closed above that entry on May 9, with volume that was just 8% above normal.

1350,SEE,"Chinese video streaming firm iQiyi (IQ) has rallied in four of the past five sessions, rose as much as 14% intraday Monday, and made a new high of 32.40.So, is the recent price action a climax run, and thus a sell signal?No. The quick reason: iQiyi simply hasn't shown the necessary size of gains that typically precede this offense-type sell signal.In a climax run, a stock goes up in a nearly vertical manner after rising steadily for months or years. Statistically, the stock will also rise 25% to 50% within the span of just a couple of weeks. It may also rise in seven of the past eight trading sessions, or in eight of 10 days.IQiyi has vaulted 42% in just five sessions. But in a typical climax run, most market leaders will have broken out of a base and rallied for a minimum 18 weeks. They usually will have already doubled, even tripled, in price, before staging the climax run. IQiyi fails to meet these criteria. The company debuted less than three months ago on March 29, pricing its IPO at 18 a share.At Monday's peak, the total gain was 80%.Still, the big swing seen in Monday trading is enough justification for holders to take at least some profits off the table. Why? IQiyi broke out of a three-week IPO base on May 10, bolting past a 20.60 buy point. The gain from that proper entry has now exceeded 50%.One of IBD's top offense-type sell rules is this: Take gains in most of your stocks when the breakout achieves a 20% to 25% advance from the proper buy point. If you have huge conviction in the company, then aiming for a 30% to 50% gain is fine. But at some point, you'll want to lock in gains before the winner goes into a natural price correction.The Baidu (BIDU) spinoff is seen as the Netflix of China, providing a platform for high-quality videos over the internet. In addition to original content, iQiyi also offers live broadcasts, online games and books and e-commerce services.The company's sales jumped 56% to $2.6 billion in 2017, but the company also lost $3.86 a share.Analysts see iQiyi posting a net loss of $1.37 a share this year and a loss of $1.09 in 2019.Elsewhere, Apple (AAPL) established a new follow-on buy point, a four-weeks-tight pattern as it unveiled new products and upgrades. Shares rose more than 1% and got as high as 193.41, 1.5% above a 190.47 entry. Volume is running below average as of Monday afternoon action.The four-weeks-tight is an extension of the three-weeks-tight pattern. The tight action reflects an unwillingness among institutional holders to sell their shares.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on charts, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:When To Sell Stocks: What Is A Climax Run?The Latest Inside Investor's CornerHow Much Are These Companies Crushing The S&P 500 This Year?

Now, the stock is trading just under a V-shaped cup with handle's 151.85 buy point. Shares found necessary support at their 50-day line Friday.A potential flaw is the stock's relative strength line. It descended rapidly in conjunction with the stock price in early May.

1358,SEE,"Novartis (NVS) is one step closer to taking a bite out of AbbVie's (ABBV) blockbuster arthritis drug after a European committee on Friday recommended that officials approve Novartis' Humira biosimilar.AbbVie, meanwhile, dipped after an analyst downgraded it on those same worries — that the threat of Humira biosimilar competition would pressure its biggest product. Piper Jaffray analyst Christopher Raymond dropped AbbVie to a neutral rating from overweight.""Specifically, while European biosimilar erosion models abound, and Humira's looming fourth quarter 2018 loss of exclusivity in that important geography is well known, we think investors are still underestimating the downside potential,"" he said in a report.On the stock market today, AbbVie dipped 0.9% to close at 98.05. The stock is consolidating with a buy point at 125.96. Novartis, on the other hand, jumped 1.4% and was near 75.60. Shares of pharmaceutical companies lifted 1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEarly Friday, Novartis' generics unit announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use recommended the full European Medicines Agency approve its Humira biosimilar. Humira treats forms of arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.""The positive CHMP opinion for our biosimilar (of Humira) is an important milestone for the millions of patients looking to reclaim their health after an autoimmune disease diagnosis,"" said Richard Francis, chief executive of Novartis' generics unit, Sandoz.If approved, Novartis would be able to sell its Humira biosimilar in 28 European countries.Humira is AbbVie's biggest drug and one of the best selling drugs ever. In 2017, it generated $18.43 billion in sales. More than two-thirds of that came from the U.S. There, AbbVie is soon to see biosimilar competition, expected in the mid-2020s.Meanwhile, other headwinds persist in the U.S. where copay accumulators are taking some of the wind out of Humira's sails. Other threats, like rhetoric from the Trump administration calling out incentives for middlemen, exist. But it's likely reform is a long way out.The same can't be said for copay accumulators. These make it so discounts — provided by pharmaceutical companies to help patients afford costly drugs — don't apply to a patient's deductible. When the discounts run out, patients must pay the full cost.That's a costly proposition with medicines like Humira, which can run into the thousands of dollars each month.""That said, a very real draw on revenue in the form of copay accumulators has really yet to be felt,"" Raymond said. ""And while AbbVie has already lowered Humira guidance once on this emerging threat, we wonder if it's the last.""It's hard to make a valuation argument for AbbVie, Raymond said. He cut his price target to 105 from 138. Over the next 12-18 months, it's possible AbbVie will gain approval for drugs that treat female reproductive issues, inflammatory conditions and arthritis.""We model success across the board and think they're largely priced into the stock already,"" he said.Raymond isn't the only one to step to the sidelines on AbbVie. Earlier this week, Credit Suisse analyst Vamil Divan downgraded the stock to an underperform rating. He also cut his price target on looming Humira biosimilar competition in Europe.RELATED:How Much Money Do You Need To Start Investing?Investing Basics: How To Sell A StockLooking For The Next Nvidia?

1359,SEE,"Large caps are looking tired. A recent check of the Big Cap 20 found 16 stocks that were either late stage or too extended to buy.Leaders have plenty of reasons to be suffering from exhaustion. Yes, many stocks have had a long run, but success doesn't fully explain the tired look of the Big Cap 20. A fresh rotation of new stock names is supposed to keep the lineup at least interesting. But the new names aren't stepping forward to lead.Why is that?Part of the reason is that the expected leadership never won favor. Homebuilder D.R. Horton (DHI) made the Big Cap 20 at the start of the year. In late January, Horton reported quarterly earnings growth of 42%, the best in 10 quarters. But the stock kept falling in the weeks ahead. In late April Horton reported 52% earnings growth and then fell some more.When good earnings growth can't persuade either a stock or its group to advance, it's best to back away. Arguing with the market is folly. In this case, the whole industry went into a decline.Caterpillar (CAT) is another stock that made the Big Cap 20 in early January. Caterpillar reported quarterly earnings growth 160% in late January. The stock began a choppy consolidation after the results.Caterpillar is now about 11% off its high.Sometimes an out of favor old name can show new strength. In early January, Parker Hannafin (PH) raised that hope. The stock made the Big Cap 20. But the motion-control technologies provider couldn't overcome the market. The S&P 500 dropped about 12% in 10 sessions in late January and early February, and Parker Hannafin sank with the market.Big cap bank stocks were another group that garnered generous coverage but never delivered as expected.Earnings growth has not been a problem for most stocks. But the market has had trouble converting good news into stock gains.What's the other part of the problem?The other problem appears to be news-driven. The market's troubles began around the same time that President Trump slapped tariffs on solar panels and washing machines Jan. 22. The list of targets grew from there.Meanwhile, starting in November, China has had three waves of tariff cuts. This has not received much attention, but it could pay off for China.China has trimmed tariffs on avocados, mineral water, strollers, washing machines, refrigerators, cosmetics, drugs, shoes, kitchenware and fitness supplies. Some say the cuts are insignificant.But if those kinds of tariff cuts were to lead to reciprocal actions, the world economy would benefit. And the stock market would likely see some new leaders.RELATED:Like Your Stocks On The Trashy Side?

The Hang Seng has let an 11.9% year-to-date gain shrivel to less than 0.5%.Despite the decline in Chinese mainland equities, Autohome, a member of IBD Leaderboard since Jan. 2 this year, scored a new breakout from a rare pattern called the ascending base. In such a pattern, the stock has already broken out but then posts three quick corrections of around 10% to 20% over a nine- to 16-week period. The stock must make a new high before each correction; hence, it's an ""ascending base.""Autohome focuses on advertising and marketing of automobiles through its website. The company's earnings have grown 28%, 15%, 39%, 58%, 82% and 53% vs. year-ago levels in the past six quarters. Analysts see Q2 earnings rising 23% to 87 cents a share.On Jan. 2, Autohome had initially cleared a 17-week base that shows elements of a double bottom. This base gave a 67.79 standard buy point.A narrow five-day handle formed on the tail end of the base. That provided a slightly lower buy point of 65.67, a dime above the handle's high. That handle began forming on Dec. 22 last year and the resulting lower entry is very close to the 66.55 ""alternative entry point"" created by the middle interim peak wedged in between the two sell-offs within the base.Check out this recent Investor's Corner column on how a chart pattern can lead to more than one correct interpretation of the stock's current balance of supply (AKA sellers) vs. demand (buyers) and the proper time to buy.On the Leaderboard daily and weekly charts, users can see chart annotations placed in real time on specific buy points, including bases and follow-on entry points.Elsewhere, software sector leader Salesforce.com (CRM) rallied as much as 4.4% and struck a new high of 132.55 before pulling back and giving up nearly half of that impressive gain. The cloud-based business software giant remains in buy range after clearing a 128.97 breakout point in a seven-week cup without handle, a variation on the cup-with-handle base, a bullish chart pattern.IBD's Medical-Products group recently bumped the enterprise software industry group off the No. 1 rung among 197 industry groups ranked each day by Investor's Business Daily.

HDFC's 50-day average turnover is a healthy 826,000 shares per day. That big advance instantly gave the Indian lender much needed progress in creating the right side of what currently looks like a cup base.Notice on a daily chart how much of the current base in HDFC has formed beneath the 50-day moving average. A no-no.Consumer spending-linked names continued to fare well. Shake Shack (SHAK), a new idea on IBD SwingTrader, surged more than 5% and at one point reached as high as 62.54 in volume that is running nearly triple its normal pace.The burger and shake chain broke out of a well-formed first-stage cup with handle at 44.50 on April 26. Volume came in just 13% above the 50-day average on that session.However, Shake Shack saw a 69% boost in volume vs. normal levels the very next session as shares rose another 4.1% to 47.26, quickly exiting the permissible 5% buy zone.On May 4, the New York-based chain roared more than 18% higher after reporting a first-quarter adjusted profit of 15 cents a share, up 50% as sales jumped 29% to $99.1 million, a quarterly record.Net margin improved 90 basis points to 5.7%.Shake Shack now gets a top-flight 93 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99, as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.

That would mark the fourth quarter in a row of low double-digit top-line gains. Sales jumped 5%, 7%, 12%, 13% and 16% in the prior five quarters.Apple has climbed 61% since it initially broke out of a first stage base on Jan. 6, 2017.

1371,SEE,"It's time to give Facebook's stock some credit.After a data privacy scandal knocked shares of Facebook (FB) for a loop in March, it's recovered in spades — so much so that on Thursday the stock made a breakout from a first-stage base.Facebook's chart is compelling. It recently cleared a double-bottom entry of 186.20, but the breakout was in light volume. Facebook recently added a handle area to its base, presenting an alternate entry of 188.42.It's not often that a former leader hit hard by institutional selling is able to come back, especially after a lengthy price run. Shares of Facebook hit an intraday high of 195.32 on Feb. 1, good for a gain of more than 400% since its May 2012 debut at 38. It closed at 38.23 on its first day of trading.So far, Facebook stock is proving its mettle.Even better, Facebook's price performance since a breakout from a base in late January 2017 offers a great illustration of why IBD rules for buying and selling are always prudent to follow.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe base breakout in early 2017 wasn't perfect but still worked well and ended up being a perfect entry point.It cleared a first-stage cup-with-handle base during the week ended Jan. 27 in higher volume (1). The buy point at the time was 129.37. The breakout reinforced a steadfast IBD rule that says to buy stocks breaking out of bases when the market is in a confirmed uptrend. That was the case at the time.The base was first stage because the low of the base undercut the low of a flat base that formed a couple of months earlier. That served to reset the base count. The thinking behind a base reset is that enough sellers get shaken out of the stock to pave the way for more upside.But Facebook showed less-than-ideal price action the very next week when shares reversed lower in higher weekly volume. It was a sign of institutional selling — not good to see so soon after a breakout. But no sell signal was triggered as the stock held above the buy point and its 10-week moving average.Over the next several months, Facebook rode its 10-week moving average (drawn in red in the accompanying chart) higher (2). It didn't take long for the stock to trigger an IBD profit-taking rule that says to take a 20% to 25% gain in a stock if you have it. Why? Because that's typically the time a stock starts to pull back and consolidate gains after a breakout.In early August, Facebook started to take a breather but didn't correct much off highs. A flat base eventually formed with a 175.59 buy point (3), but Facebook had a hard time breaking out. It rallied 4.9% before settling into a new flat base with a 184.35 entry. It rallied nearly 6% from the second breakout before settling into its current pattern.Big sellers were in Facebook in the week ended Feb. 9. Shares plunged 7.5% in higher volume, giving up support at the 10-week moving average. It rallied for a bit before plunging again during the week end Mar. 23. That was around the time of the Cambridge Analytica data scandal.But it didn't take long for Facebook to recover as Wall Street placed bets that the company would live to see another day without a meaningful hit to earnings and sales.Shares of Facebook gapped up April 26 on bullish Q1 earnings. Investors were also cheered by a boost in daily user growth to 1.45 billion.RELATED:How The Correct Buy Point Marks A Time Of Real OpportunityThe Ins And Outs Of A Double-Bottom BaseFacebook Will Reorganize Into Three Divisions, Plans Blockchain GroupGlobal Stock LeadersWhich Companies Are New To Key IBD Growth Stock Screens?

As for FANG stocks, FANG stocks Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN), while Netflix (NFLX) is slightly extended and Alphabet (GOOGL) is nearing a buy point.Netflix boasts the highest IBD Composite Rating of these top tech stocks, with a best-possible 99. Fellow FANG stocks Facebook and Amazon each earn a 98, while Google parent Alphabet's has improved to a 91. Apple still lags with an 88. Winning stocks typically have a high Composite Rating, which ranks stocks based on a variety of fundamental and technical factors, when they launch big runs.Facebook cleared a 188.42 handle buy point on Thursday, and was within the 5% buy range as it extended gains Friday. It's now just 1% below its prior high of 195.42 set on Feb. 1. Facebook stock sold off as much as 24% from that level and only took two months to battle its way back. While volume is tracking below average, it's decent compared with levels before the stock's March sell-off and market volatility toward the beginning of the year.Facebook fell 0.4% to 193.28 in Monday's stock market trading as the company denied a New York Times report that it gives extensive user data to Apple, Samsung and other smartphone users. Facebook said it provides limited user data to help create their own Facebook apps and that most of the data remains on the specific phones.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

If Netflix stock pulls back into the buy zone in an orderly fashion, investors would be provided with an additional chance to buy shares. Many leaders pull back into buy range after an initial breakout.Netflix stock rose 0.5% to 361.81 on Monday.Alphabet's stock is back in rally mode. While the potential handle entry of 1,118.25 is no longer valid, the Google parent is approaching a 1,178.26 buy point in a messy double-bottom formation. Alphabet rose 1.6% to 1,153.04 Monday.Apple has been trading in a tight range, forming the three-weeks-tight pattern. If Apple stock can soon clear the 190.47 level, that's a chance for investors to add shares to their position. For the three-weeks-tight add-on entry, investors should buy as close to the entry as possible, rather than using the 5% buy range as their guide.Apple stock climbed 0.8% to 191.83, clearing that three-weeks-tight as the iPhone giant begins its Worldwide Developers conference today. But shares closed near session lows and volume was light.If Apple dips, the stock could re-enter the 5% buy zone from the double-bottom base cleared May 4.It wasn't too long ago that the FANG trade, or FAANG trade if you include Apple, was all but declared dead. Facebook was hit hard by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and other big cap tech names were weighed down by the broader market volatility. But now that the performance of the FANG names and Apple are improving, perhaps the FAANG trade isn't dead.

1387,SEE,"It's a hard fact to face sometimes. Not all your swing trades are going to work. But cutting losses quickly keeps the damage of any individual trade at a minimum. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) provides an example. Taking action quickly avoided potential heartache down the road. For long-term performance, that gives you a greater chance at success.Investors had a strong reaction to Chipotle's earnings on April 26, pushing the stock up nearly 25% (1). What really stood out was the tight action over the next few weeks. The stock hardly gave up any gains. Plus, the declining volume suggested very few investors were selling.On May 16, Chipotle Mexican Grill cleared its consolidation as volume picked up (2). It joined IBD's SwingTrader on the positive action. Of course, the expectation was for continued gains. However, market weakness contributed to a pullback. The stock hadn't broken its support levels, so cutting it completely seemed unnecessary. But if it couldn't follow up on the strength, could this provide profits quickly?Reducing the position by half on May 18 acted as a compromise (3). If the weakness continued, the early sell reduces the overall loss. For swing trades, if the losses stay small, it allows the gains to compound and grow your portfolio. If the stock comes back, it can either be repurchased or at the very least turn the trade profitable. In this case, Chipotle Mexican Grill didn't really do either. It didn't see a decisive close below its 5-day moving average. But it couldn't seem to rise back above it. The 10-day moving average provided a level of support that seemed to hold. That is, until May 25 (4).Once Chipotle punctured its 10-day moving average, it was hard to justify holding any longer. Granted, the volume was minimal and the action continued to be tight. But if your stock can't make progress after holding it for more than a week, it's usually time to move on to the next swing trade. Even if the stock doesn't plummet, it may just require more time before it works. There's little reason to risk a downturn in the stock if it needs more time anyway. It's safer in cash, or even better, could be used for another prospect. The fact that the market was mostly sideways during the time made the decision that much easier.The average gain for IBD SwingTrader in 2018 is close to 5% in an average of seven days. Scaling out with the early sell kept the loss for the entire trade under 2%. The handling of Chipotle reduced the loss of money and time on a nonperforming stock.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Long-Term Stock Profits Mean Cutting Losses Quickly In Swing TradesWhich Moving Average Is Best For Profiting On Swing TradesSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1395,SEE,"T.S. Eliot famously wrote that ""April is the cruelest month,"" but when it comes to America's fiscal picture, nothing could be further from the truth about this April.  The latest government numbers confirm that last month was a blockbuster for growth, federal revenues, and deficit reduction.One of the key principles of Trumponomics is that faster economic growth can help solve a multitude of other social and economic problems – from poverty, to inner-city decline, to lowering the national debt.We're not quite at a sustained elevated growth rate of 3% yet, but the latest economy snapshot tells us we are knocking on the door.  The growth rate over the last four quarters came in at 2.9% — which was higher than any of the eight years of the Obama presidency.Halfway through this current quarter, which began on April 1st, the Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates growth at 4%. If that persists through the end of June, we will have reached an average growth rate of 3% under Trump.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseNot bad, given that nearly every liberal Trump critic, trashed Trump's campaign forecast of 3% to 4% growth as an impossible dream.Economists like Larry Summers, Obama's first chief economist gloomily declared that we were mired in a new era of ""secular stagnation"" and that 3% growth was unachievable.Paul Krugman of the New York Times said it was more likely we would see flying cars than 3% to 4% growth.Now for the even better news. We are already starting to see a fiscal dividend from Trump's tax, energy, and regulatory pro-business policies.The Congressional Budget Office reports that tax revenues in April — which is by far the biggest month of the year for tax collections because of the April 15th filing deadline — totaled $515 billion which was a robust 13% rise in receipts over last year.MoneyWeek reports that the $218 billion monthly surplus (revenues over expenditures) this April was the largest ever, with the previous record being $180 billion in  2001. (April is always the one surplus month.)What's the simple lesson here? More growth, more tax revenue.But there's another lesson and it is about how wrong the bean counters were in Congress who said this tax bill would ""cost"" the Treasury $1.5 to $2 trillion in most revenues over the next decade.If the higher growth rate that Trump has already accomplished remains in place, then the impact will be well over $3 trillion of more revenue and thus lower debt levels over the decade.  Putting people to work is the best way to balance the budget.  Period.Critics will dismiss the importance of these higher revenue collections by arguing that the new receipts are for 2017 tax payments, which don't take account of the tax cut which passed in December.This ignores that some of the growth we have seen was a result of the anticipation of the tax cut.  Moreover, the fact that the tax cuts ‎are just sinking in, means we should get even higher growth rates for the next several years at least.Alas, it is not all good news in the April surprise. The inexcusable omnibus spending bill increased federal spending by some $300 billion in 2018 and we are starting to feel the impact of that splurge.  Federal outlays are up 8.7% in April.That's unforgivable given that Republicans run everything in Washington these days.No one thought that Trump could ramp up the growth rate to 3 percent or that his policies would boost federal revenues. But he is doing just that — which is why all that the Democrats and the media want to talk about these days is Russia and Stormy Daniels.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1398,SEE,"Canada will buy Kinder Morgan (KMI) Canada Ltd.'s Trans Mountain oil pipeline and its controversial expansion project for C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion) in a bid to ensure it gets built amid fierce opposition.XFinance Minister Bill Morneau and Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr announced the plan Tuesday in Ottawa. ""It must be built and it will be built,"" Morneau said. The deal, which includes the expansion, related pipeline and terminal assets, is expected to close in August. Construction will continue through the 2018 season, and the federal government will transfer it to one or more new owners when ""appropriate.""Buying the pipeline outright had become increasingly likely after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau first pledged only to backstop it. ""We are going to get that pipeline built,"" Trudeau said Tuesday morning as he headed into a meeting with his cabinet.The purchase marks a stunning development for Trudeau's government -- effectively nationalizing the country's highest-profile infrastructure project until an operator can be found. The project has been beset by legal uncertainty and rising protests from environmental groups and the province of British Columbia. It will be a key test of Trudeau's bid to balance the environment and the economy by backing the C$7.4 billion pipeline expansion while pushing a national carbon price to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Canada first offered earlier this month to indemnify the expansion project before making Tuesday's announcement. The plan includes the existing pipeline that's been in operation since 1953.The plan announced Tuesday has several stages -- construction will continue this year with a Federal loan guarantee as the deal is finalized; the government will look for a new owner or owners to transfer the project to; and then ""indemnify"" the owner against certain costs.Calgary-based Kinder Morgan Canada, a unit of the Houston-based parent, was little changed at C$16.59 in Toronto trading Monday, for a market value of C$5.76 billion. Shares were halted on Tuesday pending the announcement, and the company was due to hold a call after Morneau announcement.The two sides had been in talks since the company set a May 31 deadline for the government to give certainty in the face of opposition from British Columbia, which is concerned about increased tanker traffic and possible oil spills along the Pacific coast. Trudeau pledges regularly that the pipeline will be built.The Trans Mountain expansion would almost triple capacity to 890,000 barrels of oil on a line running from Alberta to a terminal near Vancouver. The 980-kilometer (600-mile) expansion is seen by the oil industry as a crucial link to Asian markets, allowing producers to diversify away from the U.S., which takes the vast majority of Canadian oil exports.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Energy Stocks And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

1407,SEE,"The biggest oil stocks were slow to join the shale boom, but they're ready to pounce on what soon could be the next bonanza: deepwater oil drilling.XOnce too costly except when oil prices were at their highest levels, deepwater oil projects now can break even at price points similar to many low-cost shale fields. New technology and streamlined processes get the credit. Consider this: Crude prices can fall to $35 a barrel, less than half current levels, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) could profit off the Vito deepwater oil project, 4,000 feet deep in the Gulf of Mexico.Shell gave the final green light to the Vito project in April, after slashing development costs by 70%. A month later it announced another deepwater oil discovery, also in the Gulf. This isn't a coincidence. The oil company plans to boost deepwater oil production by over 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, to more than 900,000 by 2020. This comes even as Shell ramps up shale activity in places like the Permian Basin.Shell is not alone. Other big oil stocks are again looking at deepwater oil projects, whose high costs made them ripe targets for cuts after crude oil prices collapsed in 2014. Deep-pocketed companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX) are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the potential boom. The steep startup costs of a deepwater drilling platform and rig mean only the biggest companies can afford to invest even as deepwater oil grows increasingly competitive with shale. And deepwater opportunities are wide open next to the crowded competition onshore, where many smaller companies are vying for land, labor and equipment.""A gap had emerged between offshore and onshore,"" said John Kerr, chief technology officer at BHGE's (BHGE) oilfield equipment unit, in an interview with IBD. ""The last three to four years we basically applied a strict diet into what was a historically expensive environment.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnalysts caution against direct comparisons of deepwater oil drilling and shale, saying they are like apples and oranges. But in general, shale drilling is more nimble. That means companies can respond more quickly to price fluctuations by adjusting activity without sinking their cash flow. A well in the Permian can cost about $10 million.Deepwater oil projects, those that reach depths of 500 feet or more underwater, can require billions of dollars of total investment. And their complex, sprawling operations can't throttle back so easily. The Vito development, for example, will consist of eight subsea wells.However, once those upfront costs are sunk, so to speak, deepwater projects look different. Before oil crashed, they used to cost as much as $1 million a day in the Gulf of Mexico, according to Wood Mackenzie, an energy research company. Today that's down to $400,000 or less.The steep rate of decline for shale well production also requires companies to ramp up drilling just to keep a shale project's output steady, driving up costs. A typical onshore shale well's output drops off 60%-80% in 12 months, said James Williams, an economist at energy consultant WTRG. But a typical offshore well has a 10%-12% drop-off rate in 12 months.And because deepwater oil plays have orders of magnitude more oil than shale plays do, costs are spread out over more barrels. Oil exploration and production company Hess (HESS) said unit development costs for its Liza deepwater project off Guyana are about $7 barrel. Compare that with $12 a barrel seen in the Permian's Delaware Basin.""The Delaware Basin is a great place to invest your money but Guyana is even better,"" CEO John Hess said in May, according to E&P Magazine.In fact, Guyana is among the most interesting deepwater basins in the world, Andrew Latham, vice president of exploration research at Wood Mackenzie, told IBD. He noted that Exxon Mobil and Hess make discoveries with almost every well they drill in the region.""They are basically going to where geology is favorable,"" he said. ""The focus is on quality, going after very productive reservoirs.""He is also bullish on the potential in Brazil, Gulf of Mexico, Senegal and the eastern edge of the Mediterranean Sea near Egypt and Cyprus.One of those areas could be the next ""super basin,"" another windfall for oil stocks on the scale of the Permian.At the CERAWeek energy conference in March, the chief exploration officer at Italy's Eni (E) mentioned the Santos basin in Brazil, saying deepwater can be profitable with oil prices at $50 per barrel.Also at CERAWeek, BHP Billiton's (BHP) exploration chief said the company is focusing on the Gulf of Mexico, Western Australia and the Caribbean.In the Gulf of Mexico alone, an estimated 2.5 billion barrels in ultra high-pressure fields have been discovered, says William Turner, who analyzes the Gulf for Wood Mackenzie. And there are likely even more discoveries in the Gulf that companies haven't reported yet.Companies don't have approvals yet to use the technology that can tap into them. But once approvals start, oil firms like Total (TOT) and Chevron will start drilling and report more ultra deepwater finds, he says.If oil is at $70 a barrel, Wood Mackenzie estimates more than 69 billion barrels of deepwater oil are profitable worldwide as well as 31 billion barrels of oil equivalent of gas.As it did with shale projects, the oil crash forced deepwater project managers to find ways to streamline.Companies used their best drilling and completion crews. The ones that didn't cut it didn't make it during the downturn.Increased coordination between drilling and surface teams helped them get the job done right the first time. Or, if there was a problem, they were able to fix it more quickly.Companies also used off-the-shelf drilling platform technology instead of costlier bespoke equipment.""The two big areas they have worked on are drilling expenses and facility expenses,"" Judson Jacobs, senior research director of upstream operations at research firm IHS, told IBD. ""Largely what they've done is become more efficient with how they drill.""The time between a deepwater discovery and the start of production is now about three to five years, instead of seven years as in the past, according to Bob Fryklund, chief strategist for IHS' upstream division.So what might've been a ""long-cycle"" project is now a medium-term one, making it more competitive, he says.Another technique gaining interest is subsea processing. That's where oil processing takes place on the seafloor instead of the ocean's surface.""What drives the costs the most is the topside, what you have to put on the surface,"" Fryklund said. ""We can now put a lot of stuff on the floor.""Oil companies could reduce costs by an additional 30%-50% with newer technology and higher levels of data analytics, Jacobs says.For example, 3D printing has improved the turnaround time for repairing and replacing parts.In the future, artificial intelligence and robotics will further cut costs for deepwater drillers.Among the big oil stocks, BP (BP) already uses magnetic crawler robots to scour for cracks in pipes in some Gulf of Mexico projects. Later this year, Total will deploy a robot to look for gas leaks in its North Sea operations off the coast of Western Europe.Tech advances are also enabling more remote drilling, says Kishore Sundararajan, chief engineering officer at BHGE's oilfield services unit. And since space on the rig is the most expensive real estate on a deepwater project, moving personnel off the rig via remote operations saves money.The Trump administration plans to open new areas to the oil industry. Nearly the entire U.S. coastline would be fair game.The Northeast Atlantic, which hasn't seen drilling since the 1970s, could be a particularly attractive spot for oil companies, Fryklund says.The Trump administration also wants to remove regulations imposed after the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon disaster. Those rules added to the industry's production costs, worsening the downturn seen a few years later.""With the Trump administration, there is expectation they are going to review some of the more stringent offshore drilling rules in the U.S."" that resulted from overregulation, according to Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group. ""Expect to see a more friendly environment for producers to come in.""Still, Flynn says, BP's disaster-related expenses, which are about $65 billion, could be a deterrent against lax safety that regulators can't provide.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Oil Stocks And Industry NewsWhy Oil Stocks Are Getting Slammed On The Stock MarketHere's The Clearest Sign Yet That The Biggest IPO Ever Is On HoldBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth Stocks

The Labor Department's monthly figures earlier Friday showed manufacturers added 18,000 jobs in May, slightly above the average for the past two years. American households and companies are spending steadily, helped in part by lower taxes.Meanwhile, a gauge of input prices advanced for a sixth straight month, reaching the highest level since April 2011.

1422,SEE,"For those looking for the best dividend stocks in 2018, the Utility Leaders screen may prove disappointing right now. The list remains scant, with just six stocks as of the end of Friday's trading. They include Exelon (EXC), featured in this column on May 12 and in IBD Weekly.FirstEnergy (FE) doesn't make the current screen. One possible reason why: It could be the decline in cash payouts in recent years, as calculated by William O'Neil + Co. But the Akron, Ohio-based company makes up for that negative factor with plenty of positive ones.Consider FirstEnergy's 3-year Earnings Stability Factor, a very respectable 7 on a scale of zero (highly stable) to 99 (highly volatile). Income investors want to focus on companies that do not see big fluctuations in profits. Stable profits boost the odds that a company will sustain or even increase its dividend paid out per share.Second, the stock's annualized dividend yield of 4.2% nearly makes an embarrassment of the S&P 500's 1.8% yield.FirstEnergy is set to pay 36 cents a share Friday to shareholders of record May 7. The company has delivered that quarterly cash dividend for more than four years in a row. But it marks a decline from the 55 cents per share that First Energy paid for many years through December 2013.On April 23, FirstEnergy reported non-GAAP earnings of 67 cents a share, up 29% vs. a year ago, as revenue increased 4% to $2.98 billion""Eighteen months ago, we announced our plan to move away from commodity-exposed generation, so our company could fully focus on the tremendous opportunities in our regulated businesses,"" Charles E. Jones, FirstEnergy president and chief executive officer, said in a news release. ""Today, we are pleased to report strong earnings that represent FirstEnergy as a fully regulated company, and to reaffirm our guidance and growth projections.""FirstEnergy also raised its full-year non-GAAP profit forecast to a range of $2.25-$2.55 a share. The midpoint of that range would mark a 15% decline vs. the $2.82 it earned in 2017.The stock on Tuesday halted a five-day winning streak and closed a hair beneath its rising 50-day moving average. FirstEnergy shares are up 11.4% since Jan. 1.Watch to see if the stock musters the strength to not only retake the medium-term support and resistance line but also overcome overhead selling near 35 to 36.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary and analysis on stocks, charts, and financial markets.)RELATED:The Current Utility Stock LeadersIPO Leaders

1428,SEE,"There's an options trade that promises stellar returns if U.S. stocks continue to tread water. The catch: It's only managed to deliver that a handful of times over the past decade.Welcome to the forgotten world of buy-writes: an investing style for traders who lack conviction on whether the second-longest bull market on record still has life. It combines long equity exposures with sales of call options to deliver potentially double-digit returns in the event that index moves are subdued.With the main U.S. stock benchmark churning near the midpoint of its trading range, now could be the strategy's moment in the sun. The Cboe S&P 500 BuyWrite Index is besting the equity gauge this year on a price basis, putting it on track for only its third year of outperformance over the past 10.""The investor who is most interested in this fund is someone who thinks the market is going to chop around, go sideways, maybe see a slight pullback,"" said Ted Samulowitz, manager for the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio ETF (PBP) at Invesco Advisers.Here's how it works: A portfolio of stocks is acquired, and call options are written on some or all of the shares. The fund earns income from selling the calls, in exchange for giving up the appreciation beyond the exercise price of the options. In other words, if stocks soar, holders won't participate in much, if any, of the gains.It's an investing style recommended by UBS Group, which points out that money managers can trade ""exposure to significant potential upside in equity markets for a smaller, but certain, extra return,"" according to a recent note.While U.S.-listed passive products tracking the strategy have only seen tepid inflows at best so far this year, it offers a juicy income stream that can cushion against moderate market dips, proponents say.The biggest ETF of its kind, the PowerShares S&P 500 BuyWrite Portfolio, collects around 125 basis points a month from selling options, according to Samulowitz. That's up from around 80 basis points a month at the end of last year, he said, as the trade has the somewhat paradoxical quality of benefiting from moderate bouts of volatility.""It's just another nice thing about a buy-write strategy because as volatility goes up, we collect more premium,"" said Samulowitz.The Cboe BuyWrite Index trailed the S&P 500 by 6 percentage points last year on a price basis, while the gap was 2.5 percentage points in 2016. But in down years for stocks, buy-writes can outperform, outpacing the return of the S&P 500 by about 6 percentage points in 2015. While the strategy is neck-and-neck with the S&P this year on a total return basis, it can be adjusted to allow for more or less participation in the market's upside.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe AdvisorShares STAR Global Buy-Write ETF (VEGA), for instance, can sell out-of-the-money calls, which allows it to benefit to a certain extent from rising stocks, according to Rebecca Valdez, fund manager at Partnervest Advisory Services, which manages the ETF.There's an argument that investors who seek yield and don't see much upside in stocks should put their money into bonds, but Samulowitz considers buy-write strategies as a substitute for high-yield debt in a portfolio.""If credit spreads start to widen out, the equity cycle is probably not going to roll over for another six months, so the buy-write should continue to outperform,"" said Samulowitz.While the trade can protect against moderate volatility, it isn't a panacea should another massive spike come along, according to Valdez. The Cboe index fell more than the S&P 500 when volatility more than doubled in early February amid a perfect storm of overextended positions and monetary fears.""You can't negate all of the volatility with a buy-write strategy, but you can definitely dampen it,"" said Valdez.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:6 Ideas To Consider If The Stock Market Is Making You NervousExtreme Market Moves Taking Hold As Italian Bonds Test ModelsNew Leaders Emerge Among Market-Beating Foreign Stock Plays

1434,SEE,"Just when it looked like the new normal of lackluster growth was history, Italy's political crisis threatens to throw a soggy pizza on the Trump economic boom.As Italian government bond yields surged on Tuesday, triggering long-dismissed fears about the fate of the European Union's currency area, the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled nearly 400 points, or 1.6%, on the stock market today. The S&P 500 slid 1.2%.While those fears about a breakup of the euro may be overdone, the uncertainty surrounding Italy is likely to linger and exacerbate global economic fragility at a consequential time.Just consider how expectations have swung for the U.S. economy: A week ago, the odds of four Fed rate hikes in 2018 were just over 50%, according to the CME Group FedWatch tool. Now those odds have sunk to 15%, and the odds of only two rate hikes have spiked to 44%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseA relatively positive impact of the global flight to safety was to push U.S. Treasury yields lower, with the 10-year yield sliding to 2.79% and the two-year yield to 2.34%, which will lower borrowing costs for companies and consumers. But the 10-year yield has fallen harder, once again squeezing the yield spread and thus banks' net interest margins. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) — Dow Jones and S&P 500 components — skidded 4.3% and 3.4%, respectively, on Tuesday.Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar index continued its recent ascent, jumping to its highest level since July 2017.The roughly 6% rise in the dollar vs. other advanced economy currencies over the past three months is a negative for the earnings of U.S. multinationals, since it makes foreign-earned revenue worth less in dollar terms. But economists also see a stronger dollar as a negative for global growth, especially for emerging markets where companies often borrow in dollar-denominated debt that is harder to service when the local currency falls.A stronger dollar is already pressuring developing economies. The rush to safety sparked by Italy's political turmoil will add to that pressure, leading to outflows from emerging markets, and increasing financial vulnerability in places like Turkey and Argentina. Brazil is already reeling from a truckers strike.If a stronger dollar comes at the same time China's economy begins to slow, the global outlook could quickly shift from the best in a decade into a relative soft patch. Economic data from China over the past month have indeed been on the weaker side.European economies also have slowed, leaving the U.S. as the main standout of late. While there's reason to think that the U.S. economy has  enough of a head of steam to avoid a letdown this year, it may not approach the heights expected from the Trump tax cuts.The real risk is that when the stimulus from tax cuts and higher federal spending begins to ebb in late 2019, a softer global economic backdrop will further undercut U.S. momentum. Even if the Fed curbs rate-hike plans, monetary policy may still be too tight.Italy's underperforming, over-indebted economy and financial system emerged from crisis after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged in 2012 to do ""whatever it takes"" to preserve the currency union in 2012, then launched a massive bond-buying program. But now the question is whether Italian politics will allow Draghi to work his magic.The ECB had been moving to phase out its bond-buying program. While that's looking increasingly unlikely, Draghi will have limited ability to backstop Italian debt if political leaders remain bent on flouting EU budget deficit rules and embarking on a fiscal expansion.In March, Italians backed two populist parties, the 5 Star Movement and Northern League, which formed a tentative coalition government this month. The latest crisis erupted when Italian President Sergio Mattarella blocked their appointment of a euro critic as finance minister on Sunday. He then installed pro-market International Monetary Fund economist Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister.A new election could happen in late July, but a top EU official's warning stoked further outrage.""The coming weeks will show that the development of the markets, government bonds and the economy of Italy will be so far-reaching that this will be a possible signal to voters not to vote for populists on the right or left,"" European Budget Commissioner Günther Oettinger said.Oettinger may be right, but it's also possible that Italians are fed up with EU rules after a prolonged period of economic stagnation.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:This Top Stock Set To Hit Buy Zone; Key Tech Sector Holds UpHow JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley Made The Bank Sell-Off Much WorseForget Trump: Why We're Headed For A Long, Cold U.S. And China Trade WarThese 4 Top Stocks Hit Buy Points, But Only One Closes In RangeStock Market Today: Track Market Trends And The Best Stocks To Watch

1435,SEE,"Looking for ways to cut retirement costs without sacrificing your quality of life? Spending does generally decline in retirement. The real challenge for many retirees is how to cut retirement costs — and by enough to keep spending below income — without resorting to radical, depressing solutions like eating bologna sandwiches five days a week.You work too hard building a retirement nest egg to waste any of the income it provides. So here are experts' tips for cutting retirement costs, often by a lot, in four key areas:How can you put a dent into such a staggering demand on your retirement finances? Exercise and education can make a big difference.Corporate wellness programs are proliferating. Companies offer workers more and more incentives to exercise and change habits having to do with eating, sleeping, smoking and so on. Corporations are not pushing their wellness programs out of altruism. They see financial paybacks in the programs. It stands to reason that you can reap similar dividends by participating in what is in effect your own personal wellness program.Here are the numbers: 57% of workers who were at high risk of cardiac problems because they had such red flags as too much body fat and high blood pressure had switched to low-risk status after six months in a wellness program, according to a 2010 Harvard Business Review study.Those workers' medical claim costs fell by $1,421 on average compared to the previous year. For every $1 their employer had invested in the wellness program, it yielded $6 in health care savings.In a separate, more recent study reported by the Society for Human Resource Management, an employer got a return on investment of $3.80 for the disease management part of its wellness program and an ROI of 50 cents for the long-term lifestyle improvement part.The lesson: at the very least, exercise. If you can, join a wellness program that includes exercise at some place like a local health club or your condo's activities center. The participation cost is likely to more than pay for itself in lower medical costs. ""Retire as healthy as you can,"" said Rich Ramassini, a senior vice president for strategy and sales performance at PNC Investments. ""Then take steps to stay healthy and active. It pays off.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBut what about when one of you does need a lift somewhere, while your spouse already has taken the car, perhaps to play tennis with her friends? It cost $6,354 to own and operate a small sedan for the year 2017, according to AAA, the motorist advocacy group. Ramassini says that use of riding-sharing services like Lyft and Uber tends to cost just a fraction of that.Once you do retire, you should have more time to perform maintenance and repair on your own. Stuart Ritter, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price, said, ""Maybe you hired other people to do things like care for your lawn and stain your deck. Now you can do it yourself at lower cost because you have more time and flexibility in your schedule.""Are your handyman skills in some areas rusty? You can brush up at many hardware stores, especially big-box retailers that conduct instructional sessions, Ritter says.In addition, retirement gives people the flexibility to book things like flights and cruises at the last minute. ""If you don't mind the uncertainty, that's another good way to save a lot of money,"" he said.Heather Lord, a senior vice president of strategy and innovation at American Funds parent company Capital Group, added, ""As a retiree, you have more time to enjoy free entertainment such as art in the park and free local concerts in parks and libraries and schools."" Those can add up to big savings, avoiding regular full-price admission fees like $25, $50 or $100 or more per person, per event, Lord adds.YOU MAY ALSO LIKE:You Need This Much Retirement Savings At Your Age And IncomeHow To Apply For Social Security Benefits: What You Need To Know

It's tied to how companies recognize revenue from long-term customer contracts.

The new price target is based on conservative expectations for sales of spinal muscular drug Spinraza, he said in a report to clients.""We acknowledge our call could be early especially as multiple sclerosis/Spinraza dynamics play out in the coming quarters,"" he said. ""That said, we like the potential for the stock to benefit from a fear-of-missing-out rally as more data points crop up on Biogen's high-stakes Alzheimer's disease pipeline.""On the stock market today, Biogen slipped 0.2% to close at 293.96. Biogen stock is consolidating with a buy point at 370.67. Shares of other biotech companies collectively lifted 2.1%.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseBiogen is working on a number of Alzheimer's disease treatments, including aducanumab and a drug partnered with Eisai called BAN2401. Aducanumab data isn't expected until 2019 or 2020. Meanwhile, investors aren't hopeful for data from an 18-month study of BAN2401 in the third quarter.The 18-month study of BAN2401 could have some impact on expectations for aducanumab, he said. So far, aducanumab has shown some promise. Kulkarni sees a 35% chance aducanumab will get approval to treat Alzheimer's disease. He noted stocks tend to be volatile on Alzheimer's news.Aducanumab has been largely devoid of scares thus far, Kulkarni said. In February, Biogen increased the size of a study of aducanumab by 510 patients. That sent Biogen shares diving 6.6%. About the same time, Dow Jones component Merck (MRK) scrapped its studies of an Alzheimer's disease treatment.Still, ""the Alzheimer's disease market is large enough for Biogen to benefit from a fear of missing out in case positives emerge,"" he said.Kulkarni sees multiple sclerosis drug sales accounting for about 67% of Biogen's total revenue in 2018. Risks in that segment include rivalry from Roche's (RHHBY) drug Ocrevus — though Biogen gets a royalty on those sales — and drug-pricing concerns.""While that risk (of headwinds) still remains, we note that Biogen's prescription share, at least in the U.S., appears to have been stabilizing,"" he said. ""We will continue to monitor trends closely, and are also mindful that it may be too early to ascertain the effects of initiatives such as value-based pricing.""Multiple sclerosis is often cited as an ""expensive"" condition to treat. In general, though, the frequency of price increases for these drugs has slowed from twice per year to once annually. Further, generics from the likes of Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA) could eventually take share.For now, however, Biogen looks safe. Multiple sclerosis patients tend to stick with branded medicines and don't seem to see their doctors as often, Kulkarni said.Sales of spinal muscular atrophy drug Spinraza could be choppy on its loading dose schedule. Patients receive four loading doses in quick succession before moving to maintenance doses every four months. This means sales-per-patient peter off when they move to maintenance doses.""It is our view that investors were generally caught by surprise by the fast launch, and are now somewhat more pessimistic on the product given the most recent quarterly performance,"" he said.Further, Novartis (NVS) could compete now that it has acquired spinal muscular atrophy player AveXis.RELATED:How Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?Long-Term Retirement Investing Strategies With ETFsStill The No. 1 Rule For Stock Investors: Cut Your Losses Short

1455,SEE,"As congressional Republicans returned to their states and districts for the Memorial Day week, they were buoyed by recent election results and forecasts for November. The generic poll shifted to congressional Republicans as ""progressive"" Democrats — too liberal for their districts — won nominations throughout the nation.Concurrently, the benefit of Republican tax reform for low and middle-income taxpayers — challenged repeatedly by Democrat congressional leaders — was confirmed by a key congressional source. That shoots down the Democrats' main claim to leadership restoration, which will likely only further nosedive as conservatives wage their campaign for Tax Reform Protection and Expansion.The numbers are now in. According to Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the rich are now paying a higher share of federal taxes after enactment of the Republican tax reform plan than before.For 2017, before tax reform, the JCT estimates those earning $1 million or more a year paid 19.5% of all federal taxes, counting income taxes, payroll taxes, and excise taxes. But for 2018, after tax reform, the committee estimates that these same millionaire taxpayers will pay 20.4% of all federal taxes.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe biggest relative tax cuts resulting from the tax reform are for those making less than $50,000 a year. Their share of federal taxes fell from 4.4% to 3.8%, a tax cut of 14%.Indeed, the committee estimates that the federal tax burden went up for all taxpayers now making over $200,000 a year, from 49.8% before tax reform, to 51.3% this year after tax reform. You have to go down to those making between $100,000 and $200,000 a year to find taxpayers paying a lower share of federal taxes, from 29% of the federal tax burden last year to 28.8% this year.But how could that be? The fundamental reason is the economic growth effects of tax reform.Higher economic growth means increased wages, jobs, employment and income. As the economy grows, the share of taxes paid, especially by those earning higher incomes who still pay much higher tax rates under our so-called ""progressive"" tax code, goes up as well.Those same economic effects of the tax reform amount to economic liberation for the poor, working people and the middle class. After 8 years of economic stagnation under the neo-socialist policies of Obamanomics, the rising wages, jobs, employment and income under the long overdue Trump Republican economic recovery are making America great again for those with low and moderate incomes.Top economists estimate wages for average middle-class families are increasing by $4,000 a year due to tax reform. That's in addition to direct tax cuts of $2,000 a year for middle class families.These economic effects are why we now see the lowest unemployment rates among blacks in American history. And despite the lies of the Democrat fake news media, the lowest unemployment rates among Hispanics in history as well.And these economic effects are why Trump/Republican economics is now resonating among blacks and Hispanics culturally as well, from young black Millennials like Candace Owens to hip-hop stars like Kanye West.Trump is emerging as the gallant victor of America's new cultural Civil War. That is why Republicans are now moving ahead of Democrats in national generic polls for this year's midterm elections.Because working families making less than $50,000 a year pay virtually no federal income taxes, due to Republican tax cuts going back to Reagan, the Trump Republican tax cuts slashed a bigger percentage of federal taxes for these families than for those earning higher incomes.Every taxpayer received some tax cut under the Republican tax reform. But the tax cuts make up a bigger relative share of the taxes paid by lower income workers than for the highest income workers.Democrats openly abandoned blue collar workers in the 2012 election. Then, Obama squeaked by with the voter turnout of his hip ""rainbow"" coalition. But blue-collar workers, formerly the Democratic Party's backbone, got revenge by voting for Trump and his Republicans in 2016. Now it looks increasingly like blue-collar voters will let their voices be heard for tax reform in 2018.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1464,SEE,"President Trump has long argued that America's prescription drug prices are too high, and now we have a better idea of his administration's strategy.A document released on May 11, ""American Patients First: The Trump Administration Blueprint to Lower Drug Prices and Reduce Out-of-Pocket Costs,"" enumerated the details.There are three key take-aways: Medicare will no longer negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies. The administration will seek to shift the payment burden from Americans to foreigners. And drug pricing and purchasing rules, particularly for Medicare, will get dozens of technical fixes.The plan seeks to push prices downward while only lightly addressing the underlying problem of how much it costs manufacturers to develop and produce drugs. This — regardless of the plan's merits — is problematic.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseMany had expected and/or hoped that President Trump would move to authorize Medicare to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers.He advocated such a move on the campaign trail and some — especially on the Democratic side of the aisle — see that as a key to lower drug costs. But there are good reasons why this idea was jettisoned.The federal government has many virtues. Negotiating bargain prices is not among them. The U.S. military supposedly paid $2,228 dollars for a monkey wrench circa 1980 (roughly $7,100 in 2018 dollars).While the veracity of that oft-cited figure is hazy, the problem it represents is not. The federal government's much-vaunted market power rarely translates into a lean procurement process.Direct negotiation would also provide a gigantic invitation to graft.The federal official negotiating with Drug Company X today may well seek employment at that same company down the road. Given the purchase volumes involved, upping the negotiated price by a tiny amount would provide a sufficient windfall for Company X to finance a lucrative career for the negotiator.Companies have memories, so an implicit tit-for-tat doesn't require a handshake — or even a wink.The administration correctly notes that residents of foreign countries benefit greatly from American pharmaceutical innovation. The plan and rhetoric surrounding it imply that we can achieve lower prices for Americans in part by raising the prices that foreigners pay. This is easier said than done.There's the point that if drugmakers could extract higher prices from foreign markets, they would already have done so.Residents of those countries don't pay lower prices because their government negotiators deftly use their market power to bring drug companies to heel. Rather, their lower prices result largely from foreign customers' lower income, lower wealth, and higher saving rates than Americans.Even our wealthiest trading partners are, for the most part, poorer than America. It's questionable whether American manufacturers can charge significantly higher overseas prices without seeing volumes drop.The administration does correctly identify one problem that might yield positive returns. A number of countries abuse our drug manufacturers' patent rights. Cracking down on such practices could conceivably bring financial benefits to Americans.On the other hand, we might simply discover that without their patent-violation discount, these countries would simply buy fewer drugs.The bulk of the Trump plan is a long list of micro-adjustments to current policy. Some are, for now, aspirational: ""reducing patient out-of-pocket spending,"" ""improve competition,"" ""better negotiation.""Outcomes depend highly on the details that follow later. And in some cases, unintended consequences could even undermine the overall goal; the plan envisions mandatory price transparency which, as antitrust law suggests, can sometimes generate tacit collusion.To its credit, the plan does in several places note the importance of reducing the cost of producing drugs. But it misses an opportunity to shift our focus toward allowing for the same types of cost-cutting, life-changing innovations found in America's high-tech industries.Contrary to popular perception, risk-adjusted profit margins in the pharmaceutical industry are too thin to sustain large price decreases without commensurate production cost decreases.That, to a large extent, requires reforming the Food and Drug Administration's approval process — reducing production costs so price decreases won't discourage innovation or reduce the supply of drugs to patients. But that will have to await future documents.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market? Start with IBD University.

1471,SEE,"Wall Street showed mixed stock market action in afternoon trade Friday, with the Nasdaq holding its command over other indexes. The tech-filled composite index rallied 0.1%, setting up a likely weekly gain of more than 1%.Apple (AAPL) helped the Nasdaq's cause, lifting 0.7% to 189.51 in very quiet turnover. At that price, the iPhone giant is now extended past the 5% buy zone after the leading megacap tech bolted past a 179.04 proper buy point in a seven-week double bottom.The double bottom must be a minimum seven weeks. This key chart pattern should feature two distinct sell-offs, with the second low undercutting the first low.This is not a new pattern, but repeated often by great stock market winners in many of the past bull market cycles. Former big market winner Nokia produced one in the fall of 1998. More recently, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) did the same in the summer of 2015.At 2:30 p.m., the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average edged around 0.3% lower. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.2%. The 600 continues to outperform its large-cap sibling, rising 7.1% since Jan. 1.The 500, at 2719, is up just 1.7% year to date, but the key index looks poised to close above the 50-day moving average for a third week in a row.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

1472,SEE,"On the leading edge of the flourishing marijuana industry is MedMen's West Hollywood cannabis dispensary, which resembles an Apple (AAPL) store crossed with an upscale ski lodge. Touch-screen tablets on large, hazelnut tables display the buds' names and their prices. Clear, snowglobe-sized pods containing pot samples have a small latch at the top that customers can open to take in the fragrance. A staff member, one of many in a red MedMen T-shirt, relays customer orders via a small, clip-on microphone to a pickup counter.Big money is pouring into the legal cannabis market, potentially steering more U.S. consumer spending toward weed. And as the marijuana industry evolves into everyday consumerism, struggling beer and tobacco companies might find an avenue for new business in some of the increasingly popular products in Med Men's store: the cannabis drinks stacked in a refrigerator near the corner, or the sleek vaping devices and tins of prerolled joints, showcased in the tables' inset, fluorescent-lit displays.The trend has spurred Constellation Brands (STZ), the parent of Corona beer, to place a bigger bet on cannabis drinks. The creator of Blue Moon, the wheat beer owned by Molson Coors (TAP), wants to make THC beer. Former beverage execs have switched to the marijuana business. As for big tobacco companies, vaping devices alone could hand them a huge chunk of the pot market, a top Wall Street analyst says.Such moves face obvious obstacles. Pot is still federally prohibited, forcing shops to deal strictly in cash, even as California, the biggest marijuana market on the planet, and other states break away to legalize recreational use. Mixing alcohol with THC is also illegal. Less obvious obstacles include creating a cannabis drink that tastes like the alcoholic beverages we know and not, say, a weed fiber supplement.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseStill, Andy Thomas, CEO of Craft Brew Alliance (BREW), whose beer brands include Red Hook and Kona, told IBD that pot is ""potentially one of the most disruptive factors"" to the beer industry, whether it's smoked, vaped or swallowed.""I think regardless of what kind of path you take, you can't help but say it's going to be another one of those forces that changes the way people socialize,"" he said.""You have to look at it as an opportunity,"" he added later. ""Otherwise I think we're kind of putting our head in the sand.""This month, Cowen & Co. estimated U.S. marijuana business could reach $75 billion by 2030 if fully legalized, indicating explosive growth. Its forecast two years ago put 2026 sales at $50 billion. That projection also compares with some estimates for current annual cigarette sales of $77 billion and beer sales of $110 billion, both of which are on the downtrend.Baby Boomers, seeking pain relief, are already buying more pot in general. So are more women, as cannabis products become easier and safer to buy in legal states. A report from the marijuana delivery platform Eaze, which operates in California, found that monthly marijuana spending last year among its thousands of users increased to $179-$189 from $125-$152 in 2016. An average-size pot dispensary draws more average yearly sales per square foot than a Whole Foods, and slightly less than a Costco (COST), research from Cowen and Marijuana Business Daily has shown.As the marijuana business shakes off threats from the Trump administration, MedMen, which has stores and other facilities in California, Nevada and New York, is trying to undo the stereotype of the pot dispensary as a windowless, cavernous weed deli.The company's stores have a bright, browsing-friendly atmosphere with staff who recommend cannabis products based on customers' preferences. In MedMen's store in downtown Los Angeles, shelves of creams, pet meds and Gummi candy line one wall. Near the checkout, wooden bins loaded with joints, packs of tea and other edibles, make up what spokesman Daniel Yi likened to an impulse-buy display.""Just the same way you shop at BevMo for your favorite Cab, the consumer wants to experience the store,"" he said during an interview in March.He said then that cannabis products that come in alternate forms — rather than the dry stuff people have been grinding, packing and rolling themselves for generations — could soon make up a majority of legal cannabis sales.Amid the influx of new marijuana users and shifting consumption habits, alcohol and tobacco companies have particular reason to take notice.As of 2016, the monthly rate of binge drinking was around 13% lower in states that had fully legalized pot than in states where it was illegal, Cowen's research this month shows.Meanwhile, Canada has been grooming itself to be a global leader for the cannabis industry. Toronto-based Cronos Group (CRON) has listed on the Nasdaq. Others, like Aurora Cannabis, plan to follow.""Ultimately, I see no reason why the global cannabis industry won't be as large as the brewing industry,"" said Cam Battley, chief corporate officer of Aurora.In May, Canopy Growth (CGC), which already trades in Canada, debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. MedMen followed that same month, with a listing on the Canadian Securities Exchange that came via a reverse takeover deal.However, tobacco companies like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI), which includes Reynolds American, might have an easier time carving a way forward.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Cowen analyst Vivien Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, big tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""She estimated then that big tobacco companies could nearly double their underlying growth via the cannabis market and grab around a fifth of the overall share of the marijuana industry by 2036 in a fully-legal U.S.Rather than try to snuff out the marijuana industry threat, beer giant Constellation agreed in October to take a minority stake in Canopy Growth. Bruce Linton, CEO of Canopy, said the investment followed nearly a year of conversations. Canopy, he said, was inspired to reach out after Constellation expressed interest in the cannabis market.""That was the very opposite of most of the other liquor, alcohol, wine guys, which was: 'How do we get rid of this problem?'"" Linton said. ""And so we thought that's the kind of guy we want to talk to.""The Canopy investment further chipped away at a longtime barrier between the beer and marijuana industries. But for other companies to make a similar move, they'd need to create an affiliate or subsidiary in Canada, and repatriating earnings from cannabis sales could still be difficult. Constellation Brands did not respond to requests for more detail about its investment in Canopy.The ongoing federal ban on pot is just one obstacle for the burgeoning marijuana industry, though the Trump administration last week signaled it wouldn't crack down on weed in states that have legalized it. Another is getting a precise, consistent dose that delivers a predictable high.Some bars already serve cocktails containing cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonpsychoactive but often-mellowing component of cannabis. CBD beer already exists. But the substance is unlikely to ease big alcohol companies' worries about people swapping booze with pot.""To really solve for the substitution issue, it's going to need to be THC,"" Azer said, referring to the psychoactive component tetrahydrocannabinol.But unlike tequila shots or bong rips, after which you generally know where you stand, edibles or THC coffee might take an hour or two.""People who consumed or who have kind of boomeranged to cannabis probably had a really bad story and experience with an edible, where they didn't know the dosing, or what's in it,"" said Sheena Shiravi, Eaze's director of communications. ""Education is really the key to that.""Eaze, she said, has tried to be upfront about products' THC and CBD levels, so that people can figure out how they react to a milligram or two. Lower-dose edibles, with two milligrams of THC, were popular last year, she said.Even so, achieving consistent taste in edibles and beverages — let alone one that doesn't resemble a rubberized, liquefied version of weed – has been another hurdle.""There have been a lot of folks in our space, the edibles space specifically, that have had trouble with uniformity throughout their products, making sure that one bite and one sip is the same as the next, or discoloration, cloudiness in the case of beverages and food, it can clump up and just taste funky,"" said Alex Howe, co-founder and president of Rebel Coast winery, which is making a THC-oil-infused, alcohol-removed sauvignon blanc.Chip Forsythe, Rebel Coast's winemaker and CEO, said he chose a sauvignon blanc because of the wine's citrusy, lemon-grass notes. And he said it tasted better than other wines when the alcohol is removed, while lending itself to some  characteristics of cannabis.But even as people look to avoid hangovers and alcohol's side effects, making that wine, he said, is far more difficult than letting the grapes sit around while yeast eats the sugar. And he said people still like the taste of the grape-based stuff that has existed for thousands of years.""We did a lot of trials in the beginning thinking that marijuana infused-wine should taste like wine and smell like marijuana,"" Forsythe said. ""We've ruled that out just from getting a tremendous amount of customer feedback on it. People really wanted something that tasted like wine, looked like wine and smelled like wine.""Thomas, of Craft Brew Alliance, said his company has held focus groups and conversations with people in the marijuana industry. He said he would consider making or selling cannabis-infused beverages and other products if federal prohibition were lifted. But he notes that pot regulations differ from state to state, and that competition can differ from product to product.""Trying to compete with weed at something that's predominantly in edible form is a very different animal than trying to compete with weed as something that's part of an ingredient form, is probably totally different than competing with weed, which is kind of an inhalable,"" Thomas said. ""And I think until we really know a lot of that it will be challenging for us to figure out what to do.""None of those products seems likely to wipe out demand for buds. Canopy's Linton likes the odds for marijuana beverages, which combine drinking rituals with the high that comes from smoking.""I've never had somebody say, 'Do you want to come over for Gummi bears?'"" he said.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Could Big Tobacco Become Big Cannabis As Marijuana Business Soars?These Marijuana Stocks With Second-Hand Exposure May Surprise YouHere's How Enormous Marijuana Business Could Get With LegalizationThe Apple Store For Weed Partners With Nasdaq's First Pot Stock

1481,SEE,"After decades of working together, advisors and their longtime clients form tight bonds. These relationships often extend to the next generation. This can be a vital part of building a successful financial advisory practice that lasts.To grow their business, advisors welcome aging clients' adult children to the practice. This can happen naturally as these children mature and need financial expertise.Some advisors adopt a proactive strategy to cultivate the rising generation. But if they push too hard, they can drive away the people they're trying to attract.What's the best way to win over clients' adult children? Start by creating a firm that appeals to all ages.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""We tell parents that we want to figure out a way to make it easy for your children to work with us in their style,"" said Mike Searcy, a certified financial planner in Naples, Fla. ""We know that parents are concerned that there's continuity"" for their kids in planning their financial future.In 2010, Searcy launched a subsidiary company to focus on a younger clientele. It has a different name and brand identity geared to up-and-coming professionals.""Unlike the parent company, our subsidiary has no minimum asset requirement,"" Searcy said. ""It's a different tier of service with millennial partners — advisors in their 30s — who can relate to my clients' adult children. My clients encourage their kids to meet with us.""Knowing that younger clients are more tech-savvy, Searcy harnesses technology at the subsidiary firm. Clients must agree to receive communication via email and many opt for videoconferencing, online educational resources and electronic signatures to sign documents.To work with multiple generations of a family, advisors create opportunities — both formal and informal — for clans to share financial goals and strategize about their future. By hosting such events, advisors help families come together over money issues.""When we do an estate plan for the parents, we like to bring in their children so that it's no longer cloaked in mystery,"" Searcy said. ""Even if the kids don't see all the details about Mom and Dad's assets or the value of their business, they get a sense of the master plan.""In addition, his firm offers coaching for clients' adult children or grandchildren who seek financial advice. He finds that giving them practical home- or car-buying tips can double as a trust-building exercise.Such meetings lay the groundwork for a full client relationship as their assets grow. Searcy, 63, hands off the coaching duties to junior associates so that they can build rapport with their peers.Matt Sivertsen, a certified financial planner in Moline, Ill., goes a step further. He offers to host what his firm calls ""first step cash management"" meetings with clients' adult children. In these one-hour sessions, they learn budgeting tools to develop a long-term financial plan.""We'll ask the parents if they'd like to have our 27-year-old junior planner take their children or grandchildren through this cash-flow management process,"" Sivertsen said. ""In offering this education, we may find that in five years they remember what we did for them"" and sign on as clients.To encourage a client's adult children to come aboard, Sivertsen's firm offers them a 10% discount on its monthly or quarterly retainer. But what helps even more is exposing them to comprehensive financial planning in the first place.""When Generation One holds a family meeting, Generation Two comes,"" he said. ""They come away seeing what we've done for their folks, how we focus on being stewards of the balance sheet and the breadth of our analysis, and they understand the full scope of what goes into a financial plan or a retirement plan.""Initiating periodic contact with a client's adult children — with the parents' consent — serves as relationship-building outreach. Advisors involve the next generation by inviting questions and providing information they can use.""We touch base with them one or two times a year with Mom and Dad's permission,"" said Brian Spinelli, a certified financial planner in Long Beach, Calif. ""We not only ask if they have any questions, but we might also get ahead of certain health issues related to their parents such as early signs of dementia or other behavioral issues.""Spinelli has learned that he doesn't need to impress the next generation by discussing investment strategy in depth. Instead, he responds to their queries with jargon-free advice.""We can get too technical with them and go into the weeds,"" he said. ""But we've found that they usually don't need a lot of technical information. They just want to know we're here and what our role is.""THESE MIGHT ALSO INTEREST YOU:Advisors Steer Clients On Safer Course When Family Squabbles EruptExperienced Advisors Dish Out Pearls Of Wisdom To Rookie PlannersAdvisors Extract More Value From Their Time By Working Efficiently

Trump, he and First Lady Melania Trump are still seemingly banned from The Disney Channel.Why?Just a modicum of research shows that for the eight years of the Obama presidency, The Disney Channel featured President and Mrs. Obama in virtually all of their children's programming and even wrote numerous parts exclusively for Michelle Obama.  The Obamas literally got more airtime than some of the child stars of the network.That saturation of a liberal president and first lady into children's programming being no surprise as a majority of the leadership of both The Disney Corporation and The Disney Channel is liberal to far-left in their political beliefs.But was it fair?  Has Disney gone too far in letting personal ideologies control their public content?I happen to be a conservative Christian who does believe we are all God's Children born with the exact same rights.  The exact same.  No matter our gender, no matter our color, no matter our faith, and no matter our sexual orientation, we are all born with the exact same rights.  We must recognize and protect those rights.Does Mr. Iger, the Disney Corporation and the Disney Channel actually believe the same?Is President Trump banned from The Disney Channel because of liberal frustration, anger and even hate directed at the man himself?

1499,SEE,"Square (SQ), Mastercard (MA), Visa (V), PayPal (PYPL) and Verisk Analytics (VRSK) held up nicely Tuesday even as financial stocks overall tumbled from Italy's political woes. Square, which tried to break out amid the selling Tuesday, moved back above the buy zone Wednesday, while Mastercard and Visa remain above entry points.Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) tumbled between 4% and 6% Tuesday each as investors sought safety in U.S. Treasurys, pushing the rate on the benchmark 10-year note down to 2.79%. The two-year yield skidded, but not as much, to 2.34%, squeezing the yield spread and banks' profitability on loans. (These Wall Street giants rose modestly Wednesday, with Treasury yields recouping some losses.)But financial stocks with less exposure to falling interest rates were relatively unscathed. Visa and Mastercard, for example, oversee vast payment networks but don't issue credit cards directly, unlike fellow Dow Jones components JPMorgan and American Express (AXP). That means they aren't exposed to lower rates or credit risk directly. Payments firms PayPal and Square also are largely insulated from interest rates, though Square does make some loans to small businesses. Verisk provides underwriting data analytics to the insurance industry.Here's how these five financial stocks, each of which is in a buy zone or near a buy point, are performing.

1500,SEE,"Today, all Americans are told, ""Go to college!""President Obama said, ""College graduation has never been more valuable.""But economist Bryan Caplan says that most people shouldn't go.""How many thousands of hours did you spend in classes studying subjects that you never thought about again?"" he asks.Lots, in my case. At Princeton, I learned to live with strangers, play cards and chase women, but I slept through boring lectures, which were most of them. At least tuition was only $2,000. Now it's almost $50,000.""People usually just want to talk about the tuition, which is a big deal, but there's also all the years that people spend in school when they could have been doing something else,"" points out Caplan in my new YouTube video.""If you just take a look at the faces of students, it's obvious that they're bored,"" he says. ""People are there primarily in order to get a good job.""That sounds like a good reason to go to college. But Caplan, in his new book, ""The Case Against Education,"" argues that there's little connection between what we absorb in college and our ability to do a job.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""It's totally true that when people get fancier degrees their income generally goes up,"" concedes Caplan, but ""the reason why this is happening is not that college pours tons of job skills into you. The reason is ... a diploma is a signaling device.""It tells employers that you were smart enough to get through college.But when most everyone goes to college, says Caplan, ""You just raise the bar. Imagine you're at a concert, and you want to see better. Stand up and of course you'll see better. But if everyone stands up, you just block each other's views.""That's why today, he says, high-end waiters are expected to have college degrees.""You aren't saying: you, individual, don't go to college,"" I interjected.""You're saying we as a country are suckers to subsidize it.""""Exactly,"" replied Caplan. ""Just because it is lucrative for an individual doesn't mean it's a good idea for a country.""Caplan says if students really want to learn, they can do it without incurring tuition debt.""If you want to go to Princeton, you don't have to apply,"" he points out. ""Just move to the town and start attending classes.""That's generally true. At most schools you can crash college lectures for free. But almost no one does that.""In people's bones, they realize that what really counts is that diploma,"" concludes Caplan.Because that diploma is now usually subsidized by taxpayers, college costs more. Tuition has risen at triple the rate of inflation.It's not clear students learn more for their extra tuition, but colleges' facilities sure have gotten fancier. They compete by offering things like luxurious swimming pools and gourmet dining. That probably won't help you get a job.""If you're doing computer science or electrical engineering, then you probably are actually learning a bunch of useful skills,"" Caplan says. But students now often major in abstract topics like social justice, diversity studies, multicultural studies.""But don't the liberal arts expand people's minds?"" I asked. Philosophy? Literature? Isn't it all making our brains work better?""That's the kind of thing you expect teachers to say,"" answered Caplan. ""There's a whole field of people who have actually studied this (and) they generally come away after looking at a lot of evidence saying, 'Wow, actually it's wishful thinking.'""A study found that a third of people haven't detectably learned anything after four years in college.Although Caplan thinks college is mostly a scam, he says there's one type of person who definitely benefits — professors like him.""I'm a tenured professor,"" he said. ""A tenured professor cannot be fired. ... You got a nice income and there are almost no demands upon your time.""Professor Caplan is only expected to teach for five hours a week.I told him that sounded like a government-subsidized rip-off.""Yeah.

1501,SEE,"Botox maker Allergan (AGN) is looking to sell its women's health and infectious diseases units, but it won't engage in a ""fire sale"" to do so, Chief Executive Brent Saunders said Wednesday.Allergan is eyeing the potential sale of both units amid a strategic review that began earlier in the year. A sale would allow Allergan to focus on four key segments: medical aesthetics, central nervous system, gastrointestinal and eye care.But the firm isn't feeling pressure to sell, Saunders said.""It takes another party to consummate a deal,"" he said during a conference hosted by Bernstein. ""We will not sell those businesses unless we get the intrinsic value we believe they deserve. There is no fire sale at Allergan; there's no undue pressure to sell them for a bargain-basement price.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

Women's health declined by a third to $163.3 million.The biggest drug in women's health is birth control pill Lo Loestrin. On Tuesday, Allergan voluntarily recalled a batch of its Taytulla birth control pills, which was incorrectly packaged. Its Teflaro drug leads the anti-infective unit, treating skin infections and a form of pneumonia.Divesting these businesses would fall under the potential outcome of a strategic review noted earlier in the year. Saunders also said Allergan would consider splitting the business, buying back shares, making acquisitions or maintaining the business as is.In April, Saunders was seemingly against splitting the company, which would be long and disruptive. He reiterated that viewpoint Wednesday during the Bernstein conference when an analyst asked whether the firm could just split medical aesthetics from everything else.""There may be a time in the future where that is feasible,"" he said. ""Today, it's hard to see how that works.""Saunders noted that medical aesthetics, central nervous system, gastrointestinal and eye care all share resources to be successful. Botox, for instance, is used in both medical aesthetics and as a therapeutic. He called the businesses ""concentric circles.""""Now, is there a point in the future where they'll be big enough in scale? Absolutely,"" he said.

1512,SEE,"General Electric (GE) needs to boost its target for raising capital, even after its new transportation deal, to hit deleveraging targets, and may also have to consider another dividend cut, according to JPMorgan.GE still must come up with billions of dollars in additional capital to fix its balance sheet, analyst Steve Tusa wrote Tuesday, while reaffirming an underweight rating on GE shares and a year-end price target of 11.""With little available cash flow to naturally de-lever, we don't see how, from a risk mitigation perspective, a company of this size and complexity cannot be seriously considering at least a dividend cut and/or a more aggressive approach to reinforcing its capital base,"" he said.On Wednesday, CEO John Flannery warned there will be no profit growth at its core power business this year, adding that the company will see how its turnaround plans play out to determine the dividend.That may have been interpreted as leaving the door open to another cut, but sources told CNBC Thursday that GE doesn't have plans to cut its payout in 2019.Shares rallied 3% to 14.60 on the stock market today after diving 7% Wednesday on Flannery's bearish profit comments.JPMorgan's analysis followed news that GE's transportation unit will combine with Wabtec (WAB) in an $11.1 billion deal, providing GE with $2.9 billion in cash at the merger's close.But in Tusa's view, GE needs roughly $32 billion in capital, far more than its target of $20 billion in asset sales, to lower its debt-to-adjusted earnings ratio to 2.5.He identified possible sources of capital, saying its stake in Baker Hughes (BHGE) could be monetized for roughly $20 billion, while its stake in the merged Wabtec company could yield about $2 billion with other divestitures raking in $4.5 billion or so. But that would still leave a shortfall of $6 billion, Tusa said.Meanwhile, Reuters reported Tuesday that GE is looking for ways to sell off its insurance business, which forced the company to book a steep charge earlier this year.GE had promised in November to shed $20 billion in assets to soothe ratings agencies and find ""their way to get to 2.5x leverage,"" Tusa noted.But he found its leverage ratio is actually worse than generally accepted, estimating it at 4.4x vs. the 3.9x figure that Moody's (MCO) has estimated in its credit ratings.Moody's assumptions on GE's leverage recently ticked up from 3.2x in the fall of 2017, Tusa noted, after the firm included the impact of higher restructuring costs on earnings. Meanwhile, GE's pension obligations remain significant.Against that backdrop, the ""current dividend payout ratio remains too high for the company to deleverage over time simply from running its business,"" Tusa said.The stock bears a 48-cent annual dividend, yielding 3.1%, after the company sliced its dividend payout in half in November.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:If General Electric Breaks Up, Should You Break Up With GE's Stock?Boeing Pounces On Lion Air Deal; Stock Soars On China's XiGE Will Offload One Of Its Oldest Businesses In New CEO's Biggest Deal

That's one of the reasons it's been a mainstay in IBD's Sector Leaders screen. Shares hit a new high May 17, but the stock has been under selling pressure ever since, along with many other top oil stocks.Earlier this month, the oil and gas producer reported its fifth straight quarter of triple-digit revenue growth. Quarterly profit jumped 58% from the year-ago quarter. This year, annual earnings are expected to rise 33% to $6.88 a share, with growth accelerating in 2019, rising 45%.But the stock's technical picture is starting to look problematic.Headed into Friday, Diamondback's Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D- was hurt by four recent above-average-volume price declines.

The proper buy zone extends up to 355.87.In a proper flat base, the stock must correct in price for at least five weeks. On Netflix's weekly chart, you can see that the video streaming giant began its correction in the week ended April 27. Last week was the fourth week of base building.So, is Netflix moving out prematurely?Not necessarily. Here's where the daily chart really counts.Since the stock began its mild decline April 18, Netflix formed the flat base for 25 trading sessions through Tuesday of this week. That's more or less equivalent to five weeks' worth of time in building this important chart pattern among leading stocks.Then on Wednesday, Netflix rallied 13.10 points, nearly 4%, to 344.72. It closed virtually at the session high, a sign of strength.Now, take a look at the stock's action from March 12 to April 16. The cup base showed symmetry in shape. The 19% drop from head to toe? Nice and mild. The problem? Five weeks are not enough to construct a proper base. You need a minimum six weeks for a cup without handle.Hence, Netflix's cup carried a V-shape flaw.RELATED:This Stock Fell 99% But Is Now A New Market LeaderA Stock Forms A Cup But There's No Handle; Is It Doomed To Fail?How To Find Out What's New In IBD's Key Growth Stock Lists

1535,SEE,"Taking profits on the way up is a key part of a swing-trading strategy. The biggest problem? The fear of missing out on an even bigger gain. If you can train yourself to take that fear out of the decision, you can stack a number of gains together for a significant boost to your portfolio. American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) provides a recent swing trade example.The move in American Eagle Outfitters started with a bullish reversal off the 50-day moving average (1). A bullish reversal can signal that a short-term pullback may be shifting directions. When looking for reversals, we aren't trying to catch the bottom on beaten down stocks. Rather, these are stocks in uptrends already showing relative strength vs. the market. American Eagle Outfitters had a Relative Strength Rating of 94. That means, despite its 12% pullback, it was in the top 6% of stocks in terms of price performance over the last 12 months.Volume was above average on the bounce from the 50-day line and it joined IBD's SwingTrader at 20.72. Two days later and it approached our 5% profit goal (2). We took half profits. Taking half profits on the way up allows you to lock in early gains while still participating if the rally continues. We also typically raise our stop. There is no reason to let a trade turn negative after you have a gain around 5%. We raised the stop to a 1% profit from our entry, in this case 20.93. With half profits booked and a raised stop, you help ensure a profitable trade.For American Eagle Outfitters, the gains continued to stretch and four days after our entry, the stock hit its 10% profit goal (3). With five days up in a row, a break is normal and expected. The market also had a bearish reversal a few days prior so locking in the full gain seemed prudent.Taking profits when they come that quickly can give your money some velocity. String together a number of gains back-to-back and your portfolio can turn in spectacular performance. It compresses the power of compounding into a shorter period. Of course, there's a trade-off. The stock can continue without you. You could be compounding your gain in one trade rather than many. That's the goal of position trading. The benefit of position trading is you can see some big numbers in your individual trades and reduce your transaction costs.In the case of American Eagle Outfitters, the stock did go up from our exit. Briefly. Just a few days later it took a 2.7% hit, putting the price back under our final exit (4). Our swing-trading strategy of taking profits helped optimize our gains for the short period of a week.More details on Past Trades are accessible to subscribers and trialists to SwingTrader. Free trials are available.RELATED:Taking Profits Early Is A Key Tenet Of Swing TradesTaking Profits: Swing Trade Example Netted a 15% Gain in 15 daysSwing Trading Strategies And Lessons

1538,SEE,"American Century Ultra Fund (TWCUX) got it right with Wabtec (WAB) — also known as Westinghouse Air Brake.The $11.4 billion portfolio is underweight in industrials, but its managers nonetheless made room for the locomotive equipment maker, starting in 2010. ""Wabtec fits our quality, durable-growth philosophy based on the management team, their track record and a business with a strong operating margin averaging 17% over the last five years,"" client portfolio manager Kevin Lewis told IBD. ""Further, the company has sustainable growth opportunities in aftermarket sales, which are high margin, and also due to strong demand for active safety and improved emission products that they produce.""On news of its agreement to merge with the diesel locomotive business of Dow Jones industrials veteran General Electric (GE) in an $11 billion deal, Wabtec was full steam ahead on Monday, chugging forward nearly 4%. Shares retreated 1% on Tuesday. It lost about another 1% on Wednesday and was up Thursday morning. That left the stock ahead about 19% for this year. Wabtec shareholders will own 49.9% of the combined company. Lewis said, ""We believe the structure of the merger makes sense and view favorably that Wabtec management remains in control and is leading the merged company.""The fund's managers hope to hit similar jackpots with other holdings in leading stocks such as Netflix (NFLX), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Abiomed (ABMD). Those stocks have gained 73%, 35% and 106% respectively this year.Overall, the fund aims to invest in companies whose fundamentals are strong and getting better, but where growth is not fully reflected in their share prices.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services.

That outperformed 78% of its large-cap growth rivals tracked by Morningstar Inc.Ultra is a bottom-up portfolio. It invests stock by stock. Buys and sells are not dictated by sectors or macro factors. Still, there are some broad themes that make some industries more likely ponds for the managers to reel in catches.One is the technology sector, where the managers see lots of growth stock stories. Information technology ended Q1 as the portfolio's largest overweight. ""We continue to find strong growth opportunities through bottom-up fundamental analysis,"" managers Keith Lee, Michael Li and Jeffrey Bourke told shareholders in their latest commentary. In the first quarter, the fund added to its stakes in Facebook (FB) and PayPal (PYPL).Netflix has IBD's highest-possible Composite Rating of 99. Stocks with a Composite Rating of 95 or higher are considered leaders. Netflix offers TV shows and movies to subscription customers via the internet.Netflix is the most-watched streaming service, viewed by 46% of respondents, up from 42% a year ago, according to a recent report by Morgan Stanley (MS). Original programming is the main draw for Netflix.Amazon Prime Video is the third most-watched streaming service. It now captures 30% of viewers polled by Morgan Stanley. That was up from 27% a year ago.Amazon's earnings per share were flat then grew 40% and 121% the most recent quarters. Trading around 1,584, shares are just above a 1,568.62 buy point.PayPal, a tech name to which the fund added, in November agreed to sell its U.S. consumer credit business to Synchrony Financial (SYF) for $5.8 billion. Last week, PayPal agreed to buy Sweden's iZettle for $2.2 billion. That would be its biggest acquisition since being spun off by eBay (EBAY).Potential new investors have balked at PayPal's high level of stock-based compensation, according to Morgan Stanley analyst James Faucette.Health care is another sector where the managers find a lot of growth stories. The fund's overweight in health care vs. its Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark was its second largest overweight as of March 31.""Valuations of drug and medical supplies companies have corrected, and we see opportunity where earnings growth is driven by innovation,"" the managers said in their commentary. ""Despite potential measures to control drug pricing, drug pipelines are robust, with ample clinical trial readouts.""A maker of cardiac pumping devices, Abiomed is another stock with IBD's best-possible Composite Rating of 99.

1539,SEE,"The Nasdaq outperformed other key indexes in afternoon trading in stocks today. But in general, investors appear to be brushing off concerns over stability in the East Asia region after President Trump canceled a highly anticipated June 12 meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore. A new Chinese IPO broke out.The Trump news didn't stop ZTO Express (ZTO), a play on Chinese e-commerce, from breaking out. However, keep in mind that the stock has a penchant for pulling back rapidly after hitting new highs.At 2 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved a 1% early-morning loss to nearly nil. Key Nasdaq component Apple (AAPL) erased minor morning losses and is trading near 188, up 5% past its latest 179.04 buy point in a seven-week double-bottom base.The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average also cut beefy early losses to around 0.2% to 0.3%. The small-cap S&P 600 rose fractionally.Meanwhile, the Dow transports rallied more than 1.1% as airline, railroad, logistics and truck firms gained ground amid a 1.6% drop in WTI crude oil futures. West Texas Intermediate crude is now at $70.70 a barrel, still up 17% year to date.Please read Wednesday's Big Picture column on how stocks today are mirroring the bullish activity seen in the prior session. As noted in the Market Pulse table within the Big Picture, the S&P 500 has logged seven distribution days within the past 25 sessions. Yet these instances of pronounced institutional selling have not been enough to swat the key large-cap benchmark far from its all-time highs.At 2727, the 500 is just 5% below an all-time peak of 2872 and is up 2% year to date.The Nasdaq composite, benefiting from the strength in FAANG stocks such as Apple and new breakout Netflix (NFLX), continues to lead the major indexes with a 7.5% year-to-date advance.ZTO rolled past an 18.18 buy point in a somewhat jagged cup base that began a negative reversal Nov. 10. No handle formed on the five-month cup base, so the proper buy point is 10 cents above the left-side lip of 18.08.The 5% buy zone goes up to 19.09. Read this recent Investor's Corner on the importance of not buying too far extended in price following a sound breakout.Notice on the weekly chart how ZTO broke out of a first-stage cup-type base at 16.14, rallied 12%, then pulled back sharply to begin a new base. In other words, the stock's action going all the way back to July of 2017 can be seen as a long base on base, one of eight key patterns that savvy growth investors use to time the market and find the right time to buy top growth stocks.The other seven chart patterns to learn and master: the cup with handle, double bottom, flat base, ascending base, high tight flag, saucer, and IPO base.The delivery giant, an October 2016 IPO, has grown earnings 7%, 0%, 35% and 70% vs. year-ago levels in the past four quarters. The Street sees Q2 profit rising 67% to 25 cents a share.On IBD Stock Checkup, ZTO gets an outstanding 98 Composite Rating on a scale of 1 to 99. The Relative Price Strength Rating of 83 means that ZTO has outperformed 83% of all public companies in IBD's database over the past 12 months.If the stock can maintain its fierce new uptrend, that RS Rating should rise. The up/down volume ratio is very strong at 2.7. See it in the ""Technical Performance"" section of Stock Checkup.The Shanghai-based company has a float of 426 million ADS (American depositary shares) and 721 million shares outstanding. The market cap of $13.3 billion makes it a midcap company.Netflix (NFLX), meanwhile, added gains after the streaming giant cleared a 338.92 proper entry in a narrow flat base. See today's Stock Spotlight column for a discussion on how Netflix formed two bases, and why the first one was flawed.Netflix joined IBD Leaderboard on April 5 as a half-position stock, then got upgraded to full-position status on April 17.

1540,SEE,"Ligand Pharmaceuticals bottomed out at 6.59 a share during the 2008-to-early 2009 bear market. Today, the medical stock is an emerging market leader. When is the right time to buy?If you are familiar with the double-bottom base, then you could have spotted a chance to buy Ligand as shares raced more than 14% higher during the week ended May 11. That week, Ligand Pharmaceuticals (LGND) rolled past a 172.17 buy point. Find the buy point by adding 10 cents to the middle peak within the eight-week pattern.The 5% buy zone goes up to 180.78. Please check out this new Investor's Corner story on the importance of buying no more than 5% past a proper entry.So for now, Ligand is too high in price to buy. But on Monday, some funds are clearly taking some profits. The stock deserves a rest. After bottoming out within the base at 149.22, shares have screamed 31% higher.IBD's analysis of the biggest stock market winners shows that as many as four out of every 10 big moneymakers will pull back to or slightly below the proper buy point after a breakout. After this pause in price, such stocks will then begin to climb sharply again.The other two medical sector plays in Stock Spotlight now: Neogen (NEOG), extended from a cup-style base and a 64.52 buy point; and Amedisys (AMED), which has run more than 15% past a 63.88 prime entry point in a nine-month cup with handle.The strength in Ligand's shares reflects rare fundamentals. The developer of multiple new drugs and treatments for a broad range of health conditions has shown marvelous profit growth in recent years. In 2012, the San Diego-based firm lost a penny a share; in 2017, it earned $3.26 a share, up 51% vs. the year before. Wall Street sees earnings jumping 57% to $5.11 a share this year and 8% to $5.53 in 2019.Sales rose 29% to $141 million in 2017. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see sales rising 35% to $190 million this year.Check out a premium long-term weekly chart, available in MarketSmith. Then, focus on the action starting in the spring of 2016. You'll see that Ligand built a somewhat gently sloping double bottom that had two lows: 114.53, followed by a lower low of 109.62. It's absolutely critical to see the second low undercut the first low. You want to see a true shakeout of holders before the stock rebounds.Ligand broke out past a 125 buy point in early July 2016 and rallied three weeks in a row. But the stock then made a nasty reversal. It slid more than 37% over the next three months. That decline reset the base count in Ligand, a positive.Ligand went on to form a long first-stage saucer with a handle. It broke out at 124.52 in late July to early August of 2017, rallied almost 20%, then formed a stage-two cuplike base that yielded a second breakout opportunity at 149.41. Ligand failed to gain 20% from that breakout point. Instead, it formed a new five-week flat base, producing a 170.40 buy point. A March 8 breakout didn't bear much fruit.So, the latest double bottom can be seen as the last chapter of a three-part base on base pattern, all of which is second stage.You can also change the date in any daily, weekly or monthly chart in MarketSmith to see how Ligand behaved after it bottomed out in 2008 and formed new bases after the market issued a follow-through in March 2009.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis on growth stocks, buy points, sell signals, and financial markets.)RELATED:The New America: Ligand Has $200 Million In Sales, But Doesn't Own A Single DrugThis Medical Play Is A Watch List Member On IBD LeaderboardThe Latest Inside Investor's CornerWhat Are The Essential Elements Of A Base On Base?

1544,SEE,"Celgene (CELG) plunged to another four-year low Monday on a report that an executive in charge of business development quietly retired in mid-April.But RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says the departure of George Golumbeski was planned years in advance of his April 16 retirement. Golumbeski had worked for Celgene business development for about nine years.Robert Hershberg took over as executive vice president, head of business development and global alliances, in April 2017. Golumbeski then moved to more of a strategic role. Hershberg was responsible for the deals with Juno Therapeutics and Impact Biomedicines.""Given that this has been a transition in the works for some time, we do not see any relation between reports about this emerging today and proximity to upcoming (clinical study) readouts,"" Abrahams said in a report.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseOn the stock market today, Celgene toppled 4.7% to close at 74.69. Shares touched a low last seen in May 2014. Broadly, shares of biotech companies dropped 1.6%. Abrahams noted investor sentiment on Celgene has been low this year.Two weeks before Golumbeski's departure on April 16, former chief operating officer Scott Smith unexpectedly departed Celgene. Smith had been instrumental in helping to launch Otezla, one of Celgene's biggest moneymakers.Celgene delivered a beat-and-raise earlier this month. Otezla sales grew and beat views. Still, investors are wary of the inflammation and immunology franchise. In February, U.S. officials delayed Celgene's application for multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod.Meanwhile, investors are also concerned about a looming patent cliff for key cancer drug Revlimid. Celgene is hoping the acquisition of Juno will help offset some of that. Juno is working on a number of cancer treatments.Abrahams found it ""somewhat ironic"" that shares would sell off on news of Golumbeski's departure. Investors have long been critical of the biotech company's business development strategy, which they see as not sufficiently preparing for post-Revlimid revenue sustainability.""However, we do believe it illustrates the sharply negative sentiment pervasive in the name, which we continue to believe will require a turnaround in catalysts to improve on,"" he said.RELATED:New Option Strategy Limits Risk Around EarningsHow Much Volume Should You Look For In A Stock?The Basics: How To Analyze A Stock's Cup With Handle

1549,SEE,"""For want of a nail…, the kingdom was lost.""  The old proverb, dating back to the 13th Century, and imported to America in Ben Franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac, provides a cautionary tale.During World War II, it was posted on the wall of the Anglo-American Supply Headquarters in London —a reminder that the most sophisticated defense supply chain is only as strong as its weakest link.It's a reminder we need to dust off for our 21st century, as technology transforms all aspects of our lives, including the advanced weaponry that increasingly supports the U.S.'s battlefield superiority.Especially now, as we see headlines like this one in the defense press:  ""The U.S. is running out of bombs — and it may soon struggle to make more.""  The story notes that in the case of many key materials, ""…key suppliers are foreign-owned, with no indigenous (U.S.) capability to produce vital parts and materials.""Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe metals and minerals on which U.S. weapons platforms depend are all too often sourced from foreign suppliers – a vulnerability that America's adversaries could exploit in time of conflict.Until now, however, awareness of the problem has not produced action anywhere near adequate to reverse or even reduce this dangerous dependency.That could change, as the House of Representatives has added comprehensive critical minerals reform language to the 2019 fiscal year National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the massive must-pass bill that funds the U.S. military for the year ahead.With a push to put the defense bill on the President's desk by Memorial Day, focus shifts to the Senate and the Congressional conference that will determine whether the critical minerals provisions will remain.While the path to passage may be new, the bill is anything but, as the language is drawn from a bill that has passed the House five times in recent years, only to stall in the Senate.  It sets clear and consistent deadlines for a federal mine permitting process that has grown maddeningly opaque, resulting in a permitting odyssey that stretches an average of 7 to 10 years and oftentimes longer.Indeed, the only thing longer than the American permitting process is the list of metals and minerals we need for our weapons systems.As the Senate defense debate grinds into gear, expect objections that including a mining-related provision to the NDAA is improper, non-germane to use the parliamentary term.That's wrong.  In fact, one might argue that ensuring that the U.S. does all it can to ensure the reliable domestic supply of defense-critical metals and minerals is about as germane to the NDAA as it gets.According to the most recent U.S. Geological Survey Mineral Commodity Summary, the U.S. is 100% dependent on foreign supply for 20 metals and minerals, and 50% or more dependent for a total of 43 metals and minerals.  That's nearly half of the naturally-occurring elements on the Periodic Table.Such deep dependency is the catalyst for the President's Executive Order on Critical Minerals, issued in December 2017, which just this month produced the first unified Critical Minerals List, prepared by the Department of interior in coordination with the Department of Defense:  35 metals and minerals, from Aluminum to Zirconium.Consider it Exhibit A in the argument for adding Critical Minerals provisions in the NDAA.  The case for inclusion is strong:Connect the dots, and it's clear the U.S. lacks reliable access to a wide range of metals and minerals critical to our military's advanced weapons platforms — materials that in nearly two-dozen cases, we are sourcing from China, a nation that the 2017 U.S. National Defense Strategy identifies as presenting a ""central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security.""That's a five alarm fire bell when it comes to strengthening the raw materials supply chain in the U.S. Defense Industrial Base, and it's all the reason Congress needs to include critical minerals language in the National Defense Authorization Act.Finally, the U.S. has known resources of nearly all of the 35 minerals and metals on the Critical List.  Whether those resources can be economically developed is an open question — one that the private sector, and private capital, will be ready and willing to answer, once the U.S. Government sends a clear, consistent signal that it is serious about remedying our deep domestic minerals deficit.It's time to make the connection between critical minerals and national defense.  As Ben Franklin understood, America's adversaries surely will.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

1552,SEE,"Today, it would be true to report many of the well-known large-cap biotech stocks are showing ""disappointing"" or ""downright awful"" performance in 2018. Just witness the damage lately in shares of Biogen (BIIB), Celgene (CELG) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN).XIt would also be true to report that some companies in IBD's biotech industry group have been fantastic winners.Select gene therapy firms have been rising fast since breakouts in the second half of 2017. And blood disease expert Bioverativ, a Biogen spinoff, had a nice rally going before it soared 62% on Jan. 22. Make sure you see the big price gap in the accompanying chart below. Bioverativ soared in mammoth volume on news that it's being acquired by French pharmaceuticals titan Sanofi (SNY) for $11.6 billion.Could an investor have used good stock charts to find a breakout by Bioverativ before it made that giant single-day gain? Yes. Bioverativ crafted a double-bottom base, helping to set up the big move.If you don't use stock charts, you're trading at a disadvantage. Without charts, it's very tough to determine two keys about the market: 1) the current psychology of buyers and sellers; and 2) the balance of supply vs. demand in any given stock.When did Bioverativ break out? Jan. 9, while the stock market itself was in a confirmed uptrend. A confirmed uptrend is the best time to buy top-performing growth stocks. You have greater odds of making money when you invest with the larger trend.The specialist in therapies for hemophilia and rare blood disorders established an excellent prior uptrend, running from 44.98 on the close of its Feb. 2, 2017, market debut to a peak of 64.41 more than five months later. The stock corrected 16% in four weeks and carved out a three-month saucer with handle (1), but never broke out.Then Bioverativ really began to sell off.On Oct. 27, the midcap swooned 12% and hit as low as 50.50 (2). This created the first low in the base. In a proper double bottom, a stock will rebound back near its highs, then sell off a second time. And during that decline, the stock must undercut the first low.Why? You want to see an authentic shakeout of uncommitted shareholders. Find signs that shares move from weak hands to strong hands.The correct buy point? When the stock rises a dime over the middle peak in between the two lows.Bioverativ did exactly that. The stock rebounded up to 58.19, less than 3 points off the base's left-side peak of 60.74, then nose-dived again. This time, the sell-off took Bioverativ all the way to 48.28. A fine undercut of the first low (3).A double bottom forms over a minimum seven weeks. Corrections of more than, say, 30% to 33% are not ideal. The deeper the correction, the more a stock has to work just to get back to its highs.Look for signs of symmetry within the base. It should look like a ""W"" except that the second low undercuts the first.Bioverativ possessed all of these bullish traits in its 11-week double bottom. On Jan. 9, 2018, the stock gapped up 7%, surpassing the 58.29 buy point (middle peak of 58.19 plus 10 cents).  Volume gushed 75% above normal levels. Seven sessions later, Bioverativ traded at 64.11, up 10% from the proper entry, right before the acquisition news sent shares vaulting 62%.Prior to its breakout, the Waltham, Mass., firm notched quarterly earnings-per-share gains of 64%, 73% and 31%. Revenue had soared 317% in 2015, then rose another 58% and 32% the next two years.Expect double bottoms to proliferate among leading stocks when the major indexes fall furiously in several waves. Great market leaders built double bottoms and broke out after the bear markets in the fall of 1998, the fall of 2002, and other occasions.Sometimes you'll see a handle form on the double bottom. It's the market's way of presenting an additional buy point.(Sanofi completed its acquisition of Bioverativ on March 8. A version of this column was published on March 1, 2018. Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more analysis and commentary on the financial markets, growth companies, charts and stock breakouts.)RELATED:This Is The Golden Rule Of InvestingWhat Is The Current Stock Market Direction?

1553,SEE,"On Jun 8, we issued an updated research report on Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report). The company is expected to benefit from focus on innovations, growth in the global protein market, restructuring actions and acquisitions. However, stranded costs following the Diversey sale and increasing raw material prices remain headwinds for Sealed Air. Upbeat Outlook for 2018 Expected benefits from reducing costs, driving operational excellence and commercializing new innovations combined with favorable global business trends poises the company well for improved 2018 results. Sealed Air projects net sales of approximately $4.75-$4.80 billion for 2018, a constant dollar growth rate of approximately 4.5%. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $2.45-$2.55, the mid-point of which reflects healthy year-over-year growth of 38%. The company is witnessing strong customer acceptance and increased adoption with the seafood and convenience segments. Further, ongoing momentum in high-growth geographies such as Brazil, Russia, China and Southeast Asia will continue in 2018 as demand increases for packaged proteins and convenience meals. Further, in North America and EMEA, the ongoing shift to fresh foods, combined with Sealed Air’s sustainable innovative packaging, is driving above market growth. Innovations to Boost Top Line Sealed Air’s top-line will be supported by enhanced demand for its core product portfolio, recently-introduced innovations and accelerated growth in the global protein market along with the e-commerce sector. Additionally, the company believes that market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of its divisions. The company should benefit from the commercialization of new products. Sealed Air is winning new customers globally given its innovative platforms including the Internet of Things, Intellibot robotics, clean-in-place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others. Furthermore, it is exploring opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow its own brand into new channels. Restructuring to Aid Margins Sealed Air strives to target incremental, profitable growth opportunities in adjacent markets and expand presence in high-growth geographies. Regarding mergers and acquisitions, the company is looking at options for technology, equipment and automation opportunities that enhance business and are accretive to earnings. The company is focusing on creating profitable growth, driving operational excellence, and developing a high-performance organization in order to deliver long-term value. The company is also focusing on reducing cost structure. Through the Sealed Air Restructuring Program, the company expects to generate incremental cost savings of $130-$150 million per annum by the end of 2019. Diversey Care Sale to Aid Focus on Core Business, Costs a Woe Sealed Air has divested its Diversey Care division as well as the food hygiene and cleaning business within the Food Care division for gross proceeds of $3.2 billion in September 2017. Notably, this is a step in Sealed Air’s transformation and will enable it to enhance strategic focus on the Food Care and Product Care divisions along with simplifying operating structure. The sale provided the company the financial flexibility to accelerate share repurchases, pay down approximately $1.1 billion in debt, taking its total debt balance down to $3.3 billion. However, stranded costs following the Diversey sale, increasing raw material prices remain headwinds. Moreover, Sealed Air continues to invest in R&D, sales and marketing. Even though these investments will drive future growth, it will affect margins in the near term. Other Headwinds The company’s e-commerce business carries lower margins. Consequently, volume gains have not translated to EBITDA growth. With a major portion of its product focus tied to the food and beverage end markets, weak economic conditions could negatively impact demand for Sealed Air’s product offering and demand for its customer's products as customers would be less willing to invest in innovative offerings. This would impact sales and margins.  In the past year, Sealed Air has underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock dipped 0.8% while the industry gained 4.3%. Sealed Air carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Stocks to Consider Some better-ranked stocks in in the same sector include Axon Enterprise, Inc. (AAXN  -  Free Report), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT  -  Free Report) and Terex Corp. (TEX  -  Free Report). All three stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Axon Enterprise has a long-term earnings growth rate of 25%. Its shares have appreciated 170% over the past year. Caterpillar has a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.3%. The company’s shares have been up 46% in the past year. Terex has a long-term earnings growth rate of 21%. The stock has gained 14% in a year’s time. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1555,SEE,"The third-quarter earnings season is almost in the final lap with 406 members of the S&P 500 Index having reported their quarterly numbers, which makes up 85.4% of the Index’s total market capitalization. Per the latest status as of Nov 3, these companies have put a 7.5% increase in earnings on the back of 6.3% higher sales on the scoreboard. Around 73.9% of these companies delivered positive earnings surprises while 66.7% surpassed revenue expectations. (Read more: The Tech Sector's Impressive Earnings Power on Display)Taking into account all the S&P 500 members that are yet to disclose their numbers, total earnings for the index is expected to be up 6.5% year over year on a 5.6% increase in revenues in the third quarter. This marks a deceleration from the 11.2% increase in earnings in the second quarter and 13.6% in the first. Nevertheless, despite lower growth projections, total earnings in dollar amount is likely to hit all-time quarterly record at $302.7 billion in the third quarter.Further, earnings growth graph will eventually pick up from fourth quarter onwards as evident from our projections. Earnings growth will be 8.4% in fourth-quarter 2017, 8.9% in first-quarter 2018, 8.9% in the second and 9.6% in third-quarter 2018. Consequently, these quarters are set to break the expected record levels in the third quarter in dollar terms.Industrial Products Sector to Log GrowthIndustrial production — a measure of the level of output of manufacturing, mining and utilities sectors in a country — dipped at an annual rate of 1.5% in the third quarter. Excluding the effects of the hurricanes, the index would have risen at least 0.5%. Prior to the storms, the manufacturing sector had been buoyed by a stronger global economy that translated to greater demand for manufactured products.Despite this setback, the industrial products sector, one of the 16 Zacks sectors, is anticipated to log growth of 18.5% in third-quarter earnings while revenues will rise 4.4%. Notably, it is one of the nine sectors that is anticipated to log positive growth this quarter. Also, the industrial products’ upbeat growth projections puts it just a pace behind Energy Sector’s projected 153.1% earnings growth and the Technology sector’s 20.1%.In this context, we take a sneak peek into three industrial products stocks that are slated to report their third-quarter results on Nov 8.Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report) is a provider of food safety and security, facility hygiene, and product protection solutions worldwide. The company will report financial results before the market opens. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 1.64%.Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sealed Air is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

Notably, Sealed Air’s earnings lagged estimates while revenues beat in the second quarter.The company has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 1.64% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Sealed Air is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, that is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Sealed Air’s Earnings ESP is +3.30% as the Most Accurate estimate of 47 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sealed Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) which when combined with earnings ESP of +3.30% makes surprise prediction difficult.

Further, costs associated with the Diversey Care operations and various restructuring actions underway will strain margins.Also, recent resin price increases due to the impact of Hurricane Harvey will dent the quarter’s margins. Though Sealed Air has implemented a price increase recently in Food Care, the benefits of it will take time to translate into improved earnings. Meanwhile, margins will remain affected.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is currently pegged at 46 cents, reflecting a 35.92% year-over-year decline.Share Price Performance Sealed Air underperformed the industry in the past year.

1557,SEE,"Favorable supply/demand trends and an improving industry structure are expected to provide the much-needed impetus for the packaging industry’s growth. Rising demand in packaging for food & beverages, personal and household care products, medicines and other products also bode well for the industry.The packaging companies are now, particularly, focused on geographic expansion through mergers and acquisitions. Aggressive restructuring and consolidation as well as focus on realigning product offerings to reduce operational costs spell good. Moreover, the preference for value-added services and customized packaging solutions to provide convenience, safety, durability, as well as freshness protection will continue to drive the industry.Currently, the Zacks categorized Containers – Paper and Packaging sub industry is enjoying a Zacks Industry Rank of 113. The favorable rank places the industry in the top 44% of the 250+ groups enlisted. The industry has also outperformed the S&P 500 over the past three months. Given that trade war fears are rattling markets again on reports that the United States is contemplating tariffs on imported steel and aluminum from the EU, and possibly Canada and Mexico. The tariff announcement stoked concerns of a global trade war again. Thus, to combat market volatility, investing in packaging stocks seems to be a smart choice, wherein investors can gain impressive returns by banking on the robust industry fundamentals.For investors’ convenience, we are comparing two major packaging companies which are expected to gain from their solid fundamentals — Sonoco Products Company (SON  -  Free Report) and Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report). While both the packaging stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it will be interesting to see which one is better positioned in terms of fundamentals. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Other stocks in the same industry worth considering include Crown Holdings, Inc. (CCK  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1, and Silgan Holdings Inc. (SLGN  -  Free Report), carrying a Zacks Rank #2.Price PerformanceSonoco’s shares have appreciated 51% over the past year; while Sealed Air has rallied 44%. Sonoco is a clear winner in this respect, with better returns than Sealed Air and the sub industry, which gained 48% during the same period.ValuationThe EV/EBITDA metric is usually used to compare two stocks within the same industry or sector, and has an edge over other metrics such as P/E because it is not affected by the different capital structures of the two companies. Compared with the sub-industry’s EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.96, both Sonoco and Sealed Air are underpriced, with respective reading of 8.53 and 8.84. Clearly, Sonoco is cheaper in terms of valuation.Inventory Turnover RatioOver the past year, the inventory turnover ratio for Sonoco and Sealed Air has been 9.08% and 5.78%, respectively, compared to the industry’s level of 6.42%. A higher turnover than the industry average means that inventory is sold at a faster rate, suggesting efficient inventory management. Further, a high inventory turnover rate implies that lesser company resources are tied up in inventory, and the company is able to manage inventory effectively to generate revenues and avoid wastage. Clearly, Sonoco has scored better on this front.Return on AssetsReturn on assets (ROA) is one of the key financial ratios for packaging companies as the firms rely heavily on inventory to generate revenues. An above-average ROA denotes that the company in question is generating earnings by effectively managing assets.Sonoco and Sealed Air’s ROA for the trailing 12-months (TTM) is 6.56% and 5.75%, respectively. Both companies scored above the industry’s level of 5.62%, with Sonoco faring better than Sealed Air.Dividend YieldIn the last one-year period, Sonoco’s dividend yield of 3.16% has been higher than the industry’s 2.05%, while Sealed Air has dividend yield of 1.43. Also, in April 2018, Sonoco’s board of directors rewarded a 5.1% increase in quarterly dividend to 41 cents per share which, also, is a positive signal.Debt to CapitalSealed Air has a highly levered balance sheet as evident from its debt-to-capital ratio of 95.5%, much higher than the industry average of 48.3%, and Sonoco’s 41.8%.Q1 Earnings PerformanceIn the first quarter of 2018, Sonoco reported adjusted earnings of 74 cents per share, up 25% year over year. The reported figure beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 72 cents and came close to the higher end of management’s guided range of 69-75 cents. Its net sales grew 11%, year on year, driven by higher selling prices to counter elevated freight, wages and operating inflation, as well as solid sales from acquisitions, modest volume growth and the positive impact of foreign exchange. (Read more: Sonoco Tops Q1 Earnings & Sales Estimates, Lifts View)Sealed Air’s first-quarter adjusted earnings improved 19% year over year to 51 cents per share. In addition, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Total revenues also increased 10% year over year in the quarter. Currency had a positive impact on total net sales of 4%, with increased sales across all regions in the quarter. (Read more: Sealed Air Beats on Q1 Earnings, Hikes '18 Outlook)Earnings Surprise HistoryTaking a look at the companies’ surprise history, Sonoco has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the four trailing quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.39%. Meanwhile, Sealed Air has delivered positive earnings surprises in the two of the preceding four quarters, generating an average positive earnings surprise of 0.24%.Earnings Estimate Revisions, GrowthEarnings estimates for Sealed Air have gone up nearly 3% for 2018 and 5% for 2019, in the past 30 days. Meanwhile, estimates remained unchanged for Sonoco for the same time frame.Sonoco’s 2018 earnings estimates reflects year-over-year growth of 17.9%, while the 2019 earnings estimate reflects year-over-year rise of 5.8%. Sealed Air’s earnings estimates for 2018 and 2019 depict a projected growth of 37.6% and 13.7%, respectively. Sealed Air has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.60%, way higher than Sonoco’s 4.67%. Sealed Air is a clear winner here.ConclusionFrom our comparative analysis, it is clear that Sonoco is outwitting Sealed Air, when considering price performance, profitability, valuation ratios, inventory turnover, leverage and average positive earnings surprise. However, in terms of earnings growth projections, Sealed Air holds an edge over Sonoco. Thus, it is apparent that Sonoco is better positioned than Sealed Air and thus, calls for investors’ attention.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

1560,SEE,"The Q1 earnings season performance so far has been promising and seems on track to deliver the best performance in seven years. Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are expected to be up 22.6% for this earnings season aided by a rise of 8.4% in revenues. If this materializes, it would surpass fourth-quarter 2017 results where the S&P 500 recorded 13.4% earnings growth on 8.6% revenue growth. To date, 267 S&P 500 members have released results, logging year-over-year earnings growth of 25.1% on 10.3% higher revenues. (Read more: Q1 Earnings Season Good, But Not Great) Industrial Sector Poised for Double Digit Growth The Industrial Products sector, currently placed at the top 6% out of the 16 Zacks sectors, is one of the sectors which are expected to record double-digit earnings growth, mainly driven by the U.S. tax reform. According to our latest projections, the sector is anticipated to log an earnings growth of 35.4% in first-quarter 2018 driven by 15.4% rise in revenues. Industrial production is one of the leading economic indicators for industrial stocks. For first-quarter 2018, industrial production — a measure of output at factories, mines and utilities — rose at an annual rate of 4.5%. Further, the U.S Architecture Billings Index (“ABI”), an economic indicator that provides an approximately nine-to-12 month glimpse into the future of non-residential construction spending activity, was 51 in March — increasing for the sixth straight month. Notably, any score more than 50 indicates billings growth and reflects a healthy business environment. Per the latest report of the Institute for Supply Management (“ISM”), Purchasing Managers Index (""PMI”) was pegged at 59.3% in March. This indicates strong growth in manufacturing for the 19th consecutive month, led by continued expansion in new orders, production activity, employment and inventories. A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding. New orders index is at 61.9, remaining at or above 60 for the 11th straight month.  Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 17 industries reported growth in March. The only exception being Apparel, Leather & Allied Products. We have two industrial stock reporting earnings on May 3, before the opening bell — Ball Corporation (BLL  -  Free Report) and Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report). Let’s have a close look at the factors that will impact their first-quarter 2018  results.  Ball Corp. supplies metal packaging products to the beverage, food, personal care, and household industries worldwide. It also supplies aerospace and other technologies and services to government and commercial customers. The company’s earnings outpaced estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 2.51%. Ball Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Ball Corporation price-eps-surprise | Ball Corporation QuotePrevalent headwinds in domestic beer consumption are expected to dampen first-quarter results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales of its Beverage packaging North and Central America segment is pegged at $955 million for the quarter, representing year-over-year increase of 0.6%.Difficult manufacturing performance is expected to impact the food and aerosol business. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates that the company’s Food and Aerosol Packaging segment's revenues are likely to reach $287 million in the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 5.5%.Ball Corp.’s Aerospace business is anticipated benefit from the company’s focus on world-class technology and proficiency. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s net sales is pegged at $252 million for the quarter, reflecting 6.8% year-over-year improvement.In Brazil, the company’s volume growth is predicted to be slower than the market rate due to competition. We expect net sales for Ball Corp.'s Beverage packaging, South America segment to be around $382 million, reflecting an increase of around 3% year over year.Furthermore, the company's performance might have been marred by volatile volumes in the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) beverage-can business. Our consensus estimates indicate that its sales in the Beverage packaging, Europe segment  will reach $551 million in the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8.5%.Though the company continues to make progress on global finance transformation projects and corporate cost-cutting initiatives, Ball Corporation is likely to face tight supply and demand situation.Our proven model does not conclusively show that Ball Corporation is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

However, the first quarter is likely to be a low point for EBITDA, primarily due to the timing of its contract pass-through and higher input costs. Further, stranded costs following the Diversey sale remains a headwind. Sealed Air continues to invest in R&D, sales and marketing. Even though these investments will drive future growth, it will affect margins in the near term.

1561,SEE,"Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report) has announced price increase for majority of its Food Care division’s North American products in the range of 5-8% to combat elevated costs for major petrochemical raw materials. The price hike will be effective from Oct 2.According to Sealed Air, persistent spike in costs of key raw materials, including a 31% rise in the price of polyethylene since 2016, led to the price hike. Notably, the company has raised prices by 5% on all shrink bags, rollstock products, food films, and vertical pouch packaging. The company has also increased the prices for unpadded solid plastic trays by 6% and pre-padded solid plastic trays by 8%.The most important raw materials utilized by Sealed Air are polyolefin and other petrochemical (PE)-based resins and films. These raw materials represented around one-third of consolidated cost of sales in 2016.Sealed Air Corporation Price  Sealed Air Corporation Price | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteThe prices for these raw materials are cyclical and depend on fluctuations in prices of petrochemical-based raw materials and energy. Further, the recent tropical storms, Harvey and Irma, have adversely affected the production and delivery capabilities of refineries and natural gas and petrochemical suppliers. These factors lead to increased costs of raw materials and in turn, may hurt revenues and profit margins of Sealed Air.The above discussed action is in sync with Sealed Air’s effort to minimize the cost adjustments. The move will also assist the company to continue delivering equally valuable and innovative products to customers.Sealed Air’s topline is likely to grow on the back of enhanced demand for its core product portfolio, recently-introduced innovations, and accelerated growth in the global protein market, along with the e-commerce sector. In addition, the company believes market differentiation of revolutionary innovation has been gaining significant traction in each of its divisions.

1564,SEE,"On Aug 21, 2017, we issued an updated research report on Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report). The specialty packaging service provider will benefit from focus on product innovation, acquisitions and growth in eCommerce. However, higher raw material costs and lower volumes in Latin America due to ban on Brazil beef exports remain primary headwinds.Sealed Air reported second-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents, down 5.4% year over year. Earnings also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. Total revenues increased 3% year over year on a reported basis to $1.07 billion in the quarter. Revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.064 billion.For 2017, Sealed Air guides net sales of $4.3 billion, as compared with $4.2 billion for 2016 based on an expected 3% constant dollar sales growth in Food Care and 3-4% constant dollar sales growth in Product Care. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the full year 2017 is now anticipated to be in the range of $825-$835 million, as compared with $808 million for the full year 2016. Volume growth, partially negated by higher raw material costs, a higher mix of e-Commerce and fulfillment sales will drive growth in EBITDA. Adjusted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $1.75-$1.80 for the full year 2017.Sealed Air’s top-line will be supported by enhanced demand for its core product portfolio, recently-introduced innovations, and accelerated growth in the global protein market along with the eCommerce sector. Sales for its new products, including B+, FloWrap, StealthWrap, inflatable bubbles and automated mailers, are anticipated to ramp up in 2017 and contribute to both the top and bottom-line growth. The company is winning new customers worldwide given its innovative platforms including the Internet of Things, Intellibot robotics, clean-in-place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others.Through the Sealed Air Restructuring Program, the company expects to generate incremental cost savings of $100-$110 million per annum by the end of 2019, compared with the savings run rate achieved by the end of 2015. Of this, approximately $25 million is anticipated to be achieved in 2017.The company is divesting its Diversey Care division as well as the food hygiene and cleaning business within the Food Care division for gross proceeds of $3.2 billion. The transaction is on track to close in September 2017 and would create two independent companies. This is a step in the company's transformation and will enable it to enhance strategic focus on the Food Care and Product Care divisions along with simplifying operating structure. The transaction is expected to generate approximately $2.5 billion in net cash, on after-tax basis. The cash proceeds from this transaction will be utilized to repay debt and maintain credit profile, repurchase shares, and also fund core growth initiatives. This includes potential complementary acquisitions to Food Care and Product Care divisions.On the flipside, the pending sale of Diversey will be substantially dilutive to earnings. Further, costs associated with the Diversey Care operations and various restructuring actions underway will strain margins.Further, Sealed Air’s results in APAC will be impacted as the Australia/New Zealand region rebuilds cattle herds, which is normally a two to four-year process and dairy markets remain muted. The selective ban on the Brazilian beef export will stall the recovery in this local market and negatively impact volumes in Latin America in the third quarter of 2017. Higher raw material prices will also impact margins.In the past one year, Sealed Air has underperformed the industry it belongs to. The stock dipped 5.9% while the industry gained 8.3%.Sealed Air carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the same sector include Terex Corporation (TEX  -  Free Report), AGCO Corporation (AGCO  -  Free Report) and Owens-Illinois Inc. (OI  -  Free Report).

1566,SEE,"Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 3, before the opening bell. Notably, the company’s earnings performance has not been impressive for the past few quarters. In the last reported quarter, Sealed Air’s earnings and revenues both improved on a year-over-year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates on both counts. However, in the trailing four quarters, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion, missing two and meeting one, recording an average negative earnings surprise of 1.89%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement. Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Sealed Air Corporation price-eps-surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteKey Factors to Consider The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues for the first-quarter 2018 is pegged at $1.14 million, representing a year-over-year improvement of 10%. We believe Sealed Air’s top-line will also be supported by enhanced demand for its core product portfolio and accelerated growth in the global protein market along with the e-Commerce sector. Currency is anticipated to have a favorable impact. Ongoing focus on innovations and impact of prior acquisitions will also boost the top line. The company continues to drive profitable growth by improving productivity with its Sealed Air Operational Excellence culture. However, the first quarter will be a low point for EBITDA, primarily due to the timing of its contract pass-through and higher input costs. Further, stranded costs following the Diversey sale remains a headwind. Sealed Air continues to invest in R&D, sales and marketing. Even though these investments will drive future growth, it will affect margins in the near term. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for earnings per share is pegged at 50 cents for first-quarter 2018, up 16% year over year.  Over the past six months, shares of Sealed Air have gained 1.0%, outperforming 0.7% growth recorded by the industry due to the prevailing headwinds. Earnings Whispers Our proven model does not conclusively show that Sealed Air is likely to beat on earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below: Zacks ESP: Sealed Air currently has an Earnings ESP of -0.60%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. Zacks Rank:  Sealed Air’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Stocks to Consider Here are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter: MSA Safety Incorporated (MSA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.46% and a Zacks Rank #1. The company’s shares have advanced 9% in the past six months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Rexnord Corporation (RXN  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.82% and a Zacks Rank #2. Its shares have gained 11%, over the past six months.  Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. (RS  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +13.39% and a Zacks Rank #1. The stock has climbed 16% in six months’ time. The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of All Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

1570,SEE,"Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report) announced a 2.5-5% price hike on majority of its Food Care division’s products in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), effective Jan 1, 2018, in order to remain profitable regardless of higher raw material and other input costs.Notably, the company raised prices in EMEA as polyethylene (PE) market prices remain highly uncertain in the region due to a slump in upstream market activity. However, Sealed Air refrained from price hikes in Switzerland and the U.K. at this moment, as it had raised prices in the regions earlier this year.According to Sealed Air, persistent spike in costs of key raw materials, including a 19% in PE, 16% in nylon and 35% in polystyrene, led to the hike. The prices for these raw materials are cyclical, and depend on fluctuations in prices of petrochemical-based raw materials and energy.Sealed Air Corporation Price  Sealed Air Corporation Price | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteThe recent price hike also stemmed from rise in non-material costs, including power, labor and transportation, in the range of 1-4%. The hike will be applied to all shrink bags, rollstock products, food films and vertical pouch packaging.The escalating raw material costs have partly shadowed Sealed Air’s price performance compared to the industry it belongs to. The company has underperformed its industry in a year’s time, recording a mere gain of 3%, which is in huge contrast with 14.5% growth recorded by the industry. Nevertheless, Sealed Air is anticipated to grow on the back of enhanced demand for its core product portfolio, recently-introduced innovations, and accelerated growth in the global protein market, as well as the e-commerce sector.Zacks Rank & Key PicksSealed Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same space are Caterpillar Inc.

1573,SEE,"Sealed Air Corporation (SEE  -  Free Report) will release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8, before the opening bell.In the first quarter, Sealed Air's top line and bottom line declined on a year-over-year basis. Sealed Air also lagged earnings estimates by 6.52% in the last reported quarter.The company has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 0.55% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Sealed Air Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseSealed Air Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Sealed Air Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model shows that Sealed Air is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Sealed Air is +1.82%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate of 37 cents is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 36 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Sealed Air currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The combination of a favorable rank and positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors At PlaySealed Air’s top-line will be supported by enhanced demand for its core product portfolio, recently-introduced innovations, and accelerated growth in the global protein market along with the eCommerce sector. Growth in red meat production this year could lead to a sizable pickup in North American Food Care operations. Overall, within Food Care, improvement will come on the back of growth in North America and improving trends in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA). Within Product Care, continued expansion in the eCommerce and fulfillment markets, and stabilization in the industrial sector will help drive momentum.However, the selective ban on the Brazilian beef export will be an impediment to volumes in Latin America. Results in APAC will be impacted as the Australia/New Zealand region rebuilds cattle herds, which is normally a two to four year process resulting in dairy markets remaining muted. Higher material costs, unfavorable impact of foreign currency will also dent results.Share Price PerformanceSealed Air underperformed the industry in the past one year.

Average earnings surprise was a positive 5.53%. Notably, in the last quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.11 per share topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.73%.Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Avery Dennison Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Avery Dennison Corporation QuoteWe believe that its constant focus on execution of strategies, sound financial performance and growth opportunities have lifted investor sentiments for Avery Dennison. In the last six months, the company’s shares have yielded 29% return, outperforming growth of 22.3% recorded by industry it belongs to.Let us see whether Avery Dennison will be able to maintain its earnings streak this quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Avery Dennison is likely to beat estimates in the second quarter. This is because the company has the combination of two key ingredients for a possible earnings beat – a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks ESP: Avery Dennison has an ESP of +1.68%, with the Most Accurate estimate of $1.21 exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.19.Zacks Rank: Avery Dennison’ Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. Moreover, its positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sellrated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.What’s Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Avery Dennison’s execution of strategies continues to enhance its competitive advantage, while driving profitable growth and improving returns. The company’s effort to reduce complexity, focus on cost structure, and use of lower-cost locally sourced materials that will support more competitive pricing, will boost its margin performance in the quarter to be reported.Though Avery Dennison anticipates some sequential raw material inflation in second-quarter 2017, consistent focus on productivity will drive results.Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some stocks you may want to consider, as according to our model they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Belden Inc.
