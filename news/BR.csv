5,BR,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10% and a Growth Score of A.Last year, the company has outperformed its industry. The stock has returned 14% against the industry’s decline of 2%.We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s strong business model and benefits from strategic acquisitions.Let’s discuss them in detail.A Strong Business ModelBroadridge’s prudent business model allows the company to fetch a good percentage of its business from recurring fee revenues, which include contributions from Net New Business and acquisitions related synergies. Notably, revenues for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 came in at $4.143 billion, $2.897 billion and $2.694 billion, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 43%, 7.5% and 5.3%, respectively.Revenue growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. Also, the metric is essential for justifying the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Broadridge’s diversified products and services coupled with strategic acquisitions have boosted the company’s top-line growth. Higher revenues are expected to expand margins and increase profitability in the long run.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. QuoteStrategic Acquisitions Expand Product Portfolio and Customer ReachOn Mar 27, 2018, Broadridge completed the acquisition of ActivePath. The buyout is expected to help the company enhance consumer experience by transforming and improving its digital platform. In 2017, it acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, LLC., a full service financial document management solutions provider, and Message Automation Limited, a leading specialist provider of post-trade control solutions. The company’s 2016 acquisitions include that of DST Systems’s North American Customer Communications (NACC) business, 4sight Financial Software Limited and Inveshare.In 2015, Broadridge acquired four companies namely — QED Financial Systems, Direxxis, Fiduciary Services and Competitive Intelligence — and the trade processing business of the Wilmington Trust Retirement and Institutional Services unit of M&T Bank Corporation. In 2014, it had acquired TwoFour Systems LLC and Emerald Connect, LLC. We believe, all these buyouts have helped Broadridge to evolve as one of the leading financial and outsourcing services providers.We remain encouraged by the company’s acquisition spree, which is helping Broadridge to expand its product portfolio and customer reach.Bottom LineThe aforementioned factors have positively impacted Broadridge’s financial performance. Evidently, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 21.2%. We believe the upbeat performance will continue in the quarters ahead, thus giving investors reasons to remain optimistic on the stock.Zacks Rank and Key PicksBroadridgehas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include CRA International (CRAI  -  Free Report), FTI Consulting (FCN  -  Free Report) and NV5 Global (NVEE  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.In the trailing four quarters, CRA International, FTI Consulting and NV5 Globalhave delivered a positive earnings surprise of 28%, 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

6,BR,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether or not this provider of payroll and integrated human resource and employee benefits outsourcing solutions will be able to deliver a positive surprise.Notably, the company has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive earnings surprise of 1.77%.What the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model shows that Paychex is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because the stock fulfils the Zacks criteria of a positive Earnings ESP, and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Paychex has an Earnings ESP of +0.20% and a Zacks Rank of #3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter’s earnings is pegged at 61 cents, representing year-over-year growth of 10.9%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $854.8 million, up 7.4% from the year-ago quarter.Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Paychex, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Paychex, Inc. QuoteLet’s now discuss the influencing factors in detail.Factors to ConsiderStrong domain expertise in human capital-management solutions for payroll, HR, retirement, and insurance services are expected to increase the company’s clientele and drive revenues.The company’s product launches and joint-venture initiatives are additional positives. Its investments toward building the sales team, which eventually assists in client addition and revenue generation, is a major tailwind.Notably, during the soon-to-be-reported quarter, the company’s solutions were adopted by the International Franchise Association (IFA) for providing payroll services for IFA membership.We also believe Paychex’s inorganic growth strategies are also proving conducive to its growth. With 14 acquisitions since its inception, the company has significantly improved its solutions suite and total addressable market (TAM). These have also acted as revenue boosters.However, a declining client retention rate is affecting the company’s financials. Additionally, heightening competition from industry peers like Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), Insperity, Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report), H&R Block, Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report) and DST System is another key concern.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

8,BR,"Whether a stock has the potential to offer considerable returns is determined primarily by its earnings and valuation ratios. Simultaneously, it is important to check whether its price performance exceeds its peers or the industry average.On such comparison, if we find that a stock is unable to match up to wider sectoral growth despite having impressive earnings momentum or valuation multiples, it may be better to avoid it.However, those outperforming their respective industries or benchmarks should be included in your portfolio, since they have a higher chance of securing significant returns. Picking a stock that outperforms its peers ensures that you have a winning option on your hands.Then again, it is imperative that you determine whether or not an investment has relevant upside potential when considering stocks with significant relative price strength. Stocks delivering better than the S&P 500 over a period of 1 to 3 months at the least and having solid fundamentals indicate room for growth, and are the best ways to go about this strategy.Finally, it is important to find out whether analysts are optimistic about the upcoming earnings results of these companies.

Reimbursable debit network fees, postage and other revenues (32.3%) increased 7.2% to $1.01 billion.Top-line growth was driven by innovative product and services portfolio and expanding enterprise business.2017 at a GlanceIn 2017, First Data reported adjusted earnings of $1.52 per share, which increased 15% compared with the year-ago figure.Consolidated revenues for the year came in $12.05 billion, up 4% year over year. Also segment revenues increased 4% year over year to $7.42 billion.Strong contribution from acquisitions played a significant role in driving the top line. First Data Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  First Data Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | First Data Corporation Quote Expanding ClienteleFirst Data signed a number of enterprise deals in the quarter. The company expanded its financial solution business in India by entering into agreements with SBI Cards and RBL Bank.

The company also clinched two statement printing deals with PNC and Verizon.The company also entered into partnership with AccorHotels Group which will benefit its global and cross channel payments.Segments in DetailFirst Data has three reportable segments: Global Business Solutions (GBS), Global Financial Solutions (GFS) and Network & Security Solutions (NSS).Global Business Solutions: This segment generated $1.13 billion, accounting for 58% of total segmental revenues. The figure grew 10.2% year over year driven by strong geographical market results across North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific (APAC) regions.Strong growth in the United Kingdom, Germany and India drove the EMEA and APAC revenues, respectively. Further, acquisitions of CardConnect and BluePay generated robust revenues in North America by improving service offerings.Global Financial Solutions: Revenues from this segment came in $412 million, accounting for 21% of the segmental revenues, down 1% on a year-over-year basis. The decline was primarily due to lower revenues from GFS North America since the company did not receive previously disclosed termination fee in this quarter compared with $7 million received in the year-ago quarter.Exclusion of termination fee impact would have resulted in a flat year-over-year revenues due to softness in plastic and retail private label businesses. Otherwise, First Data experienced year-over-year growth in EMEA, APAC and Latin America, which was driven by internal growth in Argentina and the United Kingdom.Network & Security Solutions: This segment generated $406 million, accounting for 21% of segmental revenues.

13,BR,"The global outsourcing services industry has been unstable over the past few years. A report from statista shows that market size of $88.9 billion in 2017 was same as in 2015 and improved from $76.9 billion in 2016. However, it marks a steep decline from $104.6 billion in 2014.While increasing demands for technology expertise, efficiency and cost reduction has kept revenues in good shape, heightened trade war tensions are a concern. Increasing U.S. protectionism is hurting growth prospects of this industry.Moreover, the U.S. government’s plan to reduce the issuance of H1-B visas to foreign nationals, particularly from countries like India, is a key concern for this industry.Industry Outpaces Sector and S&P 500 IndexLooking at the industry's stock market performance, it is obvious market participants appear optimistic about the group's outlook. The Zacks Outsourcing Industry, which is a group within the broader Zacks Business Services Sector, has outperformed its sector as well as the benchmark index in the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 26.9% in the past year, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Business Services Sector have rallied 13.3% and 21.3%, respectively.One-Year Price Performance Outsourcing Stocks Look ExpensiveThe outperformance of the industry over the past year has led to its relatively rich valuation.Price to Forward 12 MonthsComparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price-to-forward 12 months (P/E-F12M) earnings, we see that the industry’s 22.41X is ahead of the S&P 500’s 17.11X. However, a comparison of the industry with that of its broader sector indicates that the group is trading at a decent discount. The Zacks Business Sector’s forward 12-month P/E- is 22.77, which is above the industry’s 22.41.Price to Forward Earnings GrowthComparing the industry to the S&P 500 on the basis of price to forward earnings growth, we see that the industry’s 2.33X is again ahead of the S&P 500’s 1.84X.Comparison with the Zacks Business Services sectors confirms that the stock is trading at an expensive rate. It is also ahead of the sector’s 2.02X.Outperformance May Continue on Solid Earnings OutlookThe outsourcing services industry has been in a decent shape driven by demand for expertise, efficiency and cost reduction. Most of the companies maintain a geographically diverse revenue base and rely on business moves such as transformation initiatives and technological improvement to expand market share and boost revenues.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The valuation discussion shows that market participants are willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from current levels.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and the industry's aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018.Price and Consensus: Zacks Outsourcing Industry This becomes clearer by focusing on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revision trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $2.74 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up estimate for every company within the Zacks Outsourcing Industry but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the industry’s earnings per share for 2018 but how this estimate has evolved recently.Current Fiscal Year EPS Estimate RevisionsAs you can see here, the $2.74 EPS estimate for 2018 is up from $2.53 at the end of September 2017. In other words, the sell-side analysts covering the companies in the Zacks Outsourcing have been steadily raising their estimates.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy Near-Term ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued underperformance in the near term.The Zacks Outsourcing industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #155, which places it at the bottom 39% of more than 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Outsourcing Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthWhile the near-term prospects do not look welcoming for investors, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Outsourcing industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate is at the current level of 10.5%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite.Mean Estimate of Long-Term EPS Growth Rate In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be the recovery in the top line that the Zacks Outsourcing industry has been showing since the beginning of 2013.Revenues: Zacks Outsourcing Industry Bottom LineTrade war tensions are intensifying with time and increasing U.S. protectionism should act as major hindrance to outsourcing firms in the United States. Additionally, companies in the industry continue to suffer from client concentration and stiff competition.Since the near-term prospect of the industry does not appear encouraging, it would be prudent to stay away from some weak stocks that are likely to underperform.Below are three stocks which carry a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell) and have witnessed downward or no earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.StarTek, Inc.

We'll need to take a closer look to find out.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.TTEC Holdings and Broadridge Financial Solutions are both sporting a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use.TTEC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.89, while BR has a forward P/E of 25.82. We also note that TTEC has a PEG ratio of 2.24. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. BR currently has a PEG ratio of 2.58.Another notable valuation metric for TTEC is its P/B ratio of 4.68. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BR has a P/B of 11.67.These metrics, and several others, help TTEC earn a Value grade of A, while BR has been given a Value grade of D.Both TTEC and BR are impressive stocks with solid earnings outlooks, but based on these valuation figures, we feel that TTEC is the superior value option right now.

16,BR,"With markets in correction mode, it’s very difficult to select stocks that will offer steady returns going forward. Investors may apply complex investment strategies with an aim to book higher returns but may not be rewarded with the desired returns.Thus, at present, investors should use conventional strategies, based on key fundamentals, to select stocks. One such strategy is focus on sales growth.Why Sales Growth?Investors often fail to keep an eye on sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s share price is usually sensitive to its earnings momentum. Nonetheless, earnings are not the be-all and end-all in the sense that books can be easily manipulated. That’s why sales should always be taken into consideration.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It offers investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing exclusively on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks, but it does not ensure profits. So, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 20 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in Seattle, WA, Starbucks (SBUX  -  Free Report) operates as a roaster, marketer, and retailer of specialty coffee.

17,BR,"Outsourcing is the business of transferring the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis. The buoyancy in the outsourcing space is further confirmed by its Zacks Industry Rank in the top 37% (95 out of the 250 plus groups).Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stocks — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Paychex, Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.57 billion, Paychex’s market cap is $24.56 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with a VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over Paychex in terms of investment attractiveness. Paychex has a VGM Score of D. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over Paychex in terms of price performance. Shares of Broadridge have gained 53% in a year’s time, outperforming the industry’s rally of 24.8%. Paychex, despite rallying 20.9% in the same time frame, underperformed both Broadridge and the industry it belongs to. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.Paychex’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 11.3% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  For 2019, Paychex’s earnings are expected to register 10.9% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge.Thus, Paychex has an edge over Broadridge in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge has performed better than Paychex, having surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters, delivering an average beat of 23.6%. Paychex delivered a positive surprise in two of the prior four quarters with an average beat of 1.2%.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 27.6%, Paychex not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and Paychex is 28.5 and 27.9, respectively, while that of the industry is 27.5. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Paychex has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge scores over Paychex in terms of price performance and earnings surprise history. Paychex, however, has an edge in terms of expected earnings growth and net margin. Although both companies carry a Zacks Rank #2, Broadridge, with a better style score, has a higher probability of success in the near term. However, a faster share price rally in the past year has led to a relatively rich valuation for Broadridge compared to Paychex.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report). While Automatic Data Processing and Dun & Bradstreet sport a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR carries a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share (three to five years) growth rate for Automatic Data Processing, Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and FLEETCOR Technologies is 11.3%, 6% and 16.5%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

18,BR,"Investors focused on the Business Services space have likely heard of Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report), but is the stock performing well in comparison to the rest of its sector peers?

BR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BR's full-year earnings has moved 4.21% higher within the past quarter. This is a sign of improving analyst sentiment and a positive earnings outlook trend.Based on the latest available data, BR has gained about 27.07% so far this year.

19,BR,"FactSet Research Systems Inc. (FDS  -  Free Report) looks strong on the back of higher growth in organic revenue, annual subscription value and increasing product portfolio. Growth across regions outside the United States is acting as another major tailwind for the company’s growth prospects.Notably, in third-quarter fiscal 2018, FactSet reported strong results with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings per share of $2.18 beat the consensus mark by 4 cents and increased 17.8% year over year. Revenues of $339.9 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a slight margin and increased 8.9% year over year.Despite such impressive results, we observe that shares of FactSet have rallied 18.8% in the past year, underperforming the industry’s rise of 25.5%. Higher Annual Subscription ValueFactSet is witnessing growth in its Annual Subscription Value (ASV), driven by new client additions. The company added 80 new clients in third-quarter fiscal 2018, taking the total to 4,975. The company’s ASV increased 6.3% and reached $1.36 billion as of May 31, 2018. Organically, it increased $9 million during the quarter.Further, FactSet’s ASV reported robust growth on the basis of region. ASV generated $843.6 million revenues from the United States, up 4.4% from the prior-year quarter as well as organically. Internationally, ASV derived $512.6 million revenues, up 8.1% on a reported basis and 6.7% organically. While 13% growth was observed from the Asia-Pac region, Europe grew at a rate of 5%.The company's proprietary content revenues are expected to gain momentum in the quarters ahead, attributable to stronger demand driven by the company's competitive pricing strategy. We believe that its growing customer base, solid revenue growth, coupled with high client retention rate (90%) and a competitive pricing strategy, will positively impact results over the long term.Robust Organic GrowthFactSet continues to grow organically. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, organic revenues grew 5.7% to $332.5 million on the back of accelerated sales of content and technology solutions (CTS), analytics products and wealth management solutions. Region-wise,FactSet reported 5% organic growth from the United States and 6.9% internationally. The uptrend was due to higher sales from international price increase and analytics, data feed products along with a rise in workstation sales. FactSet’s ASV organic growth rate was 5.3% in the reported quarter.Expanding Global FootprintFactSet is strengthening its presence in the Asia Pacific region with the opening of a new office in Shanghai, China on May 31. With the opening, FactSet can now offer its data and analytic solutions to the growing number of investors and investment managers in China who seek better tools to aid them in their investment. FactSet has been working with the Chinese investment community since 1996.Additionally, the company’s ASV recorded 13% organic growth from the Asia-Pac region in third-quarter fiscal 2018. The region witnessed new client addition and higher sales to existing clients particularly in Singapore and Australia. Growth across both fixed income and equity products and Content & Technology Solutions (CTS) products boosted its analytical suite.We believe all these factors will perfectly complement the robust growth in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite contributing only 8% to total revenues, the Asia-Pacific region recorded marked improvement over the past two years. Revenues grew almost 40% from fiscal 2015 ($76.5 million) to fiscal 2017 ($106.7 million). The Asia Pacific segment operates offices in Australia, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Singapore and Shanghai.In third-quarter fiscal 2018, FactSet’s ASV recorded 5% organic growth from Europe. The company enjoyed major gains from the region in analytics, CTS and an increase in workstation sales. The UK and Nordic regions reported robust performance. Notably, FactSet generates around 25-27% of revenues from Europe. The European segment operates offices in Bulgaria, Dubai, England, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.Strong Product Suite Across AnalyticsFactSet is highly optimistic about the integrated data-related products and services within its analytical suite, which it offers to the investment community. With the market adapting a quantitative approach to save time, reduce operating expenses and increase work efficiency, FactSet’s innovative analytical product suite should benefit.  To this end, FactSet’s recent launch of Open: FactSet Marketplace looks exciting. Open:FactSet Marketplace is a new online platform, which offers both core financial and alternative datasets to address the growing demand for integrated data. The company believes that this new platform will boost its CTS suite  next year.RisksDespite such tailwinds, FactSet continues to face stiff competition from other players providing financial market data, analytics and related services. These competitors may be able to expand their offerings and data content more effectively, price their products more aggressively or respond more rapidly to situations developing in the marketplace.Additionally, FactSet’s balance sheet is highly leveraged. As of May 31, 2018, long-term debt was $574.74 million compared with $574.70 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $213.1 million compared with $233.6 million at the end of the prior quarter. Such a cash position implies that FactSet needs to generate adequate amount of operating cash flow to service its debt. Also, high debt may limit the company’s future expansion and worsen its risk profile.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderFactSet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report), Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report).

Moreover, earnings are expected to register 8.6% and 8.1% growth, respectively, in 2019 and 2020. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 8.2%.Growth Factors: Increasing demand for outsourcing services offers ample opportunities to Paychex. The company’s efforts to capitalize on these opportunities by periodically introducing products and services for its clients and by moving into the mid-market arena have paid off. In fourth-quarter fiscal 2018,HRS segment revenues climbed 17% year over year to $401 million, mainly owing to a rise in human capital management (HCM) services clients. The HCM services include comprehensive HR outsourcing services, comprising HROI, time and attendance, retirement services and insurance services. In fiscal 2018, segment revenues rose 14% year over year to $1.5 billion. According to Paychex, in fiscal 2019, HRS revenues growth is anticipated in the range of 10–11%.Paychex’s efforts to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry are appreciable. To this end, Paychex completed the acquisitions of HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc., a national professional employer organization.Buyout of Lessor Group is expected to contribute significantly to FactSet’s payroll services. Notably, in the fiscal fourth quarter, Lessor contributed approximately 1% to total payroll service revenue growth.  Payroll service revenues increased 3% year over year to $452.4 million in fiscal fourth quarter and 2% to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2018. As of May 31, 2018 (inclusive of the Lessor acquisition) Paychex had more than 650,000 payroll clients across more than 100 locations in the United States and Europe.Paychex’s strong cash position reflects management’s efficient execution in recent times. At the end of fiscal fourth quarter 2018, Paychex had cash, cash equivalents and corporate investments of $424.2 million compared with $421.2 million at the end of the prior quarter. The company has no long-term debt.  With no long-term debt to clear off, the significant amount of cash provides Paychex the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy in the form of strategic acquisitions and other related investments.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

21,BR,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 27 before the bell.We expect revenues of Payroll service and Human Resource Services (HRS) to increase in the to-be-reported quarter.

This upside is expected to be driven by strength across the company’s human capital management (HCM) services including HR, retirement and insurance services. HRS revenues rose 17.1% year over year in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.Retirement services revenues are likely to benefit from an increase in the number of plans served. Insurance services revenue are anticipated to grow, courtesy of growth in the number of health and benefit applicants, and higher average premiums for workers’ compensation insurance services.Further, interest on fund held by clients is expected to increase on the back of higher average interest rates earned.

Distribution revenues during the quarter increased 7%, primarily due to favorable foreign-currency fluctuations.Revenues from the Investor Communication Solutions segment (78% of total revenues) increased 13.9% from the year-ago quarter to $802.2 million.

23,BR,"Web.com Group Inc. (WEB  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 8.Notably, the Internet services and online marketing solutions provider for small businesses delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the trailing four quarters.Last quarter, the company delivered GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share compared with 7 cents in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, Web.com reported revenues of $189.8 million, slightly better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $189 million. However, the figure declined 1.6% on a year-over-year basis.For fourth-quarter 2017, Web.com projects non-GAAP revenues between $188.5 million and $191.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $190.8 million. Web.com Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Web.com Group, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Web.com Group, Inc. Quote Factors to ConsiderWeb.com’s top line is likely to benefit from increasing brand awareness. During the quarter, the company launched its new website that enhances customer experience.Moreover, the company’s focus on higher-ARPU and differentiated value-added solutions are expected to drive the top line.Retail business is expected to be strong on the back of robust demand for security and e-mail products. Management noted that post the Equifax breach, security has become imperative for small businesses to have a successful online presence. Web.com’s simple-to-use security products and consultative approach is likely to boost sales of the security products.Moreover, the completion of the Yodle integration is likely to bolster Lead Stream and vertical market solution results.Additionally, strong demand for real estate solution TORCHx is expected to drive conversion and retention rate, which will eventually boost total revenues. The company’s strategic partnerships with RE/MAX (one of the largest real estate brokerage franchisors) and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices are expected to boost TORCHx’s adoption rate.We also expect robust performance from Lighthouse 360 and Web Brand Networks (WBN) to drive quarterly results.Notably, Web.com has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to boost operations. The company’s acquisition of Donweb.com last year and Scoot in 2014 will continue to accelerate overseas expansion.However, an increasingly competitive business environment is a major concern. Moreover, declining subscriber base is a headwind. Web.com stated that overall retention rate may decline due to the increased mix shift towards value-added services subscribers who inherently have a higher churn rate than low-cost domain customers.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

24,BR,"Even as market panic grows, fueled primarily by inflationary fears, it is easy to forget that the economy remains on a firm footing. Recently released ISM services data provides ample proof of this fact, with the index hitting a 12 and a half year high. This was a significant improvement over the last two months of readings and was likely a product of optimism emanating from recently announced tax cuts.Moreover, the outlook of the business services sector is firmly tied to the broader economy. It is widely expected that the business-friendly approach of the Trump administration will provide a further boost to the U.S. economy.Further, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the fourth quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select business services stocks which are also slated to outperform their earnings estimates.ISM Services Gauge Touches Record HighIn January, the ISM Services Index increased by 3.9% to 59.9%, exceeding the consensus estimate of 56.8%. This is the highest level since August 2005 when it hit 61.3. Any level above 50 signifies expansion for the sector and going by that benchmark, this is the 96th consecutive month of expansion.Further, the New Orders Index increased by 8.2% to 62.7%. Additionally, the Prices Index and the Employment Index gained 5.3% and 2% to hit 61.6% and 59.9%, respectively. The surge in orders was attributable to recent tax cuts and a strong economy. Only three services industries contracted, with 15 reporting expansions. These gains are particularly noteworthy since they come after two months of declines.Strong Economy, Trump Administration to Boost SectorCurrently, the U.S. economy exhibits signs of improvement with a rise in GDP, an improving employment scenario, inflation approaching 2%, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum gained by oil prices. The Trump administration remains focused on improving the ease of doing business, exemplified by recently passed tax cuts. It is widely expected that it will pursue its agenda of deregulation aggressively.Moreover, total Q4 earnings for the sector are expected to be up 13.1% on 5.7% higher revenues as of Feb 2, 2018. That’s far better than the more vaunted consumer discretionary and conglomerates sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 3.7% and 14.3%, respectively, during the fourth quarter. Overall, total Q4 earnings are expected to be up 13% from the same period last year on 7.7% higher revenues.

27,BR,"While a steady U.S. economy and President Trump’s reformative announcements are acting as tailwinds for the markets, heightened tensions related to trade war remain a major concern.Fears of a trade war between the United States and its trading partners have been around since March. It all started with Trump’s announcement of imposing 25% tariff on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports on America’s biggest allies —  European Union, Canada and Mexico.America’s trading partners retaliated by targeting its products worth billions of dollars. The European Union intends to hit back with higher tariffs on roughly $7.5 billion worth of U.S. exports and file a legal notice against American measures at the World Trade Organization. Canada’s retaliatory tariffs on $12.8 billion worth of U.S. exports will be effective from Jul 1. Mexico is also set to impose a 20% tariff on U.S. pork and ham imports in response to Trump’s steel and aluminum import levies, per Reuters.Relations between China and United States have been tensed for a while, with the latter announcing a hefty 25% tariff on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods. The final list of Chinese goods subject to new import taxes is expected to be announced tomorrow. Trump also plans to restrict Chinese investment in U.S. companies and limit the number of goods that these companies can sell to China. China retaliated by announcing tariffs on U.S. goods (including soybeans, aircraft and vehicles) worth $50 billion.Adding fuel to the ongoing trade tensions, the Trump administration initiated a national security investigation into whether automobile imports are harming U.S. national security. The investigation, under Section 232, is the same tactic used by the Trump administration before it imposed global tariffs on steel and aluminum import earlier this year. The public hearings for the aforesaid investigation into auto imports is expected to be held around Jul 19-20.Given these developments, tensions over trade policy are most likely to escalate again in the coming months. All these events are hinting toward a global trade war.What’s Going in Favor of the Business Services Sector? As tensions over trade policy intensify, the business services sector stands to gain from the growing U.S. economy. This is because it is firmly tied to manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities that are currently benefiting from the all-round strength in the economy. The sector has recorded the highest jobs, with an addition of 483,000 jobs in the past 12 months.In May, the sector added 31,000 jobs, the second highest among all sectors.Economic activity in the manufacturing sector expanded in May as PMI measured by Institute of Supply Management (ISM) touched 58.7%. This shows strong growth in manufacturing for the 21st consecutive month, driven by continued increase in new orders, production activity and employment. Of the 18 manufacturing industries, 16 reported growth in May.As far as the non-manufacturing sector is concerned, NMI was 58.6% in May, recording the 100th consecutive month of expansion. This expansion was driven by continued increase in business activity, new orders, employment, inventories, prices and supplier deliveries. Out of the 18 non-manufacturing industries, 14 reported growth.Although U.S. economic growth decelerated in the first quarter to an annualized pace of 2.2%, after averaging higher than 3% in the previous three quarters, the economy is likely to rebound in the coming quarters. Income tax cuts along with increased government spending are expected to push annual economic growth to the 3% target.Additionally, the current 18-year low unemployment rate of 3.8% recorded in the month of May further raises optimism about the economy.6 Stocks to Secure Your Portfolio Amid Trade War TensionsGiven the promising developments in the business service sector, adding stocks from the sector looks like a smart move to safeguard your portfolio amid trade war fears.The buoyancy in the sector is further confirmed by its Zacks Sector Rank in the top 44% (7 out of 16 sectors). Additionally, we observe that the sector has performed well in the past year compared with the benchmark.

28,BR,"Outsourcing is the practice of handling over the control of certain operations, services or processes (which were previously done by the company’s internal staff and resources) to external resources or third-party contractors. A company may choose to outsource its operations for several reasons such as to reduce and control operating costs, increase focus on its core business competencies, thereby improving efficiency, strengthening its market share and getting access to better external resources. To avoid government rules and regulations, outsourcing is also adopted.Per a report by statista, the global outsourcing industry generated $88.9 billion in revenues in 2017. The outsourcing trends are expected to be more favorable going ahead in 2018 on a worldwide basis.Despite multiple tailwinds, outsourcing services have certain disadvantages. Companies need to constantly negotiate terms with their third-party contractors to enjoy easy services. At times, third-party vendors need to access the company’s internal data for proper functioning and this is where the security factor comes in. Given this backdrop, it is not a bad idea to undertake a comparative analysis of two Outsourcing Services stock — Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) and Automatic Data Processing Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report). Both the stocks are part of the broader Business Services sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors). While Broadridge has a market capitalization of $13.71 billion, Automatic Data Processing’s market cap is $61.36 billion.Zacks Rank & Style ScoreCurrently, both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.However, with an VGM Score of B, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP in terms investment attractiveness. ADP has a VGM Score of C. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores.Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 offer the best investment opportunities for investors. Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.Price PerformanceBroadridge clearly scores over ADP, considering its price performance in a year’s time. Shares of Broadridge have gained 54.6%, outperforming the S&P 500’s and industry’s rally of 13.7% and 25.2%, respectively. ADP has gained 37.6%, underperforming both the S&P 500 Composite and the industry. Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects.ADP’s current-quarter earnings are projected to grow 38.5% compared with 9.9% for Broadridge.  However, for full-year 2018, the situation is just the opposite with ADP’s expected earnings growth rate of 16.8% being lower than Broadridge’s growth rate of 34.5%.For 2019, ADP’s earnings are expected to register 12% growth compared with 6.9% for Broadridge. Moreover, the long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 11.3% for ADP is higher than Broadridge’s growth rate of 10%.While Broadridge’s earnings are expected to grow higher than ADP in 2018, the situation is expected to reverse in 2019 and the long term.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on the earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and full-year 2018 and 2019, in the last 60 days, ADP appears to be more favorably placed.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current quarter earnings improved 9.8% for ADP against a decrease of 2.1% for Broadridge.For 2018, the consensus estimate improved 4.3% for ADP and 4.2% for Broadridge. Estimates for 2019 moved up 3.4% for ADP and 2% for Broadridge.Earnings Surprise HistoryThe earnings surprise history of a stock helps investors have an idea of the stock’s performance in the previous quarters.Broadridge and ADP have an impressive earning surprise history, with their earnings surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the previous four quarters.However, Broadridge enjoys an edge over ADP as it delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 23.6% as against 5.2% for the latter.Net MarginNet profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.With a TTM net margin of 13.6%, ADP not only compares favorably with the industry’s figure of 11.8% but also has a lead over Broadridge’s 9.4% TTM net margin. Broadridge does not compare favorably with the industry in terms of TTM net margin.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for Broadridge and ADP is 28.8 and 34.2, respectively, while that of the industry is 28.3. Although both the companies are overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge has an edge with a lower P/E ratio. The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while Broadridge and ADP have EV/EBITDA ratios of 16.3 and 21.0, respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 13.6. Although both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry, Broadridge is better positioned with a lower EV/EBITDA value. Though both the stocks look overvalued relative to the industry, Broadridge is undervalued compared to ADP.ROE and ROCReturn on Equity (ROE) is the measure of a company’s efficiency in utilizing shareholders’ funds. The trailing 12-month ROE for Broadridge and ADP is 45.3% and 45.7%, respectively, while that of the industry is 34.7%. Although both the companies clearly score above the industry, ADP is a better choice than Broadridge with a higher ROE. Return on Capital (ROC) for Broadridge and ADP is 21.3% and 30.4%, respectively, while the industry’s ROC stands at 22.9%. This implies that ADP generates a higher return on investment than its industry.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that Broadridge is superior than ADP when considering price performance, valuation and earnings history. ADP scores over Broadridge in terms of net margin, long-term expected earnings growth, earnings estimate revisions, return on capital and equity.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Mastercard Incorporated (MA  -  Free Report), FLEETCOR Technologies, Inc. (FLT  -  Free Report) and WEX Inc. (WEX  -  Free Report). While Mastercard sports a Zacks Rank #1, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX carry a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rate for Mastercard, FLEETCOR Technologies and WEX is 19%, 16.5% and 14.3%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

31,BR,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 8. Investors are keenly awaiting the earnings report of this technology-based outsourcing solutions provider to the financial services industry  to see if it succeeds in delivering a positive surprise.Notably, Broadridge has an impressive earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and matched the same once, delivering an average positive surprise of 12.8%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Broadridge has a Zacks Rank #2 and its Earnings ESP is +1.45%. Therefore, the company is likely to deliver a positive surprise this quarter.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings is pegged at 58 cents per share. This indicates a year-over-year increase of 48.7%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $953.7 million, indicating 6.9% growth from the year-ago quarter actual figure.Factors to ConsiderNotably, the company continues to supplement internal growth with strategic acquisitions. During the quarter, the company acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, a provider of financial document management solutions. The acquisition is anticipated to enrich the company’s offerings related to “corporate disclosure lifecycle”.     Additionally, the company also acquired Morningstar, Inc.’s 15(c) board consulting services business. The acquisition is anticipated to strengthen Broadridge’s ability to provide a comprehensive source for financial data required for the fulfillment of governance related responsibilities by the board of directors of mutual funds.Moreover, in a bid to offer an innovative digital experience across financial services and other industries, the company expanded its strategic alliance with Amazon.com’s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services (AWS) in December 2017. The collaboration effort will help to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository.Furthermore, the company enhanced its client base with some prominent additions in the soon to-be-reported quarter. Earthport, a financial services firm, adopted “Broadridge's hosted service for Foreign Exchange and Cash Management processing”.    Beta Capital Wealth Management chose the company’s solutions for a “comprehensive front to back office technology and operations solution.”Broadridge also completed a blockchain-based pilot project along with Natixis and Societe Generale aimed at optimizing the efficiency of “bilateral repurchase, or repo agreements.”We believe all these initiatives and the strong business model of the company, a good percentage of which comes from recurring revenues are tailwinds that will help the company to deliver an impressive performance in the quarter under discussion.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc.

33,BR,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is BR due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Broadridge Q3 Earnings & Revenues Top, EPS View UpBroadridge Financial Solutions reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2018 results with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Adjusted earnings of $1.00 per share beat the consensus mark by 21 cents and increased 45% year over year. The bottom line benefited from lower tax rates (as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) and improvement in adjusted operating income.As a result of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for the reported quarter reduced to 12.9% from 28.6% in the prior-year period. The company also witnessed $15.6 million of tax benefit from stock-based compensation. This was, however, partially offset by $16.1 million of net tax charges associated with the Tax Act.Total revenues of $1.07 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.03 billion. The figure was up 6.2% year over year. The top line benefited from robust event-driven fee revenues, higher recurring fee revenues and distribution revenues.Recurring fee revenues increased 8% to $639 million due to higher organic growth, which was backed by net new business, internal growth and acquisition-related synergies. Event-driven fee revenues increased 9% to $67 million due to higher proxy contests. Distribution revenues increased 2% to $385 million. There was also a positive impact of $1 million from foreign currency movements.Revenues by SegmentInvestor Communication Solutions segment (79.79% of total revenues) revenues increased 4.2% from the year-ago quarter to $855.3 million. Segment revenues were driven by higher recurring fee revenues ($403 million) from internal growth, net new business and acquisitions, elevated event-driven fee revenues ($67 million) and distribution revenues ($385 million).Global Technology and Operations segment (21.94%) revenues came in at $235.2 million, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter. Segment revenues were driven by internal growth from higher trade and non-trade activity levels, higher net new business from closed sales and buyouts.Operating ResultsOperating income increased 19% year over year to $130 million. Adjusted operating income came in at $152 million, up 13% from the year-ago quarter.Operating income margin rose to 12.1% from 10.9% in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted operating income margin rose to 14.1% from 13.2% in the year-ago quarter. The margin expansion was driven by higher recurring fee revenues.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10.6% to $138.8 million. Total operating expenses increased 4.7% to $941.9 million.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowBroadridge exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $352.1 million compared with $366.5 million at the end of December 2017. As of Mar 31, 2018, long-term debt was $1,203.1 million compared with $1,222.7 million at the end of December 2017.The company generated $274.8 million of cash from operating activities in the reported quarter compared with $162.1 million in the year-ago quarter. Free cash flow was $204.2 million compared with $92.6 million in the year-ago quarter.During the reported quarter, the company returned $123 million to its shareholders in the form of dividends compared with $80.4 million in second-quarter fiscal 2018.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceBroadridge raised its fiscal 2018 guidance for adjusted EPS growth to 31-35% from 27-31%, while reaffirming its outlook for revenue growth and margin expansion.Total revenues are expected to grow in the rate of 2-4%. Recurring revenue growth is expected in the range of 4-6%. Adjusted operating income margin is still estimated to be approximately 16%. It also reiterated free cash flow expectations in the range of $500-$550 million.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions lower for the current quarter.Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus  Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. Price and Consensus | Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, BR has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B.

If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Our style scores indicate that the stock is more suitable for growth investors than momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift.

34,BR,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Dun & Bradstreet (DNB  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 11.8% over the past month. DNB hit a new 52-week high of $131.86 in the previous session. Dun & Bradstreet has gained 11.4% since the start of the year compared to the 13.8% move for the Business Services sector and the 15.5% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 9, 2018, Dun & Bradstreet reported EPS of $1.24 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.04 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 7.95%.For the current fiscal year, Dun & Bradstreet is expected to post earnings of $8.47 per share on $1.77 billion in revenues. This represents a 15.08% change in EPS on a 1.78% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $8.84 per share on $1.81 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 4.39% and 1.95%, respectively.Valuation MetricsDun & Bradstreet may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for DNB? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Dun & Bradstreet has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are C and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 15.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 12.5X versus its peer group's average of 21.9X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 3.46. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (The) Price and Consensus  Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (The) Price and Consensus | Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (The) QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Dun & Bradstreet currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Dun & Bradstreet meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though DNB shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Dun & Bradstreet Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Dun & Bradstreet have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Waste Connections (WCN  -  Free Report), and Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 12% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for DNB, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

35,BR,"In the latest signal that the U.S. economy is starting to pick up the pace, the services sector grew at a faster clip in May. This marked the 100th successive month of expansion for service-oriented companies, which employ the majority of the United States’ working population.Respondents of the survey conducted by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) did express concern about trade-related issues. But the overall sentiment about the economy remained upbeat. This is why it is a good time to invest in stocks from the services sector.Index Expands at Faster Clip in MayThe ISM services index increased from 56.8% in April to 58.6% in May. At this point, the index is nearing a 13-year high. More significantly, while any figure above 50% indicates expansion, a reading above 55% is outstanding.The Business Activity Index increased from 59.1% to 61.3%, marking the 106th straight month of gains. Additionally, the New Orders Index increased from 60% to 60.5%. The Employment Index increased from 53.6% to 54.1%.The report also revealed that 14 non-manufacturing industries have experienced expansion in a month. The survey’s results were nearly identical to the one released by IHS Markit. In fact, the IHS Markit U.S. Services Business Activity Index hit a three-year high in May.Upbeat Sentiment Outweighs Trade ConcernsAccording to the ISM’s Anthony Nieves, respondents remained concerned about trade tensions. There are fears that a breakdown in trade agreements like the NAFTA and tariffs on aluminum and steel could raise costs on the supply side. This in turn could impede growth for the economy at large.However, most respondents continue to remain positive about business conditions. The outlook for the economy at large remained encouraging. Recently released economic reports seem to bear out this fact. For instance, May’s jobs report reflects the continuing strength in the labor market with unemployment falling to an 18-year low. Our ChoicesA substantial expansion in the services sector is indicative of its continuing attractiveness as an investment option. Additionally, encouraging economic data, like the recent jobs report, bears out the optimism expressed by respondents in the ISM survey.This is why it makes good sense to add stocks from this sector to your portfolio. However, it is crucial to pick winning stocks in order to reap maximum gains. This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

In fact, the company is an exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).Additionally, it experienced a combined growth of 1.2% year over year to 145.8 million in domain name registrations for .com and .net. Notably, there were 8.9 million new registrations for .com and .net, gained 7.2% compared with 8.3 million in the year-ago-quarter. Per VeriSign, .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).VeriSign’s “The Domain Name Industry Brief” stated that domain name registration declined slightly 0.4% sequentially to approximately 330.7 million across top-level domains (TLDs) at the end of the third quarter. However, the same increased 3.7 million or 1.1% year over year.Additionally, Country Code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs) increased 3.2% year over year and 0.3% sequentially to 144.7 million in the third quarter.Meanwhile, the company is benefiting from strong gTLD prospects. Markedly, new gTLDs (ngTLD) represent 6.4% of total domain name registrations. Further, gTLD prospects, international expansion through IDNs and investments in intellectual properties are likely to boost results.Improving trade in bitcoin and cryptocurrency sectors is also a favorable contributing factor for rising domain name registrations.For 2017, VeriSign has revised the guidance for its domain name base growth rate. Per the company’s prediction, the metric is expected to grow in the range of 2.8% to 3.1%, up from its earlier forecast of 2% to 2.75%. The domain name registration is likely to increase within a range of 0.4 million to 0.9 million in the to-be-reported quarter.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  VeriSign, Inc.

39,BR,"U.S. equity markets have been on a tear since President Donald Trump’s election, owing to his pro-growth policies. However, various concerns over geopolitics and political stability in the United States bother the markets (read: U.S. ETFs in Focus as Market Cap Hits $30 trillion).Trump ImpactTrump’s tax reform was recently signed into law, driving U.S. equity markets higher. As a part of the measures introduced in the reform, the corporate tax rate was slashed to 21% from the previous 35%. Small-caps are significantly expected to benefit from this move, as the median effective tax rate is higher for small-cap stocks than large caps.The Trump administration indicated last month that it now plans to work on infrastructure spending, after the massive tax overhaul was passed. We might see developments in the infrastructure space, as recently a copy of Trump’s infrastructure plan got leaked. ""We are not going to comment on the contents of a leaked document but look forward to presenting our plan in the near future,"" White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters told CNBC (read: US Industrial Production Beats Expectations: ETFs in Focus).Coming to regulation cut down, Trump aims to cut down on stringent regulations for ease of doing business. He especially targets to cut a lot out of the Dodd Frank Act, as he thinks it restricts business growth. The bill, if passed, would allow small banks to avoid certain elements of federal oversight, such as stress tests, which measure an institution’s ability to withstand economic downturns. “We’re looking at Dodd-Frank very strongly and I think we’ll have something on that,” Trump told the Wall Street Journal.Geopolitical RisksGeopolitical risks have been on the rise. In his New Year’s address, North Korean premier, Kim Jong-un, warned the United States of potential nuclear action in case his country is threatened (read: What Does Kim Jong-Un's Speech Hold For Safe Haven ETFs?).Moreover, rising concerns in the Middle East are bothering the markets. Rising political unrest in Iran and Venezuela are driving fear among investors. Since small-cap stocks have more domestic exposure, the capitalization is not likely to be disturbed by geopolitical risks.Let us now discuss a few ETFs focused on providing exposure to U.S. small-cap equities.iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM  -  Free Report)This fund seeks to provide exposure to small cap U.S. companies and tracks the Russell 2000 index.It has AUM of $43.2 billion and charges a fee of 20 basis points a year. From a sector look, the fund has high exposures to Financials, Information Technology and Health Care with 18.0%, 16.9% and 15.5% allocation, respectively (as of Jan 19, 2018). The fund’s top three holdings are Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR  -  Free Report), Bluebird Bio Inc (BLUE  -  Free Report) and Sage Therapeutics Inc (SAGE  -  Free Report) with 0.5%, 0.4% and 0.3% allocation, respectively (as of Jan 19, 2018). The fund has returned 20.2% in a year.

40,BR,"Investors on the lookout for stocks with the potential for maximum growth and value investing may consider the growth at a reasonable price or GARP strategy.This popular strategy helps investors gain exposure to stocks with impressive growth prospects that are trading at a discount. GARP investing employs popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book value (P/B) ratio – to evaluate whether a stock is undervalued.GARP Metrics – Mix of Growth & Value MetricsThe GARP approach helps to identify stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth history and impressive prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only nine.Here are six of the nine stocks that made it through the screen:Apple Inc.

41,BR,"Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) seems to be on track to enhance its offerings for mutual fund and investment managers. Its latest inorganic addition is Morningstar, Inc.’s 15(c) board consulting services business. The financial terms of the deal were kept under wraps.This business segment of Morningstar helps “ boards of directors and executive teams of mutual funds” in meeting their 15(c) fiduciary duties for the process of reviewing and approving the fee related agreements with each investment advisor. The buyout will help Broadridge in better serving its fund board clients.The company in its press release revealed that, “This acquisition will enable Broadridge to provide its fund board clients the ability to benchmark funds using both Morningstar and Lipper data via an objective, independent source in order to better assess their fund advisors and sub-advisors.”The acquisition is anticipated to strengthen Broadridge’s ability to provide a comprehensive source for financial data required for the fulfillment of governance related responsibilities by the board of directors of mutual funds.Dan Cwenar, Broadridge’s head of buy-side data and analytics stated, “This acquisition broadens the breadth and depth of the data-driven solutions Broadridge provides to the investment management industry and underscores our commitment to providing innovative services to help clients get ahead of today’s challenges and capitalize on tomorrow’s opportunities.”Share PriceBroadridge stock has gained 36.9% over the past year, substantially outperforming the 6.6% rally of the industry it belongs to.Factors Driving the StockAcquisitions have been key catalysts for Broadridge’s growth. Prior to the abovementioned acquisition, the company acquired Summit Financial Disclosure, a provider of financial document management services in October 2017.

The company also formed a strategic alliance with Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) to build a new solution that can store documents and data in a repository, which will be further used for machine learning and artificial intelligence.Furthermore, Broadridge’s product launches, share repurchase programs and regular dividend payment policies look encouraging.

42,BR,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) released updates about the impact of the recent tax reforms on its business operations. The company has declared reductions in the bottom-line projections for fourth-quarter 2017, thanks to anticipated non-cash charges against provision for income taxes. Robert half expects incurring the charges as a result of the provisions enlisted under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).Per the recent tax reforms, Robert Half expects one-time charges of approximately $34-38 million (amounting to nearly 27-31 cents per share) to its provision for income taxes. Consequently, earnings are now estimated in the range of 29-39 cents, which marks a substantial decline from the previous range of 60-66 cents.Further, the company has also released updates regarding the effective tax rate for 2018, in relation to the recent enactments under the TCJA.  Robert Half now expects effective tax rates in the range of 26-28%. Notably, management’s tax projection for 2018 is pegged below the forecast for fourth-quarter 2017. Incidentally, during the third-quarter conference call, management projected effective tax rate for fourth-quarter 2017 to be approximately 37%.Reduced tax rates for 2018 are likely to boost the company’s bottom line. Also, greater retention of profits will help the company allocate more funds toward corporate reformation and development efforts.Can TCJA Improve Hiring Market Conditions?It is not certain whether the ongoing tax reforms will lead to higher wages for workers in the United States. However, such moves are expected to create more jobs owing to positive impacts on the economic conditions. The benefits from lower tax rates may propel companies to allocate more capital for increasing headcount to support business growth. The above-mentioned factors can significantly bolster Robert Half’s business in the forthcoming periods.  While Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management noted that hiring market trends started improving in September and continued till October. Evidently, temporary and consulting staffing revenues grew 2.1% in September and 2% in the first two weeks of October. Also, permanent placement revenues advanced 7.2% in September and surged 21% in the first three weeks of October.  These factors along with an overall improved economic scenario in the United States, encourages management about business growth. Such positive trends have been boosting investor’s optimism in the stock. In the past six months shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have returned 16%, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 16.2%.Looking For More?

46,BR,"Investors following the growth or value strategy are always on the lookout for stocks that are poised to see strong growth and are available at a discount. Growth at a reasonable price or GARP investing is a strategy that takes care of these criteria.The GARP approach prefers stocks that are priced below the market or any reasonable target determined by fundamental analysis. These stocks also have solid prospects in terms of cash flow, revenues, earnings per share (EPS) and so on.However, one should not confuse GARP investing with the blend strategy. While the blend strategy promotes investment in both value and growth stocks, GARP investing requires both value and growth features in a single stock.Growth MetricsStrong earnings growth and solid prospects are the main concepts that GARP investors borrow from the growth investing strategy. However, instead of super-normal growth rates, picking stocks with a more stable and reasonable growth rate is a preferred tactic of GARP investors. Hence, growth rates between 10% and 20% are considered ideal under the strategy.Another growth metric that is considered by both growth and GARP investors is return on equity (ROE). GARP investors look for strong and higher ROE compared to the industry average to identify superior stocks. Moreover, stocks with positive cash flow find precedence under the GARP plan.Value MetricsGARP investing gives priority to one of the popular value metrics – price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Though this investing style picks stocks with higher P/E ratios compared to value investors, it avoids companies with extremely high P/E ratios. Moreover, the price-to-book value (P/B) ratio is another value metric that is considered.Using the GARP principle, we have run a screen to identify stocks that should offer solid returns in the near term.Screening ParametersAlong with the criteria discussed in the above section, we have considered a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Last 5-year EPS & projected 3–5 year EPS growth rates between 10% and 20% (Strong EPS growth history and prospects ensure improving business.)ROE (over the past 12 months) greater than the industry average (Higher ROE compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks.)P/E and P/B ratios less than M-industry average (P/E and P/B ratios less than that of the industry indicates that the stocks are undervalued.)These few criteria have narrowed down the universe of over 7,700 stocks to only six.Here are four stocks that made it through the screen:Home Depot, Inc.

48,BR,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) has been struggling with underlying weakness in Protiviti segment and sluggish domestic hiring trends. These factors also weighed on the company in third-quarter 2017, wherein earnings and sales declined year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter. However, the company is encouraged with the improving trends in the U.S. market.Further, the company has managed to stay afloat, courtesy of strong international operations and constant investments in technology up-gradation initiatives. Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have surged 24% in the past three months, almost in line with the industry’s rally of 25.4%.Let’s now delve into the factors that have been impacting Robert Half’s performance lately.Soft Protiviti Segment & Escalated Costs Protiviti is the wholly-owned subsidiary of Robert Half, offering varied risk consulting and audit services. Of late, the segment has been depicting weakness due to declining margins and fewer high-margin clients. During the third quarter of 2017, Protiviti’s revenues declined about 4% to $209 million, primarily stemming from weak trends in the United States. Despite a stable U.S. economic environment and a stronger job market, the hiring cycle continues to be lengthy as employers take more time to make hiring decisions. This is negatively affecting the company’s profits. Further, gross margin in the segment contracted 130 basis points to 29.6% during the quarter, severely affecting the company’s profits. The company has also been incurring increased selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses owing to higher staffing costs. Further, management expects SG&A deleverage, on account of costs related to IT initiatives, increased head count and higher compensations, especially outside the United States.The Driving FactorsNevertheless, the company has been witnessing strength in international hiring, driven by increasing demand for its professional staffing services. This, in turn has encouraged Robert Half to steadily invest in technology improvements. Major software initiatives include upgrades to enterprise resource planning applications and the implementation of a global, cloud-based customer relationship management application.Further, the company continues to invest in digital technology initiatives designed to enhance the service offerings to clients and candidates. In this regard, Robert Half concluded the global rollout of its CRM software in 2017, while it also launched a website recently. Notably, international revenue growth, mainly from European regions, provided some cushion to Robert Half’s soft revenues in third-quarter 2017.While Robert Half’s U.S. revenues were soft in the third quarter, management noted that trends improved in September which continued till October. Further, management is optimistic about the overall improved economic scenario. The increased economic activity in the United States and an optimistic growth view for 2017 give out positive signals for Robert Half’s business.Looking For More?

50,BR,"Shares of Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) advanced more than 3%, yesterday, after the company reported better-than-expected first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings. Moreover, both the top and bottom line increased year over year.The company posted adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents per share (excluding acquisition and amortization related expenses), surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 41 cents. Also, adjusted earnings increased 50% on a year-over-year basis.In the last one year, Broadridge’s share price increased 49%, outperforming the Zacks industry, which gained only 14.8%.Quarter DetailsBroadridge’s first-quarter revenues of $925 million increased 3% year over year. However, it lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $928 billion. Better-than-expected revenues from closed sale were a catalyst.Recurring fee revenues increased 6% during the quarter that included contribution from organic growth, Net New Business, internal growth and acquisitions related synergies. Recurring revenues from closed sales during the quarter were $23 million, reflecting an increase of 6% on a year-over-year basis. Event-driven fee revenues increased 58% to $59 million during the quarter, primarily due to higher proxy contest activity and higher mutual fund proxy activity. Distribution revenues during the quarter decreased 6%, primarily due to foreign currency fluctuations.Revenues from the Investor Communication Solutions segment (79% of total revenues) increased 1% from the year-ago quarter to $733 million. The improvement was attributable to higher recurring revenues from net new business, closed sales, higher event-driven fee revenues and internal growth.The Global Technology and Operations segment (21% of total revenues) revenues came in at $208 million, reflecting an increase of 11% from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven by higher Net New Business from closed sales, internal growth and recent acquisition.Broadridge’s adjusted operating income margin expanded from 9.1% to 11.5%, primarily due to the higher recurring fee revenues and event-driven fee revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues contracted from 12.4% to 12.3% on a year-over-year basis. The company’s adjusted net income of $64 million or 54 cents was up from $44 million or 36 cents in the year-ago period.The company exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $288.8 million compared with $271.1 million in the previous quarter.

The company projects revenue growth in the range of 2-3%, while recurring revenue growth is expected in the range of 4-6%. The company anticipates recurring revenues from closed sales to be a key growth driver and range within $170 million to $210 million. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 16%. Adjusted earnings are expected to increase in the range of 15-19%. Management expects free cash flow in the range of $400-$450 million.Recent ActivityThe company recently announced the acquisition of Summit Financial Disclosure, LLC (“Summit”). Summit is a full service financial document management solutions provider. We remain encouraged by its buyout spree, with the help of which the company is expanding its product portfolio and customer reach.Our TakeBroadridge reported mixed first-quarter results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were favorable backed by higher recurring revenues, internal growth, contribution from Net New Business, higher distribution revenues and acquisition-related synergies.We remain optimistic about Broadridge’s strategic acquisitions, product launches, share repurchase program and dividend paying initiatives. We also believe that the company’s close association with Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will be beneficial in the long run.However, competition from DST Systems Inc.  and pricing pressure remain headwinds.Currently, Broadridge carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology sector is Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarter, with an average beat of 4.2%.However, in the past year, shares of the company have declined 11% against the 21.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.  Acquisitions Strengthening PortfolioAcquisitions have been a key catalyst for ManpowerGroup, which helped it to strengthen the company’s diversified portfolio. In fact, it has been acquiring and investing in companies globally. Some of the notable acquisitions include LearnUp, a recruitment company acquired in 2017, and CIBER — a global information technology consulting, services and outsourcing company bought in 2016.Notably, acquisitions contributed 50 basis points to first-quarter 2018 revenues.

Also, the company’s businesses spread across Europe and APME countries are growing strong. Notably, in first-quarter 2018, revenues from Southern Europe increased 28.2% year over year to $2,312 million. The upside was driven by growth in permanent recruitment and strong businesses across France and Italy.Revenues from Northern Europe totaled $1417.6 million, up 14.4% year over year. The increase was driven by strong growth in Poland, Finland and Russia. The APME segment’s revenues rose 13.9% year over year to $720.2 million. The uptrend was backed by growth in India, China and other APME countries like Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore.Competition RifeManpowerGroup operates in a highly competitive employment services industry with low barriers to entry. It faces stiff competition in both domestic and international markets from other established players such as Adecco S.A., Randstad Holding N.V. and Kelly Services Inc.

52,BR,"Avis Budget Group, Inc. (CAR  -  Free Report), through its Avis brand, boosted its long-term marketing association with Universal Parks and Resorts with the opening of vehicle rental services at five Loews Hotels of Universal Orlando Resort. This extended partnership was announced yesterday.The five Loews Hotels to be provided with Avis’ high-quality vehicle rental services are Loews Portofino Bay Hotel, Loews Royal Pacific Resort, the Hard Rock Hotel Orlando, Loews Sapphire Falls Resort and Universal’s Cabana Bay Beach Resort. Additionally, an Avis counter is scheduled to be opened at Universal’s Aventura Hotel, this summer.Universal Parks and Resorts, also known as Universal Studios Theme Parks or Universal Theme Parks, is the theme park subsidiary of NBCUniversal, which is owned by Comcast Corporation (CMCSA  -  Free Report). The Universal Orlando Resort, commonly known as Universal Orlando, is a subsidiary of Universal Parks and Resorts.Avis Budget and Universal Parks and Resorts’ alliance goes back a long way. On availing Avis’ vehicle rental services, guests of Universal Parks and  Resorts are offered special packages coupled with attractive discounts. Additional benefits are provided through Avis customer channels, which include services from-and-to airport locations of Orlando and Hollywood. Advertisements of Avis vehicles also appear on the online booking portal of Universal Parks & Resorts. Bottom LineThe Avis brand accounts for almost 58% of Avis Budget’s total revenues and is one of the world’s leading providers of vehicle rental services. In 2017, the brand reported $5.2 billion in revenues from company-operated Avis locations, globally. Based on the type of customers, it earned 49% of revenues from the commercial customers, with the remaining derived from the leisure segments of the travel industry. Market-wise, it generated around 70% of revenues from on-airport locations and 30% from off-airport locations.While Avis Budget already enjoys a dominant position in the airport car rental business, the launch of these onsite hotel rental locations in Orlando should help the company increase its off-airport presence. Stephen Wright, senior vice president, global travel, partnerships and associations at Avis Budget stated, “Universal’s theme parks in Orlando and Hollywood are popular attractions in the United States visited by travelers the world over.”Considering the brand’s overall robust growth, Avis Budget is focused on further strengthening its Avis brand with continuous investments in technology and enhancement of customer services with different applications. Further, the company is highly optimistic about its Avis brand benefiting from the opportunities in mobility solutions and vehicle-related technologies. Meanwhile, the comeback of Avis brand in Japan, after a gap of 14 years, is a major positive, which should help the company expand globally and boost its top line.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, Avis Budget is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.

54,BR,"Investors looking for stocks in the Outsourcing sector might want to consider either Convergys (CVG  -  Free Report) or Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Convergys and Broadridge Financial Solutions are both sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that these stocks have improving earnings outlooks. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CVG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.14, while BR has a forward P/E of 27.55. We also note that CVG has a PEG ratio of 1.57. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. BR currently has a PEG ratio of 2.76.Another notable valuation metric for CVG is its P/B ratio of 1.59. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, BR has a P/B of 11.76.These are just a few of the metrics contributing to CVG's Value grade of B and BR's Value grade of D.Both CVG and BR are impressive stocks with improving earnings outlooks. But considering the above metrics, value investors will likely feel that CVG is the better option right now.

55,BR,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about First Data Corporation (FDC  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 11%. In a years’ time, the stock has rallied 17%, outperforming the 8.4% increase of the industry it belongs to.  We believe First Datahas the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s benefits from acquisitions, partnerships and agreements.Let’s discuss them in detail.Active on Acquisition FrontAcquisition of BluePay, Acculynk and CardConnect are significant additions to the First Data’s product portfolio. BluePay will allow the company to expand market share in the high growth integrated payments space. Acculynk acquisition is expected to boost First Data’s extensive payments portfolio. CardConnect was the company’s peer payment processor and its long-time distribution partner. Its acquisition will help First Data to enhance its financial technology capacities.Moreover, the addition of CardConnect’s invoice-to-cash processing capabilities opens vast opportunities for First Data in the ERP space and helps it better manage cash and other services for clients. First Data can now better focus on globalizing its offerings and strategic partnerships along with boosting its business around enterprise clients.First Data Corporation Net Income (TTM) First Data Corporation Net Income (TTM) | First Data Corporation Quote  Strategic Partnerships and AgreementsStrategic partnerships and agreements have been playing a significant role in shaping the growth trajectory of the company. In first-quarter 2018, First Data teamed up with RBL Bank. The partnership will allow RBL Bank to leverage First Data’s VisionPLUS for its credit card customers across India. Earlier this year, the company announced a similar kind of partnership with SBI Card, a leading credit card issuer in India. The move enables SBI Card to leverage VisionPLUS to enhance service offerings. These endeavors have improved First Data’s client base and are likely to boost top-line growth.Additionally, Global Financial Solutions (GFS) segment will continue to expand globally, courtesy of these partnerships and renewed agreements with Credit One and PSCU. First Data also extended partnership with Alibaba’s (BABA) Alipay, which enables the company to integrate Alipay at its point-of-sale (POS) across 35,000 North American merchants. Moving ahead, First Data’ Global Business Solutions (GBS) segment is likely to gain momentum.To ConcludeAlthough First Data rides high on significant growth prospects, it is not free from overhangs. The company’s all three business segments experience seasonality with stronger demand in the fourth quarter and weaker demand in the first quarter, relative to the second and third quarters. Seasonality causes considerable fluctuations in revenues and profits, and makes forecasting difficult. Also, frequent acquisitions have escalated integration risks. Nevertheless, we believe that acquisitions, partnerships and agreements bode well for the company in the long term.First Data carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

56,BR,"Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 earnings results on Nov 8.In the last reported quarter, the company posted on in-line earnings. The company surpassed earnings estimates in three out of the trailing four quarters, generating an average beat of 3.6%.We believe that Broadridge’s strategic acquisitions, product launches, share repurchase program and dividend paying initiatives, will continue to boost the company’s top-line. We also believe that its close association with Accenture (ACN) will act as a tailwind.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 41 cents, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 13.9%.  Further, the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last 30 days. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $928 million, up roughly 3.7% from the year-ago quarter.Aspects to Influence Q1 ResultsQ4 Earnings HighlightBroadridge reported modest fourth-quarter results. Year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were favorable driven by higher recurring revenues, internal growth, contribution from Net New Business, higher distribution revenues and acquisition-related synergies.The company provided 2018 outlook. The company projects revenue growth in the range of 2-3%, while recurring revenue growth is expected in the range of 4-6%. The company anticipates recurring revenues from closed sales to be a key catalyst and range within $170-$210 million.Notably, its shares have surged 30.9% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s meager gain of 3.9%.Acquisitions: Key CatalystsThe company has supplemented internal growth with strategic acquisitions. Broadridge acquired many companies like Message Automation Limited, DST Systems Inc.’s  North American Customer Communications (NACC) business. The transaction expands digital communications offerings as well as print communications business. In our opinion, these buyouts have helped Broadridge to evolve as one of the leading financial and outsourcing services providers. We also remain encouraged by its acquisition spree, with the help of which the company is expanding its product portfolio and customer reach. These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.Strong Business Model & Share Repurchase: Other Positive FactorsThe company generates recurring revenues and a good percentage of its business comes from recurring fee revenues, which include contributions from Net New Business and acquisitions related synergies. Revenue growth is an important metric for any company as it is a vital part of growth projections and instrumental in strategic decision-making. Further, revenue growth is essential for justifying the fixed and variable expenses incurred to operate a business. Broadridge’s diversified products and services coupled with strategic acquisitions have provided a boost to top-line growth.In the last reported quarter, recurring fee revenues increased 24% during the quarter that included contribution from Net New Business, internal growth and acquisitions related synergies. Moreover, revenues from the Investor Communication Solutions segment (86% of total revenues) increased 45% from the year-ago quarter to $1.162 billion in the last reported quarter. The improvement was attributable to higher recurring revenues from net new business, internal growth and NACC acquisitions.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for Investor Communication Solutions is pegged at $735 million, up 1.7% year over year.Furthermore, Broadridge has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. In fiscal 2017, repurchased $342.8 million worth of its treasury stock and paid dividend of $152.2 million. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Broadridge is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two important ingredients.Zacks ESP: Broadridge’s Earnings ESPis +4.03%. This is because the company’s Most Accurate estimate is 43 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 41 cents. A favorable ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Broadridge currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Broadridge’s Zacks Rank #2 and +4.03% ESP makes us reasonably optimistic of an earnings beat.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.DISH Network Corporation (DISH  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

57,BR,"Automatic Data Processing Inc (ADP  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on Nov 2.Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 5.65%. Last quarter, ADP delivered a negative earnings surprise of 2.99%.Adjusted earnings of 66 cents per share increased 4% on a year-over-year basis on revenues of $3.07 billion, which increased 5.7%.Notably, the stock has returned 13.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 6.7% rally of the industry.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key Factors to Watch ForADP’s top-line growth is anticipated to be 5% in the quarter, which is in the lower end of its 5-6% growth forecast for fiscal 2018. We expect improving bookings to positively affect revenues along with strong growth in the Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services segment.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $3.06 million. The consensus estimate for the PEO Services segment is $892 million. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Automatic Data Processing, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Automatic Data Processing, Inc. QuoteHowever, elevated spending on service and sales along with the charges related to Service Alignment Initiative will keep margins under pressure in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Moreover, higher tax rate will also dent profitability.Further, the ongoing proxy fight with Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square will remain an overhang on the stock.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that ADP is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: ADP’s Earnings ESP is -0.35%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: ADP carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which when combined with a -0.35% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Kemet Corporation (KEM  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +7.46% and sports a Zacks Rank #1.

58,BR,"Though rising yields have dampened the appeal for dividend investing, a niche corner of this space is still in vogue. This is none other than the dividend growth strategy. Stocks with a strong history of dividend growth year over year form a healthy portfolio with greater scope of capital appreciation as opposed to simple dividend paying stocks or those that pay high yields.Why Dividend Growth?Stocks that have a strong history of dividend growth belong to mature companies, which are less susceptible to large swings in the market, and thus act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty. At the same time, these offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.These stocks have superior fundamentals as opposed to their traditional dividend counterparts such as a sustainable business model, a long track record of profitability, rising cash flows, good liquidity, strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. They have a history of outperformance over the long term but not necessarily high dividend yields. All these makes dividend growth a quality and promising investment metric for the long term.Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that dividend increase in the future is likely. This makes the portfolio healthy and safe. Though these stocks have a long history of outperformance compared with the broader stock market or any other dividend paying stock, it does not necessarily mean that they have the highest yields.As a result, picking dividend growth stocks appear as winning strategies when some other parameters are also included.5-Year Historical Dividend Growth greater than zero: This selects stocks with a solid dividend growth history.5-Year Historical Sales Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a strong record of growing revenue.5-Year Historical EPS Growth greater than zero: This represents stocks with a solid earnings growth history.Next 3–5 Year EPS Growth Rate greater than zero: This represents the rate at which a company’s earnings are expected to grow. Improving earnings should help companies sustain dividend payments.Price/Cash Flow less than M-Industry: A ratio less than M-industry indicates that the stock is undervalued in that industry and that an investor needs to pay less for better cash flow generated by the company.52-Week Price Change greater than S&P 500 (Market Weight): This ensures that the stock appreciated more than the S&P 500 over the past one year.Top Zacks Rank: Stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and 2 (Buy) generally outperform their peers in all types of market environment.Growth Style Score of B or better: Our research shows that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.P/E Ratio Less than X-Industry: A ratio less than X-industry indicates that the stock is cheap and undervalued in that industry.Here are six of the 14 stocks that fit the bill:Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report): This California-based company designs, manufactures, markets and services semiconductor processing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits. It is expected to see earnings growth of 44.76% for this fiscal year and has a P/E ratio of 14.21 versus the industry average of 21.3. Lam Research has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Style Score of A.

59,BR,"Robert Half International Inc. (RHI  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $51.50 on Oct 2, eventually closing at $51.16. We believe that the company’s software upgrading initiatives and growth prospects in the temporary staffing arena has aided the stock to gain new highs.Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have increased 5% in the past three months surpassing the industry’s growth of 1.1%.Let’s delve into some of the aspects that have been impacting the company’s performance lately.Technology & Software Investments Robert Half has been heavily investing in technology infrastructure and implementing improved software systems. A major portion of its capital expenditures are being allocated toward improving software systems. Such initiatives will ensure the company’s future growth prospects. Major software initiatives include upgrades to enterprise resource planning applications and the implementation of a global, cloud-based customer relationship management application.  Growth Prospects in Temporary Staffing Hiring cycle in the United States remains lengthy as employers take more time for hiring decisions, which is negatively affecting Robert Half’s profits. Nevertheless, Robert Half remains hopeful regarding improvements in the hiring activity in the United States as companies are increasingly using temporary and consulting professionals as part of their human resource mix. Also, the 2017 Salary Guides by Robert Half shows rising demand for skilled professionals across a range of occupations in the United States. This would aid in increasing the demand for professional staffing service providers, thus widening revenue opportunities for Robert Half.Bottom Line Though delay in hiring process and weakness in Protiviti segment due to declining margins and fewer high-margin clients have dented the company’s overall profitability, the company’s ongoing technology and software upgrading initiatives are expected to improve the performance of its segments. Thereby, we believe the company will be able to take advantage of the rising demand for professional staffing services internationally, going ahead.Further, Robert Half carries a VGM Score of A, indicating its underlying strength. It is also observed that some of the key financial ratios of the company are higher than the industry levels, as depicted in the figure below.Moreover, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained stable at 69 cents over the past one month, ahead of the upcoming third-quarter results. The same also lies within the management’s guidance of 66-72 cents.Looking For More? Check These Three Picks Investors may also consider better-ranked stocks from the same sector such as Atento S.A.

62,BR,"Paychex Inc. (PAYX  -  Free Report) appears to be striving to capitalize on the rising opportunities in the professional employer organization (PEO) industry. In this regard, the payroll and human resource solutions provider recently acquired Charlotte, NC-based HR Outsourcing Holdings, Inc. (HROI) for an undisclosed amount.Founded in 2001, HROI is a well know name in the PEO industry, which, along with its subsidiaries, offers human resource solutions to small and medium-sized businesses in over 35 states across the U.S. Importance of HROI Buyout A PEO is a firm or company to which organizations can outsource their HR functions, including payroll and benefits administration. The benefits offered by a PEO make it a viable choice for organizations.The most important benefit is that an organization gets full administrative support without investing in technology and employees. Apart from this, a PEO takes care of all aspects of an employee’s tenure. Organizations get trained representatives who can better address their HR related matters. Moreover, the growing regulatory burden on small companies signifies that the need to outsource non-core activities is growing.Therefore, in our opinion, the acquisition is a strategic fit for Paychex as more and more companies are willing to use PEO services rather than creating their in-house HR management departments. Also, both the companies have similar target customers,  small and medium-sized businesses.As of May 31, 2017, Paychex had nearly 605,000 payroll clients but the market is still highly untapped. Per the company, there are about 12 million businesses in the U.S. under its total addressable market, half of which are still untapped.The recent buyout of HROI will expand its services, thereby helping it to add to its customer base.Bottom LineThe company’s initiatives to boost revenue growth through acquisitions are encouraging. Since its inception, the company has completed 13 acquisitions of which eight were under the leadership of current president and CEO, Martin Mucci.These buyouts have helped the company to expand its services as well as global reach, thereby boosting its revenues. Notably, in the last five fiscals, i.e. 2012 to 2017, the company has seen its revenues rise at a CAGR of 7.2%.Going ahead, one of the key secular growth drivers of Paychex is the demand for outsourcing. Human Resource Services outsourcing is a large, less-than-half-penetrated market that offers significant cost saving potential.The company seeks to capitalize on this opportunity by periodically introducing products and services for upselling to the client base and moving into the mid-market.However, for the last few months, payroll client growth has been affected by political uncertainty, which in turn is impacting outsourcing-decision making in the mid-market. This was highlighted by Paychex during its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 conference call.This makes us sceptical about the company’s near-term performance. Intense competition in the outsourcing space from major players like Automated Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Insperity (NSP  -  Free Report) could add to its woes.Paychex has underperformed the industry to which it belongs to in the last year. The stock has lost 8% of its value in the said period while the industry declined just 1.3%.Currently, Paychex carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A better-ranked stock in the same industry space is Broadridge Financial Solutions, Inc. (BR  -  Free Report) which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Management expects free cash flow in the range of $400–$450 million.Our TakeBroadridge reported modest fourth-quarter results. Year-over-year comparisons on both the counts were favorable driven by higher recurring revenues, internal growth, contribution from Net New Business, higher distribution revenues and acquisition-related synergies.We remain optimistic about Broadridge’s strategic acquisitions, product launches, share repurchase program and dividend paying initiatives. We also believe that the company’s close association with Accenture (ACN  -  Free Report) will be beneficial in the long run.However, competition from DST Systems Inc. and pricing pressure remain headwinds.Currently, Broadridge carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Another top-ranked stock worth considering in the broader technology sector is Applied Optoelectronics, Inc.

70,BR,"Investors often overlook sales growth while picking stocks, as a company’s stock price is generally sensitive to its earnings momentum. However, earnings are quite vulnerable in the sense that books can be easily cooked and inflated. That’s why sales must always be taken into consideration while making any investment decision.Sales growth is actually an important indicator of a company's health and ability to sustain its business. It provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power. The main advantage is that the sales figure is generally not manipulated and is less volatile than earnings.Without some top-line growth, the bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable in the long term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires sales growth.Focusing solely on sales growth is not enough though. A healthy sales growth rate is certainly a positive indicator for picking good stocks but it does not ensure profits. Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy.Substantial cash on hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Cash also enables a company to endure market downturns. Most importantly, a sufficient cash position indicates that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Selecting the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow more than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (four weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in stock price.Operating Margin (average last five years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits. A high ratio indicates that the company has good cost control and sales are increasing faster than costs, an optimal situation for the company.Return on Equity (ROE) greater than 5%: This metric will ensure that sales growth is translated into profits and the company is not hoarding cash. A high ROE means the company is spending wisely and is in all likelihood profitable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Here are five of the 14 stocks that qualified the screening:Based in New York, AMC Networks Inc.

71,BR,"A prudent investment decision involves buying well-performing stocks at the right time while selling those that are at risk. A rise in share price and strong fundamentals signal a stock’s bullish run.The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report) is a marketing and advertising services provider that has performed extremely well lately and has the potential to sustain the momentum in the near term. Consequently, if you haven’t taken advantage of the share price appreciation yet, it’s time you add the stock to your portfolio.What Makes Interpublic an Attractive Pick? An Outperformer: A glimpse of the company’s price trend reveals that the stock has had an impressive run on the bourse in the past six months. Shares of Interpublic have returned a massive 26.9%, which compares favorably with the industry’s gain of 7.1%. Solid Zacks Rank: Interpublic currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Thus, the company appears to be a compelling investment proposition at the moment.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Northward Estimate Revisions: The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Interpublic’s current-quarter earnings increased 13.5% to 42 cents per share. Estimates for 2018 increased 2.9% to $1.75 per share. For 2019, earnings have moved up 2.2% to $1.86 per share.Strong Growth Prospects: The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings indicates year-over-year growth of 24.1%. Moreover, earnings are expected to register 6.6% growth in 2019. The stock has long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 6.7%.Growth FactorsStrong Business Model Interpublic’s digital capabilities, diversified business model and geographic reach offer a distinctive competitive advantage. The company is expected to achieve targeted levels in the coming quarters based on diversification across emerging regions and collaboration/integration across agencies through technological improvement. Moreover, the company continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions to expand in high-growth regions and key world markets.Further, Interpublic looks strong on the back of higher organic revenue growth. In 2017, organic revenue growth of 1.8% was aided by growth across its major geographic regions, which was primarily a result of growth with existing clients. In the United States, organic growth was driven by its media and advertising disciplines. Internationally, organic increase can be attributed to strong growth within its media discipline, with remarkable contributions from Continental Europe and Other region, primarily Canada. In the first quarter, organic growth in the United States was 4.3% and 2.6% in international markets.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 3.6% increase in net revenues. It marked an improvement from 3.3% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Encouraging Balance SheetInterpublic has a strong balance sheet driven by the management’s prudent moves. Interpublic generated cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $791 million in 2017. The company generated $881.8 million of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $512.8 million in 2016 and $688.5 million in 2015. The significant amount of cash provides it the flexibility to pursue any growth strategy. The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed by Interpublic’s consistent efforts to return value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Interpublic paid dividends of $280.3 million, $238.4 million and $195.5 million,, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $300.1 million, $303.3 million and $285.2 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.On Feb 14, 2018, the company’s board of directors announced a 17% dividend hike, raising the quarterly cash dividend to 21 cents per share. The company also approved another $300 million share repurchase plan, while using $55 million to repurchase 2.4 million shares in the first quarter of 2018. The company still has 400 million left on its outstanding repurchase authorization.Such moves indicate the company’s commitment to create value for shareholders and underline its confidence in its business. These shareholder-friendly initiatives not only instill investors’ confidence but also positively impact earnings per share.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation (DNB  -  Free Report), Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report), and Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc.

The deal is expected to be closed in the second quarter of 2018, subject to pending regulatory approvals.The deal, expected to boost TransUnion’s healthcare solutions services, will see the integration of TransUnion Healthcare’s Revenue Protection solutions with HPS’ innovative technology.TransUnion Healthcare’s Revenue Protection solutions help hospitals and other similar healthcare service providers prevent revenue leakage by engaging patients early in the financial process, ensuring the payment of earned revenues through identification and maximization ofreimbursement opportunities and optimization of collection strategies. This helps to streamline the processes and reduce costs. The company has successfully recovered more than $3 billion in cash for its entire client base, while working with more than 1500 hospitals and health systems.To maximize reimbursements, HPS focuses on payment areas with superior technology and deep domain expertise - which act as the key driving factors. Medicare Bad Debt (MBD) helps in identifying reimbursable bad debts. Medicare Disproportionate Share (DSH) helps serve low-income patients and raise their DSH reimbursement with multiple data sources.  HPS also offers complementary services in the areas of Transfer Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRG) and Indirect Medical Education/Shadow Billing.  We believe HPS’s product portfolio will perfectly complement TransUnion Healthcare in enhancing its Revenue Protection solutions. The merged entity is expected to provide greater returns to both providers and patients, with raised reimbursements. Further, it will aid in improving the patient’s financial experience..Growing Healthcare Services SuiteThe market for Medicare reimbursement optimization is showing strong growth, contributing 20% to total healthcare expenditures in the United States. Greater patient financial responsibility, focus on cost management and regulatory supervision are acting as key driving factors, enabling healthcare providers to rely on data and analytical tools to better manage their revenue growth.In view of the significant commercial opportunity offered by the market for healthcare operations, we believe that the proposed buyout of HPS is a prudent move by the company aimed at strengthening its healthcare operations. TransUnion’s U.S. Information Services (USIS) and Healthcare operating segments are aggregated into its USIS reportable segment. Under USIS, Decision Services (20% of USIS revenue) – a sub unit – recorded year-over-year revenue growth in 2017 and 2016 due to growth in the healthcare industry. For 2017, decision services revenues increased $36.3 million compared with 2016.To make the maximum out of this growing healthcare business, TransUnion continues to look for strategic investments/acquisitions. In 2016, the company completed two acquisitions, RTech Healthcare Revenue Technologies, Inc. and Auditz, LLC, which enhanced its domestic healthcare offerings in areas of revenue protection and identification and recovery of payments.Zacks Rank & Price PerformanceCurrently, TransUnion is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.

73,BR,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Verisk Analytics, Inc.

As of Mar 31, 2018, Verisk’s three reportable segments: Insurance, Energy and Specialized Markets and Financial Services generated a respective 82%, 80% and 75% of revenues from subscriptions and long-term agreements for its solutions.Verisk’s operation in a large and diverse addressable market with low customer concentration helps mitigate operational risks. With high barriers to entry in the industry, Verisk also enjoys a dominant position.Advanced TechnologiesWe appreciate Verisk’s expertise in providing predictive data analytics decision by using advanced technologies to collect, interpret and analyze different types of data sets in real time and at scale. The company mainly uses advanced technologies such as the latest remote sensing and machine learning technologies along with cloud computing, which primarily drive the company’s business.

Such a deep technical prowess for analytics and Big Data provide it an unrivalled edge over its competitors. All these initiatives augur well for long-term growth and stability of the company.Strategic Acquisitions Acquisitions have also been one of the key growth catalysts for Verisk. The company has been continuously acquiring and investing in companies globally to expand its data and analytics capabilities across industries. From 2015-2017, the company completed 21 acquisitions. In 2018 so far, the company has acquired two companies — Business Insight Limited on Feb 21 and Marketview Limited on Jan 5. Both these buyouts will help Verisk in its predictive analytics and consumer spending analytics decision making.Verisk’s long-term business strategy includes growth through acquisitions. Internally, it is focused on evaluating and integrating acquisitions that are valuable for its shareholders. Further, acquisitions have contributed to its first-quarter 2018 earnings. The company continues to look for strategic acquisitions.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Verisk’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of share repurchases.

75,BR,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we focus on Omnicom Group Inc. (OMC  -  Free Report), a stock with an expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 5.8%. Moreover, its earnings are expected to register 10.8% and 7.4% growth, respectively, in 2018 and 2019.The company has outperformed the S&P 500 in the past six months. Shares of Omnicom have gained 7.4% compared with the S&P 500’s rally of 4.9% in the said time frame. We believe the stock has the potential to exceed expectations moving ahead. The reasons behind our optimism include the company’s higher organic growth and benefits from strategic investments, acquisitions and expansion efforts.Robust Organic GrowthWe appreciate Omnicom’s continuous focus on its internal development initiatives. To increase efficiency, the company has been making internal investments in its agencies and back office operations. It has also raised its internal investments in data, analytics and precision marketing. Driven by such positives, we expect Omnicom to witness higher revenues on the back of organic growth.Notably, in first-quarter 2018, organic growth resulted in a 2.4% increase in total revenues. It marked an improvement from 1.6% organic growth in fourth-quarter 2017. Further, the company expects organic growth to positively impact revenues by 2-3% in 2018.Growing Digital and Analytical CapabilitiesOmnicom is expanding its suite in the areas of digital and analytical capabilities by investing in agencies and partnering with innovative technology companies in key markets.On Apr 16, 2018, Omnicom’s media services division, Omnicom Media Group announced a partnership with IRI. Per the deal, IRI will serve as a preferred consumer packaged goods (CPG) data provider for Omnicom Media Group’s data and analytics division, Annalect. In Germany, Omnicom media group acquired Brain Group, a digitally-focused agency for media planning, marketing and transformation consulting and content creation.Omnicom’s operations are diversified across technology platforms, thus lowering its dependence on any one product in these dynamic technological markets. The company’s efforts to stay technologically updated to meet varying customer and client demands in areas of digital media, data as well as analytics look impressive.

This has helped Omnicom build cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments balance of $3.79 billion in 2017. The company’s cash position has improved considerably in the past few years. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, the company had $3.02 billion, $2.62 billion and $2.39 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively.The company generated $2.02 billion of cash from operating activities in 2017 compared with $1.95 billion in 2016.

The company’s strong cash flow generating abilities make it a value buy for investors.Shareholder-Friendly MovesWe are impressed with Omnicom’s consistent record of returning value to shareholders in the form of dividend and share repurchases. Omnicom paid dividends of $515.2 million, $505.4 million and $496.7 million to its shareholders, respectively in 2017, 2016 and 2015. The company repurchased shares amounting to $568.4 million, $602.2 million and $727.5 million, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

76,BR,"The first-quarter reporting cycle has seen strong earnings and revenue growth, which is expected to reach its highest level in seven years.According to the latest Earnings Outlook, S&P 500 members from the Business Services sector have already reported financial numbers and recorded top- and bottom-line growth of 22.5% and 6.8%, respectively in the first quarter of 2018. The report also states that 80.8% surpassed revenue estimates and 88.5% outperformed on the earnings front.The sector benefited from a strong U.S. economy, reduced tax rates, robust manufacturing and non-manufacturing activities, easing of the U.S. dollar and momentum in oil prices. Notably, it has performed well in the past year compared with the benchmark. It has gained 25.3%, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s rally of 19.9% in the said time frame.Given this backdrop, let’s do a comparative analysis of two Business - Information Services stocks - TransUnion (TRU  -  Free Report) and The Dun & Bradstreet (DNB  -  Free Report). Both companies reported better-than-expected first-quarter 2018 results with year-over-year earnings and revenue growth.As both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), we are using certain other parameters to find out which company is better positioned following their earnings release. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Price PerformanceTransUnion clearly scores over Dun & Bradstreet in this regard. TransUnion has gained 65.7% in the past year, massively outperforming the industry’s rally of 28.8%. Dun & Bradstreet, on the other hand, has underperformed the industry with a gain of 17.9%.Earnings Estimate Revisions The direction of estimate revisions serves as an important pointer when it comes to the price of a stock. Based on second quarter and full year earnings estimate revisions in the last 60 days, TransUnion is better placed. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter earnings increased 5.3% for TransUnion against a decrease of 0.7% for Dun & Bradstreet. For 2018, estimates for TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet have increased 5.2% and 4.3%, respectively.Earnings ExpectationsEarnings growth along with stock price gains is often an indication of a company’s strong prospects. TransUnion’s second-quarter earnings are projected to grow 27.7% while that of Dun & Bradstreet are expected to increase 7.1%.  Looking at the full year 2018 picture, TransUnion’s earnings are projected to grow 29.4% while that of Dun & Bradstreet are expected to increase 15.1%.  Thus, TransUnion has an edge over Dun & Bradstreet in terms of quarterly and yearly projected earnings growth.Net Margin Net profit margin helps investors evaluate a company’s business model in terms of pricing policy, cost structure and operating efficiency, and shows how good it is at converting revenues into profits. Hence, a strong net profit margin is preferred by all classes of investors.Even though readings for both the companies compare unfavorably with the industry’s figure of 19.3%, TransUnion has a lead since its TTM net margin is higher at 17.6%, compared with Dun & Bradstreet’s 16%.ValuationThe Price to Earnings Ratio (P/E) metric is used to measure a company's value relative to its earnings. In general, a lower number or multiple is usually considered better than a higher one.The trailing 12-month price-to-earnings multiple for TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet is 37 and 16.4, respectively, while that of the industry is 26.8. Dun & Bradstreet has an edge with a lower P/E ratio and is undervalued relative to the industry.The EV/EBITDA metric is used to compare two stocks within the same industry and offers a clearer picture of a company’s valuation because it includes debt. The ratio is often used in addition to the P/E ratio.We observe that while TransUnion and Dun & Bradstreet have EV/EBITDA ratios of 23.7 and 8.7 respectively, the industry’s figure stands at 17.4. Thus, Dun & Bradstreet is better positioned with a lower EV/EBITDA value and is undervalued relative to the industry.TransUnion is overvalued relative to the industry in terms of both the metrics.Bottom LineOur comparative analysis shows that TransUnion scores over Dun & Bradstreet in terms of net margin, expected earnings growth and earnings estimate revisions. Its share price performance over the past year has also been relatively better. Dun & Bradstreet has an edge solely in terms of valuation.So, even though TransUnion seems expensive compared to Dun & Bradstreet, it is likely to generate higher capital appreciation.Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader Business Services sector include Automatic Data Processing (ADP  -  Free Report) and Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report), each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.The long-term expected earnings per share growth rates for Automatic Data Processing and Broadridge are 11% and 10%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

77,BR,"Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP  -  Free Report) stock has rallied a massive 28.9% in the past year, outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 13.7%. The company is well poised on the back of strategic acquisitions and strong cash generation ability. ADP’s focus on streamlining its business is a positive as this should strengthen its core operations in the long run. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, ADP posted impressive results with earnings and revenues surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increasing on a year-over-year basis.Adjusted earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents and increased 16% year over year. Revenues came in at $3.69 billion, outpacing the consensus mark by $26 million.

Through acquisitions like WorkMarket (in January 2018), Global Cash Card (in October 2017) and The Marcus Buckingham Company (in January 2017), the company has not only gained new customers but has also been able to expand its operations in international markets. We believe that the company will continue to pursue acquisitions that strategically fit its overall business mix and are easy to integrate over the long term.Business Improvement InitiativesADP has been continuously taking up initiatives to streamline its business. We believe this should help the company strengthen its core operations in the long run. In tune with this strategy, in the past few years, the company has divested a number of divisions including AdvancedMD, Procure-to-Pay business, Dealer Services, Occupational Health and Safety services and Taxware Enterprise Service.Strong Cash PositionThe company exited third-quarter fiscal 2018 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion.

79,BR,"A prudent investment decision involves buying stocks that have solid prospects and selling those that carry risks. At times, it is rational to hold certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions.Here we discuss about Genpact (G  -  Free Report), a stock that has rallied 19.6% over the past year. The company has expected long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10%. The company’s strong prospects in the artificial intelligence (AI) space and benefits from strategic acquisitions are impressive.Let’s delve deeper in to Genpact’s key growth drivers.Acquisition a Key Growth StrategyGenpact is very active on the acquisition front. We believe that the buyouts of TandemSeven, BrightClaim and Rage Frameworks in 2017 are helping the company to expand product portfolio and gain new domain expertise.In fact, the addition of TandemSeven’s core design thinking process to Genpact’s AI platform is likely to help the latter become more customer-oriented company. Acquisition of BrightClaim and their associated company, National Vendor, should also strengthen Genpact’s insurance claims management expertise.Meanwhile, Rage Frameworks buyout expanded Genpact’s capability to provide AI offerings across industries, such as consumer packaged goods, industrial engineering, life-sciences and high-tech.Genpact’s other notable acquisitions include LeaseDimensions, Endeavour Software, Strategic Sourcing Excellence (SSE), PNMSoft Limited, Hitachi Management and Pharmalink Consulting. These buyouts have helped the company in expanding its presence in mobile technology, dynamic workflow solution, life sciences and banking operations. These, in turn, have driven customer base and top-line growth.Genpact Limited Revenue (TTM) Genpact Limited Revenue (TTM) | Genpact Limited QuoteArtificial Intelligence: Big OpportunityArtificial Intelligence presents significant growth opportunity for Genpact. Of late, the  company launched artificial intelligence (AI) platform — Genpact Cora — an automation to AI-based platform that combines its proprietary automation, analytics, and AI technologies into a single common platform.  This latest platform has a modular, interconnected network of technologies that enables clients to better tackle specific operational business challenges.Genpact Cora is also helping the company to provide related offerings to industries like consumer-packaged goods, industrial engineering, life sciences and high tech. Acquisitions of Rage Framework and design thinking based companies, like Tandem Seven have also expanded the company’s AI product portfolio.Per an IDC report, worldwide spending on cognitive systems and AI is estimated to touch $52.2 billion in 2021 at a CAGR of 46.2%. We believe that Genpact is well positioned to take advantage of the projected improvement in the AI space.Strong Clientele a BoonGenpact has a strong clientele across the world. The company serves almost one fifth of the Global Fortune 500, including Boeing, Citigroup, GlaxoSmithKline, Wells Fargo, Ironshore, Mondelez, PayPal and Abbott. We note that the Global Client base has improved rapidly over the last five years (2012-2017). Revenues from this group have increased at a healthy CAGR of 12% in this time frame to reach $2.47 billion in 2017.Moreover, Global Clients (as a percentage of total revenues) increased from approximately 75% in 2012 to approximately 90% in 2017. We believe that Genpact’s expertise in providing BPO services might continue to expand customer base in the long run.Bottom LineDespite riding on significant growth prospects, Genpact is not free from overhangs. High indebtedness resulting from frequent acquisitions and significant client concentration in terms of geographic location (North America) are threats. However, we believe that acquisitions, strong clientele and growth in AI space bode well for the company in long term.Genpacthas a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

80,BR,"Have you been paying attention to shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding (BAH  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 2.6% over the past month. BAH hit a new 52-week high of $41.16 in the previous session. Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has gained 7.1% since the start of the year compared to the 9.8% move for the Business Services sector and the 0% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 5, 2018, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding reported EPS of $0.48 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43.For the current fiscal year, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding is expected to post earnings of $2.44 per share on $6.21 billion in revenues. Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $2.77 per share on $6.56 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 25.77% and 5.53%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile BAH has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding has a Value Score of B. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 16.8X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 18.2X versus its peer group's average of 14.8X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.63. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation Price and Consensus | Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corporation QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Booz Allen Hamilton Holding currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Booz Allen Hamilton Holding passes the test. Thus, it seems as though BAH shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of Booz Allen Hamilton Holding have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also solid potential picks, including Maximus (MMS  -  Free Report), Broadridge Financial Solutions (BR  -  Free Report), and Dun & Bradstreet (DNB  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 1% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for BAH, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.
