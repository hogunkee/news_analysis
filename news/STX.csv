2,STX,"The U.S.-China trade war started with the Trump administration accusing China of unfair practices related to the forced transfer of American technology and intellectual property. But U.S. tech companies are seeing little impact so far from the trade dispute as the U.S. on Friday imposed the first round of tariffs on Chinese goods.The U.S. is imposing an additional duty of 25% on about $34 billion worth of Chinese imports covering 818 products. The list does not include products commonly purchased by U.S. consumers such as mobile phones or televisions. It targets mostly products that are part of the ""Made in China 2025"" industrial policy. That policy includes industries such as aerospace, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles.The list of Chinese products impacted includes engines, motors, generators, furnaces, pumps, compressors, machine tools, and manufacturing, construction and agricultural equipment. It also includes aircraft and aircraft parts, cars, trucks, oil and gas drilling gear, television cameras and broadcast gear.China retaliated on Friday with 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. products, mostly agricultural goods. The impacted U.S. goods include grains, corn, soybeans, meat, fish, dairy, nuts, fruits and vegetables, alcohol and tobacco. China's levies also cover U.S.-made autos.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe U.S. is planning a second wave of tariffs covering 284 Chinese goods worth about $16 billion, but does not have an implementation date yet.""While tariffs on both sides should have limited direct head wind to IT (information technology) hardware and semiconductor companies, there are a few ways for U.S.-China trade wars to impact companies,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Friday.For instance, companies that procure components and materials from China could see an uptick in their costs, he said.U.S. technology companies also could be subject to retaliatory actions by the Chinese government, Daryanani said. Memory-chip maker Micron Technology (MU) losing a patent infringement case in a Chinese court this week could be a result of the trade disputes, he said. Micron stock was up fractionally 53.23 at the close.Also, China has held up chipmaker Qualcomm's (QCOM) acquisition of NXP Semiconductors (NXPI). That deal has been ""in limbo 17 months and counting,"" Daryanani said. Shares of both were up fractionally in afternoon trades Friday.While the first wave of Chinese products subject to U.S. import tariffs includes computer hard disk drives, U.S. data storage systems vendors Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) should see minimal impact, he said.The impact will be ""manageable and transitory"" given that Seagate and Western Digital also have factories outside of China, he said. Seagate stock was off 2 cents to 58.59 while Western added 0.6% to end the regular trading session at 77.93.If the trade conflict lingers, though, it could impact the U.S. tech industry in other ways. President Donald Trump has threatened to block Chinese investment in U.S. companies.That could cut off investment capital being used to fund such things as electric and self-driving vehicles. U.S. firms like Tesla (TSLA) could be impacted. Tesla stock slipped marginally to close at 308.90.RELATED:Trump Tariffs Go Live; Still One Chance To Avert Brutal China Trade WarMicron Says China Injunction Will Impact Only 1% Of RevenueChina Approves Marvell Acquisition Of Cavium As Chip Stocks StruggleWhat's Next In Trump's China Trade War?

4,STX,"Western Digital (WDC) stock broke out to a multi-year high Wednesday as a confluence of recent events appears to have emboldened Wall Street, which has given the disk-drive maker a slew of price-target increases in recent days and weeks.X The largest manufacturer of disk drives and a leading provider of flash-memory chips, Western Digital shares are up for the fifth straight day, and its stock was up 1.6% to close at 95.27 on the stock market today. Helping its cause, Western Digital has reported five quarters in a row of double or triple-digit earnings growth, and recently settled a spat with Japan's Toshiba over the sale of a flash memory business.Among those singing the company's praises has been Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rikesh. Rikesh in early February raised his price target on Western Digital to 110 from 105, with a buy rating. He noted that major users of memory have reported earnings, and a drop in iPhone projected sales has helped sales of so-called NAND flash memory, which Western Digital markets.Rikesh said that ""NAND pricing has held steady, pointing to strong fundamentals for (Western Digital) combined with, as we noted prior, a constructive settlement with Toshiba.""Christian Schwab, an analyst at Craig Hallum, on Tuesday raised his price target on Western Digital to 120 from 110. He maintained a buy rating, citing lowered interest expense at Western Digital and improved capital structure. The company recently restructured its debt to more favorable terms.Late last month, Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy resumed coverage on Western Digital with a buy rating and a price target of 105. Cassidy is optimistic about Western Digital's disk drive business and the recent joint venture agreement with Toshiba, which ended a lengthy battle over a previous joint venture. Cassidy also resumed coverage of Seagate Technology (STX) with a hold rating and price target of 49.

Shares of Seagate Technology were up 0.1% to 56.30.IBD'S TAKE: Shares of Western Digital broke out of a three-and-a-half-month base in strong volume, with a buy point of 93.41. The stock on Wednesday hit a level not seen since May 2015.

5,STX,"Snoop Dogg, Sir Patrick Stewart and a large British tobacco company: all vaguely in the same news story, thanks to an investment deal announced late Wednesday that an analyst called Big Tobacco's ""most significant"" attempt yet to gain exposure to the marijuana industry.Imperial Brands Ventures, a subsidiary of U.K. tobacco giant Imperial Brands (IMBBY), and Snoop Dogg's venture capital firm, Casa Verde Capital, said they are investing in Oxford Cannabinoid Technologies, a British medical marijuana research firm backed by Stewart of ""Star Trek"" and ""X-Men"" fame.The decision by Imperial, whose cigarette brands include Winston and Kool, comes roughly a year after the company appointed the chairman of a medical cannabis company to its board. It also comes amid flagging demand for cigarettes, and on the heels of the FDA's approval this week of Epidiolex, a cannabis-based drug from GW Pharmaceuticals (GWPH).""We are pleased to be partnering with OCT,"" Matthew Phillips, Imperial Brands' chief development officer, said in a statement on Wednesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of Use""Cannabinoid products have significant potential and our investment enables Imperial to support OCT's important research while building a deeper understanding of the medical cannabis market,"" he continued.Earlier this year, an Imperial spokesman told IBD that the tobacco company was ""tracking developments in what is a fast-growing (cannabis) segment.""Oxford said in Wednesday's statement that it had secured investments from Imperial Brands Ventures and Casa Verde and others as part of a Series A funding round. Oxford will use the funds to set up a strategic research partnership and a laboratory in Europe.The company, founded in 2017, intends to fund research surrounding cannabinoids in academic institutions internationally.""With indications ranging from pain and inflammation to cancer and neurological disorders, OCT has commissioned research in many critical areas,"" the statement said.Cowen analyst Vivien Azer, in a research note on Thursday, said Imperial's investment was ""the most significant move among the global tobacco players in the cannabis industry to date. We continue to expect to see more activity in cannabis from both global tobacco and global alcohol.""Last year, Imperial appointed Simon Langelier, the chairman of PharmaCielo, a Canadian medical cannabis company, to its board. The spokesman for Imperial told IBD this year that the company appointed Langelier largely due to his three-decade stint at Philip Morris International. However, the spokesman added that Langelier's cannabis background was not ""irrelevant,"" either.Some analysts believe that the quickly growing — and destigmatizing — marijuana industry presents more of an opportunity for tobacco firms than alcohol.""Vaping is one of the fastest-growing segments in both nicotine and cannabis,"" Azer said in 2016. ""Upon federal legalization, Big Tobacco could leverage its expertise to explore the legal cannabis market through vapor.""Still, tobacco stocks like Altria Group (MO) and British American Tobacco (BTI) crashed two months ago after Philip Morris International (PMI) turned in weak first-quarter sales and weaker-than-expected demand for so-called ""reduced-risk"" devices.Turning Point Brands (TPB), which owns rolling-paper-maker Zig-Zag, has expressed excitement about pot legalization in Canada and the cannabis industry broadly. Philip Morris International planned to invest around $20 million in an Israeli company that makes a cannabis inhaler, according to reports in 2016.Imperial Brands rose 2.8% in over-the-counter U.S. trading.

10,STX,"Shares of disk drive company Seagate Technology (STX) were flying Monday, reportedly due to its early investment in a cryptocurrency called Ripple that has soared in value, though it was sinking on Monday.X A May 2015 report from blockchain news provider CoinDesk said Seagate invested in digital payment network company Ripple Labs in May 2015 in order to become an ""active participant"" in blockchain technology.A wave of venture capital investment is pouring into blockchain technology startups. Ripple Labs was founded in 2012 and uses the Ripple protocol and its own native digital currency, called XRP as a way to move money internationally. Ripple says it has more than 100 customers using its technology.The CoinDesk article, quoting a Seagate senior executive at the time, said Seagate was a participant in a $28 million Series A fundraising announced in May 2015. It said Seagate's business model ""would seem to lend itself to two popular use cases for blockchain technology: the ability to move payments and the ability to track the positioning of its supply chain.""Fortune reported that financial services company Bloomberg, in December, had made XRP one of just four cryptocurrencies it provides pricing data for on its terminal service. The others are Bitcoin, Ether, and Litecoin, lending new legitimacy to the currency.The Ripple currency was introduced in 2013 and initially traded for pennies. But its value soared in the summer as Bitcoin began to surge. According to CoinMarketCap, the trading value of Ripple was down 31% Monday, trading at 2.34. In comparison, Bitcoin was trading at 14.784, down 12%.Seagate shares surged 7.2% to close at 46 on the stock market today.

Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, so you can know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.According to Value Street Research, Seagate invested in the Series A and Series B of Ripple Labs, owner of 61% of XRP. Value Street says Ripple holdings of XRP are currently worth about $180 billion on the market. In addition to the $28 million Series A funding round, Seagate also invested in a $55 million Series B rounds of Ripple.Value Street estimated, as of this morning, that Seagate's investment in Ripple was valued at approximately $7.8 billion, or roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of the company, assuming Seagate has not cashed out its investments in Ripple.According to CoinMarketCap, there are currently 100 billion total XRP in existence, of which Ripple owns 61 billion. Value Street said.The meteoric rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ripple has done more than make some investors rich overnight.

Western Digital acquired a stake in the business, resulting from its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition.Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges.Western Digital has worked to acquire the Toshiba unit to fortify its strong and growing presence in the memory-chip market — chips that are used broadly in smartphones, memory cards, USB drives, solid-state drives, digital cameras and other devices. In addition to being a competitive force in chips, Western Digital is also the world's largest manufacturer of disk drives, competing against Seagate Technology (STX)Western Digital has fought legal battles against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property and prevent the chip unit from falling into the hands of competitors. That includes Broadcom (AVGO), which reportedly bid on the unit. Broadcom is a leading manufacturer of chips used in wireless and broadband communication.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 95 out of a possible 99. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.The Bain Capital/SK Hynix group had previously been selected by Toshiba as the winning bidder. That deal collapsed under heavy legal pressure by Western Digital.Western Digital implied it might continue legal action, in a statement issued late Tuesday.""It is surprising that Toshiba would continue to pursue a transaction with a consortium led by Korea-based SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan without SanDisk's consent,"" Western Digital said in a prepared statement. ""The language in the relevant joint venture agreements is unambiguous, and multiple courts have ruled in favor of protecting SanDisk's contractual rights. We remain confident in our ability to protect our joint venture interests and consent rights.""It said ""arbitration requests"" are on file and continue to move forward in the ICC International Court of Arbitration.The other group bidding for the unit is a consortium led by manufacturing giant Foxconn that includes Apple.RELATED:Toshiba Agrees To Talk With Western Digital Over Disputed Chip DealWestern Digital Seeks To Block Toshiba Chip Sale Via Arbitration

44,STX,"Seagate Technology (STX) was downgraded and had its price target cut by a Wall Street analyst following a review of market conditions that raised red flags.XFBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi on Monday downgraded Seagate to sector perform from outperform and cut his price target to 32 from 40.Seagate shares fell 3.3% to close at 30.95 on the stock market today.Seagate competes primarily with Western Digital (WDC) in the disk drive market. Western Digital also has a large business in chip-based storage technology. Western Digital shares were up 0.4%, near 87.38.The Seagate downgrade follows comments from disk-drive component suppliers that include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL), suggesting tough times ahead in disk drives.In its Aug. 24 quarterly earnings call, Broadcom said strong growth in its disk drive business for enterprise customers currently is not sustainable and expects a sharp decline in demand, ""driven by the start of an anticipated correction in the disk drive market,"" Seyrafi wrote in a note to clients. Enterprise business customers accounted for 37% of Seagate sales and a high percentage of its profits in the last quarter.Marvell also made comments on its quarterly earnings conference call on Aug. 24 that presented a ""cautious view of disk drive demand in the near-term,"" wrote Seyrafi. Marvell said that there were some inventory issues and factory transitions with a few major customers. Disk drive inventories are also above average, which raises concerns about pricing, said Seyrafi.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.Seyrafi also said industry trends favor Micron Technology (MU), a leading provider of DRAM chips uses in chip-based storage systems.""We believe that current consensus estimates for Seagate are too high and need to be lowered,"" Seyrafi wrote. ""We believe that investors should consider moving out of Seagate and into Micron."" He said Micron is benefiting from healthy demand for the rise in chip-based storage systems, ""which are increasingly displacing disk drives.""On Monday, Seyrafi initiated coverage of Micron with an outperform rating and price target of 45.He said Micron ""is a prime beneficiary of the tremendous amount of consolidation in the DRAM space over the past 10 years,"" as the top-three DRAM suppliers — Micron, Samsung, and SK Hynix, have grown their combined DRAM revenue share to 95% from less than 60% in 2007.Micron shares jumped 3.3% to close at 33.44.Western Digital reported strong quarterly results in late July that beat on the bottom line, while Seagate reported quarterly results that missed expectations, causing shares to tumble.RELATED:Western Digital Close To Acquiring Toshiba Chip Unit After Tough Fight

46,STX,"A lengthy and contentious battle may soon come to a close, as a second Japanese newspaper has reported that a group led by Western Digital (WDC) won the bidding for a Toshiba memory-chip unit, for about $18.2 billion.A win by Western Digital would fortify its strong and growing presence in the memory-chip market — chips that are used broadly in smartphones, memory cards, USB drives, solid-state drives, digital cameras and other devices. In addition to being a competitive force in chips, Western Digital is also the world's largest manufacturer of disk drives, competing against Seagate Technology (STX).Toshiba denied the report on Tuesday by Japan media group Nikkan Kogyo that said Western Digital won the bidding process. Reuters is reporting that Toshiba now favors a group led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan to buy its prized semiconductor business, after failing to bridge key gaps with Western Digital.Western Digital shares were up 1.6% to 88.78 in the stock market today.Toshiba is under heavy pressure to sell the chip unit, in order to cover massive losses from its nuclear division and avoid having its stock delisted from Japan's stock exchanges. Toshiba also denied an earlier report from Asahi Shimbun, a widely respected newspaper in Japan, that also said Western Digital had won the bidding process. Western Digital has not commented on the reports.Western Digital gained a stake in the Toshiba unit as a result of its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition. Western Digital has fought legal battles against Toshiba to prevent any deal that did not have its consent, in order to preserve intellectual property, among other reasons.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital holds a strong IBD Composite Rating of 94 out of a possible 99, and recently moved above its 50-day moving average, which can be a positive sign. There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing.The Western Digital group includes private equity firm KKR, a public/private Japanese group called Innovation Network, and the Development Bank of Japan.Apple (AAPL) is said to be involved with the SK Hynix and Bain Capital  group.The other group bidding for the unit is a consortium led by manufacturing giant Foxconn that includes Apple.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a report to clients late Monday said he thinks Western Digital will end up with a minority stake in the unit, with its Japanese partners holding a minority position.""We think the outcome is a positive for Western Digital,"" Daryanani wrote.The Toshiba unit would boost Western Digital's access to a large and growing category of memory chips called NAND flash and also prevent a ""significantly worse scenario"" of the unit going to competitors, Daryanani wrote. NAND flash consumption has exploded over the last 5 years.Daryanani has an outperform rating on Western Digital and a price target of 115.RELATED:Toshiba Agrees To Talk With Western Digital Over Disputed Chip DealWestern Digital Seeks To Block Toshiba Chip Sale Via Arbitration

47,STX,"Americans want smarter devices, homes, factories and cities, so STMicroelectronics (STM) has remade itself to deliver the smarts.One of Europe's largest semiconductor companies, STMicro is growing with red-hot demand for the chips needed for intelligent devices. Some on Wall Street seem convinced the outlook is promising for the venerable, 30-year-old Swiss firm whose stock struggled for more than a decade and a half following the dot-com boom and bust.""The outlook for 2018 is pretty much a historical high,"" Tristan Gerra, a semiconductor analyst for R.W. Baird, told Investor's Business Daily.""(STMicro) has methodically shut down businesses losing money or just breaking even, such as memory chips and cellphone chips,"" Gerra said. ""Now the result is you have a company that is much leaner that only has products that are profitable.""STMicro has benefited from relentless smartphone innovations, connected home devices and wearable tech gadgets, as well as emerging opportunities in the automotive and industrial sectors.A massive shift toward greener, safer and self-driving cars is one powerful engine of growth. The industrial Internet of Things — which connects machines to one another and the cloud, while harnessing the power of Big Data analytics to make factories more efficient — is another.STMicro stock has vaulted 125% in the past year. That is more than three times the return of the PHLX SOX Semiconductor Sector Index — dominated by U.S. giants Nvidia (NVDA), Intel (INTC) and Qualcomm (QCOM) — over the same period.Gerra believes STMicro stock has room to run despite the monster moves it already has made, rising to levels not seen in a decade. He has a price target of 20, which represents an upside of roughly 14%. Shares climbed into buy territory Thursday and have kept climbing since then. Shares ended the regular trading session Tuesday up 1.7% to 17.77.STMicro's surging profits and margins come as the firm has raised its capital expenditures to $1.25 billion to $1.3 billion, citing new products and higher demand, while alluding to design wins. Many investors and analysts understand the latter to mean the eagerly awaited 10th anniversary iPhone from Apple (AAPL).STMicro's 3D sensors are expected to power the upcoming iPhone's standout new feature: advanced facial-recognition technologies that may allow users to unlock devices and authenticate payments in a more seamless way, experts say.Improving fundamentals and a robust product portfolio make the stock ""well-positioned for a continued recovery with significantly less cyclicality going forward,"" Gerra said in a recent note, while highlighting the potential for further revenue momentum.Analyst views call for STMicro earnings to more than quadruple to 83 cents a share for fiscal 2017 from 19 cents for 2016, according to Zacks Investment Research. For 2018, that's projected to reach $1.10 a share, then rise to $1.16 in 2019, Zacks says.STMicro holds one of the broadest product portfolios in the chipmaking industry, according to investment research firm Morningstar Inc. And the firm is seeing strong growth in bookings across all its product lines and global regions.""We are firing on all cylinders,"" STMicro Executive Vice President Bob Krysiak told IBD. ""We have great pipelines in smartphones, automotives and across the mass-market space.""Besides Apple, major customers include Cisco (CSCO), Seagate (STX) and Western Digital (WDC), as well as Asian smartphone makers Huawei and Samsung. Its products end up in everything from cars and smartphones to drones, welding equipment, solar kits, thermostats and consumer electronics.Its micro-mirror MEMS chips in the Amazon (AMZN) Echo Look and near field communication (NFC) chips in the Samsung Galaxy S8 show how the company is innovating and pursuing new lines of growth, according to Gerra. NFC chips allow smart devices to talk to one another when brought physically together, such as pay card readers.The smartphone remains king for the company, notwithstanding slowing sales across the industry.""It's a big market that continues to innovate every year,"" Krysiak said. ""Smartphone makers depend on us suppliers to provide the innovation.""STMicro has been making strategic moves in this segment. Abandoning its dated Nokia and Blackberry businesses years ago, it switched its focus to phone sensors, power management, security, NFC and other wireless technologies.Its FlightSense technology opens the door to the next generation of proximity sensors. For instance, it helps smartphone cameras focus automatically with much greater accuracy.The biggest opportunities may still be ahead. Smartphones have assumed a role as a central device in the larger Internet of Things, becoming as indispensable to industrial end markets as to the average consumer, Krysiak says.IBD'S TAKE: As IBD Stock Checkup notes, STMicro's stellar ratings for Earnings Per Share growth and Relative Price Strength help it earn a spot among the top five stocks in its industry group.Other massive opportunities are seen in autos and factories. The company has gone well beyond its traditional supplies to the automotive industry.Its positioning and car-to-car communication technologies are making self-driving cars possible. It has partnered with Israeli vision-tech pioneer Mobileye (MBLY) on groundbreaking active safety systems. And with vehicles becoming ""almost an internet device,"" in Krysiak's words, and electrified powertrains on the rise, the silicon content of cars has ballooned.STMicro calls these emerging automotive trends ""smart driving"" and now averages 36 parts per vehicle produced in the world, up from 24 just a few years ago.""Smart driving is just starting,"" said Krysiak, who believes the opportunity lies not just in intelligent vehicles themselves, but the entire infrastructure — of power charging systems, parking structures and the like — needed to leverage all that processing power.STMicro also is infusing technology into a sector sometimes viewed as boring — industrials.STMicro chips have made data centers more energy efficient, helped robots become more situation-aware and precise, and brought augmented reality and touchless interfaces to industrial assets.""The last bastion of change in the digitization of everything will be the factory floor,"" Krysiak said. ""We are bringing our vision systems and processing systems there, all leveraging cloud-computing technologies.""STMicro posted net revenue of $6.97 billion in 2016. It spent roughly 19% of that on R&D investments, amid cutthroat industry competition to keep rolling out what the firm describes as ""significantly cheaper, smaller, faster, more reliable and embedded"" products.For fiscal 2017, STMicro is targeting $8 billion in revenue and is now guiding to the high end of its previous forecast range of 12.5%-15.5% growth.While many analysts regard STMicro as a well-diversified company with some unique products, they see challenges too. Baird's Gerra notes that it remains a somewhat cyclical company, since it has a manufacturing component.Slowing car sales in the U.S. and China — two of the biggest automotive markets — are a potential challenge in the future too.Morningstar analyst Brian Colello also sees risks tied to STMicro's in-house manufacturing, with the need for further research reinvestments and ongoing capital expenditures potentially weighing on profits.He raises yellow flags about other aspects of its operations.There are concerns about STMicro's ""ownership by the French and Italian governments, which raises doubts as to whether it is truly focused on operating efficiency,"" he wrote in a recent report.Finally, STMicro hasn't developed a massive scale advantage given its size, with gross margins and operating profits ""below those of other successful pure-play analog chipmakers,"" Colello said.RELATED:Stocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksThe New AmericaChip Stocks & Semiconductor Industry News And Analysis

57,STX,"In a very busy week for news, stocks rallied solidly. Markets worldwide cheered the results of the first round of France's presidential election. Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting.

Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion.

Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates.

Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated.

Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views.

Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators.

The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day.

The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) fell below their 50-day lines as well.

The market uptrend, for now, remains under pressure with five distribution days marked over the past 25 sessions for the 500.U.S. government bonds, meanwhile, edged lower and the 10-year Treasury yield rose to nearly 2.42%, according to Tradeweb, following a slight upward adjustment to the Q4 growth in U.S. GDP to 2.1% vs. a prior revised print of 1.9%. Strong consumer spending helped boost imports.The 10-year yield has swum within a relatively tight range of around 2.3% to 2.6% since December.Back to stocks, on the upside, banking, finance, farm equipment and building-related groups excelled with gains of well more than 1%. Techs also rallied. Data storage giant Western Digital (WDC) bolted more than 3% in strong turnover to 83.72, surpassing a new flat-base entry point of 81.77.Notice on an IBD daily chart that Western's relative strength line is charging into new high ground. Western Digital's up/down volume ratio is at 1.4, well above the neutral 1.0 level, and the Accumulation/Distribution Rating of B+ suggests strong accumulation by institutions.Western Digital sports an excellent 97 Composite Rating from IBD Stock Checkup on a scale of 1 to 99, and the data storage group enjoys an excellent No. 7 ranking among 197 industries ranked each day by IBD.Western had suffered a severe decline that finally ended with shares hitting bottom at 34.99 in May 2016, more than 69% below an all-time peak of 114.69. But after the Nov. 8 U.S. elections, the Irvine, Calif., company broke the long-term downtrend with a strong move past the 60 price level.Aggressive investors could have bought even earlier.On Sept. 16, Western gapped up 3.1% to 54.94 in robust turnover, 89% above its 50-day average. In so doing, the stock cleared a 54.51 entry in a seven-week cup with handle. Notice on the daily chart that the handle met the minimum length of five days. Plus, the stock had broken out after it had rallied back above the 50- and 200-day moving averages.However. it would have been totally understandable to have passed on this breakout attempt. While 54.94 was sharply higher than the recent low of 34.99, Western still down sharply off its then 52-week high of 86.39. Industry peer Seagate Technology (STX) is staging its sixth gain in seven sessions, rising more than 2% to 46.91. Shares are finding support at the 50-day line, a bullish sign.Seagate also sports enviable ratings from IBD, including a 92 RS Rating, meaning that over the past 12 months, it's outperformed 92% of all public companies. FY 2017 profit is expected to rebound 99% to $4.49 a share. Keep in mind that the data storage companies tend to show volatile earnings swings. In FY 2016, ended in June, Seagate's profit fell 50% to $2.26 a share.RELATED:Managing A Stock Portfolio: Concentrate Positions, Bolster Your Overall ReturnStock Market Today: Do These 7 Highly Rated Chipmaking Stocks Deserve A Spot On Your Watch List?How Much Is The Data Storage Group Up This Year: Check The Daily 197 Industry Group RankingsIs The Market's Uptrend Still Healthy?

64,STX,"There's no shortage of star power in First Trust Nasdaq-100-Technology Sector ETF (QTEC), with Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOGL) among its holdings.Indeed, the exchange traded fund is a way to gain exposure to the biggest brands in technology, and those stocks are performing well. Because it's culled from the Nasdaq 100 (the largest nonfinancial stocks in the composite), the ETF is predominantly a big-cap fund, with a median market cap of $32 billion.More than 40% of the fund is in chip stocks. About one-fourth is in software, 17% in internet companies and the rest in hardware, services and telecom stocks. The fund's hardware stocks have been shining.Western Digital (WDC) has surged more than 130% from a low in May 2016. The data storage stock broke out of a base March 30 and remains near a 81.77 buy point. Rival Seagate Technology (STX) has risen more than 160% from its May low. Apple may be flagging the past couple of weeks, but shares have rallied about 20% from a breakout past a 118.12 entry in January.The internet components haven't exactly impressed. Alphabet — the parent company of Google — Yahoo (YHOO), Baidu (BIDU), Akamai (AKAM) and NetEase (NTES) have printed mediocre charts for months. Facebook, though, is still trending moderately upward.Despite relative strength in the sector, the ETF's semiconductor stocks have been mixed.What about the sector's outlook? Much depends on consumer reception to new products, such as the next iPhone model, and corporate spending on information technology. Earlier this month, Nomura analysts saw strength in that area.""Our early-April survey of 50 global CIOs offered a significantly improved view of 2017 IT spending vs. our October survey,"" the firm noted. ""This suggests the economic and financial upticks since October may prove resilient. The top spending drivers, security and cloud, remain key themes.""The tech sector is turning in the third-highest earnings growth rate of 11 S&P sectors at 13.0%, according to FactSet.The 35 companies in the ETF are about evenly distributed in terms of weighting, each accounting for 1.5% to 3.2% of the portfolio. That leaves the fund less exposed to risk from a single holding.The ETF has made an impressive run since it broke out of a long consolidation and started making new highs last July. Today, shares are finding support at the 50-day moving average. That leaves investors with an opportunity to buy shares, although it needs to be treated as a secondary entry, not as favorable as a base breakout. The most recent of those was in November, when First Trust Nasdaq-100-Tech Sector was trading at 51.65.RELATED:Robotics ETF Taps Growth In Manufacturing, Drones, Other AreasThis Cloud-Computing ETF Is Loaded With FANG Stocks

"
66,STX,"The Boise, Idaho-based company discussed a renegotiated supply agreement with Inotera that should result in ""significant benefit,"" and a new partnership announced Thursday with Seagate Technology (STX), Pacific Crest Securities analyst Monika Garg said in a research report Tuesday.
"
67,STX,"""The new Inotera agreement could lead to 8% to 10% higher DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) margins from Inotera,"" Garg said.

"
74,STX,"Sundararajan said the two-year deal, which also includes options to extend the pact longer, ""will likely bring Micron Technology's margin at least to the high 40s by itself"" and will be above 50% once other costs savings are factored in.

79,STX,"XBargain hunters moved into the market and the Dow Jones industrial average looked poised to recoup all early losses on Monday afternoon, helping shave some of the indexes' losses with an hour to go in the session. However, the S&P 500 looks poised to register its seventh distribution day, or session of intense professional selling, in recent weeks.The S&P 500, off by as much as 0.8% by around 12:05 p.m. ET, likely skirted a distribution day with a loss of less than 0.2%. Meanwhile, the S&P 100, which tracks the 100 largest companies monitored by Standard & Poor's, nearly closed breakeven, down less than 1 point.The Dow Jones industrial average also cutt its losses, down less than 0.1%. The Nasdaq composite dropped around 0.3%. Volume appeared to finish higher on the Nasdaq vs. the same time on Friday.The relatively high distribution count is offset by the fact that most of the distribution days going back over the prior 25 sessions were light in nature. Plus, the major benchmarks are holding close to all-time highs. Nonetheless, equities have had a superb run since late June, and for now the current uptrend remains at ""uptrend under pressure.""Read IBD's The Big Picture column on a daily basis to monitor important changes in the overall market direction. The last time IBD set the outlook at ""market in correction"" came on June 27 last year.Meanwhile, while the tech sector remains hot, a few leaders are showing some selling stress.Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI), a big winner since the start of the year, fell 3% to 54.42. It recently formed  a faulty V-shaped cup base that fell way short of the minimum six weeks needed to form a good pattern. The two-weeks-down/two-weeks-up action has been seen in many past winners, based on IBD's research of sell signals among the top market leaders.Applied made a stunning run after clearing a 27.38 buy point in a seven-week base in mid-January. In less than nine weeks, the maker of laser components and subassemblies for fiber optic networks ran up more than 100% to a high of 56.14. The two-week pullback that followed put the finishing touches on a rare high, tight flag pattern. However, one critical flaw in Applied's flag was the unusually heavy volume during the two down weeks that produced the flag portion.Nevertheless, those who bought at the 27.38 proper entry and have conviction in the company can sit tight for now. Shares are still well above the fast-rising 10-week moving average.The Street sees Applied Optoelectronics' earnings rising 144% to $3.39 a share this year on a 46% vault in revenue to $380 million.The company's revenue rose 24%, 66%, 46% and 37% in the prior four years through 2016.Cognex (CGNX) hit a new high of 86.88, but reversed for a mild loss of nearly 0.3%. Volume is huge. More negative price reversals in fast turnover would mean it's time to lock in at least partial profits.Seagate Technology (STX) fell nearly 2% to 45.08 in rising turnover vs. Friday. The data storage giant is trying to cling to its rising 50-day moving average after a nearly 20% gain from a breakout past 41.55.A solid bounce off the 50-day line would greatly benefit current Seagate holders. Otherwise, taking at least partial profits in the mid-cap tech firm makes good sense from a portfolio management perspective.Taking profits at 20% to 25% in numerous companies not only builds up an overall nice return, but the disciplined selling also frees up cash for an investor to potentially find an even better market leader.Use IBD's Stocks On The Move table, found in the ""Stocks List"" section at Investors.com, to find high-quality stocks rising in huge volume, then analyze their fundamentals and level of mutual fund and hedge fund sponsorship quickly via IBD Stock Checkup. Consultant Science Applications International (SAIC) continues to struggle, falling nearly 2% to 73.08 and clipping its 200-day line, just two days after it cratered more than 13% on Thursday and took out its 50-day moving average in monster volume.SAI on Thursday posted a 7% rise in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings to 95 cents a share, extending a four-quarter streak of gains, but it was the smallest year-over-year increase over that time frame. Revenue sank 4% to $1.03 billion, accelerating a 2% decline in the third quarter that ended in October.Marvell Technology (MRVL) is losing vital support at the 50-day line. It had recently broken out of a flat base with a 15.09 entry. Shares in the former Leaderboard member slipped 1.5% to 15.03, thus round-tripping a mild double-digit gain.Also in the stock market today, Snap (SNAP) slipped nearly 1% to 22.31, but volume appears on track to be one of the lightest sessions since the stock's IPO on March 2.Notice on a weekly chart how the Snapchat site's operator showed a tight weekly close last week. It fell nearly 1% to 22.53 and action was wild during the week, but the minor weekly price change represents a clue that institutions are holding firmly, not anxious to sell.Enterprise software firm MuleSoft (MULE), a March 17 IPO at 17 a share, is staging another sharp gain, rising nearly 4% to 25.20 and approaching a 26.02 buy point in a very narrow potential IPO base. It pared earlier gains to a little more than 1%. IPO bases contain much more risk because they often form over a much shorter period of time.After peaking at 25.92 on March 19, MuleSoft dropped 16% to as low as 21.80 in just six sessions. However, a 16% correction from high to low is not extreme. At 24.34, the stock is also up 43% from its IPO pricing, indicating that institutional demand is robust.Keep in mind that IBD ratings for brand new stocks are skewed by the fact that they have not traded long enough. For instance, the Relative Price Strength Rating is based on action over the past 12 months, with a higher weighting on three-month action. MuleSoft is just starting Week 4 of its life in the public stock markets. Goldman Sachs helped bring the company public.MuleSoft has no earnings despite growing its revenue by 70% to $188 million last year.RELATED:Stock Market Today: I: Can These 6 Leaders Become The Next Cisco Of The 2010s?Stock Market Today II: Is It Time To Sell These 11 Leading Names?Great Stocks For Income Investors: Can These 3 Financial Plays Rally Big In 2017?

104,STX,"Microsoft Seen Posting Mixed Holiday Quarter Shares of disk drive makers Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital tumbled Monday after Seagate posted earnings and gave guidance below Wall Street consensus.Seagate reported earnings per share minus items of $1.35, up 2% from the year-earlier quarter and in line with guidance, for its fiscal second quarter ended Jan. 2.Revenue rose 5% to $3.7 billion, just shy of consensus estimate of $3.74 billion.Weak sales in Europe and weak disk drive prices hurt, analysts said. Europe accounts for about 20% of company revenue.Seagate stock was down 9%, at a three-month low near 58, in early afternoon trading on the stock market today. Shares of top rival Western Digital (WDC) were down 6%, near 100. Western Digital is set to report its fiscal Q2 earnings after the market close Tuesday.Before Monday, Seagate stock was up 14% this year and Western Digital stock was up 26%.Shebly Seyrafi, analyst at FBN Securities, maintained a sector perform rating on Seagate but lowered his price target to 60 from 65.""Europe normally would have been up about 5% in the December quarter, but instead was down 5%,"" Seyrafi wrote. ""Some supply constraints exist in the cloud market as well, and this supply challenge is expected to last a few quarters.""The average selling price for hard drives was $61, up $1 from the previous quarter but down $1 from the year-earlier quarter.Seagate projected fiscal Q3 revenue of about $3.45 billion, down 1.5% from the year-earlier quarter and below consensus of $3.58 billion.Follow Brian Deagon on Twitter @IBD_BDeagon.RELATED:Microsoft Seen Posting Mixed Holiday Quarter

105,STX,"Computer hardware giant Dell Technologies (DVMT) on Thursday reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter results that have positive implications for peers like HP Inc. (HPQ) and NetApp (NTAP) as well as other tech firms.Round Rock, Texas-based Dell said its sales in the quarter ended Feb. 3 were $20.1 billion, up 53% from the year-earlier period, which was before Dell purchased data storage tech firm EMC. It reported adjusted net income of $1.1 billion for the quarter.Dell Technologies describes itself as the world's largest privately controlled technology company. PC and server maker Dell, which went private in October 2013, purchased EMC last September to create Dell Technologies. At the same time, it issued a tracking stock for its stake in EMC spinoff VMware (VMW).Revenue in Dell's client solutions group, which includes PCs and displays, rose 11% year over year to $9.8 billion. That is its best performance in more than eight quarters, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani said in a report Thursday.""While the company did not provide April-quarter guidance, we think January-quarter's results have better implications for the PC businesses of PC-exposed companies,"" Daryanani said. He listed PC maker HP, chipmaker Intel (INTC), tech reseller CDW (CDW) and hard-disk-drive makers Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX) as benefiting from improving industry conditions.IBD'S TAKE: Dell Technologies stock has been forming a flat base for four weeks with a buy point of 65.88. The stock recently was added to IBD's Leaderboard list of stocks with potential for big gains.Dell shipped 11 million PCs in the fourth quarter, its largest volume since the fourth quarter of 2011. Its personal computer shipments were up 8.2% year over year.Dell's infrastructure solutions group generated $8.4 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter. That included $3.6 billion from servers and networking and $4.8 billion from storage. VMware revenue for the fourth quarter was $1.9 billion, Dell reported.""Dell's server and networking performance should also have positive implications for the server/data center segments of Intel, Western Digital, Seagate and CDW,"" Daryanani said. NetApp should benefit from the same trends helping Dell's storage business, he said.

106,STX,"Major indexes struggled to advance despite Wednesday's strong February report on private sector job creation, but the Nasdaq composite and the tech-leaning Nasdaq 100 are both up nearly 0.3%.Snap (SNAP), meanwhile, enjoyed a more than 6% lift to 22.88, and volume is heavy at 36 million shares as of 3 p.m. ET. However, total session turnover is unlikely to surpass the 71.9 million shares that exchanged hands during Tuesday's big sell-off. One would prefer to see a high-growth stock rise in higher volume vs. the prior session, and not in lower turnover, as it would indicate serious demand for shares among the professional crowd. However, it's also perfectly natural to see Snap's daily turnover cool down after last week's highly anticipated market debut.After 50 days of trading have passed, investors can then track Snap's level of turnover by comparing it with the 50-day moving average, found on all IBD charts as well as on Marketsmith, IBD's premium-quality charting and stock screening service.The major averages, including the Dow Jones industrial average, S&P 500 and Russell 2000, were down slightly but off intraday lows. Volume is running sharply higher on the NYSE vs. the same time on Tuesday, while Nasdaq turnover was virtually flat.Despite the losses, the S&P 500 still stands tall in 2017, up 5.6% since Jan. 1. As seen on a daily chart, the 500, Dow Jones industrial average, and Nasdaq all are leading their respective 50-day moving averages, which in turn are all rising.That's healthy action for a market that has been in a nearly nine-month uptrend since the rare Day 3 follow-through that took place on June 30 last year.Among leading stocks, Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX) deserve close watch as they appear to join the likes of Apple (AAPL) in making nice gains since pulling themselves out of big declines, forming bottoming base patterns that show clear institutional buying, and coasting to 52-week highs. Western Digital on Feb. 24 bounced nicely off its 50-day moving average near 73.46, presenting a follow-on buy entry. Seagate barreled past a 41.55 first-stage base entry on Jan. 25 in huge volume after reporting a 68% leap in fiscal Q2 profit and its smallest year-over-year revenue drop in seven quarters.Viewed from a weekly chart, Seagate's quiet action in recent days may become a narrow handle on a much larger, deeper consolidation. France's digital ad firm Criteo (CRTO) is also on the move up, rising 2.1% to 50. The software firm is now extended more than 8% past a 46.09 buy point within a first-stage cup with handle.Criteo went public in late 2013 at 31 a share. Earnings per share have grown 64%, 34%, 106%, 182% and 17% vs. year-ago levels in the past five quarters. Due in part to a tough comparison, Q1 profit is seen up just 2% to 44 cents a share.Momo (MOMO), a video platform and play on the Chinese digital ad industry, rocketed 13% to 33.97, good for another all-time high, following robust Q4 results (EPS up 633%, revenue up 524%) issued Tuesday morning. The gain from a 23.96 cup-with-handle buy point has stretched to more than 41%.Returning to Snap, given the wild price action over the past four sessions, it is still way too early to determine a proper buy point. Some IPO bases can be as narrow as seven to 10 days in length, but are extremely rare.For now, Snap has plenty of work ahead of itself after already falling as much as 30% below its all-time high of 29.44. The company also has yet to turn a profit.Most excellent cup and double-bottom bases see a decline of between 20% and 33% from head to toe. Snap's drop is already too deep for a flat base pattern.RELATED:IBD Industry Themes: Why These 4 Data Storage Firms Are ExcellingHow To Invest: The Case For A Trump-Era Secular Bull RunWhen To Buy A Turnaround: Spotting The Bottoming Base

""The company expects these trends to continue over the balance of fiscal 2017, driving our estimates higher once more.""In their earnings conference call with analysts, Western Digital executives noted favorable dynamics across all end markets in disk drives and a better-than-expected PC market.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani raised his price target on Western Digital to 90 from 80, with an outperform rating.""Western Digital reported impressive upside to December quarter revenue and earnings and provided a path toward higher EPS over the next several quarters,"" Daryanani wrote in a research note.He sees a path toward higher EPS and free cash flow, in addition to a confluence of favorable trends in both disk drives and flash-chip storage business based on Nand technology, where Western Digital is among the market leaders following its SanDisk acquisition.For the March quarter Western Digital expects revenue of about $4.55 billion, above the consensus of $4.37 billion and EPS in the range of $2 to $2.10, above Wall Street estimates of $1.69.FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi upgraded Western Digital to outperform from sector perform and raised his price target to 100, from 70.Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh raised his price target on Western Digital to 92 from 82, with a buy rating.RELATED:Western Digital Eyes Stake In Toshiba's Memory-Chip BusinessWestern Digital President: Tackling 'Third Platform' Of Data StorageWestern Digital Displays 'Operational And Financial Excellence'

113,STX,"Disk drive maker Seagate Technology (STX) late Tuesday reported quarterly earnings that easily topped Wall Street views on the bottom, with the top line also coming in better than expected. Seagate also gave bullish revenue guidance.Seagate reported revenue of $2.9 billion. That's down 3% from the year-earlier quarter, but that's is smallest percentage decline in nearly two years and it beat the consensus estimate of $2.82 billion.

114,STX,"Stocks kept a bullish tone in afternoon trading Wednesday as the indexes easily recouped last week's mild declines and more.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) continued to stage positive action following its breakout past a 118.12 cup-with-handle buy point. The megacap consumer tech play rose more than 1.5% to 121.90, stretching its gains past the proper entry point to nearly 3%.Volume was running 13% above average at around 1:30 pm New York time, another sign that the iPhone giant is still enjoying robust institutional sponsorship; watch to see how it finishes. Apple's 50-day average turnover is 29.8 million shares. The 5% buy zone extends up to 124.02.Apple is not the only company to reassert itself after a long, deep decline. Other stocks that have rebounded nicely following the formation of a bottoming basing process include Eagle Materials (EXP), GrubHub (GRUB) and Seagate Technology (STX).At 2:30pm ET, the Nasdaq composite rallied more than 0.8%, as did the small-cap Russell 2000. The Dow industrials and the S&P 500 were both up nearly 0.7%. Volume is running moderately higher on both exchanges.As noted in Tuesday's IBD Big Picture column, the above-average turnover on the NYSE as the major indexes gained sharply on Tuesday added further evidence that mutual funds, hedge funds, large investment advisors, banks, pensions and college endowments are busily accumulating shares. None of the down sessions on the S&P 500 this year have featured above-average turnover on the Big Board so far.Returning to Apple, keep a close eye on the stock action as investors wait for fiscal Q1 results, covering the October to December time frame, to be released after the market close on Jan. 31.As noted often in past Stock Market Today columns, Apple is trying to halt a three-quarter slump in earnings. The current estimate has been revised slightly up as the Street now sees earnings down just 2% to $3.22 a share. The strength of service-related revenue and the issue of whether Apple can get iPhone unit sales to grow again are major points of concern.Apple initially cleared its long bottoming base by rising past a 110.33 entry in a choppy cup with handle on Sept. 14. Shares rallied nearly 8%, then pulled back to test institutional support at the 200-day moving average.Apple's revenue is on consensus seen rising 2% to $77.4 billion. That would bust the company's unenviable three-quarter streak of falling revenue (-13%, -15% and -9% in the prior three quarters).However, Q2 sales may continue an accelerating trend as the Thomson Reuters forecast expects 6.9% growth to $54 billion. For all of FY 2017, which ends in September, the Street expects sales up 6.9%.IBD reported in its Click Tech Blog today that the upcoming iPhone 8 may get special 3D sensing features to allow users to have an augmented reality experience with their smartphones.Seagate Technology, gapping up more than 15% to 43.30, rushed past a 41.55 buy point within a deep cup with handle that is part of a long bottoming process. The 5% chase zone extends up to 43.63.Seagate reported a 68% jump in fourth-quarter earnings to $1.38 a share, crushing Wall Street's view by nearly 28%, as sales fell 3%, the smallest decline in seven quarters. Q1 profit is currently seen soaring 291% to 86 cents a share.GrubHub, No. 10 in the IBD 50, has been forming a new cup base that is nestled within a much longer, deeper cup structure that spans all the way back to its 47.95 high seen in early April of 2015.In that deep cup, GrubHub plunged 63% to as low as 17.77.GrubHub rallied 3% to 41.79, getting closer to a potential buy point at 44.68, 10 cents above the current base's left-side high.Eagle Materials, moving nicely after reporting a fourth straight quarter of double-digit profit growth, has broken out past a base-on-base pattern at 103.26. The 5% buy zone extends up to 108.42.Shares are up more than 3% to 108.04 in volume running 2-1/2 times normal levels.Eagle — which also posted accelerating revenue growth as sales rose 9% to $302 million, up from a 1% jump in Q3 — built its own bottoming base pattern when it slumped from 105.69 in 2014 to a multiyear low of 45.03 a year ago.RELATED:Seagate Flies On Strong Earnings Report; Western Digital Up NextThe Bottoming Base, Part I: How It Helps Investors Make MoneyThe Bottoming Base, Part II: Why Apple Formed One In 2009How To Invest: Master The Elements Of An Excellent Cup With HandleWhere To Find The Latest Earnings News In Tech

Both sales and profits soundly beat estimates for the period ended March 31. The results include revenue from Western Digital's $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk, which closed in May a year ago.""Favorable trends across all of their markets drove an impressive performance at Western Digital for fiscal Q3,"" Kugele wrote in a research note Friday. ""However, all of this goodness pales in comparison to the guidance for fiscal Q4 and for 2017.""Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX), and is also now a formidable player in chip-based flash storage, with its SanDisk acquisition.

138,STX,"When Western Digital (WDC) closed its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk in May, the leading provider of disk drives greatly expanded in the business of flash-based chip-storage products widely used in mobile devices.Western Digital made the acquisition to address the dramatic growth in data creation and the evolution of data storage.SanDisk has long been among the leaders in flash-based chip storage, the kind used in smartphones and tablet computers. With SanDisk, Western Digital sees its total addressable market at $72 billion.Already the No. 1 provider of disk drives, just ahead of archrival Seagate Technology (STX), Western Digital now is also a formidable player in chip-based flash storage. Western Digital and Seagate for several years have been dealing with lower demand for disk drives as consumers shift from desktop PCs to smartphones and tablets.The move helped Western Digital's stock, which is up 17% in 2016 and trading well above its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, key support lines. Western Digital stock fell a fraction to 70.17 in the stock market today.The data storage market is evolving to meet the growing demands of cloud computing, mobile computing, the Internet of Things and other forms of computing, Mike Cordano, Western Digital's president and chief operating officer, recently told IBD in a Q&A about the road ahead in 2017.IBD: With the SanDisk acquisition done, what kind of 2017 do you expect from Western Digital?Cordano: For one, we hope to reach our full stride as an integrated company — the new Western Digital, combining all the SanDisk assets. We're through the first big wave of this integration. We're in a position to deploy an integrated product roadmap across various markets that are changing dramatically.IBD'S TAKE: There are plenty of places on Investors.com to research and find top stocks, but when you're looking to get a broader idea on top tech stocks, IBD's Tech Leaders feature is worth reviewing. You can, for example, find out about four tech earnings leaders.What we see happening is an acceleration of new computing architectures. Some people call it a third platform. It's the advent of cloud mobility and other things like artificial intelligence and machine learning. For us it's really about continuing to provide the technology and storage-product building blocks. We've got a very clear focus on that across the breadth of the company. Having SanDisk and its nonvolatile memory, or flash, platform within our portfolio really allows us to play across the entire storage landscape.IBD: What do you mean by a third platform?Cordano: The third platform has various elements. One central theme is the buildout of cloud computing, both public and private. Another is mobility, which is becoming sort of a leading driver of the edge, or client. And then there are a number of other threads within that, like the Internet of Things, which is creating machine-generated data.Once you've created these big data repositories in the cloud, new methodologies allow you to derive value and insights from that data. Those are all attributes of this third platform. The previous architectural construct, the second platform, was really client-server technology. We're in the transition from second to third now.IBD: What opportunities does the third platform provide Western Digital?Cordano: Some examples are in the area of mobility and the Internet of Things. Prior to acquiring SanDisk, we had limited exposure to the storage elements of smartphones, or edge sensors in the case of IoT. And now we have exposure to all of those types of products.We're also well-aligned with the people innovating in those areas. So we have a very good view of what's happening, what the storage needs are and what the next-generation products are. We're now participating in those market segments that we were not in prior to the SanDisk acquisition.And if you look at the basic construct in the cloud data center, two storage building blocks are primarily contemplated. One is the enterprise hard drive — an optimized disk drive that is built for the data center, where you get a cost-per-gigabyte advantage. The other major building block is flash, or flash-based storage. So the coupling of those two are really the new building blocks of the cloud data center.One is optimized for cost per gigabyte, which is disk. The other is optimized for cost per I/O, which is a performance measurement — cost per input/output. Depending on the way that application is written, you're going to blend those two technologies in an optimal way to provide capability and performance.IBD: What's the future of disk drives now that chip storage is becoming more pervasive?Cordano: We recognized there was going to be a changing role for disk drives and that, given this transition to the third platform, the fundamental technology was going to change. The role of the hard drive will continue, but it's a changed role.In the data center we see the emergence of this capacity enterprise product line, which is where the growth is, relative to exabytes deployed. We really see the growth in 2020 and beyond to be largely in high-capacity enterprise drives.Historically, Western Digital was primarily in a PC-driven market. That segment of the market is changing as attributes of mobility are more important. The role of nonvolatile memory is playing a more significant role in the PC market. In the markets we serve we see a shifting, changing landscape, where flash is becoming more important in some categories. Disk drives are shrinking in those markets but, as far out as we are planning, we see a role for hard-drive technology, in particular in the data center.IBD: What has the rise of cloud computing meant for Western Digital?Cordano: Its provided multiple levels of opportunity. We've been working directly with large hyper-scale providers for years. That has given us insight into how the tech transitions were going to occur. That was very useful in making plans for products and forming our own strategy. It's been a growth driver. It's also creating a lot of interesting dynamics in the broad IT ecosystem, where things that were more traditionally on premise are moving to the cloud.IBD: How much data can we expect to see crammed into future flash chips?Cordano: What you see is quite interesting. If you look at the capacity growth-rate metrics, solid state is growing roughly at the same rate as disk. If you look at the rate of what we would call areal density, we see that growing in the neighborhood of 25% annualized. That will enable the right balance of cost and performance to support this burgeoning data growth that everyone wants to get access so. Certainly on both technology types the cost per gigabyte is dropping at roughly the same rate.RELATED:Western Digital Draws Praise At First Full-Scale Analyst Meeting In 4 YearsBox CEO Interviewed: Aiming To Change How Businesses Work

141,STX,"Some of Silicon Valley's biggest companies are trying to smooth over frictions with President-elect Donald Trump, but the soon-to-be tweeter-in-chief's possible protectionist trade measures and strained relations with China could spell trouble for the tech industry.Trump met with 14 tech leaders on Wednesday, and the tech summit's main topic included China. Those attending included the CEOs of Apple (AAPL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco Systems (CSCO), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA) and Intel (INTC). Facebook's (FB) No. 2 exec also attended. But few details about the closed meeting were revealed.Trump, who took shots at Apple, Amazon and tech in general during the campaign, looked to forge some common ground with the tech leaders. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, in the only public comment by a tech attendee, called the meeting ""very productive."" At the meeting's start, which was open to the press, Trump complimented the industry and said he wanted to help it do well.But Trump is off to a rocky start with China's government, starting with a breach of long-held protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan's president. China claims Taiwan as part of China, and the U.S. has officially recognized ""One China"" diplomatic relations since 1979. The Trump camp has suggested the One China policy could be used as a bargaining chip to win future trade concessions.During the campaign, Trump promised to brand China a currency manipulator. He warned of slapping a 45% import tariff on all Chinese goods.IBD'S TAKE: Netflix is a current member of the exclusive IBD Leaderboard, where only the very best stocks at or near buy points reside. Netflix has a conventional buy point of 129.39, but investors willing to be more aggressive should check out Leaderboard for some more information.If Trump follows through and elevates the international status of Taiwan and enacts protectionist trade measures, China's government would retaliate, observers say. China did protest Trump's phone conversation with Taiwan's president.U.S. tech, and other, companies should be ""plenty worried"" about Trump's statements, says Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. But if Trump's words don't turn into action, it could blow over. China will hold Trump more accountable once he's sworn in as president on Jan. 20, Lardy says.""He's not president yet,"" Lardy said. ""There are a lot of things China could do, but I don't think they will do any of them until there's something that goes beyond rhetoric.""Talking about how he's going to be a hard deal maker, all these things are not going to set the Chinese off on a path of retaliation immediately. But if it becomes more concrete than just rhetoric, at that point you could see retaliation in the commercial sphere. There are lots of screws they can turn on U.S. companies.""China's possible retaliatory actions include case-by-case enforcement of anti-monopoly laws and business regulations, slapping tariffs on U.S. goods and favoring European multinationals in purchases. China also could put an economic embargo on Taiwanese products.One worry for Silicon Valley is that Trump's transition team and early Cabinet appointments have few ties to the tech industry. Trump has focused on manufacturing jobs, not the digital economy. Wilbur Ross Jr., selected to head the Commerce Department, is well-known for deals in the steel and coal industry.Trump has named Gov. Terry Branstad, R-Iowa, as his ambassador to China. Branstad calls President Xi Jinping of China an ""old friend."" Lardy, though, says it's not clear how much of a ""moderating effect"" Branstad will have on Trump's dealings with China.Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group (BABA) has warned Trump about raising trade barriers. And a Chinese state-run newspaper warned in November that companies such as Apple and Boeing (BA) would be among the first to be punished if a trade war erupts.For its fiscal Q4 ended Sept. 24, Apple garnered 19% of its revenue from the Greater China region, which includes Hong Kong. Amid tougher competition from local smartphone makers, Apple's revenue from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan fell 30% year over year in the quarter to $8.8 billion. The was by far its worst-performing region, but Apple has high hopes for its business in the world's biggest nation.Chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) gets some 38% of revenue from China, says a JPMorgan report. Qualcomm in 2015 agreed to pay a $975 million fine as part of a settlement with Chinese antitrust authorities that probed its licensing deals.IBM (IBM), Cisco and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) head a long list of computer companies that could be impacted by a U.S.-China trade battle, as well as chipmakers Intel and Micron Technology (MU) and data storage product makers such as Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX).Some companies have already been harmed from revelations by Edward Snowden that U.S. tech firms' products have been used by the National Security Agency for spying. China's government responded by telling state-owned companies to buy more local equipment.One wild card is whether Trump can be more helpful to U.S. companies aiming to crack China's market than the Obama administration.Video streamer Netflix (NFLX) recently shelved its expansion in China, saying ""the regulatory environment for foreign digital content services in China has become challenging.""IBM, Intel and Microsoft have complained of Beijing pressure to hand over the keys to intellectual property to win more business.China's censorship and monitoring of social networks has stymied U.S. internet firms. Google pulled out of mainland China in 2010. Facebook, anxious to break into China, has developed censorship tools designed to let the nation's regulators suppress content, according to reports from the New York Times and others.Cable TV firm Comcast (CMCSA), which acquired movie studio DreamWorks in April, is ""very, very bullish"" on its China business, Steve Burke, CEO of Comcast's NBCUniversal, said on the company's earnings conference call in July.""I'm talking movies, television, consumer products and theme parks,"" Burke said.Comcast is on track to open a new theme park in Beijing, with local partners, in 2020. Meanwhile, China is poised to become the world's No. 1 film market.Then there are companies like Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) that have a stake in trade relations. China last year said it would open up its fast-growing electronic payments market, including bank card transactions, to foreign companies. China has been under World Trade Organization pressure to open up its payments card business since 2001.One risk for U.S. companies is that joint ventures on the mainland could be put on ice if trade frictions rise. Wang Jianlin, China's richest man and chairman of real estate and entertainment giant Dalian Wanda Group, has warned Trump of trouble if Chinese acquisitions of U.S. assets are blocked.Since China joined the World Trade Organization 15 years ago, U.S. exports to China have risen by more than 600%, while U.S. exports to the rest of the world rose by 80%, Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia, told IBD in an email.The U.S. ran up a $366 billion trade deficit with China last year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. It has been declining, but Trump aims to lower further.""Many American jobs and corporate profits would be lost if China would retaliate against new tariffs, including in the Republican-leaning Farm Belt, as China is the second-largest market for American agricultural exports, led by soybeans,"" Rothman said. ""Prices for goods sold at places such as Wal-Mart (WMT) might rise by 10% or more.  That would hurt the spending power of Trump's working-class political base.""RELATED:Apple, Palantir Among Loose Ends At Trump Tech SummitApple Hits Great Wall Of iPhone Competition In ChinaAlibaba Singles Day Breaks Record, But Growth SlowsChina GDP Rises 6.7% In Q3, Same As Q2, Q1

Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings per share minus items of $1.01, down 33% and the seventh quarter in a row of year-over-year declines.Western Digital, along with main competitor Seagate Technology (STX), is facing slowing demand for disk drives as consumers shift from desktop PCs to smartphones and tablets.Western Digital and Seagate this month both received price-target increases from RBC Capital Markets, as conditions in the data storage market stabilize.

Seagate stock rose a fraction to 34.52.Western Digital, which closed its acquisition of flash-chip storage provider SanDisk in May, is seeing ""sustained tailwinds"" across its disk-drive and chip-storage business lines, the RBC report said. It also said earnings estimates for Western Digital are positioned to keep edging up through the end of 2016.With SanDisk, Western Digital became a major competitor in both hard-disk drives and flash chip storage. SanDisk is among the largest providers of flash-chip storage, a market led by Samsung Electronics.Seagate traded down last week after posting quarterly earnings that beat the Wall Street consensus estimates, following preliminary results that Seagate posted the previous week. Seagate said it shipped a record amount of disk drive capacity, which it attributed to strong demand from cloud storage providers.Mizuho has raised its 2016 estimates for hard-disk drive shipments to 412 million from 393 million.  That would still be a 12% decline, but Mizuho earlier had estimated a 16% drop. Mizuho raised its estimate for 2017 to 385 million from 367 million.RELATED: Disk Drive Stocks Slammed Despite Seagate's Strong Guidance

Seagate stock fell 0.4% to 35.01. The stock is recovering from a deep decline.Seagate and Western Digital are dealing with lower demand for disk drives as consumers shift from desktop PCs to smartphones and portables.Despite these woes, Rakesh raised his 2016 estimate for hard-disk drive shipments to 412 million from 393 million, and raised his estimate for 2017 to 385 million from 367 million. That would be a 12% decline this year, where he had estimated a 16% drop.""As we have noted, a modestly stronger PC market has been a tailwind for disk drives combined with strength in data center orders,"" Rakesh wrote. He also said pricing for flash-chip storage remains stable.

The fund also is a pre-eminent way to gain access to foreign emerging markets for their growth potential and diversification benefits.Here's a closer look at how the three ETFs are faring:SPY traded around the flat line in August, with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it 0.1% monthly gain. Year to date through Sept. 1, the fund is up 7.7% after a strong third-quarter rally lifted it off the Brexit lows.The ETF's top three holdings are Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Exxon Mobil (XOM).The top performer in this 505-stock portfolio over the past three months is Seagate Technology (STX.)SPY raked in $608.2 million in new money in August, according to Morningstar.

Now, Proofpoint boasts more than 1,300 staffers.""In a world where you're in an ongoing war against bad actors, we have to be nimble and responsive to the changes we see in the marketplace,"" he told IBD. ""And I think that's one of the things that has truly distinguished the company.""Proofpoint on Friday cleared a 76.93 buy point from a short consolidation, climbing 0.9% to 77.20 on the stock market Friday, but in light volume. Proofpoint rose 0.4% to 77.50 in Monday trade in above-average volume.Proofpoint stock has surged 19% year to date, outplaying IBD's 26-company Computer Software-Security industry group, down nearly 8%. But the group, too, is seeing a resurgence and ranks No. 30 out of 197 industries tracked, up from No. 191 over 13 weeks.IBD'S TAKE: Proofpoint is ranked No. 4 in IBD's security software group. Go to IBD Stock Checkup to find the top three cybersecurity stocks -- and how they stack up vs. Proofpoint.That's because cybersecurity spending is taking a larger-than-expected chunk of total IT spending, Dougherty analyst Catharine Trebnick says. Panic spending forced valuations to rocket in 2015 and the first half of 2016 couldn't keep up.But the second half is turning out to be a different story, Trebnick told IBD.""You're seeing in IT spending, security is still a No. 1 priority,"" she said. ""And in this whole security area, email is the No. 1 threat vector. It's also the place where people feel they have control over their network.""And that's where Proofpoint is winning, she says.Proofpoint got its start as a spam-blocker. But today's hackers are less interested in selling a ""Rolex"" and more interested in credential theft. Thus, social engineering is at the heart of most attacks.Such was the case in February and March when Seagate Technology (STX) and Snapchat were duped into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms. Seagate's breach came down to a phishing attack whereas Snapchat was duped by a spoofed email.Both are nascent email cons. Phishing emails contain legitimate-sounding requests for information. Spoofing changes a key figure in an email address. So in Snapchat's case, CEO Evan Spiegel's last name could have been spelled with the number 1.""The email threat vector is really vulnerable,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Andrew Nowinski told IBD. ""It's easier to trick a human into clicking a link than it is to write sophisticated malware.""Since January 2015, businesses lost a collective $3.1 billion in email compromise schemes across the globe, the FBI found. Last year, 30% of targeted people opened a malicious email, according to a recent Verizon study.Proofpoint's targeted attack protection (TAP) aims to solve that equation by filtering out malware-ridden emails before they arrive in the inbox. And for spear-phishing and spoofing, last Wednesday Proofpoint announced the $18 million acquisition of Return Path's email fraud protection business.Last year, industry tracker Gartner predicted TAP, data loss prevention and encryption would continue driving secure email gateway (SEG) growth. Overall, the SEG segment is expected to sustain 2%-4% growth annually over the next several years.""The SEG market is mature. The penetration rate of commercial SEG solutions is close to 100% of enterprises,"" Gartner wrote. ""Despite the market maturity, companies can't do without SEG solutions. ... Despite the low overall growth, we do see individual vendors that are taking market share.""A Piper Jaffray survey of resellers found Proofpoint is most often beating out Cisco and Symantec, with FireEye's (FEYE) on-premises solution trailing, Nowinski told IBD. Mimecast (MIME), which filed its IPO last year, targets small and midsize businesses (SMBs), while Proofpoint's focus is larger companies and enterprises.Proofpoint is outgrowing Cisco and Symantec. In 2015, Proofpoint grew its sales 31%, leading 16% growth in Cisco's security segment. Symantec shrank 10%, though its Blue Coat Systems acquisition will likely help it grow this year.""Cisco is really pushing their security angle,"" Dougherty's Trebnick said. ""They're trying to establish a bundle, but I wouldn't say they have any new function or features. Only Proofpoint and Mimecast have whaling (spoofing) detection. ... Cisco is late to the game.""The proof is in the pudding for Proofpoint, Rosenblatt analyst Marshall Senk said in an Aug. 1 research report. During Q2, Proofpoint hit ""an inflection point,"" crushing Wall Street's sales, earnings, billings and free cash flow projections, and hitting profitability two quarters ahead of time.Revenue growth accelerated for a second straight quarter, to 41%, its best gain in seven quarters.Beyond that, Proofpoint expects to hit $1 billion in annual sales by 2020. To do that, the company would have to maintain a 20%-32% compound annual growth rate. Since 2013, Proofpoint has grown an average 37% annually. Sales have grown by more than a third for the past 11 quarters.It's also beaten sales expectations by an average of 4.3% for the past eight quarters. It has met or topped EPS minus items views for the last seven of eight quarters. Nowinski credits Proofpoint's keen forecasting skill to the fact 97% of its sales stem from subscriptions.""The average contract length is between 15 and 22 months,"" he said. ""They have two years of visibility already from all the contracts they've been signing.""Perhaps the biggest tailwinds for Proofpoint stem from cooperation. Earlier this summer, Proofpoint announced partnerships with Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Splunk (SPLK), CyberArk Software (CYBR) and Imperva (IMPV) for technical integration.The partnerships open Proofpoint up to nonoverlapping customer bases like Palo Alto Networks' 26,000 customers, Wells Fargo analyst Gary Powell wrote in a July 25 research report. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC) McAfee is obsoleting its services and recommending customers to Proofpoint.Nowinski models an $80 million to $100 million McAfee opportunity for Proofpoint. Steele wouldn't put a dollar-figure on the potential windfall. Dougherty's Trebnick expects it to be a five-year push.On top of that, the transition to Microsoft (MSFT) Office 365 adds another three- to four-year charge. Microsoft launched its cloud-based Office 365 in 2011. But only about 13% of all publicly listed firms have made the switch to cloud-based office systems, Trebnick says. It has online threat protection built in, and offers sandboxing on its enterprise model, but doesn't include spoofing protection.""CIOs (chief information officers) say that there's too much latency with (Microsoft's) new products, so they'd rather choose the (enterprise) version with either the Mimecast piece of it or install the Proofpoint piece,"" she said. ""They work in conjunction.""RELATED:Palo Alto Seen Tightening 2017 Guidance On Cisco RivalryProofpoint Battens Against Spoofers, Phishers With $18 Million BuyProofpoint Hits Stratosphere On EPS Beat, First-Ever ProfitCisco Tests Palo Alto, Check Point; CyberArk, Proofpoint Niches Safe

259,STX,"Disk drive maker Seagate Technology (STX) beat Wall Street consensus estimates with its quarterly earnings report Tuesday morning, but EPS and revenue continued to decline amid the PC slump.Seagate reported revenue of $2.65 billion, down 9% year over year but slightly above the consensus estimate of $2.64 billion, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended July 1. It was the sixth quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue declines.Earnings per share minus items fell 10% to 69 cents, but it still topped the consensus of 60 cents. It also was the sixth quarter in a row of declines for EPS.Seagate stock fell 5.5% to close at 30.65 in the stock market today. Seagate enjoyed its best gain in more than four years on July 12, rising 22%, after it hiked its earnings guidance and announced a big cut to its workforce.IBD'S TAKE: Seagate is up 74% after hitting a five year low of 18.42 on May 13. But Seagate has an IBD Composite Rating of 39, meaning it is being outperformed by 60% of stocks. Look for winning stocks with strong fundamentals at IBD Stock Checkup.For fiscal 2016, Seagate generated $1.7 billion in operating cash flow and paid cash dividends of $727 million. It ended its fiscal year with $1.1 billion in cash and equivalents, down from $2.5 billion a year earlier.Seagate rival Western Digital (WDC) reported quarterly earnings last week that topped the consensus estimate. Western Digital revenue rose 10% to $3.5 billion, but it includes partial results from its acquisition of flash-chip storage company SanDisk. Earnings per share minus items fell 48% to 79 cents.Seagate and Western Digital are dealing with lower disk drive demand as consumers shift to smartphones and portables from desktop PCs.""I am confident of the company's long-term sustainability and prosperity in a world of significant data creation and high-capacity storage demand driven by emerging technologies, and cloud infrastructure deployments,"" Seagate CEO Steve Luczo said in the company's earnings release.Western Digital fell 2.2%.

261,STX,"Western Digital (WDC) stock fell hard Friday, though the company late Thursday beat estimates with its latest earnings as well as its outlook.The No. 1 maker of disk drives reported revenue of $3.5 billion, topping the consensus of $3.4 billion. That's up 10% from the year-earlier quarter, after six straight quarters of declines, but it includes partial results from its acquisition of flash-chip storage company SanDisk. That $16 billion acquisition closed on May 12.Western Digital reported earnings per share minus items of 79 cents, down 48% but topping the consensus of 71 cents, for its fiscal fourth quarter ended July 1.""Fiscal 2016 was a transformative year for our company,"" Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan said in the earnings conference call. ""We took significant steps to continue our evolution into the leading storage solutions company and to return to growth with global scale and extensive product and technology assets.""Western Digital expects revenue this quarter of $4.4 billion to $4.5 billion, outpacing consensus expectations at $4.34 billion.On July 7, Western Digital raised guidance to include its recent acquisition of SanDisk. With SanDisk, Western Digital becomes a major competitor in both hard disk drives and flash chip storage. SanDisk is among the largest flash chip storage providers, a market led by Samsung Electronics.Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman, in a research note, said he sees just ""a modestly improving demand backdrop"" for Western Digital, but of the Q4 report he said, ""we see more to like here than not.""Ackerman, in fact, hiked his price target on Western Digital stock to 55 from 50, while maintaining an outperform rating.Western Digital stock, however, closed down 11.5% at 47.51 in the stock market today, falling just below its 50-day moving average.IBD'S TAKE: Western Digital stock has been in decline since hitting an all-time high of 114.69 in December. The stock has a weak IBD Composite Rating of 25, meaning it's underperforming 74% of all stocks. You can look for winning stocks at IBD Stock Checkup.Declining PC shipments have hurt makers of disk drives, key components in those products. Western Digital said it has reduced its overall facilities footprint by almost 20% and its headcount by almost 25% over the past two years.Western Digital's main disk drive rival, Seagate (STX), last month enjoyed its best stock gain in more than four years after it hiked earnings guidance and announced a big cut to its workforce. Seagate is scheduled to report its fiscal Q4 earnings before the market open Tuesday.

262,STX,"It seems Broadcom (AVGO) just can't resist making merger deals -- whether joining forces with another company or shedding some of its own operations.The supplier to Apple (AAPL) iPhones seemed set after making its mammoth $37 billion deal to merge with Avago earlier this year. In March, a mere month after the transaction closed, Broadcom Chief Executive Hock Tan spurned any talk of future transactions. Tan told analysts a merger or acquisition was the ""furthest thing"" from his mind.That was then. Tan's tune changed a couple months later when he told analysts on the June 2 second-quarter conference call that Broadcom will pull excess cash for mergers, as gross debt is close to double its adjusted earnings. Broadcom, the No. 2 fabless chipmaker, is still trying to buffer itself from volatile smartphone sales and angle for the more stable wired segment.Analysts say the merger strategy is working. Morgan Stanley's Craig Hettenbach notes the company now has greater diversification, with a hand in wireless, wired, enterprise storage and industrial segments.""The ebb and flow between Broadcom's end markets has allowed the company to meet revenue expectations in recent quarters despite the overriding demand weakness that has had a negative impact on most peers,"" Hettenbach wrote in a June 3 research report.Broadcom is far from new to the merger block. In fact, the company has changed hands several times itself since it was founded in 1961 as a semiconductor division under Hewlett-Packard. It left when Agilent Technologies (A) split from the company in 1999.Six years later, KKR and Silver Lake paid $2.6 billion to acquire the division of Agilent that later became Avago. Before going public in 2009, Avago sold one of its divisions to PMC-Sierra. PMC, in turn, was acquired early this year by Microsemi (MSCC).Eight years of rampant merger deals followed. In 2013, Avago acquired optical chip supplier CyOptics for $400 million and storage/networking firm LSI for $6.6 billion. Meanwhile, Avago peeled off several layers of its own by selling divisions to Intel (INTC) and Seagate Technology (STX). Then it turned the tables and bought Emulex in 2015 for $606 million.Earlier this year, Broadcom divested its Internet of Things and wireless infrastructure units to Cypress Semiconductor (CY) and MaxLinear (MXL) in deals worth a combined $630 million. Broadcom is likely to use those proceeds to pay down debt before seeking another deal.But the Big Kahuna was Avago's merger with the former Broadcom. That acquisition wrapped in February and was one of a number of chip-sector deals worth a cumulative $115 billion. (Intel bought Altera for $17 billion, and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) took on Freescale Semiconductors for $12 billion.)Combined, the new company kept Broadcom's name but used Avago's ticker, AVGO. The move helped it to diversify, and analysts thus changed their tune on the stock. In 2017, RBC analyst Amit Daryanani expects Broadcom to make a play for larger assets like Maxim Integrated (MXIM), NXP or Xilinx (XLNX).At least 16 analysts rated Broadcom stock a buy in the week following its Q2 earnings release, the first quarter in which the two companies were consolidated. Meanwhile, shareholders busted Broadcom stock out of a cup formation on June 3. Shares rocketed 7.7% before dipping almost immediately into a second cup. Broadcom stock topped a 166 entry point on July 27, but it has since pulled back.Broadcom shares ended Friday trading at a new all-time high of 170.12, up 1.9%, but lost some ground Monday. Shares finished Monday's trades down 1% to 168.35.Wireless sales accounted for a mere 22% of total revenue -- dipping below 30% for the first time in seven quarters. Broadcom's smartphone-facing unit accounted for 37% of sales in 2015. In 2014 and 2013, wireless revenue was 42% and 49% of total sales.Despite slowing importance to Broadcom's overall scheme, Tan hinted that radio-frequency content for smartphones has increased and would likely continue to rise by 20% annually for the next two to three years. That means even as smartphone units slow, Broadcom could see its take per phone grow.IBD'S TAKE: Broadcom tops IBD's 41-company Electronic Semiconductor-Fabless industry group. The group has climbed to No. 20 out of 197 groups tracked from No. 74 two months ago. Get Broadcom's IBD Stock Checkup here.UBS analyst Stephen Chin estimates that Broadcom could see its dollar content per unit boost to $8-$10 in the long term. Growth will come from additional content at existing tier-one smartphone makers like Apple and Samsung and as more infrastructure comes online to support 4G and LTE devices worldwide.""This could drive the need for additional FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) filters,"" Chin wrote in a July 15 research report. FBAR filters are a common component used in advanced smartphones. The filters account for about 12% of Broadcom's sales, Chin estimated.Broadcom's three-year agreement with Apple for chips ""suggests it will remain the FBAR market leader,"" Chin said. In a July 8 note to clients, RBC's Daryanani estimated that Broadcom's Apple-tied sales could grow more than 15% over the next three years.Diversification is key for RF suppliers like Broadcom, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and Qorvo (QRVO), which are jockeying for position as mobile sales stagnate. Vendors shipped 343.3 million smartphones in the second quarter, flat vs. last year, industry tracker IDC wrote in a July 28 note. Sequentially, smartphone shipments were up 3.1% from the first quarter.Still, mobile giants like Apple are changing their game to focus on services, IDC analyst Ryan Reith says. As smartphone makers shift strategies, so too do chipmakers.For Broadcom that means greater emphasis on its wired segment, which made up 58% of sales in the second quarter, accelerating from 22% of sales in the first quarter. Its previous three-year quarterly average in that unit was 22% of sales. Broadcom has beat Wall Street's total sales expectations for the past seven quarters.Broadcom's wired unit is largely enterprise-facing. The segment includes Broadcom's Tomahawk chips for cloud-scale networking and its Jericho platform for routing. Jericho will drive additional upside to top-line expectations for the third quarter, UBS' Chin said.""We estimate Jericho has started ramping recently and there is virtually no alternative chip supplier in the market,"" he wrote. ""The main competition is from networking OEM internal ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) designs.""

263,STX,"Seagate Technology (STX) enjoyed its best gain in more than four years Tuesday afternoon after the hard drive maker late Monday hiked its earnings guidance and announced a big cut to its workforce.Seagate stock shot up 22% to close at 29.35 in the stock market today, hitting a three-month high. But Seagate remains below its 200-day moving average, which it hasn't crossed since May 2015.Shares of rival Western Digital (WDC) rose 4.8% to 51.84, a six-month high. Western Digital raised earnings guidance earlier this month.Needham raised its price target on Seagate to 33 from 31, with a buy rating. Maxim Group boosted its price target to 35 from 25, with a hold rating.For its fiscal Q4 ended July 1, Seagate now expects revenue of about $2.65 billion, up from previous guidance of $2.3 billion and above the Wall Street consensus estimate of $2.5 billion. That would be down 9.5% from the year-earlier quarter but would mark its best period year over year in the past five quarters.Seagate said the improvement is due to better-than-expected demand for its disk drive products. Market tracker IDC on Monday said global PC shipments fell 4.5% in Q2, but that beat the 7.4% decline it had forecast.While Seagate did not give a specific estimate on earnings per share, it expects a gross profit margin of 25.8%, minus items, up from 23%, which Seagate attributed to ""cost containment execution.""RBC Capital Market analyst Amit Daryanani said the Seagate guidance implies EPS of 60 cents a share, above the consensus of 40 cents, as polled by Thomson Reuters.Seagate also updated its restructuring plan, saying it will cut 6,500 employees, or 14% of its workforce, by the end of fiscal 2017.On July 7, Western Digital updated EPS guidance to include its recent acquisition of chip storage provider SanDisk. Western Digital completed its $16 billion acquisition of chip-storage provider SanDisk on May 12. With SanDisk, Western Digital becomes a major competitor in both hard disk drives and flash chip storage.Seagate is scheduled to report fiscal Q4 earnings before the market open on Aug. 2.

264,STX,"Western Digital (WDC) stock rose Thursday as the company raised earnings guidance to include its recent acquisition of chip storage provider SanDisk and also named a new chief financial officer.After the close Wednesday, Western Digital preannounced fiscal-fourth-quarter earnings that were above previous estimates.The company now expects Q4 revenue of about $3.46 billion, up from its earlier forecast of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion. It expects earnings per share minus items of 72 cents, compared with its earlier forecast range of 65 cents to 70 cents, for the quarter ended July 1.Western Digital also announced the departure of company CFO Olivier Leonetti, effective Sept. 1. He will be succeeded by Mark Long, who also will continue in his role as Western Digital's chief strategy officer.""With the positive preannouncement, any concerns investors might have about such a (CFO) change post-quarter should be assuaged,"" wrote Needham analyst Richard Kugele in a research note. He reiterated a strong buy on Western Digital stock, and a price target of 67.Western Digital stock climbed 4.8% to 47.66 in the stock market today. Western Digital has found support recently above its 50-day moving average, but it has failed to trade above its 200-day since April 2015, and shares are down 20% so far this year.Western Digital completed its $16 billion acquisition of chip-storage provider SanDisk on May 12. With SanDisk, Western Digital becomes a major competitor in both hard disk drives and flash chip storage.Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX). SanDisk is among the largest flash chip storage providers, a market led by Samsung Electronics. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Seagate Technology stock climbed 0.9% to 23.73.RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani maintained a buy rating on Western Digital stock, with a price target of 56.""Management indicated that business fundamentals remain intact and the transition will be orderly,"" Daryanani wrote in a research note.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg said in a research note that Q4 guidance was encouraging and that fiscal Q1 might come in above guidance. But he did express concern about price wars down the road.""Western Digital should remain well-positioned in its core hard disk drive business, especially if Toshiba ultimately exits the space,"" Twigg wrote. ""However, we forecast worldwide disk drive revenue to decline over the next five years, as non-volatile memory and software-optimized solutions disrupt the storage segment. Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk should help position it for these shifts.""Western Digital is scheduled to report its full fiscal Q4 earnings after the market close on July 28.

Insider buying is generally seen as a positive sign.“We believe investors should view this step as a strong vote of confidence in the new trajectory of the company, post the SanDisk acquisition,” wrote Needham analyst Richard Kugele in a research note. “In our view, the purchase also signals that management views the stock to be trading at a depressed valuation.”Western Digital completed its $16 billion acquisition of chip-storage provider SanDisk on May 12.Western Digital stock closed up 2.3% at 47.63 in the stock market today. Shares, though, are down more than 40% since the acquisition agreement was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 37% since then. Needham's Kugele has a price target of 67 on Western Digital stock.On Friday, Western Digital gave what analysts called a thorough earnings guidance update that appeared to quell concerns about volatility, with the company's light earnings outlook blamed on interest expense on debt.

280,STX,"Disk drive leader Western Digital (WDC) gave what analysts called a thorough earnings guidance update late Thursday that appeared to quell concerns about volatility, with its light earnings outlook explained as an interest expense on debt.The new guidance for the first time included SanDisk, which Western digital acquired for $16 billion as of May 12.

Shares, though, are down about 45% since the acquisition agreement was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up more than 30% since then.Seagate stock was up 0.5% to 21.66 at the close. The stock is down 21% since the company reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on April 29.Western Digital guided revenue in the range of $3.35-$3.45 billion, slightly above consensus expectations at $3.35 billion. It expects SanDisk to contribute about $750 million for the seven weeks of sales in fiscal Q4. It expects EPS to come in at 65 cents to 70 cents, significantly below the consensus estimate of 90 cents, but the company said that is due to interest costs for its newly issued debt used to finance the SanDisk acquisition.Western Digital held on to previous views for its hard-disk drive business, with revenue of $2.6 billion to 2.7 billion, down about 6% from the prior quarter. Western Digital and Seagate have struggled through the decline in disk drive sales, due largely by the drop in PC sales.“We believe the acquisition of SanDisk is good because Western Digital as a stand-alone disk-drive company is unable to reverse the current earnings headwinds in a declining market,” wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kinngai Chan in a research note.The combination of Western Digital and SanDisk offers a good risk-reward for investors, Chan wrote, as it's better positioned to address the changing industry landscape for storage. That will allow Western Digital to better plan for its shrinking disk drive business, prioritize research and development, and optimize the product roadmap and manufacturing mix, he says.“However, we continue to remain negative on Seagate for the near to medium term as it does not have a good strategy in addressing the declining disk drive market,” Chan wrote.Needham analyst Richard Kugele maintained a strong buy rating on Western Digital stock, but he lowered his price target to 67 from 69.“We believe today begins the resetting of expectations based on the combined company, and should set a base from which to execute and outperform,” Kugele wrote in a research note.RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani, in a research note, said Q4 guidance was a step in the right direction and conservative enough to drive upside. He maintained an outperform rating and a price target of 56.While Western Digital didn’t provide any long-term targets for the combined entity, it did take away investor fears of a sharp drop in EPS, Daryanani wrote.“There are still plenty of moving parts that will create a wide dispersion of estimates,” he said.

281,STX,"Following up on its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk, Western Digital (WDC) issued new quarterly guidance after the market close Thursday that beat on the top line but fell well short on the bottom line.Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition two weeks ago, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage.Reflecting the ownership of SanDisk as of May 12, Western Digital now expects revenue of $3.35 billion to $3.45 billion for its fiscal Q4 ended July 1, compared with its earlier forecast of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. The midpoint is above the consensus estimate among analysts of $3.35 billion, as polled by Thomson Reuters. Western Digital reported revenue of $3.19 billion in the year-earlier quarter. That would be up 6.6% at the midpoint, where Western Digital revenue has declined the past six quarters year over year.It expects earnings per share minus items of 65 cents to 70 cents, compared with its earlier guidance of $1 to $1.10 a share. Analysts, though, had modeled EPS ex items of 90 cents.Western Digital stock was down more than 1% in after-hours trading, after rising a fraction in Thursday's regular session, to 44.38.

The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk-drive technology is losing ground.

That’s above the consensus estimate of $3.34 billion from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.The Wall Street consensus on earnings per share minus items is 86 cents. Daryanani expects 93 cents. He has an outperform rating on Western Digital stock and a price target of 56.Western Digital was trading near 39, up 5%, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. But shares are down more than 20% since the company's posted fiscal Q3 earnings on April 28.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).Seagate was trading near 20, up 4%, Wednesday afternoon. The stock is down 24% since the company reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on April 29.SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.

303,STX,"Western Digital (WDC) on Tuesday received a price-target hike to 50 from 45 and an upgrade to outperform from market perform by Cowen analyst Karl Ackerman.The moves comes two days before Western Digital is slated to give new guidance that will include its $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk. Western Digital announced the completion of its SanDisk acquisition last week, creating a big competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage. The company has said it would update its guidance after the market close Thursday for its fiscal fourth quarter ending July 1.Ackerman says while he expects the SanDisk acquisition to dilute earnings through 2017, “We think the stock should start to work higher from here, as Western Digital’s updated guidance should act as a positive catalyst and help eliminate uncertainty.""Western Digital stock finished trading up 4.5% to 42.28 in the stock market today. However, the stock is down 47% since the acquisition was announced in October. Shares hit a four-year low of 34.99 on May 16 but are up 20% since then.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015, with $14.5 billion from Western Digital. It’s the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers -- the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital's year-over-year revenue has fallen for six straight quarters. That’s largely due to lower disk drive sales in the slumping PC market and the migration of disk storage to chip-based storage in many products. Seagate's revenue has fallen for five straight quarters.“Now that SanDisk is subsumed into Western Digital’s operations, Western Digital now morphs from an enterprise highly exposed to the cannibalization of next-generation storage into a media agnostic, vertically integrated data storage provider capable of generating mid-single-digit revenue growth and low-double-digit EPS growth,” Ackerman wrote.He said the top 10 customers shared between Western Digital and SanDisk include Best Buy (BBY), Apple (AAPL), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ)“With SanDisk, Western Digital can now more effectively service both enterprise and hyper-scale customers and capitalize on the explosion of data creation that should double every two to three years by 2020,"" Ackerman wrote.

304,STX,"Days after Twitter (TWTR) accounts belonging to Facebook (FB) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the NFL were hacked, cybersecurity firm Proofpoint (PFPT) says its total addressable market has never been bigger -- $10 billion by 2019.That will have doubled since 2013, according to industry tracker IDC. Then, emerging markets, which includes social media, represented less than 1% of the TAM. By 2019, that business could be a $2.9 billion opportunity, or 15% of the TAM, says IDC.And social media security is only in nascent stages, Proofpoint CEO Gary Steele told analysts Wednesday at the company's analyst day in San Francisco. Proofpoint, with 2015 revenue of $265 million, already is swiping share from rivals such as Symantec (SYMC), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and FireEye (FEYE), Steele claims.Proofpoint's $2.7 billion market cap pales vs. Cisco's $147 billion and security leader Check Point Software Technology's (CHKP) $15.2 billion value, but Proofpoint outperforms its rivals time and time again, Steele says.""We manage the threat data for a high efficacy rate,"" he said. ""That's how we sell. That's how Tracey's (head of global sales Tracey Newell) team wins every deal. Simply put, we scare the (expletive) out of people. We show people what we catch.""Since its IPO in 2012, Proofpoint has achieved a 35% compound annual growth rate and, despite Wall Street whispers of a cybersecurity slowdown in 2016, Steele says Proofpoint hasn't seen any ""choppiness"" in the market.""We've seen no reduction in budgets as it relates to our projects,"" he said. ""We're clearly over the line in ... being high-priority in terms of (spending). We've seen no change in macro.""Proofpoint stock rose 1.4% in the stock market today, to 64.40, touching a five-month high. Shares are up more than 80% since hitting a 20-month low in early February.Malware campaigns jumped 800% vs. the year-earlier quarter and 66% sequentially in Q1, Steele said. David Knight, head of information security products, blamed user naivete. Since January 2015, human-error attacks have accounted for $2.3 billion in losses, says the FBI.That's because the user is most vulnerable, Knight told analysts. Whereas the infrastructure is susceptible to brute force, phishing attacks -- by email, social media and mobile -- appear legitimate and prey on users' good intentions.Such was the case in February and March when a phishing scheme duped Snapchat and Seagate Technology (STX) into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms. It's a matter of simply ""tricking"" users into handing over their credentials, Knight said.Devin Redmond, Proofpoint's vice president of social media security and compliance, expects phishing attacks to burgeon this year and next. He says the ""angler phish"" is most complex -- requiring fake accounts and websites to prey on real customers.For example, @John_Smith tweets to @bank that he's having trouble logging into his account. A spoof account -- appearing wholly legitimate -- offers to help @John_Smith with his login issue and provides a link to its credential-confirming website.It looks real, Redmond said.""The website asks for his pin code, security questions, ATM card number, pin number, social security number and data of birth,"" he said. ""It's not just getting his credential, it's getting all of the customer's information and then cleaning out his bank account.""Phishing attacks can be used to spread malicious links, Redmond said.Proofpoint is hoping to throw a wrench into hackers' processes by teaming up with CyberArk Software (CYBR), Imperva (IMPV), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Splunk (SPLK) -- a series of partnerships announced this week.Earlier, Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Mobileiron (MOBL) and VMWare (VMW) integrated with Proofpoint's Nexus One platform.""We heard it loud and clear from customers, that what they needed is the products they buy from multiple vendors to work together,"" Steele told IBD. ""It's strategically important for us to create that for the customer for their environment.""But the overall industry has made embarrassingly little collaborative progress, Steele says. Proofpoint has integrated with eight or nine social media applications and 150 app stores, ""not just Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOGL) Play,"" Knight told analysts. And it's free, Steele says.He credits Proofpoint's platform, Nexus, for the ability to integrate with other systems. Nexus controls Proofpoint's email, social and mobile visibility. Companies like Palo Alto Networks and CyberArk now can use that data in their own cyberbattles.It's a huge cybersecurity step forward, Steele says.""We saw lots of vendors delivering discrete point solutions, many of which didn't operate well with each other,"" he said. ""We believe vendor platforms need to integrate natively and you need to be able to make those relationships work well together.""

The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, move up the ladder to make bigger sales to businesses and other enterprise customers, the market where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital didn't provide updated guidance with its announcement of the deal's closure.""This is disappointing, as the company indicated on its earnings call, perhaps unintentionally, that it planned to provide updated June guidance when the deal closed,” Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg wrote in a research note. Western Digital did say that it would provide guidance in the ""near term.""Twigg said Western Digital should remain well positioned in its core hard disk drive business, though disk drive revenue will decline over the next five years as non-volatile memory and software-optimized storage products gain.“Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk should help position it for these shifts,” Twigg wrote.Western Digital and SanDisk had combined revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX).""This transformational combination creates a media-agnostic leader in storage technology with a robust portfolio of products and solutions that will address a wide range of applications in almost all of the world’s computing and mobile devices,” Western Digital CEO Steve Milligan said in Friday's press release announcing the acquisition had closed.Sanjay Mehrotra, co-founder and CEO of SanDisk, will serve as a member of the Western Digital board of directors.Western Digital stock was down 2.5%, near 35, in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today, at a more than three-year low. Seagate stock was up 1.5%, near 19, after touching a four-year low on Thursday.

He rates Broadcom stock his top semiconductor pick, with a 180 price target.Over the next two years, Broadcom stock could reach 200, Daryanani says.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Broadcom stock was up nearly 1% to 148.10. But it trailed shares of InvenSense (INVN) and Qorvo, which jumped 2.8% to 5.98 and 2% to 50.40, respectively. Cirrus Logic, Skyworks and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) stocks were up 2.8%, 1.9% and 1.5%, respectively.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) stock was up 0.6%, while Integrated Device Technology (IDTI) was up a fraction.Broadcom is slated to report its Q2 earnings after the close June 2. Daryanani expects Broadcom to miss consensus expectations for $3.55 billion in sales on petering Apple iPhone sales, despite stronger-than-expected Samsung Galaxy S7 sales.Apple comprises 15% of Broadcom's sales, Daryanani estimates, with Samsung in the high single digits. Apple's June-quarter guidance implies 40 million iPhones shipped vs. consensus views for 44 million. Near term, Apple will pose a headwind until the iPhone 7, expected to be released in September, ramps up.""To that end, Broadcom's FBAR (film bulk acoustic resonator) business could see double-digit year-over-year growth driven by content gains,"" Daryanani wrote. Wi-Fi combo chips could also see modest average sales prices tailwinds.Earlier, Broadcom saw wireless account for 23% of sales. Daryanani expects that segment to grow 37% quarter over quarter as the company's recent merger is factored. The former Avago Technologies bought Broadcom for $37 million in February, but kept the Broadcom name.Storage sales will likely become ""incrementally worse,"" Daryanani wrote. Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technologies' (STX) recent earnings suggest a $100 million hard-disk drive total addressable market in March and a $95 million TAM in June, down 20% and 15% vs. last year.Enterprise storage is expected to account for 17% of Broadcom's Q2 sales. Daryanani sees the segment declining 14% vs. Q1, vs. 6% sequential growth in the prior quarter.

364,STX,"Seagate Technology (STX) stock plunged Thursday after the company released preliminary earnings late the previous day that were below its earlier guidance due to weak demand for its disk drives in servers and personal computers.Seagate stock crashed 20.1% to 27.11 in the stock market today, the lowest since late January. The news also hit Western Digital (WDC), which fell 6.65% to 41.82.

Find out at IBD Stock CheckupSeagate expects to report revenue of about $2.6 billion, below previous guidance of $2.7 billion, for its fiscal third quarter. That would be a 21% decline year over year and the fifth straight quarterly decline. Seagate expects to report a non-GAAP gross profit margin of 23% vs. its previous guidance of 25.6%.Seagate attributed the shortfall to lower demand for disk drives in the business sector, as well as weaker demand for disk drives among China-based PC makers and the company’s decision not to aggressively participate in the low-capacity notebook market, among other reasons.Seagate will report its full earnings before the market open April 29. The company expects to report disk drive unit shipments of about 39 million, representing approximately 40% market share.Western Digital is scheduled to report its fiscal-third-quarter earnings April 28 after the market close.
"
365,STX,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) may cut thousands of jobs to buffer its bottom line amid continued PC malaise, according to a report from Oregon Live.The report came as a second analyst in a week cut his price target on Intel stock Sunday in reaction to industry reports of Q1 PC shipment declines and a “dreadful” January for Taiwanese ODMs.Intel is slated to announce its Q1 results late Tuesday.In afternoon trading on the stock market today, Intel stock was up a fraction, trading near 32. Shares dipped severely in January but began to recover by mid-February. As of Friday’s close, Intel stock was down 9% for the year.Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan cut his price target on Intel stock to 37 from 38 but reiterated a buy rating. He cited recent reports from industry trackers IDC and Gartner which projected 9.6% and 11.5% year-over-year declines in Q1 PC shipments, respectively. Taiwanese PC makers noted respective 15% and 30% declines in notebook/desktop and motherboard shipments in Q1, Sundararajan wrote in a research report.“We think there will be some effect on Intel in Q1 and Q2 possibly,” he wrote.Pre-announcements from Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and Seagate Technology (STX) -- slated to report earnings April 28 and 29, respectively -- show soft demand for the data center and hard disk drive businesses, he wrote. Hard disk drives declined 18% sequentially, Seagate said. That softness will affect Intel, which hangs 60% of its revenue on PC sales.And the data center struggles are particularly concerning. Intel is pushing big into the data center and cloud spaces to diversify from its weakening PC unit. Super Micro Computer guided to $530 million to $533 million in fiscal Q3 sales, well below the midpoint of earlier views for $530 million to $580 million.“Given that a tight correlation exists between Intel’s DCG (data center group) revenues and Super Micro Computer revenues, if we do not see any effect in Q1, we should expect some effect in Q2,"" Sundararajan wrote.Intel will likely guide 2016 sales and capital expenditures down, he wrote.Three months ago, Intel modeled mid- to high-single-digit growth for 2016. Sundararajan cut his estimate to $57.1 billion in sales and $2.30 earnings per share, up 3% and down 1%. The consensus models $58.2 billion and $2.36 a share.So far, Intel hasn’t officially announced layoffs internally, according to the Oregon Live report that cited inside sources. The cutbacks could reduce employment in some units by double-digit percentages.
"
366,STX,"The sharp drop in PC sales that is the main reason Intel (INTC) will slash 12,000 jobs is also why the disk drive industry continues to get slammed.The two largest disk drive makers, Western Digital (WDC) and Seagate Technology (STX), for several years have tried to deftly maneuver through the dramatic drop in PC sales.Global PC shipments fell 9.6% in the first quarter, year over year, to 64.8 million units, according to research firm Gartner. It was the sixth consecutive quarter of declines and the first time since 2007 that quarterly shipments fell below 65 million units.Chips and disk drives have been two central elements in every PC since personal computers emerged about 35 years ago. Intel has moved to lessen its reliance on PCs by getting more chips placed in mobile devices, data centers and elsewhere.“We are evolving from a PC company to a company that powers the cloud and billions of smart connected and computing devices,” said Intel CEO Brian Krzanich, when the company reported fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday.Besides the PC drop, Seagate and Western Digital have been hit hard by the emergence of tablets and smartphones, which don't contain disk drives at all. Seagate's year-over-year revenue has decelerated for 10 of the last 12 quarters. The trend is similar at Western Digital. That is expected to continue when both companies report quarterly earnings next week.Weston Twigg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, expects disk drive revenue to decline about 8% annually through 2020, he wrote in a research report Tuesday.Both companies have sought to battle through the onslaught by diversifying into other areas, mainly by investing in solid-state memory chips and the development of all-chip storage systems, called solid state drives.Twigg expects solid-state drives will represent about half of data storage drives by 2020.Western Digital is making a huge play in the solid-state storage market with its $19 billion acquisition of SanDisk (SNKD), a leading provider of flash-memory chips used in smartphones and tablets. The deal positions Western Digital as having one of the most complete lines of storage among all providers.The deal, though, is a big risk for two reasons -- Western Digital is taking on lots of debt, and the flash-memory market is highly competitive with the potential for substantial overcapacity, Twigg writes. This includes competition from Intel, Micron (MU), Samsung and Toshiba.The good news is that Western Digital will be well-positioned if data-intensive applications like artificial intelligence, robotics, and the Internet of Things drive substantially higher demand for data storage, with hard-disk drives creating the backbone of these systems, he said.These same trends could bolster Seagate, though the company has been far more cautious about entering the chip-storage arena than Western Digital.

440,STX,"Western Digital (WDC) shareholders approved a $16 billion deal to acquire SanDisk (SNDK), creating a formidable competitor in both disk drives and flash-chip storage.“We like the merger,” Monika Garg, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, wrote in a research note. “The deal makes strategic sense for both companies. For Western Digital, it removes an overhang from the flash-chip impact on hard disk drives. Western Digital would then own the best flash assets and supply for its solid-state drive business.""SanDisk is a leading provider of chips used for data storage in a wide variety of devices, including smartphones, tablets and PCs. The deal will help SanDisk, which has a strong retail business, to move up the ladder into the enterprise market, where Western Digital is strongest. Western Digital gets the ability to offer chip-based storage in areas where its disk drive technology is losing ground.Western Digital and SanDisk combined had revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is the largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX), though the market has struggled as PC sales decline. Western Digital and Seagate have pursued the flash chip market.""This combination brings together two tremendous companies and cultures ideally positioned to capture the growth opportunities in our rapidly evolving industry,” said Steve Milligan, Western Digital CEO, in a statement announcing the deal.China regulators are the last remaining obstacle. China has a say in the transaction, based on Western Digital investments in that country. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani said in a research note that he expects China to approve the deal.More than 90% of votes cast were in favor of approving the issuance of Western Digital stock in connection with the acquisition, Western Digital said. SanDisk said 98% of its shareholders approved the deal.“The combination of SanDisk with Western Digital will enable the combined company to offer the broadest portfolio of industry-leading, innovative storage solutions to customers across a wide range of markets and applications,” said SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra in a statement.SanDisk shareholders will receive $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 Western Digital share for each share of SanDisk stock. That amounts to about $79 per share, based on Monday's closing price of $48.19 for Western Digital. The deal was valued at $86.50 a share, or about $19 billion, when it was first announced on Oct. 21. That changed when China’s Unisplendour pulled its plan to make a $3.8 billion investment for a 15% stake in Western Digital on Feb. 23, amid a U.S. government inquiry. By terminating the investment, Unisplendour triggered the alternative deal.Western Digital anticipates seeing $500 million in total cost synergies, not including tax savings, from the acquisition. Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, issued a report on Feb. 29 recommending Western Digital shareholders approve the deal and said the transaction could attain $1.1 billion in cost synergies within 12 months of closing.Shares of Western Digital and Seagate were down 1.5% each in midday trading in the stock market today, near 45 and 76, respectively.Needham analyst Richard Kugele said in a research note that the focus will now quickly shift to Western Digital being able to “streamline two organizations and extract synergy savings while maintaining the strong cash flow of the traditional core to finance the debt.”Kugele has a strong buy on Western Digital stock, with a price target of 90. He said flash-based storage systems are proving critical for the front end of data centers, and increasingly serve as primary storage.

442,STX,"Billions of Apple (AAPL) iPhones and iPads could be exposed in an iOS 9 vulnerability, Check Point Software Technology (CHKP) researchers announced early Thursday, in preparation of presenting their findings at Singapore's Black Hat Asia 2016 conference late Thursday U.S. time.Enterprise applications installed via Mobile Device Management (MDM) software are exempt from Apple’s latest security changes, which means that an attacker can hijack legitimate communications to install malicious apps, says the security firm.It’s still theoretical, Avi Rembaum, Check Point vice president of security solutions, told IBD on Wednesday. Black Hat gives researchers an opportunity to discuss hypothetical threat vectors, including this new so-called ""SideStepper"" vulnerability.""Unfortunately, a lot of those things we talk about that might happen often end up happening,"" he said.Apple didn't respond to requests for comment. Apple stock was down a fraction in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today.Apple recognized a key piece of the SideStepper vulnerability in iOS 8. For $299 a year, an enterprise can purchase an Apple certificate to upload a private app via the Apple Developer Enterprise Program.""But if someone is going to be malicious, they don’t really care about signing a (certificate) agreement, plus it’s $299 per year to get that certificate,"" Rembaum said. ""There weren't many barriers to entry.""Enterprises are headily embracing the ""Bring Your Own Device"" trend and, in one case study of a Fortune 100 company, Check Point found 318 private apps and 116 unique certificates on employees' devices. Those numbers were suspiciously high, Rembaum said.""When we looked deeper ... they were on the sketchier side and were from parts of the world that could be problematic,"" he said. ""We saw a very small number of them that would be considered white-listed (trustworthy).""So in iOS 9, Apple upped the challenges to installation, says Check Point. But the new challenges don’t cover MDM-pushed updates to employees’ devices. Of the 1.2 billion installed iPhones and iPads, 79% have iOS installed and are therefore vulnerable.Enterprises often rely on MDM services like those by BlackBerry (BBRY) (via its Good Technology acquisition), VMWare (VMW) and MobileIron (MOBL) to push updates onto employees’ devices, thereby avoiding the ""headache"" of ensuring that every app has identical settings, Rembaum said.That MDM-device connection, however, is also a powerful portal for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, he said. A hacker can, theoretically, intercept the communications between MDM and device to install a certificate and then a malicious app.Often, the interception relies on social engineering, he said.""An attacker would send a text message to the target with a link to download the configuration file,"" he said. ""It would install a certificate and configuration instructions in the phone. The only thing the user has to do is say yes to installing.""Then the attacker is in -- with access to a user's address book, microphone, photos, GPS, apps and, possibly, company data.Rembaum recommends that MDM users take a ""multilayer approach"" to mobile security. Because hackers often rely on social engineering to launch phishing attacks -- by email, text message or social media -- enterprises should train employees on red flags.Phishing attacks cost businesses more than $215 million between October 2013 and December 2014, according to a January report by the FBI.This month, Seagate Technology (STX) discovered that it had been duped into handing out nearly 10,000 W-2 forms belonging to former and current employees. The Seagate revelation came on the heels of a similar attack on privately held Snapchat.Scammers often change a single letter in an email address or impersonate a CEO's email address, Barracuda Networks’ (CUDA) Slawek Ligier and Proofpoint’s (PFPT) Ryan Kalember told IBD.Outside education, an enterprise can install Check Point’s Mobile Threat Prevention (MTP) software and have its employees install the ZoneAlarm app, Rembaum said. FireEye (FEYE), Symantec (SYMC), Intel’s (INTC) McAfee, Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Proofpoint also compete in the mobile security space.A MitM attacker creates an encrypted tunnel -- typically through a virtual private network (VPN) -- to its own site, directing a user away from the legitimate MDM. Check Point’s MTP solution hunts down that encrypted tunnel.""The user would have received the text, clicked on the link and installed the certificate,"" Rembaum said. ""Then (Check Point’s software) would reach out and block the connection.""He added: ""The actual installation of the malware wouldn’t have succeeded.""

443,STX,"Expectations that Western Digital (WDC) shareholders will agree to the acquisition of SanDisk (SNDK) increased Thursday, with Summit Research issuing an upbeat report.“We think that shareholder approval is most likely a done deal,” wrote Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan.The vote among Western Digital shareholders is set for March 15. A definitive agreement between the two companies was reached on Oct. 21.The Summit report follows another from RBC analyst Amit Daryanani, who said an analysis of the top 20 Western Digital shareholders and discussions with a large number of investors indicate “the probability is higher the deal gets approved vs. not.” He said 15 of the top 20 Western Digital shareholders also own SanDisk stock, making the potential approval likely.Western Digital and SanDisk combined had revenue of about $20 billion in 2015. Western Digital is largest provider of disk drives, ahead of Seagate Technology (STX,), though the market has struggled as PC sales decline. SanDisk is a leading provider of flash-memory chips used in smartphones, tablets, hybrid disk drives and other devices.Western Digital says the combination with SanDisk will continue to transform it into a storage solutions company with extensive product and technology assets and deep expertise in chip-based storage.The deal currently consists of Western Digital paying $67.50 a share in cash plus 0.2387 shares of Western Digital stock, making it worth about $16 billion.The deal was valued at $86.50 a share, or about $19 billion, when it was first announced on Oct. 21. That changed when China’s Unisplendour pulled its plan to make a $3.8 billion investment for a 15% stake in Western Digital on Feb. 23, amid a U.S. government inquiry. By terminating the investment, Unisplendour triggered the alternative deal.According to Sundararajan, the deal is now worth $78.82 a share, based on the current price of Western Digital shares. Western Digital stock was flat, near 47, in afternoon trading in the stock market today. SanDisk stock was near 76, up a fraction.Western Digital anticipates seeing $500 million in total cost synergies, not including tax savings, from the acquisition. Institutional Shareholder Services, a leading independent proxy advisory firm, issued a report on Feb. 29 recommending that Western Digital shareholders approve the deal. ISS said the deal could attain $1.1 billion in cost synergies within 12 months of closing.China regulators, which have a say in the transaction based on Western Digital investments in China, have yet to issue a ruling. Sundararajan expects China to approve.

445,STX,"Apple (AAPL) supplier Broadcom (AVGO) could follow its $37 billion Avago Technologies merger by shedding $1 billion in assets to launch another M&A charge, says MKM analyst Ian Ing.Ing reiterated his buy rating on Broadcom stock, but cut his price target to 160 from 163, citing wireless seasonality. Broadcom stock rose 1.7% Wednesday and was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 131.The companies completed their merger on Feb. 1, taking the Broadcom name but keeping the Avago stock ticker. When announced last March, it kicked off a record-busting $100 billion in 2015 chip sector M&A deals. Analysts say the frenzy shows no sign of slowing as organic growth decelerates and costs rise.But the chip sector has been quiet on the M&A front this year. Broadcom will likely sell $500 million in assets to de-lever from its Q1-completed merger, Ing wrote in a research report.""For Broadcom, data center/networking product cycles have become more meaningful,"" he wrote. ""And the story increasingly revolves around a quick deleverage and return to semiconductor consolidation via accretive deals.""A number of small chipmakers -- $2 billion and less market caps -- are eyeing Broadcom's design team and business units, Ing wrote. Although $1 billion would be a fast deleverage, half that is more likely.""We do not expect as significant monetization of Broadcom units as occurred with LSI,"" Ing wrote.Avago acquired LSI in May 2014 for $6.6 billion, then sold LSI's flash unit to Seagate Technology (STX)  for $450 million and LSI's networking business to Intel (INTC) for $650 million.Post-merger, Broadcom is less exposed to Apple, which is experiencing slowing iPhone sales. In January, a Credit Suisse analyst estimated 24% of the former Avago's sales stemmed from Apple. The former Broadcom was 14% tied to Apple in 2014. Joined, Broadcom-Avago gets about 8%-9% of its sales from Apple, Ing estimated.Broadcom is slated to report fiscal Q1 earnings after the close March 3.

466,STX,"A sprawling tax-fraud scheme duped Seagate Technology (STX) and Snapchat into dispensing thousands of W-2 forms, highlighting a major fissure in the cybersecurity industry, a Proofpoint (PFPT) representative said Thursday.The breach exposed nearly 10,000 former and current Seagate employees, according to a statement from the data storage firm. The breach was discovered March 1 on the heels of a similar attack on photo-sharing app Snapchat.Seagate stock fell 3.5% Tuesday as the news made headlines and fell a fraction Wednesday before rising 2.2% Thursday, and shares were up nearly 2% early Friday. Seagate confirmed the breach in an email to IBD.""The information was sent by an employee who believed the phishing email was a legitimate internal company request,"" Seagate said. Released information includes Social Security numbers and addresses of anyone employed by Seagate in 2015.Phishing attacks on businesses are becoming more prevalent, Ryan Kalember, Proofpoint senior vice president of cybersecurity strategy, told IBD. He refers to it as ""impostor fraud."" The W-2 attack is just the most recent iteration, he said.Snapchat admitted to a similar attack on Feb. 28 in a blog post titled ""An Apology to Our Employees."" The scammer impersonated CEO Evan Spiegel, successfully asking for payroll information. Internal systems and user information remained secure.Both Seagate and Snapchat reported the attacks to the FBI, which recorded more than $215 million lost in phishing attacks between October 2013 and December 2014, according to a report in January. Both firms also offered two years of credit monitoring for the victims.""When something like this happens, all you can do is own up to your mistake, take care of the people affected and learn from what went wrong,"" Snapchat wrote.Tax fraud phishing is seasonal, Kalember noted. Wire transfer requests are also popular -- and thrifty -- modes of generating a lot of money. Networking firm Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT) found that out the hard way last August after a phisher tricked it into wiring $46.7 million overseas.And scammers are becoming more sophisticated, says Slawek Ligier, Barracuda Networks’ (CUDA) vice president of product development. ""Spear-phishing"" and ""whaling"" involve targeting someone with either money or access.Tricky email tactics -- changing the ""N"" in Barracuda Networks to ""M"" or spoofing a CEO's email address -- tend to reap the most success, Ligier told IBD. From there, scammers indulge in a series of social engineering measures.""They don't want to waste their time on people who won't fall for it,"" he said. ""But the scammer will really invest a lot of time and effort to slowly reel their victim in.""Stickier yet, there are legitimate reasons to spoof a CEO's email, Kalember says. A company will allow a third-party to spoof an email -- make it appear as if the email is coming from that CEO -- for marketing purposes. A spoof can use any display name that the spoofer chooses.Traditional email protection services can't deal with spoofs, Kalember says.""Defenses are looking for malware, and they are not equipped for this,"" he said. ""There is no malware. There is no payload. And the tricky part is, there's also legitimate business emails from people who need their W-2s.""Agari CEO Patrick Peterson says his privately held company aims at this problem. Cisco Systems (CSCO) IronPort business veterans (Cisco bought IronPort in 2007) founded Agari, which uses proprietary technology to filter out phishing emails, Peterson told IBD. It differs from Proofpoint, which plans this quarter to flag phishing emails in the same vein as spam and ""adult content.""""When (executives) see these stories about Seagate, I imagine they break out into a cold sweat, thinking they have no solution,"" Peterson said.Spear-phishers differ from mass phishers. The latter sends a blast email hoping to dupe a few vulnerable people. The former involves more research and relies on social engineering to persuade a target of its legitimacy.""The best defense we have today -- which is a pretty crappy one -- is telling people to be careful,"" he said.At the annual cybersecurity RSA Conference last week in San Francisco, Calif., executives were most concerned about phishing scams, he said. Malware detection has become so sophisticated that scammers have been forced to rely on the weak human link.So far, it's working. Recent breaches of the Office of Personnel Management, Anthem (ANTM), Sony (SNE) Pictures Entertainment and Target (TGT) also began with a phishing email; they account for about 90% of all attacks, Peterson said.""This really serves as a wake-up call to the tech industry to dig deep and find solutions,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, my crystal ball says we're going to see a lot more of these notices.""

487,STX,"Seagate Technology's (STX) acquisition of Xyratex (XRTX) for about $374 million is getting mixed reviews from analysts.
"
488,STX,"Seagate, a maker of hard-disk drives for computers and other data storage systems, on Monday announced the Xyratex deal, which it expects to close mid-2014. Xyratex makes test equipment and storage subsystems.

489,STX,"""Our overall take on the transaction is that it is another incremental data point that Seagate is trying to move up the 'storage stack' and become a key supplier to the cloud service providers,"" said Andrew Nowinski, a Piper Jaffray analyst, in a research report.

"
542,STX,"""For Apple, it's a drop in the $115 billion in (its) net-cash-and-investments bucket,"" Ellis wrote in a research report. It ""would pay out surprisingly quickly, given lower-cost Nand (flash) supply and pricing leverage with other memory markers.""

657,STX,"On Monday, the Nasdaq hit a fresh record high for the first time in almost three months. A rally in tech and consumer discretionary stocks ensued, indicating that investors are choosing to ignore trade tensions and geopolitical conflicts. Instead, markets are focusing on strong economic fundamentals following last Friday’s strong jobs report.The major catalyst to the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report), which hit an all-time high. Analysts believe that this is further evidence of upbeat sentiment about the economy. With investors choosing to show confidence in a sector which has had a turbulent ride this year, this seems to be the best time to invest in tech stocks that are part of the Nasdaq.   Apple, Amazon, Microsoft Power Broader GainsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Monday, finishing at a record level for the first time since Mar 12. One of the major drivers of the day’s gains was a surge in shares of Apple. The iPhone maker’s stocks gained 0.8% to hit an all-time high. Gains were primarily attributable to the enthusiastic response to the company’s WWDC 2018 keynote. Shares of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report) also contributed to the day’s gains, increasing 1.5% to hit a record high. Microsoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) shares also gained 0.9% to hit a new record. These gains came after the software giant revealed that it was buying software developer GitHub for $7.5 billion. As a result, the Nasdaq failed to hit an intraday high by only around 0.5%.Investors Focusing on Economic FundamentalsStocks had surged last Friday following encouraging data from the Department of Labor. The economy added 223,000 jobs in May even as unemployment plummeted to an 18-year low. Additionally, wage gains remained limited, curbing fears about surging inflation which had caused losses in February.Investors continued to focus on the positive sentiment that this report spurred on Monday. Analysts are of the opinion that the surge in shares of Apple was an expression of confidence in the state of the U.S. economy.In choosing to focus on strong fundamentals, investors ignored a spate of headwinds that dampened sentiments recently. These include trade tensions with China and geopolitical concerns emanating from the discord with North Korea and the political situation in Italy.Our ChoicesFresh evidence of the United States’ robust economic health has pushed investors toward riskier assets over the last two trading days.

660,STX,"Investing in large-cap companies is a safe bet, especially during economic downturns and stringent credit conditions. Many consider large-cap stocks an essential part of their portfolio, given the stability, healthy dividends and safety cushion they offer.Large-cap funds are ideal investment options for those seeking high returns. These also come with lower risk than small-cap and mid-cap funds.Technology Sector OutshinesTechnology has been one of the most lucrative sectors for investors, year to date. This is evident from the NASDAQ Composite (IXIC) and the S&P 500’s (GSPC) rally of 7.5% and 25%, respectively, so far this year.Among sectors, technology continues to shine, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (“XLK”) registering a return of 9.5% year to date.The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cutting-edge technology such as cloud computing, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), wearables, AR/VR headsets, drones, self-driving cars and artificial intelligence (AI).Although technology stocks will gain less from the corporate tax cuts, they hoard massive amounts of cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from Trump's repatriation policy. Moreover, higher domestic cash level will make the technology stocks less susceptible to an anticipated interest rate hike in 2018.Moreover, escalating demand for sensors and software for autonomous vehicles, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS), Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR) and Internet of Things (IoT) are significant catalysts.Further, rapid development of 5G platform and technology has emerged as the next growth driver for these companies.In view of these bullish sentiments, momentum investing can be a winning strategy for those seeking high returns in a short span.

661,STX,"Tech stocks have been unpredictable at times recently, but the sector has rebounded from volatility strongly, and there is no question that tech has been the leader of the market’s strong multiyear run. However, this might mean that income investors—those focused on finding companies with solid dividends—might be feeling left out, as tech stocks aren’t really known for their payouts.Finding a strong dividend-yielding tech stock might feel like searching for a golden goose, but investors should not feel too intimidated.

662,STX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Seagate Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 12.6, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 compares in at about 19.9. If we focus on the stock’s long-term PE trend, the current level puts Seagate Technology’s current PE ratio slightly above its midpoint (which is 10.8) over the past five years.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the sector’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 21.3. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Seagate Technology has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of just 10.5, so it is fair to say that a slightly more value-oriented path may be ahead for Seagate Technology’s stock in the near term too.    P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Seagate Technology has a P/S ratio of about 1.6. This is substantially lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.3 right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is slightly below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, this suggests some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.   Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Seagate Technology currently has a Value Style Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes STX a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Seagate Technology is just 0.6, a level that is slightly lower than the industry average of 1.2. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Additionally, its P/CF ratio (another great indicator of value) comes in at 8.3, which is considerably better than the industry average of 16.4. Clearly, STX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Seagate Technology might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth grade of B and a Momentum score of A. This gives STX a VGM score—or its overarching fundamental grade—of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>)Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been encouraging. The current quarter has seen six estimates go higher in the past sixty days, compared to none lower, while the full year estimate has seen eight upward and no downward revisions in the same time period.This has had a favorable impact on the consensus estimate, as the current quarter consensus estimate has increased nearly 23.9% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has risen about 9.7%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus  Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteThis bullish trend is why the stock boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and why we are expecting outperformance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSeagate Technology is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Boasting a formidable industry rank (top 4% out of more than 250 industries) and a top Zacks Rank, the company deserves attention right now. In fact, over the past one year, the sector has clearly outperformed the broader market, as you can see below:So, it might pay for value investors to delve deeper into the company’s prospects, as fundamentals indicate that this stock could be a compelling pick.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

663,STX,"Global dividends reached a first-quarter record of $244.7 billion, marking a 10% rise from the prior-year quarter, per the Janus Henderson Global Dividend Index. The growth was driven by record payouts in the United States and Canada.U.S. dividend hit a high of $113 billion in the first quarter as almost 80% of companies augmented their payouts from the year-earlier period. A favorable currency translation, tailwinds from the tax reform and an overall strong first-quarter earnings season led to the surge.The move was no surprise for the United States. The one-time repatriation tax on about $2.5 trillion in offshore earnings and lower tax rates were long-expected to beef up dividends under the new tax scheme enacted at the start of the year. The magnitude of Q1 dividend payments at U.S. companies is showing signs of managements’ confidence in the new tax system.In Europe, excluding the UK, dividends grew 3.9% on an underlying basis, while Asia-Pacific, which excludes Japan, was an underperformer with a 3.1% decline in payouts. In the UK, underlying payouts rose 4.2%. Emerging markets saw enhanced payouts thanks mainly to special dividends.Guidance for 2018Janus Henderson projects global payouts to touch a record $1.36 trillion in 2018, representing year-on-year growth of 6% in underlying terms. Though Australia gave a downbeat performance in Q1 due to stock-specific issues, the region should rebound on a full-year basis.

664,STX,"Netflix Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 22. The company has beaten the Zack Consensus Estimate twice in the past four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 1.25%.Last quarter, the company reported earnings of 29 cents per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 32 cents, but increased 141.7% year over year. Revenues increased 30.3% year over year to $2.985 billion and beat the consensus estimate of $2.973 billion. Subscriber growth primarily helped Netflix generate significant revenues.For the fourth-quarter of 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Netflix’s earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at 41 cents and $3.259 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increase of 173.3% and 31.5%.Notably, shares of Netflix have gained 66.7% in the past year, significantly outperforming the industry’s 19.2% rally.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetflix has been drawing strength from its growing portfolio of original content. The company had a very strong programming slate in the fourth quarter, given the new seasons of popular shows like Stranger Things and The Crown.  Its new original German series, Dark also garnered positive reviews.Per Nielsen data, which was quoted by Bloomberg, the movie Bright released in December and attracted 11 million views in the first three days of release. We believe all these will translate into an increase in subscribers. In October, the company announced that it had over 109 million subscribers globally.Netflix has also been ramping up its efforts to boost regional programming. This is expected to expand its international presence as the domestic market approaches saturation.We believe the strength of its content portfolio will drive subscriber growth across the globe. Per the latest report by SensorTower, Netflix topped the list of overall non-game apps by revenues across Apple’s App Store and Google’s Play Store in 2017.However, high costs that accompany the company’s rapid international expansion and production of original content might weigh on the bottom line.Netflix, Inc.

Based in Genoa, Italy, Banca Carige seeks to enhance financial processes by improving competitiveness across its branches and overall clientele.IBM’s innovative capabilities comprising artificial intelligence (“AI”), big data, cognitive and analytics offerings will assist Banca Carige to digitally transform its processes. The new technologies will eventually aid the Italian banking group achieve the desired business goals.

Per a MarketsandMarkets report, digital transformation market is envisioned to grow at a CAGR of 19.1% to $493.39 billion by 2022 from $205.99 billion in 2017. As a result, IBM seems well-positioned to capitalize on projected growth. The report only reinforces our belief that IBM’s services hold immense potential.We note that IBM’s stock has lost 3.6% in the past year, against the industry’s rally of 1.0%.Partnership with Banca CarigeNotably, the deal was signed in the first quarter of 2018. This partnership will aid in simplifying the bank’s IT infrastructure, aid digital transformation processes, consequently enhancing client experience.

However, the projected growth rate is lower than 43% segmental growth reported in fiscal 2018. Transactional revenues are anticipated to account 20% of segment revenues and grow in the low-single digits range considering the impact of decline pertaining to Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) in Data Store revenues. Excluding Facebook, the segment is anticipated to be up 37%, down from year-ago growth of 47%.AMS segment revenues are anticipated to be down low-single digits.

669,STX,"Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) recently entered into a partnership with Israel-based global wireless broadband provider, RADWIN. The companies have teamed up to offer cost-effective broadband internet services to “underserved and unserved” rural communities worldwide.The 21st century is basically governed by the internet and consequently the access to this service forms the very basis of this world. However, per World Internet Users data, only 54.4% of world’s population utilizes internet services in 2017. The partnership is a step in the direction of bridging this immense gap by providing affordable broadband connectivity.RADWIN will develop and market TVWS offering which will complement its sub-6GHz and mmWave fixed wireless solutions. This will aid the company’s service provider users and partners to expand presence to subscribers in remote areas. The market is difficult given the terrain obstacles and vegetation but with the kind of potential that it holds, the risk might be one worth taking.As part of Airband Initiative, Microsoft partners with telecommunications companies and internet service providers (ISPs) to provide innovative solutions which enhance rural connectivity. Digital skill training is also imparted to the people under the initiative.The innovative new TVWS solutions will be provided to Airband Initiative partners, and consequently to global telecommunications industry in the second half of 2019.Shares of the company were up 1.4%, yesterday. Microsoft shares have returned 17.9% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 15.7% rally. This outperformance can primarily be attributed to its rapidly expanding efforts in Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) and Internet of Things (“IoT”) based developments. Undisturbed focus on Azure remains a key catalyst.TVWS Tech: Focal Point of the PartnershipThe strategic deal is part of the tech giant’s Airband Initiative. This initiative seeks to augment broadband coverage leveraging various technologies comprising the innovative TV White Space (TVWS), among others.TVWS generates broadband connections in ultra high frequency (UHF) bands. The technology makes communication easier and secure despite testing rural conditions.“The TV White Space radio ecosystem is rapidly growing, and we are excited to work with RADWIN to bring innovative technologies to market at a global scale,” said Paul Garnett, senior director of the Microsoft Airband Initiative.What the Investors Need to Know?In an effort to expand penetration into smaller markets at different levels, increasing participation of rural population in the digital economy becomes a necessity. Moreover, per Boston Consulting Group data, a robust cost-effective connectivity model can be developed by leveraging TVWS tech combined with other technologies.In this era of digitization, where more and more people leverage internet services for their respective purposes, this partnership holds promise.Per a MarketsandMarkets report, the global TVWS spectrum market was is envisioned to grow at a CAGR of whopping 74.3% to reach approximately $53.1 million by 2022 from $1.2 million in 2015. As a result, the partnership to deliver broadband connections powered by TVWS tech bodes well in the longer haul.Our TakeThe rural pockets bereft of internet connectivity can benefit a great deal from the solution. Consequently, businesses including the likes of education, agriculture and telemedicine, can develop and prosper.

670,STX,"Oracle Corporation (ORCL  -  Free Report) delivered stellar fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings of 99 cents per share comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents. Moreover, revenues of $11.260 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.195 billion.Earnings increased 11.2% from the year-ago quarter. This can primarily be attributed to 2.9% growth in revenues which was toward the higher range of management’s guidance of 1-3%.Structural ChangesThe company has adopted anew Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 606 using full retrospective method.The company had recently launched a bring-your-own-license (BYOL) program which allows customers to move their existing on-premise licenses to the Oracle Cloud. In doing so, Oracle claims that licenses covered by the BYOL program can neither be defined as on-premise nor as cloud.Consequently, the company now reports its new software licenses under its new Cloud license and on-premise license segment. Further, the company merged its Cloud SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS along with its software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.Share Price MovementShares of the company went down more than 3% in after-hours trading.  In the past year, the company’s shares have gained just 0.4%, underperforming the industry’s growth of 34.5%.The share price decrease can possibly be attributed to the new accounting standard adopted by the company and the structural changes which it has undergone in the quarter. Oracle no longer intends to break out its cloud revenues and does not provide any guidance on SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS. This move is likely to enhance investor concern about the company's outlook.The share price movement was also impacted by tepid second-quarter earnings guidance, adding to the woes.Cloud Drove Solid Top LineOracle’s top-line growth benefited from the ongoing cloud-based momentum. Total cloud services and license support revenues (60% of total revenues) for the quarter advanced 7% (5% in constant currency) to $6.77 billion. We believe that the company’s growing cloud market share will continue to drive top-line growth in the foreseeable future.Under the previous reporting structure in last quarter, which was called total Cloud revenues were $1.7 billion.However, total cloud license and on-premise license decreased 5.4 to $2.48 billion year over year.Management stated that Fusion ERP and Fusion HCM came in at $2.2 billion in full year 2018. Fusion Apps advanced 62% for the full year, whereas, Fusion ERP was up 68% for the full year. Fusion HCM surged 65%.Further, the next-generation autonomous database launched by Oracle, which is supported by machine learning, is now fully available and is a key catalyst for the company. Management believes that the new database will improve Oracle’s competitive position in the cloud against Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).The company’s tech ecosystem is more than $21 billion and increased 5% for fiscal 2018. Database ecosystems were up 6%. During the quarter, database new license revenues increased 9%.The company also stated that its next-generation PaaS grew 45% for the full year and came in at $1.1 billion.Total hardware revenues were almost flat year over year and came in at $$1.11 billion. Services revenues decreased 1.2% to $883 million.Operating DetailsNon-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 130 basis points (bps) to 52.9%.As a result, non-GAAP operating income during the quarter came in at $5.3 billion, up 4% from last year non-GAAP operating margin expanded 100 bps from the year-ago quarter to 47%.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowAs of May 31, 2018, Oracle had cash & cash equivalents and marketable securities of $67.3 billion, down from $70.45 billion sequentially.

Over the last 12 months, the company repurchased shares worth $11.5 billion and paid dividends of approximately $3.1 billion. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 19 cents per share, payable on Jul 31, 2018.GuidanceFor the first quarter fiscal 2019, total revenues are anticipated to grow in the range of 1-3% in constant currency.Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be between 67 cents and 69 cents for the quarter, while in constant currency non-GAAP earnings is expected to be in the range of 68-70 cents.

671,STX,"Tech stocks have been on a tear this year and Wednesday’s session was no exception with the Nasdaq closing 0.5% higher. Overall, tech stocks have been largely responsible for the long-running market rally. But bubble fears are making a comeback courtesy of a bunch of leading analysts and market watchers.They feel that monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve and the ECB could lead to a sudden selloff. However, others feel that sector fundamentals are firmly in place and valuations are far from worrying. The ability to innovate and generate strong profits make tech stocks must haves for your portfolio.Rate Hikes Raise Bear Market FearsMichael Hartnett, a strategist at Bank of America’s (BAC  -  Free Report) Merrill Lynch recently warned that tech stocks have strong downside risks. Hartnett thinks that the strong performance of tech stocks, especially the FAANG group, has led to disconnect between U.S. equity markets and events occurring in other parts of the world. Hartnett thinks that this ""conscious decoupling"" is likely to evaporate in the months ahead as major central banks undertake monetary tightening. The Fed is widely slated to raise rates this week. And record-low employment levels could lead to further rate hikes even at the cost of roiling the equity markets.Meanwhile, the ECB is also likely to begin cutting down on its bond purchases in the next few months. Emerging markets are following suit, with 33 rate hikes in the last nine months. Global monetary tightening would mean an end to easy money for the bourses, raising the risk of “quick, deep tech sell-off,” thinks Hartnett.Strong Fundamentals Still in PlaceIn contrast, analysts at Goldman Sachs (GS  -  Free Report) have taken a distinctly optimistic view of tech stocks. In a recent paper titled ""Why Technology Is Not a Bubble,"" the investment bank says that the recent success of tech stocks is attributable to strong fundamentals. This is in sharp contrast to the dot-com bubble which built up in the 1990s.Essentially, tech companies are raking in profits and creating industry-wide disruptions in the process. But valuations are not a cause for worry, according to the investment bank’s Peter Oppenheimer.Oppenheimer agrees that the collective market capitalization of Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) is greater than the annual GDP of all the 54 African countries taken together.However, such phenomenal valuations are justifiable through strong fundamental growth. Further, valuations as a share of the S&P 500 are below the levels witnessed during earlier market bubbles.Our ChoicesWall Street seems to be having a tough time making up its mind about a tech bubble. A section of analysts believe that a bubble has indeed built up. This is why looming rate hikes could soon roil the markets party, leading to a deep selloff for tech stocks.Others think that such fears are overblown. This is because recent gains are attributable to strong fundamentals. Also, valuations are not worrying and remain below historical bubble-era levels. This is why picking tech stocks still looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

672,STX,"VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.   We note that the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.30%.Last quarter, VeriSign reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 96 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny but marked an increase of 4 cents from the year-ago quarter.Revenues increased 3.2% year over year to $296 million and came slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $295 million.For the first quarter of 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for VeriSign’s earnings per share and total revenues are pegged at $1.06 and $298 million, respectively, representing an increase of 10.4% and 3.1% from the year-ago period.VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise VeriSign, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | VeriSign, Inc. QuoteDomain Registration to Drive Growth VeriSign holds a prime position in the highly regulated .com and .net domain industry. The company is the exclusive registrar of the .com, .net and .name domains per its agreements with The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). Per the company’s agreement with ICANN, the annual fee for a .net domain name registration has been increased from $8.20 to $9.02 effective Feb. 1, 2018.We believe that increasing domain name registration coupled with price hikes for domain names will drive the top line.According to the company’s latest “The Domain Name Industry Brief”, domain name registrations across all top-level domains (TLDs) signal a positive trend, increasing 0.5% sequentially to approximately 332.4 million across TLDs at the end of the fourth quarter. Domain name registrations increased 3.1 million or 0.9% year over year.On a combined basis, .com and .net domain names improved 2.4% year over year to approximately 146.1 million in the December quarter. Reportedly, new .com and .net registrations were 9 million compared with 8.8 million in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for active domain names ending .com and .net for the first quarter stands at 148 million, indicating an increase of 2.8% from the year-ago figure.We note that the company continues to benefit from strong demand in the United States as well as in international markets. VeriSign reported that .com continued to maintain its position as the largest TLD, followed by .cn (China) and .tk (Tokelau).For the first quarter, VeriSign projects domain name base registration to increase in the range of 1.5 million to 2 million.However, the negative impact of search engine adjustments on domain monetization and increasing operating expenses related to sales and marketing remain primary headwinds.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) are best avoided.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #2 and an Earnings ESP of +2.83%. This indicates a likely positive surprise.

673,STX,"Tech stocks have been unpredictable at times recently, but the sector has rebounded from volatility strongly, and there is no question that tech has been the leader of the market’s strong multiyear run. However, this might mean that income investors—those focused on finding companies with solid dividends—might be feeling left out, as tech stocks aren’t really known for their payouts.Finding a strong dividend-yielding tech stock might feel like searching for a golden goose, but investors should not feel too intimidated. In fact, dividend-focused investors can search for the best tech stocks by using the Zacks Stock Screener, the perfect one-stop screening tool for investors of all kinds.By limiting our search to companies in our “Computer and Technology” sector with Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) or better rankings, we can ensure that we are finding the highest quality stocks to buy right now. Throw in your preferred dividend yield and voila—the best tech stocks for dividend investors to target!Check out three of these stocks to buy now:1. Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report)Seagate is a global leader in hard drive manufacturing. It offers a range of disk drive products for the enterprise, client computing, and client non-computing market applications. Seagate is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. The firm is currently generating a staggering $6.78 in cash per share on the back of 32% cash flow growth. Seagate takes advantage of its strong cash position by offering investors a dividend yield of 4.3%, making it one of the most attractive income options in the entire technology sector. 2. Garmin Ltd. (GRMN  -  Free Report)Garmin is a designer of GPS navigation and wearable technology equipment. The stock is holding a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and presents a dividend yield of about 3.5%. Investors have to pay a slight premium for GRMN right now, but a valuation of 19.5x forward 12-month earnings and a PEG ratio of 2.3 are certainly not outrageous. Meanwhile, Garmin generates $3.42 in cash per share and sticks out from the rest of the technology group with its net margin of 18.6%, which dramatically outpaces its industry’s average of 1.7%. Garmin is also an efficient company, evidenced by its RoE of 15.7%. 3. Texas Instruments, Inc. (TXN  -  Free Report)Although you might recognize the brand because of its calculators, Texas Instruments is actually one of the leading suppliers of advanced semiconductors in the world. TXN is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It should be a solid year of growth for the firm, with current estimates calling for earnings to expand by 28% in 2018. The company is also witnessing cash flow growth of 19.5% right now. Texas Instruments is really a cash cow, bringing in a total of $5.34 in cash per share. Management uses its solid financial position to reward shareholders with a dividend yield of roughly 2.2% currently. Want more market analysis from this author?

674,STX,"Some of the biggest tech names are slated to report earnings this week. These results come at a time when the technology sector is grappling with several crises which have sprung up at short intervals. Of the companies, slated to report earnings this week, Facebook, Inc. (FB) has had to battle the fallout of a data leak scandal. Meanwhile, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) has been the target of several attacks from President Trump.Given this backdrop, investors would be wondering whether upcoming results can help override recent concerns. Fortunately, earnings and revenues from the sector are likely to improve in the first quarter, which makes it a good idea to pick up select tech stocks which are also likely to outperform their earnings estimates.Can Strong Results Outweigh Recent Concerns?The variety of concerns plaguing technology, a sector which largely powered an unprecedented Bull Run, has had the strongest proponents of the sector scurrying for cover. Only recently, poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (TSM) pulled down other tech majors like Apple Inc. (AAPL).But not all the worries the sector faces at the moment could snowball into threats of significant proportions. For instance, most market watchers believe that a divided Congress is unlikely to regulate data gathering of the kind practiced by Facebook or Google. Online advertising spends, therefore, are likely to remain largely unchanged.However, higher user engagement will still be topmost on the list of investor priorities. Ultimately, earnings would not only have to be good overall. They would have to be strong enough to outweigh recent sector concerns.Earnings Prospects Remain PromisingUnlike the Finance sector whose earnings performance notably improved this earnings season compared to other recent periods, the Tech sector’s earnings performance has been strong over the last many quarters. This strength is expected to continue in the Q1 earnings season as well.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter. (Read: Can Tech Earnings Live Up to Expectations?)That’s head and shoulders above the autos and conglomerate sectors, earnings for which are expected to decline by 9.6% and 1.1%, respectively during the first quarter. Overall, total Q1 earnings are expected to be up 18% from the same period last year on 5.3% higher revenues.Our ChoicesTech stocks have been battered on several fronts this year, the latest being poor guidance from Taiwan Semiconductor. However, several of the concerns surrounding the sector are unlikely to build up into something larger.For instance, U.S. lawmakers are unlikely to impose stringent regulation on tech majors in the near term. Meanwhile, in keeping with stellar fourth-quarter results, first-quarter numbers are likely to be impressive.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks that have high chances of surprising with their next earnings announcement.

It has amassed assets over $427.47 M, making it one of the average sized ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueCompanies that find themselves in the large cap category typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Considered a more stable option, large cap companies boast more predictable cash flows and are less volatile than their mid and small cap counterparts.Carrying lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, value stocks also have lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. When you look at long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in nearly all markets. But in strong bull markets, growth stocks are more likely to be winners.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.07%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 3.99%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsETFs offer a diversified exposure and thus minimize single stock risk but it is still important to delve into a fund's holdings before investing. Most ETFs are very transparent products and many disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Real Estate sector--about 24.80% of the portfolio. Utilities and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) accounts for about 1.49% of total assets, followed by Firstenergy Corp. (FE  -  Free Report) and Interpublic Group Of Companies Inc. (IPG  -  Free Report).The top 10 holdings account for about 13.91% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSPYD seeks to match the performance of the S&P 500 High Dividend Index before fees and expenses. The S&P 500 High Dividend Index is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 dividend-paying securities listed on the S&P 500 Index, based on dividend yield.The ETF has lost about -1.93% so far this year and was up about 7.73% in the last one year (as of 04/19/2018). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.44 and $38.74.The ETF has a beta of 0.77 and standard deviation of 12.27% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space.

676,STX,"Value investing is gaining popularity by the day. The success of value investors like Warren Buffett further underscores this.Buffett believes that proper understanding of the ""intrinsic value"" of a stock makes the task easier. Yardsticks such as dividend yield, the ratio of price to earnings or to book value are the most common forms of intrinsic value calculation, which can easily single out stocks that the market is currently undervaluing.However, these ratios, while not taking into account the growth potential of a stock, may end up convincing us to invest in stocks that are at a discount just because of their poor show. This may often lead to “value traps” — a situation when these value picks start to underperform over the long run as the temporary problems, which once affected the share price, turn out to be persistent.In such a case, even if you buy a stock at less than its fair value, you might end up paying more. And here comes the importance of this not-so-popular but crucial value investing metric, the PEG ratio.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateA low PEG ratio is always better for value investors.While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps determine the intrinsic value of a stock.There are some drawbacks of using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than M Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purpose)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.)Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.)Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 30 stocks that qualified the screening:The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) is a leading player in the field of titanium technologies, fluoroproducts and chemical solutions, catering to a wide range of industries with market-defining products, application expertise and chemistry-based innovations. The company has an impressive expected five-year growth rate of 15.5%.

677,STX,"Exceptional bonhomie was on display when President Trump and North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un met in Singapore on Tuesday. This was the first meeting between a sitting U.S. President and a North Korean chairman.The meeting seemed to go off unexpectedly well, considering it was preceded by threats from both sides. Ultimately, Trump and Kim signed a document which calls for the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.Several analysts have criticized the agreement, saying that it is short of specifics. But markets are likely to be impressed that an agreement has been reached at after all. A lasting détente could take a long-standing concern off investors’ plates. Investing in consumer discretionary and technology stocks, the two best performing sectors of the year looks like a smart option at this point.  Complete Denuclearization on the AnvilAt the end of the maiden meeting between a North Korean leader and a U.S. President, an agreement was signed committing to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, the two countries promised to make efforts to create a lasting “peace regime” across Korea.On being asked about when said denuclearization would take place, Trump quipped:  ""We're starting that process very quickly — very, very quickly."" The U.S. President also claimed that the Korean conflict “will end soon.” In return the United States has promised to address concerns that it wished to affect a regime change in North Korea.War Games to End, Follow-Up Negotiations PlannedThe “comprehensive” document also entails that the two sides will continue to meet for follow-up negotiations and will seek to improve bilateral relations. Specifically, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo and senior officials from the North Korean side will conduct further negotiations.Trump also stated that the United States will cease to conduct “very provocative” war games near North Korea. This will help the United States save “a tremendous amount of money.”However, the United States would not be removing any troops from the Korean Peninsula at this point. Sanctions would also remain firmly in place.  Our ChoicesCritics of the freshly concluded agreement point out that it is low on specifics. However, it is certainly a milestone, considering that even a meeting between the United States and North Korea seemed unlikely a few months ago. The development is likely to gladden investors since it addresses a lingering and prominent concern.Consumer discretionary and technology stocks, the best performing sectors of the year, are likely to receive a major boost from to the positive sentiment generated by these developments. Adding these stocks to your portfolio looks like a smart option at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

Meanwhile, for the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.61 per share on $6.18 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.8% and 5.39%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and C, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 17.5X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 23.1X versus its peer group's average of 16.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.7. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

680,STX,"Data compiled by independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) – shows mixed results for PC shipments in first-quarter 2018. The figures as well as opinions of the two research firms are widely different.The preliminary data released by Gartner depicts that PC shipment in the quarter shrunk 1.4% year over year to 61.7 million units. This also marks the 14th straight quarter of year-over-year fall — the longest duration of decline in the PC industry’s history.Gartner noted that sluggish shipment in the Asia/Pacific region, particularly in China, resulted in the decline. Per Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, “Some state-owned and large enterprises postponed new purchases or upgrades, awaiting new policies and officials’ reassignments after the session of the National People’s Congress in early March” resulting in a lackluster demand across China’s business market.This apart, Kitagawa also mentioned that vendors have been waiting for Intel’s (INTC  -  Free Report) new eighth generation core processors, thus, taking a cautious approach toward overstocking. Also, some inventory carryover from fourth-quarter 2017 impacted first-quarter 2018 shipment.Nevertheless, IDC has a different view. Per the research firm, the PC market continued to display a stabilizing trend, with shipment remaining flat at 60.4 million units during the quarter as compared with the year-ago quarter.The results indicate that PC vendors have been benefiting from continued upgrades to Windows 10 systems by business community and elevated demand for premium notebooks from consumer as well as commercial segments, per the research firm.We believe the disparity in data and comments might be due to the different techniques used by the firms for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products, specially Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system.Notably, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and detachable, such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer.Different Takes on Component PricesThe firms have different take on component prices. Per Gartner, material prices are still rising as “component companies remain cautious about expanding their production capabilities” due to softness in the smartphone market and prevailing uncertainty in the PC market.This has resulted in escalated average selling prices (ASPs) of PCs. Kitagawa further noted, ""With fewer people buying new machines, manufacturers need to get the highest profit margin from each sale. To do that, they are raising the selling points and focusing on customer experience or perception of value.""On the contrary, per IDC, pricing has eased as component supply has improved from the first-quarter 2017 level.Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % Return Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % ReturnRegion-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms have a slightly different opinion. Per Gartner, Asia/Pacific and the U.S. regions registered declines of 3.9% and 2.9%, respectively, while all other regions recorded marginal growth. As already discussed above, China chiefly gave rise to the dismal performance in the Asia/Pacific region, registering a 5.7% decline in unit shipment.On the other hand, IDC noted modest growth in the United States, after six straight quarters of decline, while Japan retained its growth momentum for the seventh consecutive quarter. The Latin America region continues to show its recovery trend. However, like Gartner, IDC too stated that the Asia/Pacific (excluding Japan) (APeJ) region witnessed a soft performance.Top Vendors ListAlthough both research firms’ data varies, the organizations have similar views when it comes to positioning the top three vendors. The firms agree that HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) continues to be the market leader in this space, followed by Lenovo and Dell.However, for the fourth and fifth spot, the firms’ opinions differ. Per Gartner, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) holds the fourth position and Acer is placed at the fifth spot. On the other hand, IDC ranks Acer fourth and Apple in the fifth position.Both firms agreed that Dell recorded strongest year-over-year growth in the first quarter. Moreover, per Gartner, Dell replaced HP in the United States, climbing up the ladder to the top spot.What’s AheadAlthough the overall PC market is still plagued with challenges, we believe it is moving toward stabilization. According to Gartner’s report, shipment declined for the 14th consecutive quarter, but we note that the fall has moderated.Furthermore, the forward-looking statement of IDC clears the scenario. Neha Mahajan, senior research analyst, Devices & Displays at IDC, stated that ""A likely rise in commercial activity amidst a positive economic environment is expected to further strengthen demand. The retail platform too shows signs of stability especially with a fast-growing gaming community adding to the confidence.""An improving trend in PC shipment will benefit business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Intel, Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Of the firms discussed above, Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while HP Inc. and Seagate carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Intel has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

681,STX,"On Apr 10, shares of Seagate Technology Inc. (STX  -  Free Report) rallied about 5.4% to $59.35 per share on the heels of a rating upgrade from Morgan Stanley.Analyst Katy Huberty upgraded Seagate from “equal weight” to “overweight,” with a $72 price target. Huberty stated, ""We believe accelerating IT budget and data storage growth in the Data Era are underappreciated by investors.""The upgrade follows an increased interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. Exponential growth in stored data, Nearline’s rapid adoption, stable HDD pricing environment and low inventory levels are positives. We believe this could be a potential long-term growth driver for Seagate, making the stock a lucrative opportunity for investors who want to capitalize on this shift in the storage industry.Strong Demand for HDD: Key CatalystHDD requirement is growing due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Per management, in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the major top-line drivers. 12-terabyte helium product is also gaining favor among users. High customer satisfaction is likely to boost the market adoption of these products.Further, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments grew 0.7% on a year-over-year basis to 70.6 million units.Seagate also expects its exabyte shipments to be around 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes. The company has experienced exabyte growth in all end markets that include PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets.Other PositivesNotably, the shares of this second largest manufacturer of HDDs have returned 22.8% year over year, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 19.4%.Additionally, advancement of cloud storage technologies in the industry is a tailwind. This has led to an increase in the deployment of high capacity mass storage products, which bodes well for Seagate.Moreover, the company’s long-term agreement with Toshiba for NAND chips supply will help it to expand product portfolio rapidly. Further, Seagate’s effort to improve areal density with the ramp up of heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology is expected to be shipped in 2019. This is likely to drive revenues in 2019.These factors are expected to keep Seagate’s earnings per share (EPS) on a growth trajectory, which is currently projected at 15.6%. Notably, the company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the trailing four quarters.Currently, Seagate is a Zacks #3 (Hold) Ranked stock with a VGM score of A.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Applied Materials, Inc.

682,STX,"After hitting a record high last week, the Nasdaq hit a fresh peak on Jun 20. Investors feel tech stocks can continue to chalk up gains even as trade relations between the United States and China worsen. This is because they are less susceptible to tariffs than industrials. Also, China’s ability to act against U.S. tech companies may be limited by its efforts to build its own tech industry.Investors also remain hopeful that negotiations can reduce the impact of tariffs.  Germany’s decision to do away with car tariffs is an example of how trade disputes can be settled amicably. With the economy in fine fettle and no signs of a bubble in sight, investing in tech stocks still looks like a profitable option. Tech Stocks Surge Higher, Germany Dials Down TensionsThe Nasdaq gained 0.7% on Jun 20 to hit a new all-time high, boosted primarily by Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) which also hit record levels. Shares of Facebook and Netflix gained 2.3% and 2.9%, respectively.Netflix’s surge was attributable to Disney’s revised offer for Fox’s entertainment business. Subsequently, other media majors like Netflix and Viacom, Inc. (VIAB  -  Free Report) gained with investors speculating that more such deals are around the corner.Meanwhile, heads of BMW (BAMXF  -  Free Report), Volkswagen (VLKAY  -  Free Report) and Daimler (DDAIF  -  Free Report) met the U.S. ambassador to Germany, according to The Wall Street Journal. During the meeting, they floated the idea of abolishing car tariffs between the United States and the EU. This development has dialed down trade tensions and indicates that negotiations could reduce the impact of tariffs.Can Tech Stocks Withstand Tariff Shocks?Investors increasingly feel that tech stocks are not as susceptible to tariffs as say home appliance markets or industrial companies. According to Sameer Samana, a strategist at Wells Fargo’s (WFC  -  Free Report) Investment Institute, losses suffered by U.S. markets due to trade tensions are largely temporary. Ultimately, investors choose to focus on the strong performance of the domestic and global economies.Samana stresses that tech companies have been the leading gainers during market recoveries from losses attributable to trade-related issues. This is primarily because of their strong earnings performances. Further, China’ ability to impose tariffs on U.S. tech companies may be limited even as its attempts to build up its own tech industry.Our ChoicesTech stocks have chalked up strong gains despite the persistence of trade tensions. Investors feel that technology may be not be as vulnerable to tariffs as other sectors, such as industrials. Further, China may not be able to raise tariffs on tech companies beyond a point as its attempts to develop its own tech sector.Investing in tech stocks, which make up the Nasdaq, looks like a smart option at this time. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners.

Let us delve deeper and analyze the factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock a hot pick. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. What Makes the Stock an Attractive Pick?Q1 Results, Upbeat GuidanceCadence delivered strong results for first-quarter 2018. Both the top and bottom lines fared better than the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as management’s guided ranges. Notably, the company has adopted the new revenue rules of ASC 606 and accordingly incorporated the same while reporting first-quarter results.Cadence reported non-GAAP earnings of 40 cents per share for the first quarter, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a couple of cents.Revenues increased 8.5% year over year to $517.3 million, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $506 million.Robust adoption of the company’s digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an ever expanding customer base fueled overall year-over-year growth. The company has also witnessed significant demand from aerospace and defense sectors.The company raised 2018 outlook expecting first-quarter momentum to sustain.

Moreover, earnings are expected to register 8.4% improvement in fiscal 2019. Similarly, Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 revenues of $2.08 reflects year-over-year growth of 7%.The stock has a long-term expected earnings per share growth rate of 12%.Valuation Looks RationalThe company currently has a trailing 12-month Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.76. This is quite low compared with the current P/E for the industry that is pegged at 507.60. Its lower-than-market positioning indicates that there is room for an upside in the quarters ahead.Growth DriversCadence offers products and tools that help customers to design electronic products. Robust adoption of company’s digital and signoff, custom and analog, and IP solutions along with an expanding customer base remains a positive. Significant demand from aerospace and defense sectors is a key catalyst. Further, increasing investments on emerging trends like Internet-of-things (IoT), augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) and autonomous vehicle sub-systems present significant growth opportunity for the company, going forward. Reduction in long-term debt and improvement in cash balance are tailwinds.To ConcludeThe company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 2.8%.We expect the trend to continue and drive the overall financial performance of this stock.Some other top-ranked stocks in the technology sector are NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA  -  Free Report), Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Long-term earnings estimates for NVIDIA, Western Digital and Seagate are currently pegged at 10.25%, 19% and 18.9%, respectively.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

685,STX,"President Trump appears to have identified China’s Achilles’ heel, and he’s making the most of it.Accordingly, the President is doing everything he can to deny China the semiconductors it needs to get to “Made In China 2025” with the goal of forcing the Chinese administration to lower the country’s trade surplus with the U.S. by $200 billion.We’ve already seen ZTE as a casualty of this war, with management recently telling investors that the inability to access chips from companies like Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) could be an existential issue.The U.S. has also blocked every deal China has attempted, directly or indirectly, to acquire American semiconductor companies or technology. Market research firm IC Insights’ president Bill McClean says that China doesn’t have the necessary technology to design and manufacture advanced chips today, even if it can muster the resources. So it’s believed that if the U.S. blocks China’s access to technology and prevents agreements to transfer technology as a condition of doing business in China, the country won’t be able to reach parity/lead in the market.Since this is exactly what China is looking for, we have the makings of a deal.So Mr. Trump took to tweeting again late Friday: “Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!”That result, according to state-run China Daily, is ""the constructive agreement between Beijing and Washington to keep discussing contentious trade issues, instead of continuing the two-way barrage of tariffs, which pretty much brought the two countries to the brink of a trade war.""In the meantime, China is not sitting around. There have been rumblings about a new fund to drive semiconductor innovation in the country and just as the U.S. delegation was meeting with the President, the Wall Street Journal reported that the government-backed China Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund Co. was getting ready to announce a 300 billion yuan ($47.4 billion) fund to drive development of its semiconductor industry. In 2014, it had raised 139 billion yuan ($21.8 billion) that was invested in over 70 projects across the country.Unlike last time when only the government and its agencies invested in the fund, this time, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has reportedly also invited U.S. chipmakers. It is, however, doubtful that they will invest in a fund set up to drive them out of business, especially given the current political environment. And also because an excessive supply of Chinese chips will drive down prices in the global market and affect profitability across the industry, thereby slowing down its pace of innovation.It’s hard to tell where the talks are headed but China is likely to agree to a compromise.RecommendationsBecause of the China related uncertainty on the segment, the semiconductor industry isn’t the best place to invest in right now. While some Zacks Rank #1(Strong Buy) options like Mellanox Technologies (MLNX  -  Free Report), Texas Instruments (TXN  -  Free Report), Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report), Micron (MU  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report)) are there, it’s probably a better idea to take a look at the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

686,STX,"Red Hat Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jun 21.We note that, on an average, the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.17% in the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, Red Hat delivered positive earnings surprise of 13.75%.Earnings jumped 49.2% on a year-over-year basis, primarily driven by strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion.Revenues increased 22.8% year over year to almost $772.3 million, primarily on the back of strong demand for hybrid cloud solutions as well as aggressive cross-selling. The figure was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $762 million.Buoyed by solid results, Red Hat stock has returned 46.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 16.7% rally in the industry it belongs to.  Strong Partner Base & Acquisitions to Drive GrowthWe believe that Red Hat’s strong partner base that includes the likes of IBM, Intel, Dell Technologies, Google cloud platform, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) will continue to drive growth.The partnerships are helping Red Hat to cross-sell cloud-based technology across its customer base. Management expects the expanding partner base to drive 80% of new bookings in the near term.Additionally, complementary acquisitions have led to a favorable product mix, which is, in turn, bolstering overall results.The company’s strategy of making acquisitions (CoreOS, Permabit, Codenvy, 3scale, Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank, Codenvy) that can be easily integrated into current business has expanded its product portfolio into higher-growth segments, such as Hybrid cloud and other emerging technologies (Cloud Management, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Storage).OpenShift continues to gain traction, which is a key catalyst for the soon-to-be reported quarter. Another driving force for the quarter is Red Hat’s dominance in containerized application development.For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, Red Hat expects revenues between $800 million and $810 million. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to be 68 cents per share.What Our Model Says?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates.

687,STX,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jun 20. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this memory chip maker will be able to continue its impressive performance in the quarter.Notably, Micron has delivered positive earnings surprises for 10 straight quarters. Over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 8%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.As long as memory chip prices and demand continue to rise, Micron is likely to keep benefiting. The ongoing investigation by the Chinese government on allegations that Micron, along with Samsung and SK Hynix, indulged in fixing memory prices, is unlikely to conclude any time soon. This lowers the possibility of any negative impact on demand and prices in the near term.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Micron is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. Per our model, a stock with a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold), has higher chances of beating estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Micron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 but has an Earnings ESP of +0.00%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.However, the stock is likely to register massive year-over-year growth on both the counts, i.e. revenues and earnings per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal third-quarter’s earnings is pegged at $3.14, which is 93.8% higher than the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.62. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $7.70 billion, up 38.3% from the prior-year quarter tally.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. Quote Let’s see what’s driving this overwhelming expectation.DRAMs to Continue Driving RevenuesMicron has been the key beneficiary of the upswing in DRAM prices and strong demand which was triggered in the second half of calendar-year 2016. DRAM, which is one of Micron’s biggest revenue contributing segment (71% of 2Q18 revenues), is likely to deliver better numbers, given a supply shortage and increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) at datacenters. This should further drive demand for DRAMs. Notably, AI-enabled servers require five to six times the capacity of regular DRAMs compared to standard cloud servers.Going ahead, rising demand for DRAMs from autonomous vehicle manufacturers is expected to have aided the company’s to-be-reported quarterly results. Self-driving vehicles need to make real-time decisions by analyzing large amounts of data, which necessitates the use of high-performance DRAMs.Declining NAND Prices to Partially Mute Top-Line GrowthIn the last fiscal, the company witnessed impressive growth in NAND revenues due to the massive demand-supply gap which escalated chip prices. Nonetheless, we expect this segment’s growth rate to have remained moderate in the fiscal third quarter as the supply-demand gap has narrowed down significantly, according to various research firms, which is affecting chip prices adversely.Notably, in the fiscal second quarter, Micron witnessed a low-double-digit rise in bit shipments, while average selling price (ASP) declined in the mid-teens range. Therefore, looking at the current scenario, we believe decline in ASP will have negatively impacted the company’s NAND revenues and margins, and somewhat offset the benefits from improved demand and prices for DRAM products.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.77% and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1.Juniper Networks, Inc. (JNPR  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.54% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.eBay Inc. (EBAY  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.78% and holds a Zacks Rank of 3.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

688,STX,"Micron Technology Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) is firing on all cylinders driven by a surge in DRAM and NAND chip prices. This is primarily due to imbalances between industry demand and supply, which are leading to periodic shortage and temporary price hike.Micron is benefiting from robust demand for its high-performance chips in rapidly growing markets like Cloud Computing, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Augmented Reality (AR) and varied application of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in fiscal 2018 and 2019 earnings has increased significantly over the last 30 days, primarily driven by improving fundamentals and strong growth prospects.The stock hit a 52 week high of $49.89 on Nov 22. Moreover, Micron shares have returned 126.6% year to date, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of 16.6%.DRAM Demand Remains StrongWe note that DRAM accounted for 66% of fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 revenues. Cloud sales jumped roughly 50% year over year driven by increasing DRAM content per server.DRAMeXchange projects that demand for DRAM will jump 20.6% in 2018 from an estimated increase of 19.6% in 2017. The primary driver is expected to be higher storage demand from smartphones and servers.Smartphones have witnessed an increase of 33.4% in DRAM content this year, to an average of 3.2 GB per device. As smartphone original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) plan to launch devices with higher capacity and more demanding applications like AR and AI, demand for DRAM is expected to grow much faster.Moreover, server DRAM demand is expected to remain strong as Cloud Data Center customers seek innovative solutions to reduce their workload. The high-density modules based on advanced manufacturing nodes have come to the market, urging server OEMs to overhaul and shift to new technology for better results. This also provides significant growth opportunity for Micron.Expanding Footprint in SSD MarketMicron has been expanding into the solid-state drive (SSD) storage market that has helped it to offset sluggishness in the PC market. SSDs take less space, which means it is more suitable for mobile, thinner laptops and tablets. In the fourth quarter, storage revenues soared 71%, primarily driven by strong demand for SSD products.In this regard, Micron’s partnership with Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) has given a significant boost to its high-value enterprise SSD portfolio. Management projects healthy demand for SSDs, with demand for higher-density SSDs expected to improve in the long haul.Per TechNavio, the enterprise SSD market is projected to witness a CAGR of 17% over 2016-2020. The strong projection bodes well for Micron.Zacks Rank & Other PicksMicron currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) are two other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector. Both carry the same Zacks Rank as that of Micron. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long-term earnings growth for Intel and NVIDIA is currently pegged at 8.4% and 11.2%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

689,STX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.5% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsSeagate reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 96 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a dime. However, the figure declined 3% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues of $2.63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion but decreased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, both the top and bottom line figures witnessed a sequential improvement, primarily attributed to strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.At the end of the quarter, the company participated in a Bain Capital led consortium. The consortium has entered into an agreement with Toshiba Corporation for the acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corporation. Seagate has committed $1.25 billion for the takeover, which is scheduled for March 2018.This participation will enable Seagate to enter into an agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, thereby helping in its innovation of hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions.Performance in DetailDuring the quarter, Seagate shipped a record 70.3 exabytes of HDD storage, with an average capacity of 1.9 terabytes per drive. The company shipped 27.2 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market, each with an average capacity of 3.9 terabytes.Notably, the advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies are tailwinds for Seagate’s performance. Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market.Nearline products’ average capacity per drive crossed 5.4 terabytes. Management noted that the company’s 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter. Around 1 million units were shipped, which was thrice as much as in the previous quarter. Growth in the 12-terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging. Given the impressive customer feedback, the company expects to bank on the market adoption of these products.Within the edge and customer verticals, the notebook compute segment saw 37% year-over-year growth with exabytes increasing 75% from the year-ago quarter. Gaming business revenues were up 13% sequentially.Non-HDD segment revenues witnessed a 17% year-on-year increase and a 30% improvement sequentially to $242 million.Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin was 29%. Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 17% on a year-over-year basis to $408 million. This decrease in expenses was primarily due to certain cost improvement initiatives.The company divested a major portion of its high performance computing assets, which is anticipated to result in a savings of approximately 20 million a year.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowSeagate ended the September quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion and 289 million ordinary shares outstanding. The company’s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the September quarter to be paid on Jan 3, 2018.During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $237 million and free cash flow was $113 million.GuidanceManagement anticipates, in an era of advancement of cloud solutions and growing cloud and silicon storage business segments, second-quarter revenues to increase 3% to 5% compared to the first quarter, backed by a strong growth in exabyte demand.Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to decrease 2% to 3% from the prior quarter with further cost stringent approaches.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?Following the release, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been two revisions higher for the current quarter. While looking back an additional 30 days, we can see even more upward momentum. There have been three moves higher compared to two lower  in the last 60 days.Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus  Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Seagate's stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an F. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Zacks' style scores indicate that the company's stock is suitable for value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock. The magnitude of these revisions also looks promising. Notably, the stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect in-line returns from the stock in the next few months.

691,STX,"U.S. stocks seem to have shrugged off all uncertainties regarding nagging trade tensions between the United States and China. The one-and-a-half-month-long tech tantrums also have eased and rising rate worries have probably taken a backseat after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data in April.Apple Inc. (AAPL) appeared to be the showstopper on Friday as it sprung to a record high of $184.25 during Friday on news that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc had beefed up its stake in the iPhone maker.  Apple shares jumped more than 3.9% on May 4, 2018, marking the largest weekly percentage gain since October 2011.Apple’s ascent eradicates fears about subdued iPhone demand which clouded the tech and semiconductor market a few days back. The technology giant topped the earnings and revenue estimates in the most-recent earnings report. Apple beefed up its plan to return cash to its shareholders through dividend hikes and additional buybacks (read: ETFs to Buy Post Apple's Strong Q2 Result).On the other hand, April’s only 0.1% rise in wages was below expectations. U.S. employers added 164,000 new jobs in April, falling short of market expectations of 192,000 jobs. This means that the Fed is less likely to hurry in raising rates further. Naturally, hopes of a few more months of cheap money inflows boosted stocks in the recent session.Added to this, oil prices hit the highest level since November 2014. Tight global supplies on the Venezuela issue and the OPEC output cut deal, and the likely new U.S. sanctions against Iran led to this bump (read: Why to Consider Leveraged Oil ETFs Now).As a result, the three major U.S. stock indexes rose more than 1% on Friday. Three big ETFs including SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY  -  Free Report), SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA  -  Free Report) and PowerShares QQQ ETF (QQQ  -  Free Report) added about 1.4%, 1.26% and 1.9%, respectively, on May 4.High Momentum ETFsAgainst this backdrop, investors can consider high momentum stocks and ETFs for profits.

692,STX,"Model N Inc. (MODN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings on May 8.In the first quarter, Model N had delivered adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share against the year-ago quarter’s loss of 15 cents per share. The figure also compared favorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 5 cents per share.Model N surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 53.24%.Model N delivered first-quarter fiscal 2018 revenues of $39.1 million which surged 39% on a year-over-year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $37 million. The figure also surpassed the guided range of $37 million to $37.5 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Outlook and Zacks EstimatesModel N anticipates non-GAAP net loss in the range of 3-5 cents per share for the second quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at a loss of 4 cents per share, in line with the mid-point of the guided range.The company expects fiscal second-quarter 2018 GAAP revenues to come in the range of $38-$38.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $38.3 million, in line with the guided range, translating to year-over-year growth of 15.21%.Notably, Model N’s shares have returned 9.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s rally of 5.7%.Strengthening Revenue Cloud: Key CatalystModel N’s Revenue Cloud offering for med-tech, pharma, semiconductor, manufacturing and high tech companies remains a positive.During the quarter, Model N introduced Revenue Management platform to enhance digital reinvention experience. The company also launched Model N CPQ (Configure, Price and Quote), Model N Channel Cloud and Revenue Cloud for High Tech suites.The new solutions will ensure that customers smoothly transform business digitally and realize business goals by keeping their functioning updated. It will help Model N to retain as well as expand its clientele, going forward.Model N’s growth prospects in the life sciences & high technology is bright owing to increasing ineffectiveness of legacy systems. The company’s solutions provide higher Return on Investment (“ROI”) as well as plug gaps in the end-to-end revenue management process that legacy systems fail to do. This improves top-line growth of the companies, consequently bolstering adoption of Model N’s solutions.Other Factors to ConsiderThe integration of Revitas, completed during fiscal 2017, has expanded Model N’s product suite and customer base.SaaS & Maintenance revenues of $32.3 million grew 43% year over year in the last quarter. The company continues to make steady progress in its transformation to a 100% Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) based model. This move will boost the top line, going forward. However, the transformation is likely keep the bottom line under pressure, while considering the second-quarter performance.In the first quarter the company won several deals in high tech and life sciences including the likes of DexCom, Amgen, Tiro, CSL, Intel (INTC  -  Free Report) and Seagate (STX  -  Free Report). This bodes well for Model N’s top-line growth.However, increasing competition from well-established players like salesforce.com and Workday remains a headwind. Increasing expenditure to develop products is likely to hurt margins at least in the near-term.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

694,STX,"Tech stocks recently faced a severe downturn, sparked off by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.’s (TSM  -  Free Report) weak financial outlook for the second quarter. Adding to investor concerns were persistent worries over weak demand for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhones.In March, the data privacy scandal which hit Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) triggered a broad selloff in tech shares. These concerns had then spilt over into April, spooking tech investors.However, it now seems that strong earnings from the FAANG group of stocks have dispelled lingering concerns surrounding the sector. Tech stocks have rebounded strongly and are lucrative investment options at present.  Apple Consolidates Winning Streak, Facebook Sparks ReboundAhead of earnings on Tuesday, shares of Apple gained 2.3%, powering a 0.9% increase for the Nasdaq. Apple posted second quarter 2018 earnings of $2.73 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.69.Revenues came in at $61.1 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $61.1 billion. iPhone unit sales were up 3% from the prior-year quarter, with iPhone segment revenue coming in 14% higher. (Read: Apple Posts Earnings Beat & Strong Guidance, Hikes Dividend By 16%)Further, Apple said that it would be raising its dividend by 16% while also announcing “a new $100 billion share repurchase authorization.” Of course, the initial tech rebound was sparked off by stellar results from Facebook which helped tech stocks rebound on Apr 26.The social media giant comfortably surpassed both earnings and revenue estimates for the first quarter.

695,STX,"Value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. After all, who wouldn’t want to find stocks that are either flying under the radar and are compelling buys, or offer up tantalizing discounts when compared to fair value?One way to find these companies is by looking at several key metrics and financial ratios, many of which are crucial in the value stock selection process. Let’s put Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) stock into this equation and find out if it is a good choice for value-oriented investors right now, or if investors subscribing to this methodology should look elsewhere for top picks:PE RatioA key metric that value investors always look at is the Price to Earnings Ratio, or PE for short. This shows us how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings in a given stock, and is easily one of the most popular financial ratios in the world. The best use of the PE ratio is to compare the stock’s current PE ratio with: a) where this ratio has been in the past; b) how it compares to the average for the industry/sector; and c) how it compares to the market as a whole.On this front, Seagate Technology has a trailing twelve months PE ratio of 9.1, as you can see in the chart below:This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 stands at about 20.7. If we focus on the long-term PE trend, Seagate Technology’s current PE level puts it below its midpoint over the past five years, with the number having risen rapidly over the past few months.Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the broader industry’s trailing twelve months PE ratio, which stands at 12.1. At the very least, this indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.We should also point out that Seagate Technology has a forward PE ratio (price relative to this year’s earnings) of 9.4, which is tad higher than the current level. So it is fair to expect an increase in the company’s share price in the near term.P/S RatioAnother key metric to note is the Price/Sales ratio. This approach compares a given stock’s price to its total sales, where a lower reading is generally considered better. Some people like this metric more than other value-focused ones because it looks at sales, something that is far harder to manipulate with accounting tricks than earnings.Right now, Seagate Technology has a P/S ratio of about 1.1. This is a bit lower than the S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.4x right now. Also, as we can see in the chart below, this is well below the highs for this stock in particular over the past few years.If anything, STX is in the lower end of its range in the time period from a P/S metric, suggesting some level of undervalued trading—at least compared to historical norms.Broad Value OutlookIn aggregate, Seagate Technology currently has a Value Score of A, putting it into the top 20% of all stocks we cover from this look. This makes Seagate Technology a solid choice for value investors, and some of its other key metrics make this pretty clear too.For example, the PEG ratio for Seagate Technology is just 0.5, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 1x. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, STX is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles.What About the Stock Overall?Though Seagate Technology might be a good choice for value investors, there are plenty of other factors to consider before investing in this name. In particular, it is worth noting that the company has a Growth Score of A and a Momentum Score of C. This gives STX a Zacks VGM score — or its overarching fundamental grade — of A. (You can read more about the Zacks Style Scores here >>Meanwhile, the company’s recent earnings estimates have been favorable. The current quarter has seen six estimates go lower in the past sixty days, while the full year estimate has seen one up and eight down in the same time period.This has had a significant impact on the consensus estimate as the current quarter consensus estimate has risen by 2.7% in the past two months, while the full year estimate has jumped 2.6%. You can see the consensus estimate trend and recent price action for the stock in the chart below:Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus  Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteThe stock has just a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and we are looking for in-line performance from the company in the near term.Bottom LineSeagate Technology is an inspired choice for value investors, as it is hard to beat its incredible lineup of statistics on this front. Furthermore, a strong industry rank (among Top 46% of more than 250 industries) instills our confidence o the stock. However, with a Zacks Rank #3, it is hard to get too excited about this company overall. In fact, over the past two years, the broader industry has clearly underperformed the market at large, as you can see below:So, value investors might want to wait for estimates and analyst sentiment to turn around in this name first, but once that happens, this stock could be a compelling pick.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

696,STX,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fiscal first-quarter 2018 results on Oct 26. Notably, the company has a decent record of earnings surprises with an average positive surprise of 9.55% in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company came up with a positive surprise of 3.53%.In fiscal fourth-quarter 2017, the company reported non GAAP earnings of $2.93 per share compared with $1.03 reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues increased 38.5% year over year to $4.84 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.80 billion. Both the top and bottom line figures were better than the guided range.Let’s take a look at the factors that are expected to influence the first-quarter 2018 earnings.Key Growth DriversWe believe Western Digital will benefit from positive synergies derived from the SanDisk acquisition. The latter’s product portfolio is aiding the company’s expansion in the solid state drive (SSD) market. This is also anticipated to provide Western Digital with a competitive advantage against peers like Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Further, the continuous enhancement of the company’s product suite is a positive. The development of the industry’s first 3D NAND technology with 96 layers of storage capability in June was significant. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a major tailwind.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteNotably, the company completed the acquisition of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup during the quarter. The company also entered into a definitive agreement to buy Tegile Systems, a provider of flash-driven storage arrays for database. We believe these acquisitions will help the company in expanding its presence with a wider range of products and solutions.However, the ongoing legal tussle with Toshiba regarding the memory unit in Japan remains a concern. Nevertheless, strong demand for NAND flash memory chips is anticipated to be a key catalyst.Guidance & EstimatesFor fiscal first-quarter 2018, revenues are expected to be approximately $5.10 billion, which is slightly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.12 billion.Management expects non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.25–$3.35 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.30 per share is in line with the mid-point of the guided range.Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, non-computable unit shipments are anticipated to amount to $16.7 million, while the computable unit shipments are projected to total $19 million.Zacks Rank and Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

698,STX,"Micron (MU  -  Free Report) investors certainly ignored the “Sell in May and Go Away” adage in early morning trading Tuesday, with shares of the popular memory chip manufacturer gaining about 1.5%—despite continued volatility throughout the broader market.Shares of Micron have actually struggled to generate momentum since the company’s latest earnings announcement in late March, suggesting that investors are no longer piling into this growth stock en masse.Part of this has to do with muted expectations for the entire memory market going forward, with many bearish traders calling for the expiration of cyclical growth trends to cause a major pullback soon. However, Micron’s outlook was relatively sound just a month and a half ago, and its growth prospects appear strong for at least the next year.This means that Micron has entered an extremely attractive territory for value investors. In fact, it might be one of the strongest value plays in the entire technology sector. Here’s three reasons why Micron looks so cheap right now.Forward 12-Month EarningsMicron shares are currently trading at a significant discount to the company’s peer group in terms of forward 12-month earnings: Micron’s peer group includes Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Seagate (STX  -  Free Report), and Toshiba. Each of these companies has expertise in different areas and are not always directly competing, but they all reflect the commoditization of the memory business.As we can see, Micron is cheaper than this group when looking at its Forward P/E. This tried-and-true value metric accounts for the company’s expected profits over the next year, so investors can rest assured that they are getting a great price for Micron based on its future outlook.PEG RatioIn addition to the Forward P/E, value investors are always interested in a stock’s PEG ratio. Here’s how Micron has stacked up against its peers recently: The PEG is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company’s expected earnings growth rate. Some investors are willing to pay premiums for companies with explosive growth potential, but the PEG helps value investors find stocks that are both undervalued and set to expand rapidly.As we can see, Micron’s PEG has traded basically in line with its peer group over the past year, but this stills comes in at a noticeable discount to the average of 1.9 displayed by our larger “Computer and Technology” sector.Improving Analyst OutlookThe above metrics have helped Micron earn an “A” grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. Of course, this is only part of the picture for most value investors. Indeed, we have found that “cheap” stocks are the strongest when they are paired with great Zacks Ranks.The proven Zacks Rank model, which emphasizes earnings estimates and estimate revisions, helps highlight stocks that are poised to provide superior returns over the next one to three months. Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), and this is because of the company’s improving analyst earnings outlook.Within the past 60 days, Micron has witnessed nine revisions to its full-year EPS estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside among revising analysts. These positive revisions have lifted our consensus estimate for the company’s 2018 earnings by 48 cents in that time. Micron is now expected to report EPS growth of 122% on revenue growth of nearly 44% this year.Bottom LineMicron has experience volatility lately, but the stock is looking to rebound strongly, and key valuation metrics indicate that shares are likely being underpriced by the market right now. Meanwhile, an improving earnings outlook underscores the company’s strength in the near term. This should make investors optimistic right now.Want more market analysis from this author?

699,STX,"Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. In the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates thrice, delivering an average beat of approximately 66.97%.Let’s take a look at how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderImproving customer relationships and deeper market penetration are aiding the financials of Stratasys. Product launches and strategic partnerships are helping the company gain a strong foothold in the 3D printing market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 25.76% from 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.During the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company partnered with Dassault Systèmes and Industry Visionary Easton LaChappelle for the development of 3D printing based prosthetics. The company also entered into a collaboration with PostNord Strålfors, a subsidiary to PostNord, communication and logistics solutions provider.In January, Latécoère, a French aerospace manufacturer, deployed Stratasys FDM additive manufacturing for accelerating development of the design and production process. Stratasys also notified that Visual First, a Dutch 3D service bureau, replaced metal machine parts for its client, The Chocolate Factory, with 3D printing material from Stratasys.However, we remain concerned about its declining gross margin, which has been impacted by incremental sales of lower-margin products of acquired businesses including MakerBot, Solid Concepts and Harvest Technologies. Additionally, the company will continue investing in marketing and R&D to generate higher sales, which will weigh on its operating margins.Stratasys, Ltd. Price and EPS Surprise Stratasys, Ltd.

Growth in Asia Pacific and EMEA regions is boosting the top line. The company added 4,700 new customers in the fourth quarter.The company’s transition to a subscription-based model is a positive. Robust customer growth in the company’s commercial and international businesses is driving results. The company sealed a deal with one of the largest financial services firms in the United States in the last reported quarter.Tableau Software has undertaken a number of initiatives to boost sales productivity and align marketing efforts to drive growth. The company’s recent partnership with the likes Deloitte shows growing adoption of Tableau's advanced analytics offerings.Moreover, the launch of the 10.5 version of its flagship software in the quarter will boost demand.However, the model transition will remain an overhang on the company’s billings and license bookings. Saturation in the company’s domestic market (United States and Canada), which accounts for the majority of its revenues is also a concern.Also, intensifying competition from Microsoft’s Power BI and other new as well as established players is a major concern for the company. Rise in expenses due to increase in headcount also puts margins under pressure.Tableau Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Tableau Software, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Tableau Software, Inc.

703,STX,"If you are still holding on to shares of Cadence Design Systems, Inc. (CDNS  -  Free Report) in your portfolio, it is time you dump them as chances of favorable returns in the near term appear bleak.Dropping Cadence can maximize investor’s portfolio returns as it has witnessed a significant price decline in the past year. Further, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) only highlights its innate weakness.Cadencehas gained just 18% of its value year over year, underperforming 23.4% growth of its industry.Let’s delve deeper and find out what is taking this company down.Why Should Cadence be Avoided?Cadence provided not so encouraging first-quarter guidance. For first-quarter 2018, the company expects total revenues to be in the range of $500-$510 million and non-GAAP earnings in the range of 36-38 cents per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $505.8 million and 38 cents, respectively.For 2018, revenues are anticipated to be in the range of $2.015-$2.055 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are guided in the range of $1.50-$1.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues and earnings are pegged at $2.05 billion and $1.57 per share, respectively.Cadence faces stiff competition from other EDA companies like ANSYS and Siemens AG (post the acquisition of Mentor Graphics). Intensifying competition negatively impacts pricing power, which keeps margins under pressure.The company generates a significant portion of its revenues from the International market. Consequently, we expect adverse foreign currency exchange rates to impede revenue growth in the near term due to fluctuation in the U.S. dollar against the Japanese Yen, Euro and other foreign currencies.Acquisitions have also negatively impacted its balance sheet, as high indebtedness adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of Dec 30, 2017, the company had total debt of $644.4 million. We also note the high level of goodwill and intangible assets, which totaled $944.8 million or almost 39.1% of total assets at the end of fourth-quarter 2017.So, it may not be a good decision to retain this stock in your portfolio anymore, at least if you don’t intend to wait for a long time.Stocks to ConsiderFew better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

704,STX,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) appears a promising pick at the moment driven by stellar second-quarter 2018 results, strong product portfolio strength and expanding partner base. Moreover, it has been a favorite with investors, courtesy of its rising share price and strong fundamentals.The companyhas been witnessing upward estimate revisions, reflecting analysts’ optimism. The stock has seen the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings being revised 1.1% upward, over the last 60 days. Consequently, the stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Itsshares have returned 12.2% over the three months, substantially outperforming the 0.6% rally of the industry.Notably, the companyhas a number of other aspects that make it an lucrative investment option.5 Reasons Why Western Digitalis an Attractive PickUpbeat Q2 Results: Western Digital delivered second-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $3.95 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14 cents and soared 71.7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues also increased 9.2% year over year to $5.34 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.29 billion. The strong top-line growth reflected healthy demand in the company’s end-markets for high capacity enterprise hard drives and flash-based products.Stock Looks Undervalued: From a valuation perspective, the stock looks very attractive as it currently trades significantly lower than the industry average based on a forward earnings estimate, which signifies a huge upward potential. Western Digitalcurrently trades at a forward P/E of 6.61x compared with the industry group average of 7.50x.Positive Earnings Surprise History: Western Digitalhas an impressive earnings surprise history. The company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording a positive average earnings surprise of 6.4%.Strong Hold in SSD storage market: Western Digital has been expanding into the SSD storage market due to the decline in the PC market. SSDs are faster and more energy efficient than traditional hard drives. The secular growth of digital data, modest improvement in the TAM and higher demand for storage will remain the catalysts for storage in general and especially for SSDs. This persuaded TechNavio to project enterprise SSD market to grow at a CAGR of 17% during 2016-2020. The SSD segment’s growth potential is a major positive for Western Digital because this could mitigate the losses stemming from the secular decline in the PC market, which does not necessarily use SSDs.Active on the Acquisition Front: The acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for Western Digital and will help it boost market traction in the newer storage technology — SSD. The merger will lead to economies of scale, lower costs, greater market reach and acquisitions of new technologies, among other synergies.The Amplidata, sTec, Inc., Velobit, Inc. Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems Inc. acquisitions have not only strengthened its small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio. Moreover, the company’s strong cash balance of $6.27 billion and positive operating cash flow of $1.18 billion at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2018 enabled it to expand through acquisitions. These strategic takeovers are expected to provide the company with a competitive edge.Other Key PicksSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1.Applied Materials, NVIDIA and Seagate Technology have a long-term expected EPS growth rate of 13.26%, 10.25% and 15.6%, respectively.Can Hackers Put Money INTO Your Portfolio?Earlier this month, credit bureau Equifax announced a massive data breach affecting 2 out of every 3 Americans.

705,STX,"The S&P 500, which had more than tripled on Mar 9 after a grueling spell following the Great Recession, is now on the second-longest and second-highest bull market run in history. The bull run through the 1990s has been the longest. Stocks scaled new highs on Republican tax cuts and robust economic growth at home and abroad.But, recent trade war tensions, uproar in the White House, higher interest rates and half a trillion dollars of loss for tech stocks in just over a two-week span have pushed the index back to critical support at its 200-day moving average. The S&P, in fact, fell into correction territory, while volatility has more than doubled so far this year.Not all S&P stocks are, however, facing a tumultuous Q1. Some of them have been able to dish out impressive year-to-date gains and have remained unperturbed by the higher bouts of gyrations.What Backed the S&P Rally?The S&P started Q1 on a positive note. Trump’s polices, including tax cuts, repealing regulations and increased infrastructure outlays restored expectations of a pro-growth agenda that helped the S&P move north.The latest tax laws gave companies massive tax relief as they will now be paying between 8% and 15.5% instead of the earlier 35% for bringing back money held overseas. This means around $1.2 trillion in foreign profits that the S&P 500 companies are hoarding be brought back. This in turn can be used to create jobs and reward shareholders — something the Trump administration has been aiming for since the campaigns days.Trump’s economy is also in good shape, with the jobless rate near a 17-year low. Initial jobless claims remained near the lowest level since 1970 and the number of people collecting unemployment benefits tanked to a fresh 45-year low.But, there is another major factor behind the strong American growth. It’s the global economic growth, with every major country from China to Europe and Latin America to Japan expanding at a healthy pace. According to the International Monetary Fund, the global economy expanded at rate of 3.7% last year, the fastest since 2010.S&P Ends Q1 on a Sour NoteSelling in stocks intensified after the Trump administration announced that it will levy tariffs on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese imports on top of imposing duties on foreign steel and aluminum. In response to Trump’s tariffs, Beijing said that it will target 128 U.S. products with an import value of $3 billion. Investors panicked as a full-blown trade war might deal a heavy blow to economies, resulting in widespread unemployment.A number of high-profile departures from the Trump administration, in the meantime, pushed political-risk to the highest level since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Such events threatened to upset the Trump administration’s business-friendly policies.Amid all these, the Fedhas tightened its monetary policy. At the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Mar 21, Jerome Powell-led Federal Reserve hiked interest rates by a quarter-percentage point and projected a steeper path of rate hikes in 2019 and 2020. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as we all know that they had piled up on U.S. stocks with the notion that quantitative easing will help the domestic economy grow at a better rate than emerging economies like China.Adding to the downbeat tone is also a sharp selloff in the technology sector. Investors remained concerned about tighter regulations for large tech companies. The sector took a beating following the backlash over Facebook, Inc’s (FB  -  Free Report) handling of user data. Everyone raised questions as to how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data on roughly 50 million Facebook users without their knowledge.The S&P tech sector, which was the most crowded trade of the year, peaked on Mar 12 to 1,233.93, putting its market cap at about $6 trillion. However, the market cap is currently down to nearly $5.5 trillion, a decline of 8.8%, per WSJ Market Data Group.5 Best S&P 500 Stocks of Q1The S&P, now, has fallen more than 10% from its peak in January. The average number of stocks on the index is almost 15% below the 52-week high, while the average stock in some of the sectors are already in bear-market territory, defined as a decline of 20%, as per Bespoke Investment Group.Despite the brutal selloff of the past few weeks, some stocks have managed to give encouraging returns, thanks to a great story or maybe a little luck. Here is the rundown of the best stocks from the S&P 500 in Q1. These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) provides data storage technology and solutions the United States and internationally. Even though the company is part of the larger tech sector, traders have been ploughing back into STX stock. The stock has a Zacks Rank #1.

706,STX,"Logitech International S.A. (LOGI  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 2, after the market closes. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this computer peripheral maker will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter. Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history.The company has witnessed a remarkable streak of beating earnings estimates. In fact, in each of the trailing four quarters, Logitech surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, coming up with an average positive earnings surprise of 13.2%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Logitech is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Logitech carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal fourth-quarter earnings remained unchanged over the past 30 days.However, the company is likely to continue reporting top and bottom-line growth on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter to be reported is pegged at 26 cents, representing year-over-year decline of 23.8%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $563.7 billion, up 13.6% from the year-ago quarter.Logitech International S.A. Price and EPS Surprise Logitech International S.A. Price and EPS Surprise | Logitech International S.A. Quote Factors to ConsiderWe believe the company’s thriving cloud-based video-conferencing services, strategic product launches and restructuring actions will continue to be growth drivers. Logitech is enjoying an all-pervasive growth of its retail business, which is anticipated to continue, going forward. In order to further boost growth, the company is pursuing innovation and expanding its product lines to tap the high potential market for accessories.Logitech has been able to leverage its software and go-to-market capabilities in a bid to drive market share gains. The company has manufactured innovative options, such as the fastest performing mouse and keyboard switches, as well as a wireless mouse with the longest battery life. A diverse product roster and excellent demand are expected to have driven the company’s overall performance in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.Furthermore, the company’s most significant growth driver — gaming — now constitutes 21% of revenues. In the last three quarters, the segment registered year-over-year growth of more than 30%. Continuous innovations and last year’s buyout of high-end headset maker — ASTRO Gaming — has made Logitech the leader in a growing space. We believe the gaming business to have bolstered the company’s top-line performance in the fiscal fourth quarter as well.This apart, the company’s successful measures to trim infrastructure spending, which are part of its aim of focused cost control and disciplined spending, are proving conducive to margin expansion. Further, the company has been divesting non-profit assets to reduce costs. Along with this, Logitech expects to focus on making selective investments to ensure disciplined cost management in the coming quarters. All these measures are likely to have supported the company’s to-be-reported quarter’s margins as well as bottom-line results.Despite these positives, declining demand in the company’s most profit-maximizing products, like desktops and diverse porting tools, remains a likely headwind. Moreover, the company’s sales are impacted by end-user consumer demand and consequently, unanticipated shifts in consumer buying patterns can affect the business.In addition to the above, the market where the company operates is highly competitive and characterized by short product life cycles, constant product introductions, rapidly changing technology, evolving customer demands, along with aggressive promotional and pricing practices. Consequently, the need to roll out advanced products in the market in a bid to survive the competition results in significant surges in R&D expenses, which might dampen the company’s profitability.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and a Zacks Rank #1.

707,STX,"3D Systems Corporation (DDD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this 3D printing solution provider will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.The company has a dismal earnings surprise history, with earnings missing estimates by a wide margin, in three out of the trailing four quarters. However, in the last-reported quarter, it posted a positive earnings surprise of a whopping 400%. This resulted in an average positive surprise of 9.9% for the last four quarters.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that 3D Systems is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.3D Systems carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings remained unchanged over the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at a penny, representing year-over-year slump of 83.3%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $158.8 billion, up 1.5% from the year-ago quarter figure.3D Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise 3D Systems Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | 3D Systems Corporation Quote Factors at PlayFor the past few quarters, 3D Systems has been experiencing unfavorable broader market conditions which have affected its financial performance. Macroeconomic factors such as economic slowdown, inflation, currency fluctuations, commodity prices and credit availability have dampened the company’s performance. In the prior quarter, revenues from 3D printing products and services were almost flat year over year. In full-year 2017, total printer revenues slipped 7%. We believe the aforementioned problems still persist, which is likely to have adversely impacted 3D Systems’ first-quarter performance.In addition, the company’s high operating and acquisition costs are anticipated to continue hurting its near-term operating income performance. Further, the company believes investment in IT and go-to-market initiatives will result in elevated expenses, consequently restricting near-term operating income growth.This apart, 3D Systems has to contend itself with strong competition, which often results in price cuts and lower profitability. The entry of HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) and General Electric Company (GE  -  Free Report) has shaken things up in the industry, and remains a concern for 3D Systems.Nonetheless, the company’s focus on strengthening its foothold in the 3D printing industry is expected to provide a favorable long-term opportunity. As a matter of fact, majority of 3D Systems customers are shifting from prototyping to end-use production using 3D printing technology, and the company believes it is well positioned to aid customers in their transition. In addition to this, demand for production printers, materials and software is expected to have been a major catalyst, stoking growth.Furthermore, over the past few years, 3D Systems’ healthcare business has proven to be its strongest profit churner. To make the most of the positive industry trends, the company has developed a spectrum of innovative solutions ranging from simulation to implants. We believe the new offerings, along with high demand for printers and materials from medical and dental customers, to have bolstered the healthcare business top line in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.A Stock With a Favorable CombinationSeagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) is a stock you may want to consider as our model shows that the company has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat.Seagate has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and flaunts a Zacks Rank of 1.

708,STX,"Amid the trade tensions between the United States and its key allies, investors continued to pour money into fast-growing companies, pushing the Nasdaq Composite Index to new highs for the second consecutive day since Mar 13. In fact, it has been outperforming the other major large cap indices by a wide margin on a year-to-date basis.   The strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 10.6% this year compared with gains of 0.3% for the Dow Jones and 2.8% for the S&P 500.

It is noteworthy that the sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices (AR/VR), autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Moreover, an improvement in global IT spending, as projected by Gartner, bodes well for the stocks.

714,STX,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 4.6% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $72.93 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 31.7% since the start of the year compared to the 9.1% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 21.6% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 23, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $1.05 versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.86%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $4.05 per share on $6.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.71% change in EPS on a 4.74% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.72 per share on $6.5 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.61% and 5.06%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of C. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are An and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 18X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 19.1X versus its peer group's average of 14.4X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.5. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been moving higher, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also looking good, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 3% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

715,STX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 5.6% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is STX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsSeagate delivered impressive fiscal third-quarter 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.46 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 per share, surging 32.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, the figure declined 1.4% sequentially.Revenues of $2.80 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 billion and also grew 4.8% from the year-ago quarter but declined 3.6% sequentially.Both the top and bottom lines witnessed year-over-year improvement, owing to robust adoption driven by strong demand of Seagate’s storage drives. Moreover, increasing traction for mass storage solutions across company’s edge and enterprise markets remained a tailwind.Performance in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Seagate shipped 87.4 exabytes of hard disk drive (HDD) storage, with an average capacity of record 2.4 terabytes per drive.The company shipped 43.8 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market, each with an average capacity of 4.8 terabytes.Total HDD revenues went up 6.7% year over year to $2.59 billion during the quarter primarily due to advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies. Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market.In the nearline market, the company shipped 41.3 exabytes of HDD, nearline products’ average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes. Management noted that the company’s 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter. Growth in the 12-terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging. Given the impressive customer feedback, Seagate anticipates capitalizing on the market adoption of these products.Within the edge and customer verticals, the company witnessed year-over-year exabyte growth in all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets.Non-HDD segment (cloud systems and silicon group) revenues declined 13.2% year over year but gained 1.9% sequentially to $217 million. Per management, year-over-year decrease was “primarily due to the planned end of life of some legacy OEM cloud systems products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.”Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin which came in at 30.8% declined 60 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis but expanded 40 bps sequentially.Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 13% on a year-over-year basis to $385 million. This decrease in expenses can be attributed to certain cost improvement initiatives undertaken since past two years.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowSeagate ended the March quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.93 billion up from $2.56 billion in the quarter ending December. At the end of the quarter, the company had a long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $4.34 billion compared with $5.02 billion in the previous quarter.The company’s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the March quarter to be paid on Jul 5, 2018. Further, in the quarter, Seagate redeemed senior notes due November 2018 for $57 million.Cash flow from operations was $558 million for the third quarter and was $1.65 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. Free cash flow for the quarter and first nine months of the fiscal came at $489 million and $1.4 billion, respectively.GuidanceManagement anticipates fourth-quarter revenues to grow approximately 17% on a year-over-year basis due to strong cloud demand and seasonality in other markets. However, the company projects revenues to remain flat sequentially. The company notifies that Exabyte demand is increasing on a year-over-year basis across most of the markets it caters.Seagate projects gross margins to be flat on a sequentially basis and come within the company’s long-term range of 29–33%. It projects to generate an operating cash flow of at least $500 million in the fourth quarter.Seagate anticipates additional variable compensation for its employees in the fourth quarter. However, management believes that its ongoing cost management initiatives operational efficiency will enable the company to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses by 1-2% from the prior quarter.For fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to grow 4% and the company envisions generating an operating cash flow greater than $2 billion.For second half of 2018, the company expects solid capacity demand, robust exabyte growth in its edge markets along with seasonal strength in other markets to boost the top line.ConclusionWith the huge transformations in the storage industry, mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products which is beneficial for Seagate.In January this year, Seagate entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba. The agreement will help the company in its innovation of HDD, solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions, consequently expanding its product portfolio.The company is trying to focus less on the mission-critical 15K and sub-1-terabyte client consumer markets. Management anticipates these markets to eventually converge with either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where it is already expanding footprint. Notably, as a percentage of total revenues, the products accounted for lesser than 8%.Favorable macroeconomic environment and rising global investments in cloud will continue to work as key catalysts. Further, hints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive.The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology, which is expected be shipped in 2019, is yet another positive. This move will not only reinforce company’s leadership in areal density but also boost nearline drive capacity points by at least 24 terabytes per drive.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been six revisions higher for the current quarter.Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus  Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, STX has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a bit on the momentum front with a B. The stock was also allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of A. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value and growth investors while momentum investors may want to look elsewhere.OutlookEstimates have been trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. It comes with little surprise STX has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We expect an above average return from the stock in the next few months.

The same way, growth investors often end up investing in expensive stocks.If we keenly observe the investment track of the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, we can see how, in quest of eliminating these hazards, this pure play value investor has gradually shifted to a mixed investment strategy or more precisely GARP (growth at a reasonable price) strategy.This strategy combines both growth and value investing principles and has a proven track record of success. What GARPers look for is whether the stocks are somewhat undervalued and have solid sustainable growth potential (Investopedia).Here lies the importance of a not-so-popular fundamental metric, the price/earnings growth (PEG) ratio. Although it is categorized under value investing, this strategy follows the principles of both growth and value investing.The PEG ratio is defined as: (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth RateIt relates the stocks P/E ratio with future earnings growth rate.While P/E alone only gives the idea of stocks, which are trading at a discount, PEG while adding the GROWTH element to it, helps to find those stocks that have solid future potential.A lower PEG ratio, preferably less than 1, is always better for GARP investors.Say for example, if a stock’s P/E ratio is 10 and expected long-term growth rate is 15%, the company’s PEG will come down to 0.66, a ratio which indicates both undervaluation and future growth potential.Unfortunately, this ratio is often neglected due to investors’ limitation to calculate the future earnings growth rate of a stock.There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio though. It doesn’t consider the very common situation of changing growth rates such as the forecast of the first three years at very high growth rates followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate in the long term.Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration.Here are the screening criteria for a winning strategy:PEG Ratio less than X Industry MedianP/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (For more accurate valuation purpose.)Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1  or #2 have a proven history of success.)Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us to focus on companies that have strong liquidity.)Average 20 Day Volume greater than 50,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5%: Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold) offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 23 stocks that qualified the screening:The Chemours Company (CC  -  Free Report) is a leading player in the field of titanium technologies, fluoroproducts and chemical solutions, catering to a wide range of industries with market-defining products, application expertise and chemistry-based innovations. The company has an impressive expected five-year growth rate of 15.5%.

717,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 1.The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters while missing in one, with an average negative earnings surprise of 3.31%.In the last reported quarter, Seagate delivered a positive earnings surprise of 5.71%. Earnings of $1.48 per share surged 7.2% on a year-over-year basis.Revenues came in at $2.91 billion, up 0.7% year over year. The improvement in both top and bottom line figures was driven by strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.For third-quarter fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.36 per share and that for revenues is $2.76 billion.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this quarter.Factors to considerNotably, shares of Seagate have returned 40.9% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s rally of 18.7%.Seagate is currently riding on advancement of cloud storage technologies in the industry, exponential growth in stored data, Nearline’s rapid adoption, stable hard disk drives (HDD) pricing environment and low inventory levels. We believe this will drive the results in the soon-to-be reported quarter for Seagate.Further, growing HDD requirement due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions remains positive for the company. Also, PC market stabilization will aid the shipments of the company in the third quarter.The company expects its exabyte shipments to be around 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Strong Product Portfolio — Key CatalystSeagate’s continuous efforts on product innovation and expansion will continue to cater to the rising demand for memory drives in the going-to-be reported quarter.Recently, the company rolled out 14TB helium-based Exos X14 enterprise drive which ensures cost-efficient management of growing volume of data. The product bodes well for the rising demand for enterprise storage capacity, cloud storage and hyperscale environments.The company also launched Seagate Joy Drive in collaboration with JD.com (JD  -  Free Report) in the beginning of this year. The device allows android and tablet users to expand their storage and battery capacity.Earlier this year, Seagate partnered with RackTop Systems to create data security solutions to meet risk management standards. This is likely to boost the adoption rate of the company’s solutions.Further, the recently launched¬ 5U84 high-density enclosure, Seagate Fast SSD and LaCie Rugged Secure will continue to improve customer base of the company with their efficient and useful capacity storage features.Additionally, Seagate’s long-term supply agreement with Toshiba, which ensures continuous supply of NAND chips for Seagate’s expanding solid-state drive portfolio.Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

718,STX,"The Computer – Storage Devices industry is witnessing an exponential rise on widespread use of streaming media, cloud storage solutions, cloud-based apps, data virtualization and other data-intensive chores.The key driving force of the worldwide storage devices market is its increasing use in mobile devices that have now higher memory capacities. Rampant growth in the amount of data, complexity of data formats and the need to scale resources at regular intervals have compelled several companies to turn to storage devices vendors. This represents significant growth opportunity for the industry players.As consumers’ dependence on cloud for storage purpose increases, a proportionate rise in demand for cloud-dedicated data centers is inevitable. Also, with simultaneous increase in data volumes, demand for cloud-based storage systems in data centers is likely to grow significantly.Extensive implementations of CRM solutions, increased Internet and mobile penetration, rapidly growing media and regulatory compliance have resulted in data explosion for enterprises. Now, these enterprises are realizing the importance of storing information which, in turn should favor growth.Banking on the rise of connected devices, the Internet of Things (IoT), virtual reality (VR), and artificial intelligence (AI), the Computer – Storage Devices industry remains a lucrative investment opportunity.Industry Offers Solid Shareholder ReturnsThe Zacks Computer-Storage Devices Industry, within the broader Zacks Computer And Technology Sector, has outperformed both the S&P 500 and its own sector over the past year.While the stocks in this industry have collectively gained 27.5%, the Zacks S&P 500 Composite and Zacks Computer And Technology Sector have rallied 12.5% and 19.2%, respectively.The secular growth of digital data and higher demand for storage especially for SSDs, contributed to the performance of both the sector and the S&P 500. Sector Stocks Trading CheapOwing to the strong fundamentals of the industry over the past year, the valuation looks attractive. One might get a good sense of the industry’s relative valuation by looking at its price-to-earnings ratio (P/E), which is the most appropriate multiple for valuing Computer – Storage Devices stocks because their earnings are effective in gauging performance.    Generally, the price of a stock rallies on a rise in earnings. As forecasts for expected earnings move higher, demand for the stock should drive its price. If the P/E of a stock is rising steadily, it means that investors are pinning their hopes on the company’s inherent strength.This ratio essentially measures a stock’s current market value relative to its earnings performance. Investors believe that the lower the P/E, the higher will be the value of the stock.The industry currently has a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 11.58, near the lowest level over the past year and below the median level of 12.15. Clearly, there is plenty of upside left.The space also looks quite inexpensive when compared with the market at large, as the trailing 12-month P/E ratio for the S&P 500 is 19.9 and the median level is 20.17. Outperformance to Continue on Robust Earnings OutlookRobust market adoption of cloud computing, big data, IoT, auto, connected devices, VR, and AI will continue to drive the industry and have encouraged many companies to raise their projections for the current fiscal year. This optimism is likely to help Computer – Storage Devices stocks generate positive shareholder returns in the near future.But what really matters to investors is whether this group has the potential to perform better than the broader market in the quarters ahead. The earlier valuation discussion shows that market participants have been willing to pay up for these stocks already, potentially limiting further upside from current levels.One reliable measure that can help investors understand the industry’s prospects for a solid price performance going forward is its earnings outlook. Empirical research shows that earnings outlook for the industry, a reflection of the earnings revisions trend for the constituent companies, has a direct bearing on its stock market performance.The Price & Consensus chart for the industry shows the market's evolving bottom-up earnings expectations for the industry and its aggregate stock market performance. The red line in the chart represents the Zacks measure of consensus earnings expectations for 2019, while the light blue line represents the same for 2018. This becomes even clearer when we focus on the aggregate bottom-up EPS revisions trend. The chart below shows the evolution of aggregate consensus expectations for 2018.Please note that the $4.70 EPS estimate for the industry for 2018 is not the actual bottom-up EPS estimate for every company in the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry, but rather an illustrative aggregate number created by our proprietary analytics model. The key factor to keep in mind is not the earnings per share of the industry for 2018, but how this estimate has evolved recently. The consensus earnings per share estimate for the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry reflects solid year-over-year improvement.Moreover, the trend in earnings estimates revisions have been favorable of late. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that sell-side analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings potential.The consensus EPS estimate for the current fiscal year has been revised 7.8% upward since Mar 31, 2018.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Robust ProspectsThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates continued outperformance in the near term.The Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #17, which places it at the top 7% of more than 256 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Our proprietary Heat Map shows that the industry’s rank has continuously improved over the past five weeks. Computer – Storage Devices Stocks Promise Long-Term GrowthThe long-term prospects for the industry are alluring. When compared with the broader Zacks S&P 500 composite, the long-term (3-5 years) EPS growth estimate for the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry appears promising. The group’s mean estimate of long-term EPS growth rate has shown signs of improvement since mid-April 2018 to reach the current level of 15.25%. This compares to 9.8% for the Zacks S&P 500 composite. Moreover, the growing demand of  data storage, information security, virtualization, analytics and cloud computing to store, manage, protect, and analyze data are some of the incredible business drivers. These factors are expected to drive growth in top line that has gained significant momentum since the end of 2016. In fact, the basis of this long-terms EPS growth could be another reason for the steady top line growth that the Zacks Computer – Storage Devices industry has witnessed since 2016. Moreover, another indication of solid long-term prospects is the improvement in the group’s gross margin. Bottom LineThis is a great place to invest in right now, both with respect to the near term and the longer term. Factors like an improving unit revenue scenario, increased demand for connected devices, cheap valuation and growing need for improved data storage to eliminating data portability issues are positives for the sector and might contribute to long-term growth.Keeping these factors in mind, investors may look for some good entry points in the stocks that will help them make the most of the momentum in the industry.Here, we list three stocks that have been witnessing positive earnings estimate revisions and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).(You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)NetApp, Inc.

719,STX,"Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. (MLNX  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings results on Jan 18. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 10.9%.We believe that strong demand for Mellanox’s InfiniBand solutions along with collaborations with the likes of NEC Corporation, Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise are likely to act as catalysts.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at 68 cents, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 17.1%. Further, the earnings estimate has not shown any sign of movement of late. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $235 million, up roughly 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Likely to Influence Q4 ResultsQ3 Earnings HighlightMellanox reported mixed third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensuses Estimates and the top line missed the same. Revenues improved on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by strong customer adoption of Gigabit EDR solutions in machine learning, artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, database, storage and more.Further, InfiBand’s adoption helped the company to maintain its leadership position in the high-performance interconnects space.Moreover, it provided encouraging fourth-quarter revenue guidance. For the fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenues to remain in a range of $230-$240 million. The Zacks Consensuses Estimates is pegged at $235.2 million.Notably, its shares have gained 50.4% year over year, outperforming the 34.8% rally of the industry it belongs to.Collaboration & InfiniBand Adoption: Key CatalystThe company recently announced collaboration with NEC Corporation to provide support to NEC’s newly announced SX-Aurora TSUBASA systems with InfiniBand adapters. InfiniBand is highly scalable and its off-loading capabilities that reduce load on CPUs are attracting artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning and deep learning providers.The addition of InfiniBand to NEC’s latest high-end high-performance computing (HPC) platform boosts the systems processing performance and scalability.Moreover, InfiniBand has been the preferred interconnect for AI and deep learning systems. Mellanox had announced that leading deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Caffe2, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, and Baidu PaddlePaddle use the company’s offloading capability across multiple AI servers.Mellanox also clinched design contracts on multiple platforms. These design wins include more than 20 AI projects globally, which is significant for the company’s top-line growth.Apart from strong demand for Mellanox’s InfiniBand solutions, collaborations with the likes of Atos, VMware and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have helped the company expand footprint in the cloud and datacenter market.Mellanox’s collaboration with Microsemi Corporation is also expected to reinforce the company’s footprint in the high performance computing market going forward.Further, Mellanox is winning contracts from the likes of NetApp. The network storage provider recently selected Mellanox’s ConnectX 100Gb/s InfiniBand adapters for two of its most advanced storage platforms — the EF570 and E5700.The University of Toronto also selected the Mellanox InfiniBand solutions to accelerate its new leading supercomputer in Canada. Earlier, the NASA Ames Research Center selected the company’s EDR InfiniBand solutions along with HPE SGI 8600 liquid cooled platform to expand its “Electra” supercomputing cluster.These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: Mellanoxcurrently has an Earnings ESP of -2.37%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 66 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at 68 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Mellanoxcurrently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.It should be noted that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated Stocks) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Some Stocks With Favorable CombinationHere are a few companies which, as per our model, have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), with an Earnings ESP of +0.83% and a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy).

721,STX,"The old adage “Sell in May and Go Away” is unlikely to hold true this year. Following a two-month long chain of losses earlier in the year, stocks ended April marginally higher. Now, markets seem set to surge ahead in May and the rest of the summer. The resurgence of tech stocks, which had powered market gains for some time now, is a clear indicator that this rally is set to continue.Also, the strong performance of small-cap stocks indicates that investors are willing to take on more risk. Meanwhile, trade-related fears are receding. Investors are also choosing to ignore the surge in oil prices. Investing in stocks which have surged over the year and which sport strong fundamentals looks like a smart option at this point.Tech Stocks Rebound on Strong Earnings Tech stocks, which constitute nearly 25% of the total market capitalization, have rebounded strongly in recent weeks. The category had been weighed down by a string of headwinds, including persistent concerns over poor demand for Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) iPhones.The data privacy scandal which hit Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) also triggered a broad selloff in tech shares. But a flurry of strong earnings performances, particularly from the dominant FAANG group of stocks, has powered a rebound in recent weeks.As of May 9, 2018, we have Q1 results from 84.3% of the Technology sector’s total market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these companies are up +29.4% on +12% higher revenues, with 91.5% beating EPS estimates and the same proportion beating revenue estimates. (Read: A Critical Look at the Q1 Earnings Season)Small-Caps Remain PopularOn May 14, the small-cap heavy Russell 2000 index closed 0.4% lower. The decline came despite the index nearly breaching an intraday record created on Jan 24. Further, this also went against a trend which has built up over the last three months, where small-caps have outperformed their larger peers.A variety of factors have confabulated to create this phenomenon. Firstly, small-caps are viewed as U.S. focused companies. This perception allows them to be insulated from trade-related fears and other geopolitical tensions. Further, factors like a surging dollar are unlikely to impact companies with domestically focused operations.Trade Fears Receding, Oil Spike IgnoredMeanwhile, trade-related tensions between the United States and China seem to be receding. Firstly, it is increasingly clear that a new NAFTA deal is likely to be concluded. Additionally, in a rare overture to China, Trump announced on Sunday that he would be working with President Xi in order to save phone maker ZTE Corporation.Also, investors seem to be ignoring the fact that oil prices are close to a four-year high. Instead, markets are enjoying the current rally in energy stocks. Energy stocks gained 0.6% on Monday and the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) is up 6.2% year-to-date.Our ChoicesThe rebound in tech stocks and continuing gains in small-cap stocks have ignited a new rally for the markets. With trade war fears receding and investors choosing to ignore the recent spike in oil prices, this stretch of gains is likely to continue over most of this summer.These factors are likely to negate the old adage of “Sell in May” this time around. Picking stocks with strong fundamentals which have surged over the year looks like a prudent choice at this point. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score. We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks, each of which has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

724,STX,"Investors in Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Oct 27, 2017 $35 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Seagate shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Seagate is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer- Storage Devices industry that ranks in the Bottom 32% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst has increased its earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 88 cents per share to 86 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Seagate right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

727,STX,"Apple’s (AAPL  -  Free Report) second-quarter fiscal 2018 results are scheduled to be released on May 1.The quarter witnessed investors’ anxiety over lackluster sales of the premium iPhone X, leading to decline in sales estimates. Lack of demand compelled Apple to lower shipment target.iPhone in the SpotlightiPhone, since its launch in 2007, has been the mainstay of the tech giant’s revenues. In the first quarter, iPhone revenues increased 13% from the year-ago quarter to $61.58 billion.However, lower-than-expected sales of iPhone X have prompted analysts to slash sales estimates for the product. Goldman Sachs, in its Mar 27 note, announced trimming of iPhone sales expectations by a whopping 1.7 million units to 53 million for the March quarter. Jun Zhang of Rosenblatt Securities lowered his estimate for total iPhone shipments in the March quarter by 2 million units to 50 million units.Nonetheless, Apple’s focus on “aggressive pricing” that resulted in a higher average selling price (ASP) from premium models — iPhone X, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus — is likely to boost the top line, despite lower shipments. This is evident from the fact that expected growth of revenues from iPhone is way higher than growth of its shipments for the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Notably, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPhone units sold is pegged at 52.94 million, up almost 4% from the actual figure reported in second-quarter 2017.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPhone and related products and services is $39.2 billion, up 18% from the actual figure in the year-ago quarter.However, the expensive price tag might prove an impediment in countries like China, which remains an important market for Apple, given the growing number of middle-class customers. Also, intensifying competition from regional players, who are offering feature-rich smartphones at a much cheaper price, remains a major headwind.iPad and Mac Losing SteamApple’s iPad business has been sluggish for quite some time. However, with the launch of a low cost iPad in the second quarter of 2017, the company witnessed an uptick in iPad sales.Apple sold 13.2 million iPads in the first quarter, up 1% year over year, while revenues of $5.7 billion increased 6%.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iPad business is pegged at roughly $3.98 billion, up 2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total iPad units sold is around 9 million, up 1% year over year.However, Mac sales don’t hold promise. For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Mac is pegged at $5.71 billion, down 2.2% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total Mac units sold is 4.2 million, down 1% year over year.Will Diversification Yield Results?Apple’s focus on developing innovative products in order to generate new revenue streams is a key growth driver. Fast growing Services and wearables (mainly Watch) segments are emerging as big growth catalysts.Notably, Apple’s Other Product segment, which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats headphones, iPod touch and other accessories witnessed a 36% increase year over year in the last reported quarter, the highest among all its segments. In fact, the segment recorded a new all-time high with revenues of more than $5 billion for the first time in a quarter.Apple’s Services segment, which includes revenues from Internet Services, App store, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services, continues to grow rapidly. At the end of the first quarter, the Services segment had more than 240 million subscribers. Revenues surged 18% year over year to nearly $8.5 billion.For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iTunes, Software and Services is $8.33 billion, up 18.3% year over year.Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Apple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Apple Inc. QuoteA Look at the Earnings TrendApple beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with the average positive surprise being 5.72%.The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings of $3.89 per share and revenues of $88.29 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 and $86.29 billion, respectively.   For second-quarter fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $61.1 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of almost 15.5%.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings declined by a penny to $2.69 over the last seven days.What Does Our Model SayAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Apple has a Zacks Rank #4 and an Earnings ESP of -0.23%, which indicates that an earnings beat is unlikely.

728,STX,"Paycom Software, Inc. (PAYC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 1. The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether this provider of cloud-based human capital management (HCM) software as a service solution can deliver a surprise.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 26.1%. Notably, Paycom Software has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 30.2%.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What the Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP. Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Paycom has a Zacks Rank #1 and an Earnings ESP of +0.33%. This indicates that the company is likely to beat estimates. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter is pegged at 90 cents per share, indicating an increase of 91.5% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues are estimated to be around $151.29 million, indicating 26.6% increase on a year-over-year basis.Factors to ConsiderThe company continues to gain from higher recurring revenues and traction in cloud-based offerings. Surge in demand for advanced human capital management and payroll software solutions is encouraging.The company’s client base is increasing with the help of its sales force. During the last reported quarter, management was particularly optimistic about the operations of its sales force, with senior sales people outperforming expectations. Pertaining to the stellar performance of the sales team, the company opened its 47th sales office in Rochester, NY during the first quarter.Following the company’s shift to ASC 606, effective Jan 1, 2018, margins are expected to improve significantly. This is because, per the new standard, the commission expense will be recognized ratably over the period till the contract is valid and not upfront.Notably, Paycom also announced an increase in its stock repurchase plan. It added $100 million to the ongoing share repurchase program, which has been extended till Feb 12, 2020. This also indicates a strong balance sheet. The company is optimistic about the increase in the number of companies becoming aware of the benefits of new age human resource technologies. This will aid its top line.Paycom Software, Inc.

730,STX,"Investors know that technology stocks have skyrocketed over the last few years, helping lift the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq to new heights. They also understand that this recent bearish turn can be attributed, in large part, to investors selling these same tech stocks.The recent market-wide downturn obviously offers investors the chance to buy stocks on the dip. This widely-adopted strategy sounds simple enough, but just because a stock’s price is technically cheaper doesn’t mean it’s automatically attractive to investors.With that said, as market volatility continues, investors should consider looking to the memory and computer storage industries to find newly undervalued stocks.In the past, investors bemoaned this business as far too cyclical. However, these industries are no longer tethered to the historic PC industry. In fact, the rise of connected devices, the IoT, VR, and AI promise to be secular trends that render these concerns somewhat void.Now, let’s take a look at three memory solutions firms that have become even more attractive to value investors amid this downturn.1.      Micron (MU  -  Free Report)  Micron’s post-earnings selloff presents investors with an amazing chance to buy the stock at a newly reduced price. Micron not only sits over 12% below its 52-week high, but it is also now trading at 5.1x forward earnings, which marks a discount to the broader semiconductor space.Meanwhile, analysts have turned more positive regarding Micron’s future earnings. Within the last seven days, we have seen nine revisions to Micron’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. These revisions lifted the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $0.36 in this timeframe.Investors should also note that our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for Micron’s full-year earnings to soar by 121%, while its revenues are expected to climb by 42.6%. Micron is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), which means now might not be a bad time to buy Micron stock while it is relatively cheap.2.       Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report)In less than two weeks, this data storage powerhouse sunk from its 52-week high of roughly $106 per share to around $90 per share. However, Western Digital’s current growth projection and valuation make it an inciting stock.Western Digital’s earnings are expected to surge by 36.7% this quarter and 52% in its current full-year. Furthermore, within the last 60 days, WDC has earned three earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside.WDC is also currently trading at 7.7x forward earnings, which marks a substantial discount to its industry’s average Forward P/E of 11.0. Lastly, investors should note that Western Digital is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).3.       Seagate (STX  -  Free Report)This data storage solutions firm has not experienced as precipitous of a decline as some of its peers, but a small selloff has made Seagate stock look a tad more affordable.Seagate’s Forward P/E of 11.8, which is only a slight premium to its industry’s average P/E of 11.4 and a discount to the broader chip market.Seagate has also earned six earnings estimate revisions for its current full-year, with 100% agreement to the upside, all within the last 60 days. This has helped the company’s estimate climb from $4.33 per share to $4.87 per share, which would mark an 18% climb from the year-ago period.Seagate is also currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and sports an “A” grade for Value and a “B” for Growth.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers.

It also added Nexperia, a semiconductor manufacturer, to its client base. The company will use Revenue Cloud to manage direct and channel revenues. Model N’s growth prospects in life sciences & high technology are bright, owing to increasing ineffectiveness of legacy systems. Its solutions provide higher Return on Investment (“ROI”) as well as plug gaps in the end-to-end revenue management process that legacy systems fail to do. This improves top-line growth of the companies, consequently bolstering adoption of Model N’s solutions. Additionally, Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), a prominent data storage provider, rolled out the Phase 1 Revenue Cloud for high tech. This bodes well for Model N. Recently, the company also inked several deals with high-tech and life science companies including DexCom, Seagate, Intel and Amgen. Zacks Rank and Stocks to Consider Model N carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). A few other better-ranked stocks in the technology sector are Facebook, Inc.

732,STX,"Shares of Micron (MU  -  Free Report) have dipped nearly 12% since the company’s earnings announcement last week, and with the stock now down significantly from its mid-March highs, investors are growing concerned that the memory-chip maker’s red-hot run is finally coming to an end.All in all, Micron’s new earnings results were pretty solid. The company posted adjusted profits of $2.82 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76. Meanwhile, quarterly revenue of $7.35 billion was up 58% from the year-ago period and ahead of our consensus estimate of $7.23 billion.Still, investors who are familiar with cyclical trends in the semiconductor memory space clearly felt the time was right to take their profits from this stock, which had gained roughly 90% in the year prior to its most-recent report date (also read: Micron Posts Earnings Beat, 'Secular Trends' Driving Growth).But Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra is clearly trying to shift this rhetoric. In the company’s conference call following the release of its earnings report, Mehrotra carefully selected his words in an effort to paint a new picture of the industry.“The dealer market today is very different from the PC-dominated market of the past,” the chief executive said. “More specifically, memory is making possible applications such as AI and VR, and enabling new cloud-based business models which deliver a fundamental value far in excess of a price per bit.”Memory is a heavily-commoditized segment of the technology sector, thanks in large part to cyclical demand trends that have presented themselves over decades of the aforementioned PC-dominated market.This helps explain why many memory solutions firms trade with lower valuations than many of their other high-tech peers. For example, the group of Micron, Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Toshiba , and Seagate (STX  -  Free Report) is currently trading with an average Forward P/E of 7.9, which is a significant discount to the 13.2x forward earnings multiple seen in the broader semiconductor market.Still, Mehrotra is right to point out that the technology sector has evolved over the past few years. The decline of the PC has been well documented, and in addition to that, a whole breadth of new consumer electronics—including smart appliances, wearables, and in-home virtual assistants—have emerged.These new products are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of applications for VR, AI, and IoT technology. And on the commercial side, there is plenty of growth left for cloud-based computing and new industrial machinery. All of these new applications create immense amounts of data, meaning memory providers like Micron should continue to see rising demand.“Micron's broad technology portfolio and strong innovation engine position us well for these growth trends. We continue to partner with our customers to ensure our technology and engineering roadmaps deliver the critical features for tomorrow's solutions,” Mehrotra explained.Of course, good CEOs are always trying to rally their company’s stock, and post-earnings conference calls tend to highlight bullish trends instead of lingering on headwinds. Mehrotra is hardly an unbiased spokesperson, but he is not wrong to say that the memory industry could soon defy the cyclical trends that investors have grown accustom to.And if the company’s recent earnings estimate activity is any indication, analysts agree with this sentiment. Within the past 60 days, we have seen nine revisions for Micron’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. These revisions have lifted the Zacks Consensus Estimate by $1.16 in this timeframe.Micron’s positive revision snapshot has helped the stock earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). It may take some time for this recent tech volatility to cool, but the fundamental picture for MU remains strong, and investors should consider scooping up shares at a discount.Want more market analysis from this author?

734,STX,"A slew of upbeat earnings from tech stocks helped the Nasdaq reverse a five-day losing streak on Apr 26. Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) pulled off an impressive earnings show that allayed fears for investors. This in fact showed that FANG stocks – Facebook, Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Google, whose parent company is Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report) – still have the bite despite an intensely volatile year so far. Even chipmakers notched promising results that eased concerns about weak demand for smartphones. Favorable government policies, in fact, are set to drive first quarter earnings growth for tech companies.Let’s take a look at tech stocks that are likely to see a promising first quarter.Facebook Earnings Look Past Data Privacy ScandalFacebook has been under tremendous pressure following the uproar over its user data fiasco. Everyone has raised questions over how Cambridge Analytica, which worked on Trump’s election campaign, had gained access to personal data of roughly 87 million Facebook users without their knowledge. But, the company shrugged off such dilemmas with blowout quarterly results.Facebook posted first-quarter profits of $4.99 billion that topped analysts’ estimate of $4.01 billion, while the social media giant added 70 million users in the same period despite numerous public calls against the social media app. Facebook currently boasts 1.45 billion daily users and nearly 2.2 billion monthly members.The company saw its shares pop more than 4% following the earnings report, up 7% after its conference call. Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said in the conference call that “despite facing important challenges, our community and business are off to a strong start in 2018” (read more: Facebook Q1 Earnings Top Estimates, User Growth Solid).Facebook’s Q1 Shows That FANG Stocks Still Have BiteMany market pundits, in the past several weeks, had questioned whether Internet and technology behemoths have more room to run as they were end of a major multiyear rally. FANG stocks, especially, have come under heavy gyration this year. However, the strength among FANG stocks got validation following Facebook’s strong quarterly results.But, why just Facebook? Amazon and Netflix have also given incredible performance. Amazon’s first-quarter profits more than doubled from year-ago levels, while sales continued to gain on an increase in Prime subscription prices. The Prime membership service reached 100 million subscribers after adding the highest number of members in 2017. In fact, the total count of Amazon Web Services active users, including the Prime numbers, was up 250% last year (read more: Amazon's Retail & Budding Web Services Make It a Real Deal).While Amazon’s shares have rallied more than 30% so far this year, Netflix has doubled that. And it’s partly because of its strong quarterly performance. Netflix posted $290.1 million in net income in the first quarter, higher than the profits generated by the streaming giant in the entire year of 2016. And if the company is able to meet its forecasted $358-million profit in the second quarter, it will be able to earn more than what it generated in 2017. An expanding customer base along with higher prices for the streaming service gave a boost to Netflix’s revenues (read more: Netflix Subscriber Growth Breezes Past Estimates! Snap It Up).Google, whose parent company is Alphabet, saw its earnings jump more than 70% in the first quarter even though capital outlays tripled from the year before. Earnings jumped on a change in accounting policy that compelled it to recognize the value of its stake in Uber (read more: Alphabet Q1 Earnings & Revenues Beat Estimates).Microsoft Heads for a Record, Chip Makers RallyMicrosoft Corporation’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) shares rose more than 3% in the extended session after finishing up 2.1% to $94.26 during regular trading period. Microsoft stocks just need to climb to the $130 mark, to reach the coveted milestone of $1 trillion market cap.The Redmond, Wash.,-based company saw its shares scale higher after upbeat fiscal third-quarter earnings. In fact, each of the company’s major business segments, including Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing, came out with results that exceeded analysts’ expectations (read more: Microsoft Tops Estimates, Intelligent Cloud Revenue Up 17%).Intel Corporation’s (INTC  -  Free Report) shares also climbed 7% after hours, following an uptick of 3.3% to close at $53.05 in the regular session. The chipmaker’s shares surged after earnings topped Wall Street estimates and PC-based sales came in better than expected (read more: Intel Stock Soars on Earnings Beat, Strong Guidance).Shares of other major chipmakers, including Advanced Micro Devices and Qualcomm, moved north on similar positive reports and lessened concerns over softening smartphone demand.Q1 Tech Earnings to be Double-DigitsTech earnings in the first quarter, largely, continue to be stronger than expected amid rising interest rates on higher inflation expectations and geopolitical concerns. While the recent tax cut has given the much needed windfall to the broader tech sector, cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data are expected to remain growth areas.Total Q1 earnings for the Tech sector are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 11.5% higher revenues. This would follow 24.2% earnings growth for the sector on 11.1% revenue growth in the preceding quarter.5 Solid PicksTech giants started the first quarter with a bang, while the overall sector is poised to register double-digit growth. Thus, investing in tech stocks expected to report a significant jump in Q1 earnings seems judicious.We have, thus, selected five such stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP.

736,STX,"Have you been paying attention to shares of NetApp (NTAP  -  Free Report)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 14.9% over the past month. NTAP hit a new 52-week high of $79.75 in the previous session. NetApp has gained 42% since the start of the year compared to the 5.6% move for the Computer and Technology sector and the 19% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on May 23, 2018, NetApp reported EPS of $1.05 versus consensus estimate of $1.01 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 2.86%.For the current fiscal year, NetApp is expected to post earnings of $3.54 per share on $6.19 billion in revenues. This represents a 16.71% change in EPS on a 4.77% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.03 per share on $6.51 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 16.15% and 5.13%, respectively.Valuation MetricsNetApp may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for NTAP? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.NetApp has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and D, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 22.2X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 20.6X versus its peer group's average of 13.5X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.6. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus  NetApp, Inc. Price and Consensus | NetApp, Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, NetApp currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if NetApp passes the test. Thus, it seems as though NTAP shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does NetApp Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of NetApp have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? Some of its industry peers are also impressive, including Super Micro Computer (SMCI  -  Free Report), Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report), and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), all of which currently have a Zacks Rank of at least #2 and a VGM Score of at least B, making them well-rounded choices.The Zacks Industry Rank is in the top 7% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for NTAP, even beyond its own solid fundamental situation.

738,STX,"Micron (MU  -  Free Report) shares have struggled to generate any positive momentum since the company’s recent earnings announcement, and with new volatility inspiring investors throughout global markets to take their profits from red-hot growth stocks, MU has hit a rare downturn over the past week or so.But Micron’s earnings report included several encouraging signs, with better-than-expected profits and revenues leading management to thank “secular technology trends” for the company’s remarkable growth. Micron might have suffered some profit taking, but paired with these strong results, the stock’s recent selloff feels like a brand-new opportunity to buy at a discount.The semiconductor memory giant continues to display attractive growth prospects at a valuation that should make any investor interested. So is Micron now Wall Street’s cheapest growth stock? Let’s take a closer look.ValuationValue investors have flocked to MU for years, and the stock frequently sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system. Part of this has to do with the fact that Micron’s core business, computer and mobile memory, has been commoditized by investors in recent years. For whatever underlying reason, the market’s memory giants are simply not treated like other tech stocks.This means that the best way to judge Micron’s valuation is by comparing it to other memory companies, including Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Seagate (STX  -  Free Report), and Toshiba. Each of these companies has expertise in different areas and are not always directly competing, but they all reflect the commoditization of the memory business.Here’s how Micron’s recent Forward P/E trend compares to this peer group: As we can see, MU has consistently traded at a slight discount to its peer group throughout 2018. Plus, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates calling for Micron to witness EPS growth of 119% and revenue growth of 43% this fiscal year. Investors will not find that type of expansion elsewhere in this peer group, which really underscores the attractiveness of MU’s current earnings multiple.Analyst SentimentJust two weeks ago, Micron received its most-bullish analyst call ever when Nomura Instinet raised its 12-month price target for the stock to $100 from $55. This projection represented an 83% upside from MU’s most-recent close before the note and remains the highest price target out of the 26 research firms that cover the company.And Nomura’s bullish sentiment is just a small part of a broader trend of analysts becoming more optimistic about the stock. Within the past 60 days, we have seen nine revisions to Micron’s full-year earnings estimates, with 100% agreement to the upside. The Zack Consensus Estimate for the company’s annual earnings has gained a staggering $1.01 over that timeframe.This positive estimate revision activity has helped MU earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). We believe the strongest growth and value stocks are those that also sport great Zacks Ranks, and the fact that Micron is displaying a unique combination of all three of these encouraging trends is truly remarkable.Want more market analysis from this author?

739,STX,"Red Hat Inc. (RHT  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Mar 26.We note that, on an average, the company has delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.73% in the trailing four quarters. In the last quarter, Red Hat delivered positive earnings surprise of 4.29%.Earnings increased 20.2% on a year-over-year basis primarily driven by strong top-line growth and operating margin expansion.Revenues increased 21.6% year over year to almost $748 million, primarily on the back of strong demand for hybrid cloud solutions. The figure was better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $734 million.Red Hat's top-line growth is benefiting from improving linearity owing to on-time renewal of deals reflecting strong demand for hybrid cloud technology solutions as well as aggressive cross-selling.Buoyed by solid results, Red Hat stock has returned 28.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the 7.8% rally in the industry it belongs to.  Outlook PositiveFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, Red Hat expects revenues between $758 million and $763 million.

The company’s collaborations with cloud providers like Amazon, Google and now Alibaba positions it for significant top-line growth.This is helping Red Hat to cross-sell cloud-based technology across its customer base. Emerging technologies have also been a driving factor.Additionally, complementary acquisitions have led to a favorable product mix, which is in turn bolstering overall results. The company’s strategy of making acquisitions (3scale, Ansible, FeedHenry, eNovance, Inktank, Codenvy) that can be easily integrated into current business has expanded its product portfolio into higher-growth segments, such as Hybrid cloud and other emerging technologies (Cloud Management, OpenShift, OpenStack, and Storage).Red Hat continued to win customer in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Enterprises like Follett School Solutions, SIX Group, ZTE Corporation, and Elo selected Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform as their enterprise Kubernetes solution of choice in the quarter.During the quarter, Red Hat acquired CoreOS, an innovator and leader in Kubernetes and container-native solutions, for a purchase price of $250 million.What Our Model Says?According to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

740,STX,"It seems that this isn’t the best of times for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report) and Uber. And the markets have reacted sharply with tech stocks taking a hit. While the social media platform has been embroiled in a data misuse scandal accounting for the breach of personal data of millions of users, the world saw its first casualty by a driverless car in Arizona, when a pedestrian was run over by an Uber vehicle.Tech stocks have seen a decline over the week with Facebook at the helm of the carnage. The social media giant’s shares fell nearly 7% on Monday, making it the worst performing stock on the S&P 500. Meanwhile, analysts are of the opinion that tech stocks are most overvalued relative to the market since 2009. While it’s a bit too early to predict if shares of Facebook and other tech giants will further decline, it makes good sense to pick up great value stocks while the market stays volatile.Facebook, Uber Rattle Tech StocksOn Mar 19, 28-year-old data scientist Chris Wylie, provided whistleblower accounts about Cambridge Analytica, a consultancy that was hired for President Donald Trump’s campaign. Wylie, who worked for Cambridge Analytica, alleged that the firm harvested data from more than 50 million Facebook accounts without the consent of the users. The allegations were enough to break the trust of millions of users who started deleting their Facebook accounts, resulting in the company’s shares taking a hit. Facebook lost about $50 billion of market value over the next two days.Moreover, Facebook’s scandal has taken the shape of a global controversy with Germany’s justice minister Katarina Barley reportedly summoning Facebook to clarify if the personal data of 30 million Facebook users in that country were protected from unlawful use by third parties. Brazil too has started an investigation if Cambridge Analytica acted illegally there too. And India’s IT minister said that the government is ready to launch an enquiry to see if Facebook had any role to play in unfairly influencing election in that country. If required, India will summon Zuckerberg.On the other hand, Uber’s driverless car, which struck down a pedestrian in Arizona, has raised questions about the credibility and future of autonomous vehicles. The recent incident has raised doubts in the minds of people if the world is still ready for driverless cars. A number of other tech and auto giants like Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), General Motors Co. (GM  -  Free Report) and Baidu are pumping in billions of dollars to develop autonomous-vehicle technology.However, after the accident at Tempe, AZ analysts are apprehensive that testing at Alphabet’s Waymo unit, which is worth $70 billion, could slow and delay commercialization of autonomous vehicles. The recent loss of trust in both Facebook and Uber was enough to see tech stocks plummet and unsettle investors. Also, other tech stocks like Apple, Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) declined 2.3% on Wednesday, while Alphabet  dipped 0.6%, thus affecting the overall tech sector.Tech Stocks Are Most OvervaluedTechnology stocks are trading at an 11% valuation premium to the broader market, the highest since 2009, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch strategists. Meanwhile, the valuation of the S&P 500 is at its lowest level since late 2016, with the recent decline in stocks. Moreover, the S&P technology sector has increased 7.6% year to date compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 1.5%.The primary reason for this is that technology stocks have outperformed the broader market both last year and this year, and its price gains have outpaced earnings growth. Strategists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch also said that with the recent decline in share prices, the valuation of S&P 500 stocks has fallen to a level last witnessed in 2016. Given this scenario, it is always wise to buy stocks on the dip, as technology is an overweight sector.Our ChoicesFacebook’s recent data misuse scandal coupled with Uber’s driverless car accident has seen tech stocks plunging. Shares of other tech giants like Apple and Alphabet too have seen a decline in the last few days.Overall, it’s too early to predict how the tech sector will perform in the days to come. As it is, the sector remains overvalued given that price increases continue to overshoot earnings growth. Given this scenario, it makes sense to identify value stocks that that could prove to be lucrative going forward.

742,STX,"Subdued inflation mollified concerns that the Federal Reserve might speed up rate hikes this year. In the wake of this, investors’ appetite for riskier assets, including tech and energy, has increased, pushing major bourses higher. In turn, market volatility continued to ebb.Thus, picking stocks from desirable sectors seems prudent. And why not? Buffet’s bet on Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Facebook, Inc.’s (FB  -  Free Report) shrugging off of the data fiasco have boosted investor confidence. Meanwhile, energy shares have shifted to high gear as oil touched its highest level since November 2014.Wall Street Rallies: Here’s WhyThe Dow Jones added nearly 200 points on May 10 to notch its longest string of advances — six straight days – since Feb 16. And if the blue-chip index can gain on May 11, it will mark its longest winning streak since Oct 5, 2017. The broader S&P 500 finished in the green, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq registering its fifth successive day of gains.Stocks scaled higher as the tumultuous market phase seems to have faded — at least for the time being. Softer inflation numbers helped allay fears of faster interest rate hikes this year, while concerns about a US-China trade war have somewhat subsided.Tepid Inflation Data, Trade War Fears SubsideRising inflation played spoilsport at the beginning of the year. It compelled the Fed to quicken its monetary policy instead of raising rates at a gradual pace, aggravating market fears. But, softer-than-expected rise in consumer prices in the month of April cooled inflation fears. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in April from the prior month, per the Labor Department. Market pundits, however, expects the CPI to tick up to 0.3%.Fears about a full-blown trade war between the two largest economies, the United States and China, have been doing the rounds for quite some time. This in turn could deal a massive blow to the global economy. However, China is expected to import more American goods as the two sides are looking for means to avert an all-out trade war.Volatility EbbWith investors’ anxiety seems to have eased, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called “fear gauge” — fell for the sixth straight session, down 2.4% to 13.09 on May 10. Now, the index is likely to slip to its lowest close since Jan 26.This indicated that the index has almost erased the huge spike witnessed in early February. During that time period, concerns over inflation saw the index more than double in a single session. Moreover, the VIX’s average level is 20. Thus, the current level is extremely low compared to historical standards.Appetite for Riskier Assets RisesWith fears taking a back seat, investors are looking to bet on riskier assets. Technology and Internet stocks regained their crown as the most sought-after stocks. Bellwethers Apple and Facebook, to name a few, saw their shares move north. The recent tax cut has already given the much needed windfall to tech, while cloud computing, artificial intelligence and big data remain growth areas (read more: Buffett's Bet on Apple Sparks Tech Rally: 5 Solid Buys).One of the least popular sectors last year, energy, is now hogging the limelight. It’s kind of a comeback for them as oil prices springs above the $71 a barrel. Iran sanctions have majorly kept oil prices at a three and a half year peak. A cut in global oil output initiated by the OPEC and other major oil producers, including Russia, has helped prices more than double from the collapse in early 2016. Venezuela’s production woes also drove the rally (read more: Oil Hits $70 for First Time in 4 Years: 5 Top Energy Picks).Rosy Earnings Picture Both tech and energy sectors are also witnessing solid first-quarter performance. For the quarter as a whole, total tech earnings are expected to be up 28.5% on 12.6% higher revenues.The energy sector’s earnings are expected to grow 76% from the same period last year on 14.4% higher revenues. Oil majors Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM  -  Free Report) and Chevron Corporation (CVX  -  Free Report) have already seen the best first-quarter performance in years last month.5 Top WinnersGiven the bullishness, investing in sound stocks from the aforesaid sectors seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

743,STX,"Ireland, the fastest growing economy of the European Union, has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. The Irish labor market remains tight currently as its unemployment is near a 10-year low. Also, the EU has been upbeat about the growth prospects of the Irish economy in the years to come.Finally, business conditions have kept improving and Irish wages have been boosted by tight labor conditions. Such favorable conditions call for investing in stocks from Ireland.Unemployment at a 10-year LowFor the first time in as many as 10 years, the overall jobless rate in Ireland swooned to below 6% in April. Per the latest report from the Central Statistics Office on May 1, the unemployment rate fell to 5.9%. The metric was last around this level in 2008, just before Ireland’s economic crisis.The jobless rate has been on a steady decline since the country’s finance department projected in April that by the next year, the Irish economy would witness the unemployment rate falling to as low as 5.3%. The body also stated that after this, joblessness would hold steady at that level till 2020, while the economy makes its way to full employment.Coming to the statistics, the seasonally adjusted rate for the current level of unemployment fell even below the revised rate of 6% in the month before and 6.8% in April last year. The total number of persons who were left unemployed within Ireland stood at 140,300, lower than 143,500 persons in the month earlier. Also, in the past 12 months, 16,700 persons got jobs.Irish Manufacturing Activity Gains TractionManufacturing activity in the European country gained momentum in April after a period of lull in March due to weather-related disruptions. Last month, a snowstorm in Ireland — the ugliest in last 36 years — forced the closure of business activity across the country. This led to Purchasing Managers' Index falling to 54.1% in March, its 12-month low.However, post resumption of business in the country in April, the Investec factory Purchasing Managers' Index surged to 55.3%. Further, business conditions within the Irish economy have steadily improved for the last 59 months. A reading above 50 indicates economic expansion.EU Raises Its Growth Forecast on IrelandIn its Spring 2018 European Economic Forecast, the European Union (EU) raised its growth forecast for the Irish economy. The body stated that the country would continue to experience strong GDP growth in the next two years.The commission remained upbeat on the prospects of the Irish economy and forecast that in 2018, Ireland’s GDP will surge 5.7% and 4.1% in 2019. Such growth would be achieved on the back of a rise in household spending boosted by an increase in wages. Further, continued investment in construction would also ensure that the economy remains robust in the years to come. Rising employment would drive wages higher and low levels of inflation would boost consumer spending.4 Best ChoicesIreland’s unemployment rate has fallen to a 10-year low even as the economy keeps growing consistently. This indicates that the country would remain EU’s fastest growing economy for some time to come. Further, manufacturing activity in the country has also gathered steam in the last month. Finally, business conditions have kept on improving for almost 60 months on the trot. Such favorable conditions make Ireland’s stocks a hotbed for money.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors.

746,STX,"The fastest-growing economy of the European Union is set scale new heights. Touted to grow five times as much as Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland has gone from strength to strength in the past few years. With unemployment already near a 10-year low, the country has witnessed strength in its service sector as well as household spending.Further, under tight labor market conditions, wages in the country have risen steeply. Taking such factors into consideration, betting on stocks from Ireland seems prudent at the moment.IMF Chief Lauds Ireland’s EconomyOn Jun 25, the chief of International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde praised the Celtic tiger’s growth and performance in the last few years. Lagarde was speaking at Government Buildings in Dublin after her meeting with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and the country’s Minister of Finance Paschal Donohoe.She stated that Ireland has picked up from her last visit to the country as the IMF chief in 2013. While economic growth increased steadily from 1.6% in 2013 to 7.8% last year, unemployment fell from 14.6% to below 6% this year. Also, this announcement comes right ahead of the publication of IMF’s annual report on the Irish economy.While praising Ireland’s economic resilience and prowess, Lagarde quoted John F. Kennedy in a bid to caution the country of international shocks. She said that “one should fix the roof when the sun shines,” advising the country’s policymakers to prepare for the “rainy day” as Brexit looms large.Lagarde cautioned the country of “potential shocks whether they come from trade and financing costs.” However, she remained positive about the prospects of the economy.EY Predicts Almost 5% Growth for the Celtic TigerPer the latest report by the financial accountancy firm, Ernst & Young on Jun 25, the Republic of Ireland is all set to witness GDP growth of 4.9% in 2018 and almost 4% in 2019. Further, the report states that an additional 236,700 new jobs would be added to the Irish economy through 2022.The report also confirmed that 21 financial services companies have vested their faith in Ireland in the sense that they have vowed to move the majority of their operations from the UK to the Ireland following Brexit. Consequently, the report named Dublin as the most-popular business hub post Brexit.Irish Service Sector Gathers SteamService activity in Ireland gained momentum in the month of May, staging a rebound after declining in the previous months due to harsh winters. Service activity surged to a four-month high in May. The Investec Services Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) increased to 59.3% in May from 58.4 in the previous month.Also, growth in the level of new business from abroad hit a two-year high to settle at 59.5%. Such growth was achieved on the back of increased purchase orders from Britain.4 Best ChoicesIreland’s growth in the past few years not only shows its resilience to the economic downturn in the EU but also makes it one of the most business-friendly destinations of the region. With the unemployment level near a 10-year low, higher wages and burgeoning service activity calls for investing in stocks from the country.In this context, we have selected four stocks that are expected to gain from these factors.

747,STX,"International Business Machines Corporation (IBM  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 18 after the market closes. Notably, the company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 3.39%.IBM’s significant investments in “Strategic Imperatives” — cloud computing, mobile, cognitive technologies and AI are expected to help the company win customers and drive the top line in to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, IBM has also undertaken a number of blockchain initiatives to capitalize on growth opportunity in the industry which is a significant tailwind.For fourth-quarter fiscal 2017, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for IBM’s earnings per share and total revenues are projected to be $5.17 and $21.96 billion representing an increase of 3.2% and 0.9% from fourth-quarter fiscal 2016.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Cloud, Security & IoT to Drive GrowthIBM is focusing on cloud computing which is evident from the fact that it continues to open data centers aggressively.

IBM signed almost 40 new clients on its IoT platform. The company also launched new products like IoT for Connected Products during the quarter.Moreover, Strategic Imperatives (cloud, analytics, mobility and security) grew 10% at constant currency from the year-ago quarter.In recent times, IBM’s cloud-based offerings have been selected by the likes of Syniverse, State of Arizona, Codify Academy, Italian airport operator SEA and Germany-based leading automotive supplier Faurecia.The initiatives are anticipated to improve IBM’s competitive position in the cloud computing market currently dominated by Amazon’s Web Services and Microsoft Corp.Notably, for the fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from Cognitive Solutions and GBS are pegged at $6.378 billion and $4.235, up 6.3% and 0.3%, respectively, from the actual figure reported in the prior-year quarter.Blockchain Initiatives Gaining MomentumIBM is involved in a number of Blockchain initiatives as the technology gains rapid mainstream adoption. The company is currently the dominant player in the blockchain market. Recently, CNBC quoted Juniper Research, which placed IBM above Microsoft Corporation in blockchain-related advancements.IBM uses hyperledger technology for blockchain applications and is also a key member of the Hyperledger committee. This enables the company to gain access to prior notification of any changes in the underlying infrastructure.IBM has been winning significant deals in recent times. The company has struck bank guarantee deals with ANZ and Westpac and a multi-line insurance contract with American International Group and Standard Chartered PLC. IBM has also inked a deal with global food suppliers and also one with automobile manufacturer, ZF Friedrichshafen to enhance its Car e-Wallet technology.

748,STX,"Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) delivered impressive fiscal third-quarter 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.46 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.36 per share, surging 32.7% on a year-over-year basis. However, the figure declined 1.4% sequentially.Revenues of $2.80 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.76 billion and also grew 4.8% from the year-ago quarter but declined 3.6% sequentially.Both the top and bottom lines witnessed year-over-year improvement, owing to robust adoption driven by strong demand of Seagate’s storage drives. Moreover, increasing traction for mass storage solutions across company’s edge and enterprise markets remained a tailwind.Seagate’s stock has surged 33.1% in the past year, substantially outperforming industry’s rally of 21.8%.Performance in DetailDuring the reported quarter, Seagate shipped 87.4 exabytes of hard disk drive (HDD) storage, with an average capacity of record 2.4 terabytes per drive.The company shipped 43.8 exabytes for the enterprise HDD market, each with an average capacity of 4.8 terabytes.Total HDD revenues went up 6.7% year over year to $2.59 billion during the quarter primarily due to advancement and accelerated growth of cloud storage technologies. Management believes that the HDD product suite is ready to cater to the demands of the market.In the nearline market, the company shipped 41.3 exabytes of HDD, nearline products’ average capacity per drive reached 6.5 terabytes. Management noted that the company’s 10-terabyte helium nearline product was one of the top revenue generators in the quarter. Growth in the 12-terabyte helium nearline product line was also encouraging. Given the impressive customer feedback, Seagate anticipates capitalizing on the market adoption of these products.Within the edge and customer verticals, the company witnessed year-over-year exabyte growth in all end markets, including PC compute, consumer, surveillance, gaming, and NAS markets.Non-HDD segment (cloud systems and silicon group) revenues declined 13.2% year over year but gained 1.9% sequentially to $217 million. Per management, year-over-year decrease was “primarily due to the planned end of life of some legacy OEM cloud systems products and the divestiture of high-performance computing assets.”Margin DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin which came in at 30.8% declined 60 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis but expanded 40 bps sequentially.Non-GAAP operating expenses were down 13% on a year-over-year basis to $385 million. This decrease in expenses can be attributed to certain cost improvement initiatives undertaken since past two years.Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteBalance Sheet and Cash FlowSeagate ended the March quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.93 billion up from $2.56 billion in the quarter ending December. At the end of the quarter, the company had a long-term debt (excluding current portion) of $4.34 billion compared with $5.02 billion in the previous quarter.The company’s board has approved a quarterly dividend payment of 63 cents for the March quarter to be paid on Jul 5, 2018. Further, in the quarter, Seagate redeemed senior notes due November 2018 for $57 million.Cash flow from operations was $558 million for the third quarter and was $1.65 billion for the first three quarters of fiscal 2018. Free cash flow for the quarter and first nine months of the fiscal came at $489 million and $1.4 billion, respectively.GuidanceManagement anticipates fourth-quarter revenues to grow approximately 17% on a year-over-year basis due to strong cloud demand and seasonality in other markets. However, the company projects revenues to remain flat sequentially. The company notifies that Exabyte demand is increasing on a year-over-year basis across most of the markets it caters.Seagate projects gross margins to be flat on a sequentially basis and come within the company’s long-term range of 29–33%. It projects to generate an operating cash flow of at least $500 million in the fourth quarter.Seagate anticipates additional variable compensation for its employees in the fourth quarter. However, management believes that its ongoing cost management initiatives operational efficiency will enable the company to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses by 1-2% from the prior quarter.For fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to grow 4% and the company envisions generating an operating cash flow greater than $2 billion.For second half of 2018, the company expects solid capacity demand, robust exabyte growth in its edge markets along with seasonal strength in other markets to boost the top line.ConclusionWith the huge transformations in the storage industry, mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has bolstered the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products which is beneficial for Seagate.In January this year, Seagate entered into a long-term NAND supply agreement with Toshiba. The agreement will help the company in its innovation of HDD, solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions, consequently expanding its product portfolio.The company is trying to focus less on the mission-critical 15K and sub-1-terabyte client consumer markets. Management anticipates these markets to eventually converge with either silicon-based memory or cloud storage, where it is already expanding footprint. Notably, as a percentage of total revenues, the products accounted for lesser than 8%.Favorable macroeconomic environment and rising global investments in cloud will continue to work as key catalysts. Further, hints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive.The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology, which is expected be shipped in 2019, is yet another positive. This move will not only reinforce company’s leadership in areal density but also boost nearline drive capacity points by at least 24 terabytes per drive.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Seagate sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector worth considering are Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report), Mellanox Technologies, Ltd.

750,STX,"The two independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) — yesterday reported worldwide PC shipment data for the fourth quarter of 2017. Although the figures reported by both firms are different, they share a similar opinion that the worldwide PC shipment has shown concrete signs of improvement in the quarter.Although the PC shipment declined year over year, Gartner’s data depicts that it is rather modest compared with several previous quarters. On the other hand, as per IDC, PC shipment recorded its “first positive holiday quarter shipment growth in six years.”Decline Moderated – Per GartnerThe preliminary data released by Gartner displayed that PC shipments in the fourth quarter were down 2% year over year to 71.6 million units. The decline marked the 13th straight quarter of year-over-year fall, which is the longest duration of decline in the history of the PC industry.As per the data compiled by Gartner, the overall PC market was mainly adversely affected by weak demand for consumer PCs. The decline in the segment came despite a record holiday season which signifies that PCs are no longer favorite gift items for the season, Mikako Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner, said in her note.For the full year, PC shipments declined 2.8% from the prior-year level to 262.5 million units. This independent research firm highlighted a very interesting fact that in the last six or seven years, the PC industry has consolidated heavily. Gartner reported that in 2017, the top four vendors have combined market share of 64% which is much higher than the 45% grabbed by the top four vendors of 2011.First Holiday Growth in Six Years – Per IDCUnlike Gartner, the data compiled by IDC states that worldwide PC shipments registered the first growth in the last six holiday seasons. The difference in data is mainly due to separate techniques used for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products. For example, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and ""detachables"" such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer, which are not taken into account by IDC.During the fourth quarter, PC shipments touched 70.6 million units, marking year-over-year growth of 0.7% and outperforming the research firm’s earlier prediction of a fall of 1.7%. The growth was mainly driven by “commercial upgrades and pockets of improving consumer PC demand.”For the full year, although IDC reported a 0.2% year-over-year volume decline in PC shipments, it stated that 2017 marks the most stable year for the industry since 2011. PC shipments were 259.5 million units during 2017.Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return  Computer - Mini computers Industry 5YR % Return Top Vendors ListAlthough both research firms’ data varies, they have similar views when it comes to ranking of top vendors. The firms agree that HP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) continues to be the market leader in the space, followed by Lenovo, Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Asus and Acer Group. Notably, Asus and Acer tied for the fifth spot, according to Gartner as well as IDC.Both firms stated that among the top vendors mentioned above, HP, Dell and Apple registered year-over-year growth in PC shipments, while Asus and Acer marked declines. The firms have different opinion on Lenovo as Gartner states that it registered a decline, while its shipment remained flat year over year, as per IDC.Talking about only the U.S. market, it is only HP which has witnessed increase in PC shipments as well as improvement in market share. Per Gartner, this was the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company in the U.S. market.Moreover, the quarter marked the seventh consecutive quarter of overall shipment growth for HP. We believe the spin-off from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Region-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms have a slightly different opinion. Per Gartner, Asia/Pacific, Japan and Latin America registered improvement in PC shipments, while the EMEA region slightly declined. However, the U.S. market witnessed a steep decline as consumers were seen preferring new “popular products, such as voice-enabled speakers, and newly released smartphones” over PCs during the holiday season, per Kitagawa.On the other hand, per IDC, except the United States, all three regions — EMEA, APeJ and Japan — reported growth in the quarter.However, the major thing highlighted by the firms was PC shipment growth in China, mainly driven by the huge success of Single Day promotion and strong demand for commercial PCs. According to Gartner, PC shipment in the country inched up 1.1% in the fourth quarter.What’s Ahead?Although the overall PC market is still very challenging, the forward-looking statements of the research firms indicate that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization. Jay Chou, IDC research manager, noted in a statement that “The fourth quarter results showed some potentially encouraging headway against the difficult environment in retail and consumer PCs.”Both firms agreed that consumers now look for more advanced and quality devices rather than low-priced PCs. Kitagawa of Gartner said that ""the PC will become a more specialized, purpose-driven device.”IDC’s Chou has more or less similar views as he mentioned that ""Enticed by a growing array of products that promise all-day battery life, high portability, and address emerging use cases that require more compute power, pockets of the consumer base are taking a serious look at these revamped PCs.”The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to the PC vendors, as well as the companies which are dependent on the PC industry.An improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel Corporation, Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, Western Digital sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Seagate carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

751,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc’s (STX  -  Free Report) shares have added about 4.1% in yesterday’s trading session, outperforming the market.In the last year, its shares have gained 41.4%, while the industry recorded growth of 31.7%.Will the recent positive trend continue driving the stock over the long haul or is it due for a pullback? Before we discuss how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the fundamentals and trends in order to get a better hold on the important drivers.Growth DriversSeagate recently announced preliminary results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The storage solutions provider expects higher revenues and margins in the quarter due to greater demand for its HDD products and operational efficiencies.It now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues is pegged at $2.74 billion. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 30%. Further, operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis are projected to be in the range of $390-$444 million. Previously, the company expected non-GAAP operating expenses to decrease 2-3% with cost cutting initiatives.According to Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer of Seagate, “Our revenue growth and strong portfolio profitability in the December quarter reflect solid demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions, particularly for our cloud-based environments.”Another factor that bolstered share price was Seagate’s agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, consequently helping in innovation of hard disk drives (HDD), solid state drives (SSD) and hybrid solutions. This will improve competitive position in the flash memory market.Seagate is also gaining from the increasing adoption of its Nearline HDDs. We believe that Nearline’s rapid adoption will boost Seagate’s competitive position against Western Digital.Further, the company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology are a catalyst.Notably, with the huge transformations in the storage industry mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has provided a boost to the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is beneficial for Seagate.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last seven days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Seagate's current quarter and current year witnessed upward revisions. For the current quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.27 per share, up from earnings of $1.15 per share earlier. Similarly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for current year is currently pegged at $4.28 per share compared with $4.06 projected seven days ago.Style Scores Look GreatMicron currently sports an A grade for Value, Growth and Momentum, lifting its overall VGM score to A.ValuationOn the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 11.0x, significantly lower than the industry average of 16.4x.

752,STX,"AppFolio Inc. (APPF  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 30. Notably, the company has a decent positive earnings surprise history. The stock has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, recording an astounding average positive earnings surprise of 221.43%.In fourth-quarter 2017, the company delivered earnings of 12 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. However, quarterly earnings were flat compared with the year-ago quarter. Revenues surged 35% to $37.9 million and exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36 million.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.AppFolio has a Zacks Rank #2 and Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult.However, on a year-over-year basis, the company is likely to report robust top and bottom-line growth.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 12 cents, which is way higher than the year-ago quarter’s figure of 4 cents. We note that, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has remained unchanged over the past 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $41 million, up 27.7% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, Appfolio shares have gained 16.5% in the year-to-date period, substantially outperforming industry’s growth of meager 4.4%.Factors to ConsiderAppFolio’s sustained focus on product and technology related innovations remain key catalysts. Upgrades to product suite based on customer feedback which are directed toward making the offerings user friendly, is likely to bolster its customer base.AppFolio platform’s integration with Amazon’s voice service, Alexa is likely to boost the top line, going forward. This feature will allow tenants to pay rents or submit other requests using voice commands through AppFolio’s platform. We believe the company’s collaboration with Amazon along with the expansion of its offerings will bolster the top line, going ahead.Notable product upgrades and enhancements including the likes of AppFolio Renters Insurance, a new Value+ Service, and same day ACH, an addition to the existing Electronic Payments Value+ Platform are likely to benefit adoption.During the fourth quarter of 2017, the company had upgraded its product suite by enhancing features to its existing Electronic Payments Value+ Platform. In the fourth quarter, Value + services revenue surged 42% year over year to $20.8 million.These advancements are projected to increase the customer base of the company, which comprised 11,700 property managers and around 10,000 legal customers at the end of 2017.However, intensifying competition in the cloud based business software solutions space remains a concern.AppFolio, Inc.

753,STX,"The third-quarter reporting cycle has begun and 52 S&P 500 members, representing 16.7% of the index’s total market capitalization, have already released their results.Per the latest Earnings Trends, total earnings of these companies are up 13.3% on a year-over-year basis (76.9% of the companies beat EPS estimates). Total revenue is up 6.9% (73.1% of the companies beat top-line estimates).Third-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are anticipated to be up 3% from the year-ago quarter on revenues that are estimated to increase 4.9%. The anticipated growth rate is definitely sluggish when compared with the double-digit growth in each of the first two quarters of the year.Of the 16 sectors, eight are expected to report earnings growth, with robust performance anticipated from Oil/Energy, Conglomerates and Technology.  Technology Earnings ExpectationsWe note that the technology sector has been a strong performer on a year-to-date basis. As of Oct 18, only 9.8% of the total market capitalization has reported results. Total earnings of these technology companies surged 52.8% on a year-over-year basis (83.3% of the companies beat EPS estimates) while total revenue increased 13.8% (100% of the companies beat top-line estimates).The sector is benefiting from increasing demand for cloud-based platforms, growing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions, Augmented/Virtual reality devices, autonomous cars, advanced driver assisted systems (ADAS) and Internet of Things (IoT) related software.Cloud momentum was evident from International Business Machines Corporation’s (IBM  -  Free Report) latest quarterly result.Earnings for the technology sector are now anticipated to be up 9.9% on top-line growth of 6.9%.Let’s take a sneak peek into two technology companies that are set to report their quarterly earnings on Oct 23:We expect Seagate Technology Plc’s (STX  -  Free Report) first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings to be hurt by worldwide weak PC shipment data from Gartner and IDC, intensifying competition from Western Digital Corporation (WDC) and lack of significant presence in the flash market.Seagate is a hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer and is primarily dependent on PC sales.We note that a decline in PC shipment reflects weak demand, which doesn't bode well for the company.However, improving ramp of nearline drives, renewal of existing partnership with Baidu Inc (BIDU  -  Free Report) and stringent cost control can somewhat offset negative trends.Seagate’s management anticipates revenues in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2.53 billion, reflecting year-over-year decline of 9.5%.Seagate’s stock has declined 10% year to date, substantially underperforming the 15% rally of the industry.On the other hand, Logitech International S.A. (LOGI  -  Free Report) has gained 47.8% year to date, substantially outperforming the 15.4% rally of the industry.The outperformance can be attributed to the thriving cloud-based video-conferencing services, gaming and Smart Home business. Moreover, strategic product launches and restructuring actions have been key growth drivers. Logitech is enjoying an all-pervasive growth of its retail business, which will boost top-line growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.Logitech remains optimistic that the steady traction of its product lines, as well as positive industry trends will continue to fuel growth. The company has been able to leverage its software and go-to-market capabilities to drive market share gains.Moreover, the Astro acquisition will expand Logitech’s competitive position in the Console Gaming headset market. Additionally, the cost-saving program is anticipated to bear positive impact on profitability.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +18.8% from 2016 - Q1 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +157.0%, +128.0%, +97.8%, +94.7%, and +90.2% respectively.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - Q1 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 11X over. Maybe even more remarkable is the fact that we're willing to share their latest stocks with you without cost or obligation.See Them Free>>

754,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Oct 23.Last quarter, the company delivered negative earnings surprise of 34.3%. However, we note that Seagate has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three out of trailing four quarters.We believe that worldwide weak PC shipment will hurt earnings in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, intense competition from Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) and lack of significant presence in the flash market are other concerns.However, improving ramp of nearline drives, renewal of existing partnership with Baidu Inc (BIDU  -  Free Report) and stringent cost control are likely to offset the negative trends.Seagate’s stock has declined 10% year to date, substantially underperforming the 15% rally of the industry.Weak PC Shipment Major ConcernWeak PC shipment in the third quarter as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released data is a major concern for Seagate. Both agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, is escalating PC prices, thereby thwarting overall demand.Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteSeagate is a hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer and is primarily dependent on PC sales.We note that a decline in PC shipment reflects weak demand, which doesn't bode well for the company.In the last quarter, total HDD shipment was 62.2 exabytes (EB). More importantly, HDD enterprise revenues represented 37% of total revenue.We believe that improving ramp of its 10 terabyte (TB) helium (nearline) drives is a positive. Seagate expects to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the current quarter. Moreover, management has noted that the 12 TB product (shipped in June) has received excellent customer feedback.Losing HDD market Share Dents ConfidenceSeagate has been losing HDD market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corporation. Despite a number of acquisitions, the company has no significant presence in the flash memory market.These factors have hurt Seagate’s top-line growth, which declined 9.3% in the previous quarter. Management anticipates revenues in the range of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2018.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $2.53 billion, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.5%.Negative Earnings ESPWe believe Seagate is unlikely to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the first quarter due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and Earnings ESP of -6.43%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere is a stock you may consider as our proven model shows it has the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.06% and boasts a Zacks Rank #1.

755,STX,"The downward trend in the PC industry persisted in third-quarter 2017 as well. According to the recently released worldwide PC shipment data by independent research firms — Gartner Inc. (IT  -  Free Report) and International Data Corporation (“IDC”) — even the back-to-school season failed to lift the PC market.The preliminary data released by Gartner depicts that PC shipments in the quarter were down 3.6% year over year to 67 million units. This also marks the 12th straight quarter of year-over-year fall — the longest duration of decline in the history of PC industry.Though IDC also reported a decline in PC shipments, its reported figures were widely different. Per the research firm, worldwide PC shipment edged down 0.5% on a year-over-year basis and totaled 67.2 million in the third quarter. The decline, however, was lower than IDC’s previous forecast of 1.4%.Although the firms reported a decline in PC shipments, their take on the back-to-school season sales performance is different. Per Gartner, a very weak back-to-school sales season resulted in a 10.3% year-over-year decline in PC sales in the United States, while IDC believes “back-to-school promotions helped boost results”, in the quarter.Chromebook – The Major DifferentiatorIn our opinion, the disparity in data and comments may be due to the different techniques used by the firms for tracking PC sales, as well as the inclusion and/or exclusion of certain products, specially Chromebooks, which run on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Chrome operating system.Notably, unlike Gartner, IDC includes Chromebooks. Gartner, on the other hand, takes into account Microsoft Corporation (MSFT  -  Free Report) tablets and detachable, such as the iPad Pro and the Asus Transformer.According to IDC, Chromebooks continued to witness strong growth, while in a reply to MarketWatch’s mail, Mika Kitagawa, principal analyst at Gartner said that “they did notice “strong growth” for the devices in the quarter, especially in the U.S.”Escalating Prices Upsetting DemandAlthough the firms chose different data-compilation techniques, both highlighted almost similar reasons for the plunge. Both agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, has been flaring up PC prices, in turn thwarting the overall demand. Per Gartner, DRAM shortages worsened during the third quarter when compared with the first half of 2017.Mika Kitagawa observed that to counter higher component cost situation “most vendors generally pass the price hike on to consumers, rather than absorbing the cost themselves”, which adversely affected the overall PC market.Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % Return Computer - Peripheral Equipment Industry 5YR % ReturnRegion-Wise PerformanceTalking about the geographical performance, the firms agreed that overall PC shipments across every region dropped during the quarter. However, as per IDC, which reports Japan’s sales separately, the country witnessed year-over-year growth for the fifth consecutive quarter.Per Gartner, PC shipments in the United States dipped 10.3% year over year to 14.7 million units, primarily due to poor consumer PC demand, partially offset by stable demand in the business segment. Nevertheless, the firm noted that business PC demand “could slow down among SMBs due to PC price increases due to component shortages.""PC shipment in Europe and the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) edged down 1.1% year over year to 19 million units, according to Gartner. The research firm also mentioned that the declining trend in Western Europe is slowing down, therefore it anticipates a potential stability in the last quarter of 2017. In Eastern Europe, Gartner didn’t notice any remarkable positive influence from the Windows 10 migration and thus, demand is not improving.In Asia/Pacific, PC shipments dropped 2.1% year over year to 24 million units, mainly due to dismal demand for consumer PCs, partially offset by steady demand for business PCs, per Gartner. The research firm noted a 5% PC unit sales decline in China.In Japan, the PC industry continued to display strength, according to IDC. Per the firm, “Japan traditional PC market showed stable growth in 3Q17, primarily driven by refresh projects and migration to Windows 10 as well as further notebook adoption.”Top Vendors ListHP Inc. (HPQ  -  Free Report) retained its leading position during the quarter, per Gartner. Also, this was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth for the company, following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The spin-off from its parent, Hewlett-Packard Company, and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and cutting jobs to lower costs, are apparently paying off at last.Gartner stated that among the top five vendors, only HP Inc. recorded growth in PC shipment, while Dell, Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), Lenovo and Asus witnessed declines during the third quarter. With a market share of 30.5%, HP Inc. witnessed year-over-year growth of 4.4% in PC shipment.Lenovo, on the other hand, registered a 1.5% decline and has a market share of 21.4%. Dell holds the third spot, with a market share of 15.2%, and witnessed a 0.4% decline.Apple and Asus also registered year-over-year decline of 5.5% and 9%, respectively. However, in terms of market share, Apple lost its fourth position to Asus, with respective shares of 6.9% and 7.3%.In the top vendors’ list, IDC has a slightly different opinion. While HP Inc., Lenovo and Dell are the top three vendors here also, the research firm has different names for the fourth and fifth position. Per IDC, Apple is in the fourth spot, while Asus holds the fifth position.What’s Ahead?Though both research firms reported a year-over-year decline in global PC shipments, the forward looking statements indicate that the PC industry is moving toward stabilization.IDC’s Loren Loverde, program vice president, Worldwide PCD Trackers, said “The traditional PC market performed much as expected in the third quarter."" He further added, ""Emerging markets rebounded slightly more than anticipated, but overall results reflect the stabilization we expected following component and inventory adjustments. The outlook for the fourth quarter remains cautious, likely with a small decline in volume for the quarter and the year. The gains in emerging regions and potential for more commercial replacements represent some upside potential, although we continue to expect incremental declines in total shipments for the next few years.""Furthermore, Gartner does not include Chromebook shipments in data compilation, which is showing tremendous growth. Last year, Chromebook shipments grew a whopping 38%, while the total PC market dipped 6%.In the second-quarter PC shipment report, Ms. Kitagawa had said, “The Chromebook is not a PC replacement as of now, but it could be potentially transformed as a PC replacement if a few conditions are met going forward.” She further added “For example, infrastructure of general connectivity needs to improve; mobile data connectivity needs to become more affordable; and it needs to have more offline capability”.The aforementioned positive comments on the PC market by the two industry experts will provide a respite to the PC vendors, as well as the companies which are dependent on the PC industry.An improving trend in PC shipments will benefit the business prospects of companies like HP Inc., Microsoft, Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Seagate Technologies (STX  -  Free Report) and Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), which continue to depend substantially on PC sales.Currently, HP Inc. and Intel, both carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

756,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) recently announced that IronWolf, IronWolf Pro and Barracuda Pro – which are part of the Guardian Series of hard disk drives (HDDs) – are now available in capacity of up to 12 terabyte (TB).The 3.5 inch Barracuda Pro HDD is suitable for high performance desktop, creative pro desktop applications and gaming. The high-speed drive enables faster large file transfers and photo editing.On the other hand, IronWolf and IronWolf Pro are suitable for Network Attached Storage (NAS). The new 12TB drive also support Seagate’s IronWolf Health Management (IHM) software, which helps in improving the overall system reliability by displaying actionable prevention, intervention or recovery options for the user.Capacity Expansion to Boost DemandSeagate believes that the expanded capacity will improve demand for the HDDs among large enterprises, small and medium size businesses (SMBs) and creative professionals. The HDDs are capable to address the growing storage needs amid huge influx of data generated by emerging technology and services like augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), 4K resolution and 360-degree videos.Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus  Seagate Technology PLC Price and Consensus | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteMarket research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. More importantly, almost 20% of this will be critical to daily lives and nearly 10% of that will be hypercritical.This massive volume of data presents significant growth opportunity for enterprises. However, effective storage is absolutely necessary to properly harness this data. This presents significant growth opportunity for Seagate in the long term.Expanding Portfolio to Boost ResultsSeagate has been losing HDD market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report). Despite a number of acquisitions, the company also doesn’t have significant presence in the flash memory market.Nevertheless, we expect Seagate’s expanding portfolio to be a game changer in the future. At the 2017 Flash Memory Summit (FMS), the company announced enhanced versions of two flash technologies to boost performance and capacity for mixed data center workloads.Although ramping of its 10 terabyte (TB) helium (nearline) drives have been disappointing, Seagate now expects to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the current quarter.We also expect Seagate’s involvement in the Bain Capital-Toshiba deal will improve its presence in the rapidly growing flash storage market.Moreover, collaborations with the likes of Tencent and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) is expected to boost Seagate’s foothold in China.Zacks Rank & Key PickSeagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Netlist Inc (NLST  -  Free Report) with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) is a stock worth considering in the same sector.

757,STX,"Just before the occasion of Saint Patrick's Day, which honors Saint Patrick and the arrival of Christianity in Ireland, the country has one more reason to celebrate. The economy expanded 7.8% in 2017, up from 5.2% in 2016, according to preliminary estimates from the Central Statistics Office (CSO). The figure came in stark contrast to 14.8% decline in 2010.Personal Consumption Expenditure in Ireland grew 1.9%, which alleviates worries regarding subdued inflation. Consumer spending on goods rose 4.6% while industrial output jumped 8.9%. However, growth was mainly driven by the all-important ICT sector which marked a substantial 16.8% growth. Ireland has remarkably lowered its debt-to-GDP ratio from 89.4% in 2013 to just 66% in 2016.Employment grew 3.1% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2017. This is just 12,000 jobs short of the all-time employment high. The employment rate nudged up to 68.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017, up from 67.1% in the year-ago quarter and was at the highest level since the second quarter of 2008.With this, the country became the European Union's fastest-growing economy for four successive years. Notably, the Eurozone growth rate was 2.3% last year. Several economists are bullish on the Irish economy, thanks to solid jobs data, strong consumer spending and a pickup in global growth (read: Will ECB Exit QE After September? ETFs to Gain).However, the CSO issued a warning that the headline rate was “distorted by the activities of multinationals and could not be relied upon as an accurate gauge of activity. Instead, it pointed to a 3.9 per cent increase in “modified” domestic demand, which strips out the impact of aircraft leasing and intellectual property imports, as a more reliable indicator.”Notably, gross national product (GNP), which eliminates cross-border flows by multinationals, grew 6.6%. Against this backdrop, a look at some top-ranked Irish stocks makes sense.Allegion Plc (ALLE  -  Free Report)The Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company operates as a provider of security solutions for homes and businesses.

758,STX,"The Nasdaq Composite Index staged a stunning comeback, recouping all losses incurred early last month when the index had slipped into a correction territory. In fact, it hit a record high for the second consecutive session and has been outperforming major indices, which are yet to fully recover from February’s selloff, by a wide margin from a year-to-date look.   The strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 8.3% this year compared with gains of 1.4% for the Dow Jones and 3.2% for the S&P 500 (read: Can Tech ETFs Regain Investors' Love After Selloff Snub?).What’s Driving Tech?The sharp gains came from the astounding surge in FAANG stocks and other high-performance technology names. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as big data, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.The twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies do not face any financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are boosting economically-sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.If these weren’t enough, waves of consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers are driving tech stocks to new highs (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).As a result, PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report), which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 12% so far this year.

760,STX,"A jobs report tailor-made to boost investor sentiment helped U.S. stocks surge higher last Friday. The biggest beneficiaries of this data were tech stocks, with the Nasdaq hitting closing and intraday records. In the process, the index recouped losses incurred during February’s correction, inching up marginally.Clearly, investors are seeking out tech stocks in an environment where growth-oriented investments are a favored option. Additionally, tech stocks have seen a successful earnings season and are expected to report strong numbers through 2018. With no roadblocks in sight, it makes sense to bet on large-cap tech stocks from the Nasdaq 100 at this point.Tech Stocks Rebound From February Correction During the week ended Feb 9, the Nasdaq Composite index declined 5.1%, suffering its worst losses since early 2016. And it has taken only a month for the tech-heavy index to recover completely. On Mar 9, the index gained 1.8% to close at 7560.81, around 0.33% higher than the previous record achieved on Jan 26.Additionally, the Nasdaq 100, which is made up of the 100 largest companies in the index, hit a record level. The Nasdaq is now up 9.5% year to date while the S&P 500 has gained only 3.4%. The broader market benchmark is yet to fully recover from February’s selloff, thanks to inflationary concerns.But in a market captivated by superior momentum levels, the likes of Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report), Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report) have once again become investor favorites. Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report) and Amazon each gained 1.7% on Mar 9 while Netflix rose 4.6%. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index gained 2.1%.Strong Earnings Expectations, Lack of ImpedimentsAs of Mar 7, we have received Q4 results from 98.2% of the sector’s market cap in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these tech companies are up 23.6% from the same period last year on 10.9% higher revenues. Additionally, for full-year 2018, total earnings for these companies are expected to rise 22.7% on 10.9% higher revenues. (Read: A Very Positive Earnings Picture)Strong earnings prospects are among the key reasons why tech stocks have once again caught investors’ imagination. Given the strong economic backdrop, this class of assets has become a favored option among investors since they are growing at a faster pace than the overall economy.Also, there is a clear absence of factors which could snap the ongoing tech gains, at least in the short term. This is why they are becoming favored choices, much in keeping with one of last year’s top stock strategies, sticking with winning options. Further, investors are choosing to ignore any associated volatility which accompanies such an investment strategy.Our ChoicesTech stocks have rebounded within a month of February’s correction, outpacing their equity counterparts. Investors have chosen to focus on their strong earnings prospects and the lack of impediments to future gains. This class of equities is probably the most favored growth choices even as the economy goes from strength to strength.Given this backdrop, it makes sense to bet on large-cap tech stocks which make up the Nasdaq 100. Notably, this prominent large-cap index also hit a record high on Mar 9. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum and the score is a weighted combination of these three scores. Such a score allows you to eliminate the negative aspects of stocks and select winners. However, it is important to keep in mind that each Style Score will carry a different weight while arriving at a VGM Score.We have narrowed down our search to the following stocks based on a good Zacks Rank and VGM Score.Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) is one of the world’s largest suppliers of equipment for the fabrication of semiconductor, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), and solar photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules.Applied Materials has a VGM Score of B. The company has expected earnings growth of 35.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 8.8% over the last 30 days.

(MU  -  Free Report) has established itself as one of the leading worldwide providers of semiconductor memory solutions.Micron has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A.

Micron has gained 32.8% year to date.Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) is the second-largest manufacturer of hard disk drives (HDDs) in the United States.Seagate has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of A. The company has expected earnings growth of 18.1% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has improved by 0.1% over the last 30 days. Seagate had gained 43.9% year to date.Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report) reported stellar fourth-quarter results and provided an encouraging guidance. The top-line growth came on the back of impressive results from Data Center Group (DCG), Internet-of-Things Group (IOTG), Non-Volatile Memory Solutions (NSG) and Programmable Solutions Group (PSG),Intel has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has risen 0.2% over the last 30 days. Intel has gained 13.1% year to date.Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (CTSH  -  Free Report) is a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services.Cognizant has a Zacks Rank #2 and a VGM Score of B. The company has expected earnings growth of 11.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has moved up 7.1% over the last 30 days.

761,STX,"Shares of Micron Technology (MU  -  Free Report) have soared more than 350% over the past two years, thanks in large part to rapid expansion of the memory-chip maker’s top and bottom lines. This has helped the stock emerge as a favorite among explosive-growth investors looking for tech firms that are outpacing the broader market.But more recently, value investors have flocked to MU and its attractive valuation metrics. Wall Street seemingly cannot keep up with Micron’s lightning-quick growth, leaving the company’s Forward P/E and Earnings Yield figures well within the scope of a value investor. The stock frequently sports an “A” grade for Value in our Style Scores system, and to many, it is now one of the top value opportunities in the entire technology sector.Micron is currently trading with a Forward P/E of 5.1, which compares incredibly favorably to the average of 17.4 held by the S&P 500, as well as the 21.8 average we see in our “Computers and Technology” sector. Breaking it down even further, MU also appears undervalued compared to the Semiconductors industry, which currently holds an average P/E of 13.7.So how could it be possible for Micron to be trading at such a miniscule earnings multiple? At least part of the answer lies in the fact that Micron’s core business, computer and mobile memory, has been commoditized by investors in recent years. For whatever underlying reason, the market’s memory giants are simply not treated like other tech stocks.When looking at Micron’s key valuation metrics, it probably helps to compare the stock to others in the memory business, including Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report), Seagate (STX  -  Free Report), and Toshiba . Each of these companies has expertise in different areas and are not always directly competing, but they all reflect the commoditization of the memory business.Just take a look at how MU’s P/E compares to its peer group:MU is still trading at a discount to the rest of its peers, but we can see that the gap is significantly smaller.Now, it should be clearly stated that the observation of this trend is not a knock on Micron or its business model. Our current consensus estimates are calling for EPS growth of 107.9% and sales growth of 40.7% this fiscal year, and that type of year-over-year improvement speaks for itself.But investors should know that this stock is likely to behave differently than other tech companies with triple-digit earnings growth, just as it does not see the price action one would expect from a stock trading a just 5x earnings.Another thing investors might want to consider here is Micron’s P/S ratio. While the P/E ratio has long been a tried-and-true method for valuing stocks, some investors prefer the P/S ratio because revenues are often considered the more-accurate gauge for evaluating the health of a business.Here’s a look at Micron’s P/S versus its peer group:Now we are starting to see that Micron is not the flawless value stock that it might appear to be. Investors should certainly consider the whole picture for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock right now.Want more market analysis from this author?

762,STX,"The technology sector has lately been spooked by a spate of negative news from some of its key companies. Among the worst hit were FANG stocks as Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) data scandal raised concerns over stringent regulations for the social media space, and a series of allegations from Donald Trump via Twitter on its business practices spurred Amazon’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) sell-off.The attack from industry players like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM  -  Free Report) and semiconductor-equipment supplier Lam Research (LRCX  -  Free Report) added to the latest chaos. Taiwan Semiconductor warned of waning mobile demand for the second quarter and thus reduced its sales growth target for this year to 5% from its prior outlook of 5-7% growth while Lam Research offered a disappointing outlook for chip-gear shipments for the rest of the year.Notably, TSM is Apple's (AAPL  -  Free Report) biggest supplier and the negative news has taken a toll on shares of the technology giant. Apple shed $60 billion in two days following the news. Several global chipmakers also lost market value, including Analog Devices (ADI  -  Free Report), Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report) and Qorvo (QRVO  -  Free Report).While a number of these headwinds have spread negative sentiments in the space, the rapid adoption of cutting-edge technology and solid corporate earnings are expected to fuel growth. In particular, Q1 earnings from 29.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization reported so far are up 36.3% on 13.7% higher revenues, with 100% of the companies beating on earnings and 85.7% exceeding top-line estimates. Overall, earnings and revenues for Q1 are expected to grow 22.6% and 11.9%, respectively.Given the optimism, a number of stocks in the sector have seen their Rank surging to the top-most rung in a couple of days. These are also backed by strong fundamentals compared to many others. Any of these could be a compelling choice to beat the ongoing tech turmoil and make for great picks this earnings season.

(ASGN  -  Free Report)This provides IT and professional services primarily in the technology, creative/digital, engineering, life sciences and government sectors. The stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 34.43%, much higher than the industry average of 24.68%. Sales are also expected to grow at an above-industry average rate of 25.64%. Additionally, the stock seems undervalued with a P/E of 19.97 when compared with industry average of 20.09%. The company came up with quarterly results on Apr 25, wherein it outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings by 10.67% and for revenues by 1%.ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW  -  Free Report)This provides cloud-based services that automate enterprise IT operations. It also delivered a huge earnings beat of 51.35% and revenue beat of 2.83% on Apr 25. The stock has an expected earnings growth rate of 68.40% for this year, much higher than the industry average of 24.68%. Sales are also expected to grow above-industry average at 32.14%.VeriSign Inc. (VRSN  -  Free Report)This is a global leader in domain names and Internet security, enables Internet navigation for many of the world's most-recognized domain names and provides protection for websites and enterprises around the world. The stock saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends for the company. The company is slated to release its result on Apr 26 after market close.VeriSign has a Zacks Rank #1 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.83%, indicating high chances of beating estimates this quarter. Betting on stocks that have a combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) usually leads to profits in an investor’s portfolio.

SGHThis company is a designer, manufacturer and supplier of electronic subsystems to OEMs and is engaged in the computer, industrial, networking, telecommunications, aerospace and defense markets.

763,STX,"Value investing, which had lost appeal during the Trump rally, regained its luster in recent months driven by bouts of market volatility, political uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. In particular, inflationary fears, rise in yields and faster-than-expected rates hike led to the recent spike in value stocks.Below we discuss some strong reasons for investing in value stocks.Higher YieldsThe 10-year Treasury yields topped the 3% level, which could trigger financial shock waves as it did in 2013. In fact, the yield curve started steepening after a long period of flattening and when the yield curve steepens, value companies have better access to capital and should outperform growth ones.Faster Rate Hike ExpectationsA spike in commodity prices, especially oil and metals, has led to inflationary pressures and thus speculation of faster rate hikes. Per the latest CME's FedWatch tracking tool, the market is projecting 50% chances of a total of four interest rate hikes this year against the three penciled in by the Fed. This compares to 33% probability a month ago and less than 40% late last week. This has led to greater uncertainty in the market, thereby favoring value stocks, which exhibit lower volatility compared with growth and blend counterparts. Value stocks are less susceptible to trending markets and tend to outperform in rising interest and inflation rate environments.Tax ReformThe tax cut is expected to provide a huge boost to value stocks. This will lead to an economic surge, boosting job growth in manufacturing and other sectors, increasing inflation and interest rates. Additionally, it would lead to higher earnings, increased buyback activities, and fatty dividends, prompting investors to rotate out of growth and into value stocks.   Strong FundamentalsValue stocks have strong fundamentals — earnings, dividends, book value and cash flow — that trade below their intrinsic value. Value stocks often overreact to both positive and negative news, resulting in share price movement that does not reflect the company’s true long-term fundamentals. This creates buying opportunities in such stocks at depressed prices and shows the potential for capital appreciation when the stock finally reflects its true market price.As a result, investors may want to consider a nice value play in the current scenario. While there are number of options available in the value space, focus on cheap stocks could be a less risky way to tap the same broad trends. Below we have selected five stocks having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), a Value Score of A, positive year-over-year estimate revision for this year’s earnings growth and a Zacks Industry Rank within the top 10%, with the help of the Zacks Stock Screener.Micron Technology Inc.

764,STX,"The dual prospects of four Fed rate hikes this year and higher inflationary expectations thanks to a commodity market rebound (mainly crude oil) have sent shockwaves across the treasury market. The 10-year benchmark U.S. Treasury yield spiked to 3% on Apr 24 for the first time since January 2014.The Fed enacted a 25-bp hike in March, and two more are likely in June and September. But the fed funds futures market lately signaled a 50% chance of one more move in December. Plus, the likelihood of new government debt issuances has played its role in pushing the yields higher.In such a scenario, many will be cautious about their fixed income holdings with this prospect. But beyond that, stocks are also likely to face challenges on a gradual cease of cheap money inflows. After all, global stocks have attained heights amid ultra-easy monetary policy.Time to Buy High Dividend Stocks?Investors, who want to start preparing for an uptick in interest rates, may tap high dividend-paying stocks. After all, a high dividend provides investors avenues to make up for capital losses, if that happens at all.Also, dividend investing calls for value investing. If a broad-based selloff hits the market in a rising yield environment, value stocks may come to investors’ protection. The looming trade tension (which has eased a lot in recent times though) is another reason for which investors may be in search of dividend-paying stocks that offer benchmark-beating yields.Below we highlight five stocks that yield more than 3% annually.Tecnoglass Inc. (TGLS  -  Free Report) – Yields 7.05%The company is in manufacturing and selling architectural glass and windows and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

765,STX,"Time Warner Inc.  is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 26.The media and entertainment company’s planned takeover by AT&T in a deal worth $85.4 billion hit roadblock after Department of Justice (DOJ) raised antitrust concerns over the proposed merger.Notably, Time Warner has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters by an average of 13.3%. In the preceding quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.1%.Investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Time Warner outpaces earnings estimate even this time. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings and revenues are currently pegged at $1.76 and $7.95 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 6% and 2.8%, respectively.Let’s delve deeper and find out the factors likely to impact results this quarter. Time Warner Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Time Warner Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Time Warner Inc. Quote Factors to ConsiderTime Warner has been restructuring aggressively. The company is now focusing on original programming, containing costs and increasing investments in key areas to enhance profitability. Additionally, the company has been expanding digital presence to enable consumers to access content from several platforms and devices.The company’s investments in video content and technology are expected to boost top-line growth. The company has witnessed robust subscription revenue growth at Home Box Office (HBO) and Turner.In the last quarter, HBO’s subscription revenues increased 16% driven by a rise in domestic rates and subscribers, and international growth. Moreover, Turner’s subscription revenues increased 14% due to rise in domestic rates and growth at Turner’s international networks.However, projections for HBO and Turner are not positive for the first quarter.Management expects HBO’s subscription revenues in the first quarter to improve at a rate similar to the expectation for the full year (more than 6% year over year). The sequential decline can primarily be attributed to timing for recognizing certain revenues under new revenue recognition accounting guidance adopted in 2018.Moreover, Time Warner expects HBO operating income to decline in the to-be-reported quarter.For Turner, management expects advertising revenues to increase in the high-single to low-double digits rate in first-quarter 2018. This is expected to be driven by positive impact from airing the Final Four college basketball games of the NCAA Tournament.However, operating income is anticipated to decline in the first quarter due to rise in expenses on account of the airing of the NCAA Tournament Final Four games and the timing of original series.Further, Warner Bros. operating income is expected to decline by a double-digit percentage in the going-to-be-reported quarter.What Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) along with a positive Earnings ESP has a good chance of beating estimates. The Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) are best avoided.Time Warner has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an Earnings ESP of -2.84%, which indicates an unlikely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Stocks to ConsiderHere are few stocks you may consider as our proven model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.30% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Paycom Software (PAYC  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.33% and a Zacks Rank #1.Seagate (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +6.69% and a Zacks Rank #2. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.

766,STX,"CDW Corporation (CDW  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2, before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not the company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the quarter.Notably, the company has a mixed earnings surprise history. In the trailing four quarters, the company’s results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice and came in line in the other occasions. It has an average positive earnings surprise of 0.5%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that CDW is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) are best avoided, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CDW carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, which makes surprise prediction difficult. Furthermore, we noted that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings have remained unchanged over the past 30 days.However, the company is likely to continue reporting top- and bottom-line growth on a year-over-year basis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter earnings is pegged at 92 cents, which indicates year-over-year growth of 22.7%. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $3.46 billion, up 4.1% from the year-ago quarter.CDW Corporation Price and EPS Surprise CDW Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CDW Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderFor the past few quarters, the company has been expanding its solutions suite and enhancing services capabilities, which is likely to have positively impacted the quarterly results. Moreover, the company’s investment strategies to deliver integrated solutions both in and outside of the U.K., along with the international sales team and its international-branded website, will likely have driven its performance.Furthermore, CDW specializes in offering information technology products and services to business, government, education and healthcare customers, primarily in the United States and Canada. Growth in customer channels and continued strategic achievements are a couple of positive factors which are likely to have been conducive to the company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, CDW’s robust product portfolio and product refreshes remain positives.Also, the company’s exposure in the high-end corporate desktop and digital education implementation space is encouraging. Moreover, its focus on small & medium businesses and customer additions help expand market share.Nonetheless, the company’s high debt burden might have weighed on the bottom-line results. As of Dec 31, 2017, the company had total debt of approximately $3.20 billion (excluding current maturities). Such high-debt levels increase leverage risks and interest costs which might dent the company’s profitability.Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +3.43% and a Zacks Rank #1.

767,STX,"VeriFone Systems, Inc. (PAY  -  Free Report) is set to report results for fiscal third-quarter 2017 results on Sep 7.Last quarter, the company’s earnings of 30 cents per share came in line with estimates. In the trailing four quarters, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate twice while matching the same on the other two occasions, delivering an average positive surprise of 2.11%.Non GAAP revenues declined 11% year over year to $473.9 million and was slightly better than the consensus mark. However, the figure was in line with the high end of the guided range of $470–$474 million driven by double-digit sequential growth in North America retail and SMB business verticals along with strong demand for devices in India.Given the mediocre second-quarter results and divestiture of its three non-core businesses, the company lowered its fiscal 2017 guidance.Notably, VeriFone shares have gained 10.4%, significantly underperforming the 25.5% rally of the industry it belongs to.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderVeriFone has a strong foothold in the electronic payment systems and services market and is likely to benefit from the ever-expanding demand for Point-of-Sale (POS) software and Payment-as-a Service technologies. The restructuring program initiated by VeriFone positions it well for the booming payments market.Moreover, VeriFone’s focus on strengthening its product portfolio that now includes the likes of Carbon 8 and Engage, and expansion of business primarily through accretive acquisitions will likely be a key growth driver going ahead.Further, the PCI certification received by VeriFone’s new Engage platform has attracted clients based in Germany, France, India, Japan and South Africa. Additionally, the company’s new mid-range mPOS solution based on the Carbon platform is anticipated to improve competitive position in SMB and emerging markets business.Management also expects divestitures to have a positive impact on margins going forward.However, increasing competition and continued macroeconomic volatility remain headwinds.Verifone Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Verifone Systems, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Verifone Systems, Inc. QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that VeriFone will beat earnings estimates this quarter.

769,STX,"Future estimates for stock market returns are at the lowest since the financial crisis due to overvaluation, increased inflationary pressure leading to rate hikes and telltale signs of a collapse in global growth. This perhaps explains why the latest round of encouraging earnings news failed to excite investors.Broader markets, in fact, see meager returns in the May-October period, thanks to lower trading volumes in summer, while the November-April period witnesses a substantial increase in investments. To top it, Mays during midterms tends to be worse, as is the case this year.In the wake of this, investing in companies that pay consistent dividends can make for wonderful investments. Such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Dampening Outlook for ReturnsThe outlook for returns from U.S. stocks, which have been on an extensive bull run, is pretty unwelcoming. Expectations for returns are now at an 11-year low, according to Morgan Stanley (MS  -  Free Report). The financial holding company cited changing monetary policy and slowdown in global growth as the primary factors hurting returns.The Fed’s low rates and bond buying program helped markets move north over the past decade. But, the central bank is gradually altering its monetary policy by hiking rates and streamlining the balance sheet. A hawkish Fed coupled with an uptick in prices of essential commodities is a potential deterrent for stocks. Increased oil prices and business houses saying that the cost of steel and several other raw materials are increasing in the United States have induced inflationary fears. Investors also continue to fret about the likelihood of an inverted yield curve that has been viewed as an indicator of a pending economic recession.Many market participants are spotting cracks in synchronized global growth raising fears of a stagflation. This is a situation that mostly occurs at times of high inflation and unemployment along with weak economic demand. Maybe, the concern of a slowdown in global economic growth has cast a shadow on the quarterly results of U.S. corporations. Major bourses have been trading in a tight range for the last three months, with the Dow and the S&P 500 currently in their longest stretch in correction territory in a decade.Stocks Trade at Tight Range Since FebruaryThe stock market trading in a tight range, in fact, shows that enthusiasm over equities has been dissipating. Only 32.7% of investors expect stock prices to be at a higher range in 12 months from now, per data by the Conference Board.Stock valuations are already at multi-year highs raising questions as to whether the equity market has more room to scale higher. To top it, trading volumes have been unusually low, which indicates that investors are reluctant to participate.Fear the Month of MayAnd how can we forget the adage “Sell in May and go away.” Historically, stocks have underperformed in the six-month period commencing May and ending in October, compared to the November to April period. Mostly lower trading volumes in the summer season and substantial increase in investment during the winter months are cited to be the reasons for this discrepancy.In fact, May is traditionally bad in midterm election years, according to the Stock Trader’s Almanac. Since 1950, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq lost 0.7%, 0.9% and 1.2% on average during midterm years, respectively.Buy 5 Top Dividend Stocks NowWith so many concerns plaguing investors’ minds, dividend paying stocks are tempting options at the moment.

Devices in the SAM L10 and SAM L11 series are available starting at $1.09 and $1.22 each, respectively in 10,000-unit quantities. Meanwhile, both DM320204 and DM320205 Xplained Pro Evaluation Kits for SAM L10 and SAM L11 are available for $58.00 each.Details on New DSC FamilyWith a view to streamline the design and development of applications which require complex algorithms, Microchip introduced dsPIC33CH family of DSCs. The two dsPIC DSC cores are categorized as master and slave. The master core supports the user interface, supervises system and other communications functions, tailored for the end application. The slave core maintains time sensitive control code.The dsPIC33CH family delivers high power density, enhanced efficiency, improved Digital Signal Processor (“DSP”) performance and accelerated execution.

772,STX,"Match Group Inc. (MTCH  -  Free Report) announced that it has acquired a 51% stake in Hinge, the NY-based “relationship” app, in the past week. The company retains the right to buy the remaining shares within the upcoming 12 months. The financial terms of the deal have been kept under wraps.Hinge had witnessed a whopping surge of 400% in user base in 2017 after Match aided the site to revamp dating, doing away with the “right swipe” option for meaningful real relationships. Buoyed by user growth, the Tinder provider has been increasing its stake in Hinge since then.""Hinge's passion for the user experience and their innovative approach to dating has created a product that is highly relevant particularly among urban, educated millennial women looking for relationships,"" said Mandy Ginsberg, CEO of Match Group.The company remains elated and is looking forward to become a notable contender in the relationship arena. Notably, the shares of Match Group have soared 139.4% in a year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 9%.Expanding Footprint into Relationship SpaceGiven the essential difference between “casual dating and hook-ups” and “meaningful relationship”, we believe this move will enable the company to explore a new relationship space. The addition to the portfolio bodes well, since it provides the users with increased options. The millennial individuals looking for a purposeful relationship can find solace in the company’s new offering.Notably, Hinge has already created a solid customer base within seven years of its operations. Per App Annie estimates as revealed by a source, “Hinge is the fifth-highest grossing dating iPhone app”. These attributes make Hinge a lucrative acquisition target.To ConcludeThe new acquisition bodes well. Reportedly, the company believes focus on high end millennial individuals undermines the potential competition threat from Facebook’s (FB  -  Free Report) dating developments.Match Group is considered to have pioneered the concept of online dating, which is why it enjoys a first mover’s advantage in this market. Match Group has been benefiting from increasing subscriber addition in the form of membership subscriptions. Its average paid subscribers surged 26% to 7.4 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by strength in both North America (up 17% year over year) and international (up 37% year over year).During the first quarter, Tinder average subscribers increased 87% year over year and came in at 3.5 million.

774,STX,"Tech biggies are expected to repatriate a large chunk of oversees cash now that President Trump signed the GOP tax plan into law. The question that looms large now is what will the tech players do with the cash?According to market research firm GBH Insights, roughly 90% of the cash that was taken home was utilized for dividend payments and share repurchases in the tax holiday that last occurred in 2004. But now, GBH Insights expects the firms to allocate 70% of the repatriated cash for capital returns. The market research unit specifically expects Apple Inc. (AAPL  -  Free Report) shareholders to witness another dividend hike in 2018.Higher stock buybacks are expected to further drive the share price of tech players. Moreover, a significant portion of the cash will likely be allocated for research and development and for mergers and acquisitions. This is expected to brighten the prospects for tech stocks in 2018 and beyond.  2017: A Banner Year for Tech Tech companies had a stellar run for almost the entire of 2017. During the year, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index rallied more than 28%, outperforming the S&P 500’s 19.8% gain. The market also saw an outperformance by the FAANG stocks.The FAANG word is an acronym where ""F"" stands for Facebook, Inc. (FB  -  Free Report), ""A"" for Apple, the third letter ""A"" for Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), ""N"" for Netflix, Inc. (NFLX  -  Free Report) and finally ""G"" for Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL  -  Free Report), commonly referred to as Google. Each of these stocks rose 53.4%, 46.1%, 55.9%, 55% and 32.9%, respectively, last year.Improving Free Cash FlowThe technology sector — as represented by the Zacks Computer & Technology Sector — gained significant financial strength. As of Sep 30, 2017, the sector had $20.9 billion in cash which could alone take care of major proportion of its long-term debt, recorded at $23.8 billion. Also, free cash flow jumped 33% in the third quarter, against 2.8% during the second quarter and a 22.6% quarterly decline in the first.Positive Q4 Earnings Expectations Technology is among the few sectors that are set to record strongest gains for fiscal fourth-quarter 2017. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the technology sector will likely see year-over-year earnings growth of 14% on 8.5% higher revenues.2018 Looks Rewarding for Tech InvestorsFAANG stocks started 2018 on a bullish note. Year to date, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet have gained a respective 6.5%, 2.8%, 7.1%, 8.9% and 5.7%, maintaining last year’s momentum.Netflix is looking to capture the international market and is planning to make a massive investment in original production. CNBC added that strong foothold in the international market could reward Netflix with significant cash flow.Meanwhile, Facebook has been increasing safety and security for users on the platform ever since the Russian ad fiasco came into light. Facebook is spending on original content and the growing user base will likely offset the company’s rising costs pertaining to security and safety. While the leading tech players are coming up with strategies to gain strong foothold, Trump’s tax reform will likely be a prime factor in boosting tech stocks. The lowered corporate tax rate will be implemented this year instead of 2019.Big tech companies are likely on track to bring substantial oversees cash back to the United States as the Trump administration is imposing a mandatory repatriation tax of 15.5% on cash and liquid assets against the prior mark of 35%, per GBH Insights.GBH Insights estimated that big technology firms have parked as much as $550 billion to $600 billion overseas. Per the market research firm, 2018 will witness the repatriation of $300 billion to $400 billion — comprising Apple’s $200 billion —by technology players.Around 70% of the cash repatriated will likely be utilized for capital returns, which may include dividend payments and share repurchases, according to GBH Insights. The remaining 30% will likely be allocated for activities like research & development and mergers & acquisitions.Time to Focus on Tech StocksWe have employed the free cash flow yield ratio to show that the sector is extremely lucrative from a investment perspective. Companies or sectors with strong operations generally have high free cash flow yield, indicating that the amount of money investors are generating is more than the amount spent to buy the stock. Our proprietary model shows that free cash flow yield for the Zacks Computer & Technology Sector stands at 5.1%, way higher than 3.7% for the S&P 500.Picking technology stocks seems to be a smart option at this moment.

The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues is currently pegged at $2.74 billion. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated to be 30%.

Previously, the company expectednon-GAAP operating expenses to decrease 2-3% with further cost stringent approaches.According to Dave Mosley, Chief Executive Officer of Seagate, “Our revenue growth and strong portfolio profitability in the December quarter reflect solid demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions, particularly for our cloud-based environments.”Another factor that bolstered share price was Seagate’s agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, consequently helping in its innovation of hard disk drives (“HDD”), solid state drives (“SSD”) and hybrid solutions.Last WordsNotably, with the huge transformations in the storage industry mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has provided a boost to the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is beneficial for Seagate.The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology, which is expected be shipped in 2019, is yet another positive.Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderSeagate currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Applied Materials, Inc.

777,STX,"Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) was a big mover last session, as the company saw its shares rise more than 7% on the day.

778,STX,"Investors in Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 19, 2018 $13.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Seagate shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Seagate is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer- Storage Devices industry that ranks in the Top 45% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, three analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while two have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.12 per share to $1.15 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Seagate right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

779,STX,"Silicon Motion Technology Corporation (SIMO  -  Free Report) delivered first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings of 71 cents per American Depositary Share (""ADS""), which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents and came a penny ahead of the year-ago quarter figure. However, earnings declined 10.1% sequentially.Net sales increased 2% year over year but decreased 4% from the previous quarter to $130.3 million. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131 million as well. However, the figure was marginally higher than the mid-point of management’s guided range of $127-$132 million (mid-point $129.5 million).We believe improving supply of 64-layer 3D NAND is bringing down high NAND prices, which is eventually benefiting Silicon Motion.Additionally, as the company’s Open-Channel NVMe SSD controller enters into production, Client SSD Controller sales are anticipated to increase.Revenue DetailsSales from mobile storage products (which include Embedded Storage as well as Expandable Storage products) increased 4% year over year but decreased 3% sequentially to $121.4 million. Revenues from mobile storage products contributed 93% to overall product revenues.Sales of Shannon hyper-scale SSDs and Ferri industrial SSDs were down sequentially, owing to seasonality. Reduction in SSD prices due to rebounding orders from the company’s NAND flash partners and increase in NAND supply led to higher revenues.Sales for Client SSD controllers grew 10% quarter over quarter.Revenues from eMMC controllers increased 15% sequentially. The increase can be attributed to the rebuilt inventory from its NAND flash partners.Embedded Storage1 sales (approximately 85% of total revenues) declined 1% sequentially. Revenues from SSD solutions declined 25% sequentially.Mobile communications product (which include mobile TV SoCs) sales were $7.9 million, down 16% sequentially, and represented 6% of total revenues.Other products formed 1% of the revenues and generated $1.1 million.Operational DetailsNon-GAAP gross margin declined 300 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis. However, non-GAAP gross margin increased 140 bps sequentially to 48.0%. The sequential increase can be attributed to growth in gross margin from the company’s controllers and SSD solutions.Silicon Motion Technology Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Silicon Motion Technology Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Silicon Motion Technology Corporation QuoteNon-GAAP operating margin decreased 430 bps on year-over-year basis and 200 bps sequentially to 22.1%.

Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to lie in the range of 22.5-24.5%.The company re-iterated 2018 outlook. Non-GAAP revenues are anticipated within $550-$576 million, translating to year-over-year growth of 5-10%.

780,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) renewed an existing strategic cooperation agreement with Chinese search-giant Baidu Inc. (BIDU  -  Free Report). Seagate’s shares have increased 0.57% in pre-market trading following the news on Sep 18.According to the latest pact, Baidu will give preference to Seagate’s storage products and solutions over other providers. In return, the company will get advanced access to Seagate’s products, services and support. Moreover, the companies will collaborate to design customized systems for the Chinese company.We note that the renewed deal is particularly beneficial for Seagate as it will improve its competitive position in China. The company blamed sluggish China CSP demand along with lackluster demand for OEM nearline and mission critical solutions as well as weakness in Cloud storage Systems business behind its fourth-quarter debacle.Notably, revenues declined 9.3% to $2.41 billion and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 billion in the quarter. Moreover, non-GAAP earnings declined 5.8% to 65 cents, which also lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a massive 34 cents.Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Seagate Technology PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteSeagate has lost 12.1% of its value year to date versus the 14.2% growth of its industry. Partnership to Boost Big Data FootprintThe deal will help both Seagate and Baidu address the challenges of ongoing data explosion.Market research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. More importantly, almost 20% of this will be critical to daily lives and nearly 10% of that will be hypercritical.This massive volume of data presents significant growth opportunity for enterprises. However, effective storage is absolutely necessary to properly harness this data. This presents significant growth opportunity for Seagate in the long term.We also note that Baidu has been a long-time user of Seagate’s enterprise drives in its data center and public cloud platform. The company is considered a pioneer of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques along with Tencent and Alibaba (BABA  -  Free Report) in China. Moreover, the search giant has also set up Big Data lab in Beijing, which focuses on large-scale machine learning algorithms.We believe the renewal of the deal will boost Seagate’s brand image and recognition in China, which will help it to penetrate this rapidly-growing market going forward.Expanding Portfolio Key CatalystSeagate has been losing hard-disk drive (HDD) market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report). Despite a number of acquisitions, the company also doesn’t have significant presence in the flash memory market.Nevertheless, we expect Seagate’s expanding portfolio to be a game changer going forward. At the 2017 Flash Memory Summit (FMS), the company announced enhanced versions of two flash technologies to boost performance and capacity for mixed data center workloads.These solid-state drives (SSD) effectively address the growing needs of demanding enterprise applications like data mining, weather modeling and online transaction processing, where fast data access and processing power are of utmost priority.Although ramping of its 10 terabyte (TB) helium (nearline) drives have been disappointing, Seagate now expects to ship approximately 1 million 10 TB units in the current quarter. Moreover, management noted that the 12 TB product (shipped in June) has received excellent customer feedback.Seagate now expects to achieve approximately 50% of the exabyte share within the 10TB and 12TB market by the end of 2017.Currently, Seagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

781,STX,"U.S. markets experienced another worrying decline on Monday with the Dow suffering its worst ever point-wise fall on record. The loss was so severe that it threatened to derail a global stock rally, which has thrived over an extended period. Benchmark indexes across Europe, Asia and the United States lost out on their gains for the year. These losses came on the heels of last Friday’s reverses, prompting several investors to think that the party may be over for the markets.However, strong economic fundamentals and another robust earnings season indicate that this is may just be a passing phase. Though investors could be in for a rocky ride over the next few weeks, markets will soon return to their winning ways, which is why it makes sense to pick up great value stocks on the dip.VIX Spikes, Blue-Chips Suffer Record LossesFear returned to the bourses with near panic-like selling witnessed at one point. The market’s fear gauge, the VIX, shot up 117% to 37, a level way above its long-term average of 19.5. Since the beginning of 2018, the VIX has gained nearly 238%. In fact, Monday’s increase was the largest one-day rise on record.This was particularly evident the moment when the Dow plunged nearly 1,600 points. Subsequently, the blue-chip index recovered to close 4.6% or 1,175.21 points lower at 24345.75. This was not only the largest-ever, point-wise decline, but was also the scariest loss in percentage terms for a single trading day since August 2011.Taken together with the reverses suffered on Friday, the Dow has declined 7% over two trading days. This brings to an end the periods of calm, range-bound increases which markets experienced over the past two years. Investor sentiment also underwent a radical change, with traders instinctively rushing to seek safety in U.S. Treasuries.Spike in Bond Yields Causes Global SlideMarket reverses were not limited to the United States with the Nikkei, Kospi and Hang Seng down 6.7%, 2.6% and 4.9%, respectively. The STOXX 600 also closed 1.5% lower with all sectors finishing in the red. And the explanation for these continent-spanning losses is not hard at all. These reverses originate from worldwide speculation that inflation levels in developed economies are about to hit their targeted levels of 2-3%.This would be a desirable outcome for central banks that have been worried about sluggish inflation levels for some time now. Official data from the United States converted all the speculation into a real selloff last Friday, one that seems to have spilled over to Monday. The immediate trigger was a spike in the U.S. yearly average wage to 2.9%, which led to concerns that retail prices would increase soon.This in turn could lead to a faster increase in key rates across the board and especially in the United States. Investors have panicked at the prospect of an end to an era of soft interest rates, the sort of monetary stimulus that encourages spending over saving. Further, several members of the Federal Reserve stated during January that the three rate hikes scheduled for 2018 could be increased to four or five!Markets Losses Likely a Brief SlideThe immediate trigger for U.S. market losses on Monday is being traced to algorithm-based trading. The speed at which selling spread, only to slow down in the last half hour of trading, bears evidence that computer models were responsible for the selloff. Analysts believe that this came about from an urgent need for these models to balance risk.Other market watchers think that a category-spanning selloff of ETFs led to Monday’s reverses. According to analysts at Deutsche Bank (DB  -  Free Report), trading in ETFs listed in the United States increased exponentially during the afternoon session.However, a substantial section of market watchers, traders and analysts believe that this is only a brief pause for a rally, which is unprecedented in scale and pace. They believe that recent losses will only serve to extend the duration of this market rally.Further, there is still little evidence of a substantial uptick in inflation, which could lead to faster rate increases. Until then, markets are likely to enjoy substantial gains, riding on a strong economy, a booming job market and bullish earnings releases.    Our ChoicesDespite substantial losses experienced over the last two days, strong fundamentals that powered the prolonged markets’ rally remain firmly in place. This is likely only a brief pause, one which could end up extending the duration of an unprecedented stretch of gains.In anticipation, it makes good sense to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes.

It also added Nexperia, a semiconductor manufacturer to its client base. The company will use Revenue Cloud for the management of direct and channel revenues.Model N’s growth prospects in the life sciences & high technology is bright owing to increasing ineffectiveness of legacy systems. The company’s solutions provide higher Return on Investment (“ROI”) as well as plug gaps in the end-to-end revenue management process that legacy systems fail to do. This improves top-line growth of the companies, consequently bolstering adoption of Model N’s solutions.Additionally, Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report), a prominent data storage provider, rolled out the Phase 1 Revenue Cloud for high tech. This bodes well for Model N.However, increasing competition from well-established players like salesforce.com and Workday remains a headwind.What Zacks Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

783,STX,"It was another interesting month throughout the global stock markets, with strong earnings results and relaxed trade tensions between the U.S. and China doing little to break range-bound indexes higher amid other potential macroeconomic growth headwinds. Still, many names in the technology space flexed their muscles and attempted to remind investors of the sector’s dominance.Considering the current state of the world, tech’s leadership makes sense.

At the event, management announced a new partnership with Intel (INTC), raised its quarterly revenue guidance, and announced a $10 billion share repurchase program. MU is now sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and trades at just 5.4x forward 12-month earnings. 3.

785,STX,"At times, it is prudent to retain certain stocks that have enough potential but are weighed down by tough market conditions. Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) seems to be one such stock, which investors need to retain if they are looking to reap long-term gains. Though the stock faces several headwinds at the moment, these are transitory in nature. There is enough scope for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to rebound in the long run.Seagate’s stock has surged 31.5% in the past three months, substantially outperforming the 12.9% rally of the industry.What’s Going in Seagate’ Favor?Seagate reported impressive fiscal first-quarter 2018 results. Non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 96 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share. Revenues of $2.63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion. Moreover, both the top and bottom-line figures witnessed a sequential improvement, primarily driven by strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.The company also participated in a Bain Capital led consortium. The consortium has entered into an agreement with Toshiba for the acquisition of Toshiba Memory Corporation. Seagate has committed $1.25 billion for the takeover, which is scheduled for March 2018.This participation will enable Seagate to enter into an agreement with Toshiba, per which the latter will provide Seagate with NAND supply, consequently helping in its innovation of hard disk drives (“HDD”), solid state drives (“SSD”) and hybrid solutions.Recently, the company also announced that IronWolf, IronWolf Pro and Barracuda Pro — which are part of the Guardian Series of hard disk drives — are now available in capacity of up to 12 terabyte (TB). Seagate believes that the expanded capacity will improve demand for the HDDs among large enterprises, small and medium size businesses (SMBs) as well as creative professionals.Market research firm IDC forecasts that by 2025, the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes (trillion gigabytes), which is ten times the 16.1 zettabytes (ZB) of data generated in 2016. More importantly, almost 20% of this will be critical to daily lives and nearly 10% of that will be hypercritical.This massive volume of data presents significant growth opportunity for enterprises. However, effective storage is absolutely necessary to properly harness this data. This presents significant growth opportunity for Seagate in the long term.Notably, with the huge transformations in the storage industry, mobile cloud is taking the center stage. This in turn has boosted the deployment of high-capacity mass storage products, which is beneficial for Seagate.The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (“HAMR”) technology, which is expected be shipped in 2019, is yet another positive.Moreover, collaborations with the likes of Tencent and Baidu (BIDU  -  Free Report) are anticipated to boost Seagate’s foothold in China.Moreover, the stock looks attractive from a valuation perspective. This is because Seagate currently trades at a forward P/E of 10.14x compared with the industry group average of 15.70x, which signifies a huge upward potential.The stock’s long-term earnings per share growth rate is 18.9% and it carries a VGM Style Score of A.Concerns RemainWeak PC shipment in the third quarter as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released data is a major concern for Seagate. Both agreed that shortage of key components, including DRAM, SSD and LCD panels, is escalating PC prices, thereby thwarting overall demand.Seagate is a hard disk drive manufacturer and is primarily dependent on PC sales. We note that a decline in PC shipment reflects weak demand, which doesn't bode well for the company.Going forward, Seagate has been losing HDD market share amid significant competition from Western Digital Corp. Despite a number of acquisitions, the company also doesn’t have significant presence in the flash memory market.Stock to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), both sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.NVIDIA and Intel have a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 10.3% and 8.4%, respectively.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars? Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

786,STX,"On Apr 28, the Bureau of Economic Analysis released the first advanced estimate of the first-quarter 2018 U.S. GDP growth rate. While the U.S. economy fared better than the first-quarter consensus, the growth rate was significantly lower than the last nine months of 2017. Lackluster consumer spending, which constitutes nearly 70% of the U.S, GDP, was the primary reason for slowdown in first-quarter 2018 GDP.Considering recent history, U.S. GDP growth rate remains weakest in the first quarter of any year. Despite weak GDP growth, personal disposable income and private domestic investment have increased significantly in the first quarter. Moreover, full effect of massive reduction on both personal and corporate tax rate are yet to be derived as people received those benefits only in January.The above mentioned positives are likely to push the U.S. economy on a strong growth trajectory in the second quarter and there on. At this stage, investing in good value stocks with favorable Zacks Ranks is a lucrative option.First-Quarter GDP DeclinesPer the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the U.S. GDP expanded at 2.3% in first-quarter 2018, better-than the consensus estimate of 2%. However, this rate of growth is significantly lower than the average GDP growth rate of 2.9% in the last three quarters of 2017 and well below President Trump’s targeted GDP growth rate of 3%.Personal consumer spending grew at 1.1% in first-quarter 2018. This was the slowest pace of growth experienced in nearly five years and significantly below the fourth-quarter 2017 pace of 4%.Moreover, business spending on equipment slowed to 4.7% following double-digit growth in the second half of 2017. Further, investments in homebuilding have declined in the first quarter after rebounding in the fourth quarter of 2017. Government spending has also dipped after witnessing growth in the last two straight quarters.Economy Likely to Bounce Back in Q2The first quarter GDP estimate generally remains weak due to seasonality. First-quarter U.S. GDP tends to be soft because of a seasonal quirk. Consequently, the BEA’s tepid first-quarter growth outlook may not be a true reflection of the U.S. economy.The full benefit of massive personal and corporate tax cut is yet to be realized. The $1.5 trillion tax cut measures is yet to be reflected as it has implemented only in January 2018.Moreover, U.S. private-sector workers experienced their highest increase in income in 11 years during the first three months of 2018. The latest Labor Department data revealed that employment cost index for wages and salaries in the private sector rose 1% in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter. Notably, this was the biggest gain since the first quarter of 2007.Meanwhile, disposable personal income has increased 6.2% in the first quarter compared with 3.8% in the previous quarter. More wealth, in the hands of consumers will likely bolster personal spending going forward.Our Top Picks The fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong despite a slowdown in the GDP growth rate. A healthy labor market, strong hike in wages and salaries, increase in personal disposable income and proposed fiscal stimulus by the government will bolster consumer’s income and spending in the rest of the year.At this juncture, it will be a prudent decision to buy value stocks on the dip that could prove to be valuable finds once the rally resumes. Our selection is also backed by a good Zacks Value Score and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Our research shows that stocks with a Value Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy) offer the best opportunities in the value-investing space.

788,STX,"Western Digital Corporation (WDC  -  Free Report) has been on an acquisition spree lately. Post the company’s buyout of Upthere, an app-based cloud-storage startup, yesterday, this hard disk drive (HDD) producer is set for another strategic acquisition.Western Digital signed an agreement to acquire Tegile Systems (“Tegile”) for an undisclosed amount. The company will integrate Tegile into its Data Center Systems (DCS) business unit. The acquisition deal is anticipated to close in the week of Sep 4, 2017, subject to customary closing conditions.California-based Tegile offers flash-driven storage arrays for database, virtualized server and virtual desktop environments. Tegile IntelliFlash storage arrays provide comprehensive data protection, with support for network attached storage (NAS) and storage area network (SAN) connectivity.Synergies from the DealThe acquisition is believed to be in sync with the company’s strategy to push itself further in to the enterprise cloud-based storage space. Apart from, expanding the flash- based product portfolio, the acquisition will fetch over 1,700 new customers to Western Digital.The company’s efforts toward expanding footprint in the flash storage are commendable as its development of the 96-layer 3-D NAND flash technology debuted in June. Consequently, this deal will strengthen its foothold in this space and should prove valuable.Notably, this deal comes at the time when the storage reportedly on the verge of acquiring Toshiba’s flash memory chip business. The common link in the aforementioned acquisitions is that all these companies provide cloud based flash-driven storage solutions which are growing rapidly.The demand for flash-storage has increased immensely in recent times due to exploding volumes of data. The need for storing this data as well as fast access is significant for Big Data and business analytics applications. According to market research firm IDC, revenues from these applications are expected to grow from $122 million in 2015 to over $187 million in 2019 (up more than 50%).Hence, the rising demand for flash storage bodes well for Western Digital, which is taking the inorganic route to bolster flash storage offerings.Moreover, per Research and Markets projections, worldwide data center storage market will expand at a four-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.01% during 2016-2020. Thus, the acquisition is a prudent move as it will help Western Digital strengthen its storage portfolio and increase market share.Acquisitions: Key Catalyst for Western DigitalOver the years, Western Digital has focused on acquisitions to expand total addressable market (TAM) and solidify footprint in growth markets. The acquisition of SanDisk has opened new avenues of growth for the company, particularly in the NAND and SSD markets.The acquisitions of Amplidata, sTec, Velobit, Inc., Arkeia Software Solutions and Virident Systems have not only reinforced Western Digital’s small-to-medium sized business solutions but also expanded its SSD product portfolio.Bottom lineWestern Digital stock has gained 32.6% year to date, substantially outperforming the 12.2% rally of the industry it belongs to.We believe that the acquisition strengthens Western Digital’s position in the storage market, especially compared to peers Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).We believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and increasing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a significant positive, in our view.We remain encouraged by the company’s launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Further, Western Digital’s entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report). Both the companies sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

789,STX,"Share price of Seagate Technology PLC (STX  -  Free Report) dropped to a new 52-week low of $30.60 yesterday, eventually closing a tad bit higher at $31.01.The underperformance can be attributed to the company’s disappointing fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Non-GAAP earnings plunged 41% on a sequential basis, primarily due to a 10% decline in revenues. Revenues amounted to $2.41 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.55 billion.We note that this pulled down current year earnings estimates over the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 declined 18.04% to $3.86 over the last 30 days. For fiscal 2019, the consensus estimate declined 11.9% to $4.07.Seagate has lost 16.4% of its value year to date against 11.6% growth of its industry.What’s Dragging it Down?The decline in the top line was primarily due to sluggish revenues from enterprise storage customers. This includes traditional OEM nearline and mission critical demand, China CSP nearline demand, and the company’s own Cloud Storage Systems business.Moreover, certain intra quarter channel inventory management issues affected the surveillance and NAS markets. Revenues fell 5% short from expectations and management attributed this to the above mentioned factors.Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteAdditionally, due to operational issues in the Cloud Systems and Silicon Group (CSSG) division and unfavorable enterprise and surveillance HDD portfolio mix, margins were under pressure. Management also noted that the company is not heading toward achieving the previous guidance of non-GAAP earnings per share of $4.50 for 2017.We believe, all these coupled with intensifying competition in the market post the merger of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and SanDisk are headwinds for the company. Further, declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data is a major concern for Seagate.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderSeagate has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Applied Materials, Inc. (AMAT  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report) are two top-ranked stocks worth considering in the broader sector. Both of them sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

790,STX,"Investors in Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Feb 2, 2018 $39.00 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Seagate shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Seagate is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in the Computer- Storage Devices industry that ranks in the Top 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, six analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.17 per share to $1.40 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Seagate right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

793,STX,"The technology space continues to be investors’ favorite due to its dynamic nature. This field is expected to grow faster than ever before. Therefore, if you invest right, you can reap the benefits over time..Below we have evaluated one technology company that has demonstrated remarkable share price performance so far. Micron Technology, Inc. (MU  -  Free Report) has generated significant returns for investors in the last year and has the potential to exceed expectations in the days ahead.The stock has returned approximately 82.6% in the last year, significantly outperforming the S&P 500’s gain of just 10.9%.Let’s look at the reasons behind Micron’s solid momentum.What’s Driving the Stock?The main reason behind the optimism surrounding the stock is improving prices for DRAM and NAND chips. Per various sources, DRAM and NAND prices have improved primarily due to a better product mix optimization and higher-than-expected demand for PCs, servers and mobiles.The benefit from improved pricing was well reflected in the company’s last quarterly results. Its fiscal third-quarter 2017 revenues not only increased 92.1% on a year-over-year basis but also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Most importantly, the company’s DRAM product category witnessed a 5% increase in bit shipment and 14% rise in average selling prices (ASP) during the quarter.The company’s third-quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.62 came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49. Also, it marked a significant improvement from the year-ago quarter’s loss of 3 cents.An encouraging top- and bottom-line guidance for the fourth quarter, way above the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate, also helped in boosting investors’ confidence about the company’s future prospects.Upward Estimate RevisionsIn the last 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 witnessed upward movement. For the fiscal fourth quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.81 per share, up 30 cents from earnings of $1.51 projected 60 days ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 is currently pegged at $4.61 per share compared with $4.11 projected 60 days ago.Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Micron Technology, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteOther Driving FactorsIt should be noted that Micron has been expanding in the SSD storage market due to the decline in the PC market. Notably, SSDs are faster and more energy efficient than traditional hard drives. These are also used in servers due to lower latency, thereby facilitating faster response to real-time applications.Notably, the company has an interesting partnership with Seagate (STX  -  Free Report). Per the agreement, Micron supplies a significant portion of Seagate’s NAND requirement. In return, Seagate shares its SAS SSD technology with Micron, a key technology that the latter lacks in the enterprise SSD market. We believe that this deal will expand Micron’s high-value enterprise SSD portfolio.Additionally, the acquisition of Inotera in 2016 is anticipated to be accretive to Micron’s DRAM gross margin, earnings per share and free cash flow. According to the company, the acquisition will also have some operational benefits, leading to efficient management of investment levels and cadence followed by alignment with global manufacturing operations.The company anticipates the aforementioned factors to also have a positive impact on its fiscal fourth-quarter results.Bottom LineLooking at the improving selling prices for DRAM and strategic initiatives of expanding in the SSD market, we consider that Micron is one technology stock which is worthy of remaining in investors’ portfolio.On the valuation front too, the stock looks attractive. The company currently trades at a forward P/E multiple of 6.4x, significantly lower than the S&P 500 average of 19.2x. The ratio, which is obtained by dividing a stock’s current market price with its historical or estimated earnings, measures how much an investor needs to shell out per dollar of earnings. Therefore, lower the P/E of a stock, the better for a value investor.Hence, we believe that there is still much momentum left in this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock, which is quite evident from its VGM Style Score of A and long-term earnings growth rate of 10%.The stock has grabbed the spotlight with striking performances on the back of solid earnings and robust growth projections. Keeping this in mind, we believe that investing in this stock will yield strong returns in the near term.A couple of other stocks worth considering in the broader technology sector are Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. (AAOI  -  Free Report) and FormFactor Inc. (FORM  -  Free Report), both sporting a Zacks Rank #1. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Applied Optoelectronics and FormFactor have an expected long-term EPS growth rate of 17.5% and 16%, respectively.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. With compounding, rebalancing, and exclusive of fees, it can turn thousands into millions of dollars.But here's something even more remarkable: You can master this proven system without going to a single class or seminar.

The figure was better than management’s guidance of 40%. The expansion was driven by a favorable supply-demand environment for flash-based products, product cost improvements, a higher mix of flash-based revenue, and strength in the capacity enterprise HDD product line-up.Non GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, decreased 160 bps to 16.8%, owing to lower research and development (R&D) – down 170 bps – and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses – down 430 bps.Non GAAP operating margin were 24.5% as compared with 12.9% in the year-ago quarter.Non GAAP interest expense declined 5.7% from the year-ago quarter to $197 million, slightly lower than management’s guidance.Acquisition SynergiesWestern Digital stated that it is on track to achieve the $800 million of annualized savings from the HGST integration by the end of calendar year 2017.

The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $9.19 in fiscal 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $10.45 per share.Our TakeWe believe that the shift toward non-PC applications, secular growth of digital data and increasing exposure to the small and medium business space are the long-term positives for Western Digital. The company’s growing footprint in the automotive as well as the connected home and industrial categories is a significant positive, in our view.Western Digital will benefit from favorable NAND industry conditions that management believes will persist at least through the first half of calendar 2018. This will also help in gross margin expansion.We remain encouraged by the company’s launch of a string of storage devices under the mobile and cloud segment. Continued investments in product innovation could result in flat margins in the near term.Further, Western Digital’s entry into the wireless devices market comes at a time when storage services related to smartphones and tablets are witnessing large-scale adoption. These factors are anticipated to be growth catalysts, going forward.Moreover, the SanDisk acquisition not only expands Western Digital’s offerings in the SSD segment, but also provides a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).Zacks Rank & Key PicksWestern Digital currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Infineon (IFNNY  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).

796,STX,"The spectacular run in the Wall Street is showing no signs of slowing down with the bull market now drawing close to nine years. Strong corporate earnings as well as the biggest tax overhaul in decades have been driving the latest rally. Notably, the new tax structure will save billions in the corporate world, boosting earnings and reflation trade.

797,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Jan 29. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 11.6%. Moreover, we note that Seagate has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 2.5%.Seagate is gaining from the increasing adoption of its Nearline HDDs. We believe that Nearline’s rapid adoption will boost Seagate’s competitive position against Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report). The company’s efforts in the improvement of areal density with the ramping up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology are yet another positive.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Expect What?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter is pegged at $1.40 per share, reflecting a year-over-year decrease of 1.5%. Further, earnings estimates have moved north over the last 30 days. However, Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.83 billion, down roughly 2.2% from the year-ago quarter.Aspects to Influence Q2 ResultsQ1 Earnings HighlightSeagate reported first-quarter 2018 non-GAAP earnings per share of 96 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 86 cents per share.Revenues of $2.63 billion also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.56 billion but decreased 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Nevertheless, both the top and bottom-line figures witnessed a sequential improvement, primarily attributable to strong demand and adoption of Seagate’s storage drives.Notably, its shares have gained 69.5% in the last six months, while the industry recorded growth of 22.3%.Positive Preliminary Q2 ResultsThe stock gained from the positive second-quarter fiscal 2018 preliminary results.Seagate now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.The company expects exabyte shipments to be roughly 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Moreover, the company recently announced a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba, which ensures continuous supply of NAND chips for Seagate’s expanding solid-state drive (SSD) portfolio.Improving HDD DemandHDD (hard disk drives) is improving primarily due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Increasing adoption of Seagate’s Nearline HDDs is likely to impact the to-be-reported quarter positively.Further, Seagate’s effort to augment areal density with the ramp up of its HAMR technology is a key catalyst.Strong PC Shipments Drives GrowthHints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive. Notably, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments touched 70.6 million units, up 0.7% year over year.These factors are likely to positively impact the to-be-reported quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Zacks ESP: Seagate currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.0%.

The broader index, in fact, met and exceeded Wall Street analysts’ projected average of 2,819 by the end of this year in just about 14 days of trading. Such relentless rally is merely an indication of a bull market that has an ability to discard any geo-political headwind.The index has been supported by a flurry of tailwinds.

It also posted 62 record closing highs last year, the second-highest number in its history.

Astute investors have shrugged off all kind of political uncertainty. Instead, they focused on upbeat corporate earnings results, accelerating economic growth both domestically and abroad, and the recently passed tax overhaul policy.Q4 Earnings to See Strong GrowthThe Q4 earnings season kicked off on a positive note. For the 53 S&P 500 members that have reported results already, earnings are up 11.7% from the same period last year on 7.5% higher revenues, with 81.1% beating EPS estimates and 75.5% surpassing revenue estimates. In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 10.3% from the same period last year on 7.1% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the Q3 of 2017 on 5.9% higher revenues.Estimates for Q4 earnings for most of the sectors are expected to be positive, with Energy, Industrial Products, Basic Materials and Technology poised to post strong gains. An uptick in oil output is expected to boost the energy sector, while a rise in sales on housing demand post-hurricanes will drive manufacturing activities. Meanwhile, substantial growth in cloud computing, the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence are cited to be some of the reasons that will benefit the tech sector.Solid Economic DataEconomic recovery worldwide gave a boost to profitability, reduced the jobless rate to 4.1% and lifted consumer confidence to a 17-year high last November. Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at the Conference Board, added that “consumers’ expectations remain at historically strong levels, suggesting economic growth will continue well into 2018.”Lest we forget, workers’ pay has increased 2.5% from December 2016 to December 2017. Such a low level of unemployment, rise in income and more confident consumers drove spending at both online and bricks-and-mortar stores as well as restaurants. In fact, spending might get a boost from the $1.5-trillion package of tax cuts approved by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Trump last month. These massive tax cuts will drive household income and in turn increase the propensity to consume.Tax Overhaul EffectsThe corporate tax rate will be lowered from 35% to 21% and will be implemented this year, instead of being delayed till 2019. At the same time, any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8-15.5%, instead of the current 35%.Lowering of domestic tax rates will boost profits, while a one-time low tax rate on foreign profits will encourage companies to bring funds held overseas back to the United States. This will help such companies carry out a combination of share buybacks, dividend payments and M&A activities.5 Top WinnersGiven the S&P 500’s record breaking run, investors should double down on the hottest stocks from the said index.

Shares of Seagate have rallied 14.4% since the announcement on Jan 8.Seagate now expects revenues to be approximately $2.9 billion compared with an increase of 3-5% guided previously. The improvement can primarily be attributed to strong growth in exabyte demand.Moreover, the company recently announced a long-term supply agreement with Toshiba, which ensures continuous supply of NAND chips for Seagate’s expanding solid-state drive (SSD) portfolio.Additionally, hints of PC market stabilization as reflected in the latest reports from Gartner and IDC are a positive.Seagate has returned 44.7% in the past year, outperforming the industry’s rally of 35.4%. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a market capital of $12.13 billion. Improving HDD DemandHDD (hard disk drives) is improving primarily due to strong demand for high-capacity mass-storage solutions. Increasing adoption of Seagate’s Nearline HDDs are expected to boost its market share in the near term.Further, Seagate’s effort to improve areal density with the ramp up of its heat assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) technology is a key catalyst.Moreover, stabilization of the PC market per the latest report from Gartner and IDC bodes well for memory shipments, particularly HDDs. According to IDC, worldwide PC shipment has shown signs of growth in the fourth quarter of 2017, during which shipments touched 70.6 million units, up 0.7% year over year.Seagate also expects its exabyte shipments to be around 88 exabytes, which reflects drive shipments to be around 40 million and average capacity per drive to be approximately 2.2 terabytes.Rising EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 earnings has increased 8.4% to $4.52 over the last 30 days.

800,STX,"Seagate Technology plc (STX  -  Free Report) reported disappointing fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Both non-GAAP earnings of 65 cents per share and revenues of $2.41 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 99 cents and $2.55 billion, respectively.Seagate also announced the appointment of Dave Mosley as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and instated current CEO Steve Luczo as the Executive Chairman effective Oct 1, 2017.Non-GAAP earnings plunged 41% on a sequential basis, primarily due to 10% decline in revenues. On a year-over-year basis revenues fell 9.3%, which reflects intense competition in the Hard Drive Disk (HDD) market from the likes of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report).Seagate reported fiscal 2017 revenues of $10.77 billion, down 3.5% over fiscal 2016. The company generated approximately $1.9 billion in cash flow from operations and returned 53% of that to shareholders in cash dividends worth $561 million and share repurchases worth $460 million. Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM)  Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteShares were down more than 18% in pre-market trading following the results. Seagate’s stock has gained 4.2% year to date, substantially underperforming the 22.9% rally of the industry it belongs to.Quarter DetailsSeagate reported non-GAAP gross margin of 28.9%, which contracted 250 basis points (bps) on a sequential basis.Operating expenses (prior to amortization & restructuring charges), as a percentage of revenues, increased 40 bps sequentially to 17.7%. Product development, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 10 bps, which was fully offset by a 60-bps increase in marketing and administrative expenses sequentially.Seagate exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2.54 billion, as compared with $3.02 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term debt was $5.02 billion, as compared with $5.07 billion in the preceeding quarter.Zacks Rank & Key PicksWe believe that declining PC shipment – per latest data from Gartner and IDC – doesn’t bode well for Seagate. The company is the second largest manufacturer of HDDs in the U.S., which are extensively used in PCs and Seagate derives the bulk of revenues from these devices.Currently, Seagate carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

802,STX,"Western Digital Corp. (WDC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fiscal fourth-quarter  2017 results on Jul 27.The company is unlikely to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate due to an unfavorable combination of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of +1.99%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors to ConsiderBetter-than-expected demand for storage products led Western Digital to revise its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 outlook. While the company maintained its revenue guidance of around $4.8 billion, the non-GAAP earnings per share forecast was raised from the range of $2.55–$2.65 to $2.85.Notably, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein the top and the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Also, revenues increased on a year-over-year basis. The company delivered positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 13.5%. The revised fourth-quarter guidance also boosted investors’ confidence.We note that the company has outperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 12.1%, the stock returned 41.1% over the same time frame.We believe Western Digital’s strong presence in the flash memory market has been a positive for the company for a while now. Additionally, its product portfolio is being enhanced regularly with the first portable solid state drive (SSD) unveiled in April. It also increased the capacity of its surveillance-class hard drives to 10 TB.Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Western Digital Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Western Digital Corporation QuoteMoreover, it also introduced the world’s first Client SSD with 64-Layer 3D NAND technology in May and development of the industry’s first 3D NAND technology 96 layers of storage capability in June. Additionally the SanDisk acquisition has expanded Western Digital’s offerings in the SSD segment and also provided a competitive edge against peers such as Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report).However, the ongoing tussle with Toshiba regarding the flash memory chip joint-venture in Japan is a growing concern.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

803,STX,"Seagate Technology Plc (STX  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 25.The company is unlikely to post a positive earnings surprise due to an unfavorable combination of Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -2.02%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.This is because, per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 to beat estimates.We also don’t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Increasing Competition Hurts GrowthYear to date, Seagate has underperformed the S&P 500 Index. The stock has returned 3.3% as compared with the Index’s gain of 10.7%.The dismal performance can be attributed to intensifying competition in the market post the merger of Western Digital (WDC  -  Free Report) and SanDisk. Western Digital recently revised fourth-quarter estimates upwards driven by better-than-expected demand for its storage products (flash-based storage devices). This also doesn’t bode well for Seagate’s to-be-reported quarter results.Moreover, shift in demand from PCs to inexpensive mobile devices is hurting growth of Seagate, which is primarily a hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturer.Further, declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data is a major concern for Seagate. Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise  Seagate Technology PLC Price and EPS Surprise | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteAdditionally, we also believe that Seagate’s significant investments in HAMR technology, 10 and 12 terabyte Helium HDD and fourth generation SMR technology will take some more time to translate into credible top-line growth.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may consider as our proven model shows they have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Cypress Semiconductor (CY  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +11.11% and a Zacks Rank #1.

804,STX,"On Jul 19, Zacks Investment Research downgraded Seagate Technology plc. (STX  -  Free Report) to a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Earnings estimates for Seagate have been revised downward over the last 30 days for 2017 and 2018. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 remained unchanged at $4.46, while that for 2018 declined to $4.70 from $4.75 over the same time period. The downgrade can primarily be attributed to declining product demand, competitive market structure, sluggish macroeconomic environment and IT spending trends.We believe Seagate’s significant investments in HAMR technology, 10 and 12 terabyte Helium HDD and fourth generation SMR technology will take some more time to translate into credible top-line growth.Notably, Seagate’s shares have underperformed the S&P 500 on a year-to-date basis. While the index gained 10.1%, the stock returned 1.7%.Intensifying Competition & Declining Demand Remain HeadwindsSeagate is experiencing a downturn primarily due to declining demand in the PC market as evident from Gartner and IDC’s recently released worldwide PC shipments data.Shift in demand from PCs to inexpensive mobile devices is hurting the growth of hard disk drives (HDD) manufacturers like Seagate. Moreover, the merger of Western Digital and SanDisk has intensified competition in the storage industry, particularly in the solid state drive (SSD) market. This remains an overhang on the company.The company is diversifying its product portfolio to outweigh the negative impact of diminishing HDD market, thereby lessening the risk of customer concentration. However, the products are at a very nascent stage to contribute positively to its top-line growth.Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) Seagate Technology PLC Revenue (TTM) | Seagate Technology PLC QuoteSeagate faces pricing pressure because of high volatility in the DRAM and NAND space, which led to the company maintaining low inventories in the current quarter.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the broader sector include KLA-Tencor (KLAC  -  Free Report), Veeva System (VEEV  -  Free Report) and Applied Optoelectronics (AAOI  -  Free Report).

806,STX,"The Chinese Year of the Dog kicked off on Feb 16, which has historically been promising for the U.S. stock market. Astute investors, thus, should turn bullish and use this encouraging calendar year to their advantage. And why not? The Republican tax overhaul is expected to have a positive effect on earnings this year. Fears of surging inflation and higher interest rates, on the other hand, are unwarranted and likely to ease.Year of the Dog is Great for the U.S. Stock MarketThe U.S. equity market traditionally performs well in the Year of the Dog, per LPL Research. Data from as early as 1950 showed that the 12-month return on the broader S&P 500 in the year was up more than 15% on average.In four of the last five Year of the Dog, the market clocked double-digit gains. In 1958, returns were the highest, up 32.9%. In the most recent one ending in 2006, the returns were also quite solid, increasing 12.4%. YearS&P 500 Return in the Year of the Dog195832.9%197012.7%198220.7%1994-2.3%200612.4%Average15.3%(Source: LPL)Ryan Detrick, Senior Market Strategist at LPL added that “in fact, out of the 12 zodiac signs, no year sports a better average return.” In the past Year of the Goat, Tiger, Ox, Rabbit, Pig, Monkey, Dragon, Horse, Rat, Rooster and Snake, the S&P 500 had given an average return of 14.9%, 13.8%, 13.5%, 10.6%, 10.5%, 9.2%, 8.7%, 6.3%, 3.2%, 1.8% and 0.8%, respectively.Though a few may be skeptical about investing based on stars, but this Year of the Dog has certainly started off on a bullish note. The S&P 500 managed to log its sixth straight rise on Feb 16. After all, U.S. earnings expectations have sharply accelerated on tax stimulus, while inflation scares are overblown.Tax Plan to Boost EarningsThe Trump administration’s tax cut policy is expected to boost earnings, in a market that already has historically high valuations. The headline-grabbing move was that the corporate tax rate is lowered from 35% to 21%. Republicans also repealed the 20% corporate alternative minimum tax, while any income brought back from overseas will be taxed 8% to 15.5%, instead of the current 35% (read more: GOP Passes Landmark Tax Bill: Best & Worst for Stocks).Earnings growth this year is set to be healthy. Most of the S&P 500 companies have provided guidance that exceeded expectations, while the Q4 earnings season is already on track to be quite impressive. For the 398 S&P 500 members that have reported results, earnings are up 14.5% from the same period last year on 9% higher revenues, with 77.9% beating EPS estimates and 75.6% surpassing revenue estimates.In fact, Q4 earnings among all sectors are expected to be up 14% from the same period last year on 8.2% higher revenues. This will follow the 6.7% earnings growth recorded in the third quarter of 2017 on 5.8% higher revenues (read more: What Will Retail Earnings Show?).Inflation and Rate Hike Fears OverblownA surge in inflation in January possibly leading to faster-than-expected rate hikes did trigger a sudden panic among investors. Higher inflation would prompt the Federal Reserve to hike short-term interest rates at a faster pace than expected. This, in turn, will increase borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which could eventually lead to a slowdown in the economy.But, market pundits believe that the spike in inflation last month will fizz out. Even though the consumer price index (CPI) inched up 0.5% in January from the previous month, it stayed at 2.1% in January on a year-over-year basis. Thus, it has fallen from the nearly 3% annual growth rate in the last three months. Meanwhile, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has been below the central bank’s 2% target since mid-2012.  Wage growth in January also doesn’t hint at a surge in cost of living. After all, wages rose on colder-than-normal weather condition, which is a seasonal factor. Further, if managers and supervisors’ salaries are excluded, hourly wages increased at a sluggish pace. This showed that much of the increase was not evenly distributed and concentrated mostly on managers (read more: Wages See Fastest Growth Since 2009: Top 5 Gainers).5 Biggest GainersGiven the bullishness, investing in stocks that can make the most of the Year of the Dog seems judicious. We have, thus, selected five such stocks that are poised to yield stellar returns this calendar year that constitute bulk of the Year of the Dog.These stocks also flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a VGM Score of A or B.

MDU Resources includes regulated electric and natural gas utilities and regulated natural gas pipelines and energy services, natural gas and oil production, construction materials and contracting, and construction services.MDU is not just a Utility company as more than half of their profits come from its construction segment.  But the Utility side is doing very well as the electric and natural gas segment earned +17.8% more than the year ago quarter as the company sold more electric and gas during the quarter while increasing its customer base (+2%).  Further, the company is expecting to purchase a wind farm in southwestern North Dakota in late 2018, further expanding its production and customer base.  On the natural gas side, management expects its new 21 mile natural gas pipeline to be completed this year to attract new customers. The construction segment, which consists of two divisions, construction services, and construction materials, both saw strong revenues and earnings in its most recent reported quarter.  The continued economic growth in the U.S. has been one of the big drivers behind the construction segments success.  The segments performs infrastructure work for other utility companies, builds powerlines, electric substations, and underground natural gas pipelines.  Moreover, the President’s recent announcement of his 10 year trillion dollar infrastructure plan is viewed as a big positive going forward for MDU Resources.  But even before this infrastructure boom hits, the company’s construction services segment posted record revenues in 2017, $1.37 billion, and saw earnings grow by +57.2%.  The record year was attributed to higher workloads, specialty contracting work in high-tech manufacturing and retail areas, and equipment sales and rentals.  The construction materials business saw earnings grow by +20.2% in 2017 due to increased total projects, and the entrance into new markets.  Lastly, both segments saw significant increases in their backlog of projects. Due to the strong backlogs of projects, and management guiding FY 2018 EPS in the high range of the previous consensus earnings which caused analyst estimates to improve from $$1.29 to $1.38.  Further, the company had recently increased its quarterly dividend payment by +2.6% for an annual dividend yield of +2.9%.Seagate Technology (STX  -  Free Report) offers a portfolio of hard disc drives, solid state drives and solid state hybrid drives.
