4,EL,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been on a tear lately. After putting in the bottom to its latest base in early April, the veteran chip stock has posted 10 up weeks in a row. It's hitting price levels not seen since January 2007.Judging from Monday's action, the buyers aren't tired yet.While the stock is now extended sharply past a 13.95 buy point in a large, deep double-bottom base, it may be worth keeping the stock on the watch list. Here are two reasons.One, a stock that rises that many weeks in a row is showing something special. Fund managers are serious about accumulating the stock. No wonder that AMD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also shot up to an A+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Two, fundamentals are getting white-hot at the Intel (INTC) rival in CPUs.Advanced Micro, which incorporated in 1969, ended two years of red ink by earning 13 cents a share last year. The Street sees earnings soaring 246% to 45 cents a share this year and rising another 33% to 60 cents in 2019.What's powering that solid profitability? Big sales. In the first quarter, Advanced Micro posted a 40% jump in revenue to $1.65 billion. That increase topped growth of 19%, 26% and 21% in the prior three quarters.Q1 gross margin jumped 400 basis points vs. the year-ago quarter to 36%, and the Santa Clara, Calif., company cut its operating expense as a ratio of sales from 33% to 29%.""PC, gaming and datacenter adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a news release. Advanced Micro is clearly gaining traction in the area of GPUs, or graphics processors. The firm's computing and graphics segment vaulted 95% to $1.12 billion, offsetting a 12% slide in sales in the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom business unit.At this point, it would make sense to watch for the stock to take a rest and flash a follow-on entry point. Wait for the stock's first pullback to the 10-week moving average. This could take a while. The 10-week moving average is rising rapidly. But at 13.40, it's sharply below the current share price.A three-weeks-tight pattern would offer another potential follow-on buy point. But so far, there's no such formation.Elsewhere in stocks today, Estee Lauder (EL) cooled off on Monday after gaining more than 3% in each of the prior two weeks. Those gains enabled the cosmetics giant to rise past a 151.85 buy point in a nicely symmetrical cup with handle.The 5% buy zone goes up to 159.44.Autodesk (ADSK) muscled past a 141.36 buy point in a 14-week flat base that showed a mild correction of 14% from head to toe. The expert in computer-aided design software for manufacturers snapped a six-quarter streak of losses by earning 6 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in April. Sales picked up 15% to $556 million.Autodesk's latest flat base is part of a base on base. The first base: a three-month double bottom that featured a 119.34 buy point.FleetCor Technologies (FLT), also featured in IBD's Stock of the Day column, gapped up powerfully at the open and rose as much as 6.3%. Shares are still in buy range after clearing a 213.84 proper entry in a long flat base.The fuel card provider has expanded into business transactions markets outside the fuel market via new acquisitions. Key new markets include tolls, corporate payments and lodging. FleetCor has delivered decent to solid double-digit profit and sales growth for six quarters in a row.RELATED:Inside The IBD 50: To Gain An Edge On The S&P 500, Use This TechniqueWhat Is The 3-Weeks-Tight Chart Pattern, And How It Helps Make Money In StocksThe Latest Inside Investor's Corner

Late-stage bases have less upside than earlier stages. Two weeks ago, the stock moved past an early entry at 348.67 at a handle entry only viewable on the daily chart.In the latest quarter, earnings and sales growth came in at 68% and 6%, respectively.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseEstee Lauder (EL) has rallied back above its 50-day line after a steep sell-off in early May. Now, the stock is trading just under a V-shaped cup with handle's 151.85 buy point. Shares found necessary support at their 50-day line Friday.A potential flaw is the stock's relative strength line. It descended rapidly in conjunction with the stock price in early May. Even though the stock has recovered near its old highs, the RS line still has a good deal of work ahead of it before it hits a new high.The base is shallow enough that it can also be interpreted as a flat base with a 153.98 buy point.The cosmetics maker boasts six quarters of accelerating revenue growth — from 1% to 18% in the most recent quarter over that time period.Leading brokerage firm TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is rallying back above its 50-day line, as a flat base entry at 63.11 looms ahead. Shares had a strong move after a breakout above a cup with handle's 47.36 in September.But financials have been weak over the last several weeks. Rival Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is triggering the 7%-8% sell signal from a flat base's 74.21 buy point.TD Ameritrade's earnings and sales grew 66% and 57%, respectively, vs. the year-ago period.On the downside, the stock has a weak D- Accumulation/Distribution Rating.

6,EL,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA), the beauty-products and salon chain, reported first-quarter earnings after the closing bell that beat expectations. But the company's second-quarter outlook came in below what analysts were looking for.XEstimates: A 29% jump in earnings per share to $2.48, on revenue up 16% $1.526 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Same-store sales are expected to rise 6.9%, according to Consensus Metrix.Results: Earnings per share of $2.70, up 31.7%. Net sales rose 17.4% to $1.543 billion. Same-store sales rose 8.1%.The company forecast second-quarter net sales of $1.475 billion to $1.488 billion, below estimates for $1.498 billion. And it projected EPS for Q2 of $2.35-$2.40, below forecasts for $2.50.Ulta said it expected same-store sales for Q2 to increase by 6%-7%, a slowdown from the period a year ago and from the first quarter of this year.Stock: Shares dropped 3% after hours in the stock market today. Skin care and makeup giant Estee Lauder (EL) was unchanged late Thursday, but near a 153.98 buy point of a flat base. Estee Lauder closed 1.16% lower to 149.44.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseUlta tends to be cautious with its sales forecasts. But even as same-store sales rise, Ulta has been competing against high expectations and shrinking room for error.Beauty-product discounting, concerns about slowing sales and margins, and signs Amazon could advance further into the beauty-products market helped sink Ulta's stock last year.Shares have rebounded since April. And Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy, in a research note dated Monday, said the company stands to benefit from the popularity of skin care products and the rollout of prestige boutiques. She cited ""healthy traffic"" in Ulta stores and ""stabilized promotional activity"" — or competitive price cutting — compared with last year as other positives during the quarter.The chain this spring has been the No. 1 preferred beauty destination among average-income teenagers, above Sephora and Walmart (WMT), according to Piper Jaffray's research. The company's online traffic and sales have also increased.Ulta Beauty has long been pitched as a gem among the retail sector. Customers like to sample skin care and other products firsthand. They have to be in an Ulta location to get their hair or eyebrows done. Thus, analysts have argued, Ulta has some immunity to the threat of big online retailers like Amazon (AMZN).Walmart inched up 0.04% after the close, after finishing 1.9% lower, and was below its 50-day line. Amazon was unchanged after-hours. The stock finished the day up 0.3% to 1,629.62.

10,EL,"Even Indiana Jones would probably have given up.Howard Carter and his team dug through hundreds of boulders in Egypt's Valley of the Kings for about five arduous years, looking for the lost tomb of Tutankhamun. His research told him the tomb was there. But no one — not even he — could find it thousands of years after the child king's death. Carter's once enthusiastic financial backer was losing patience.But in one of history's greatest examples of persistence with a massive payoff, Carter removed rubble that revealed the entrance of the tomb on Nov. 25, 1922. His discovery is still considered the most significant archaeological feat in modern times, Tarek El-Awady, curator of the ""King Tut: Treasures of the Golden Pharaoh"" exhibit, told IBD in an email sent from Egypt. ""Howard Carter's discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun still stands as the greatest discovery made by man,"" El-Awady said.The valuable treasures Carter found still draw crowds to museums around the world. But what Carter did to achieve his goals and persevere is equally priceless, including:Carter was never formally trained as an archaeologist or even a scientist. He was the son of an artist and an artist himself. But he learned about archaeology on the job after he was hired at the age of 17 to draw Egyptian artifacts for a wealthy family. His skill as an artist won him a spot traveling to Egypt alongside some of the best archaeologists of all time, including Percy Newberry. From them he learned how to carefully excavate and catalog a dig's artifacts. This knowledge, paired with his previous training as an artist, created a powerful blend of skill sets that few in the world possessed. ""He learned a lot on the job. You can't learn it until you're standing there having to do it,"" Pearce Creasman, associate professor and director of the Egyptian Expedition at the University of Arizona told IBD. ""He put all the pieces together and learned from all these people and added his special skill (of drawing) to the mix.""Carter's skill set was so unique that he commanded respect on digs and was later named chief inspector for the Egyptian Antiquities Service — a position that would set him up for success later.From Newberry and others, Carter learned the importance of being highly detailed in cataloging everything he found. His journals of findings are richly illustrated in painstaking detail — a standard practice in archaeology today — but perhaps seen as excessive or even obsessive in the day.To capture every detail, Carter developed a breakthrough system of classifying digs that culminated with the King Tut discovery. Every group of objects found was designated with a number from one to 620, Nicholas Reeves and John Taylor wrote in ""Howard Carter Before Tutankhamun."" Smaller groups of items found were then notated with single or multiple letters, such as a, b, c, aa, bb, cc and aaa, bbb, ccc.Again, this was Carter applying his talents to something he learned from someone else. Carter ""learned excavation with British excavator Flinders Petrie, who taught him the importance of small finds,"" Brian Fagen, an archaeologist and emeritus professor of anthropology at University of California, Santa Barbara, told IBD. ""Researchers working on the tomb still consult his notebooks, which are an exceptional record, far ahead of their time.""Carter closely observed and took valuable tips from ""experts."" But just as importantly, he knew what to ignore, too. Theodore Davis, a wealthy U.S. attorney and successful archaeologist whom Carter was working with, declared in the early 1910s that all the great finds in the Valley of the Kings already had been found.Carter disregarded Davis' ""expert opinion."" Carter's own experience proved to be just as precious, if not more than Davis'. Carter ""was a maverick operator, stubborn, ambitious and brimming with self-confidence,"" William Cross, author of ""Carnarvon, Carter and Tutankhamun Revisited: The Hidden Truths and Doomed Relationships,"" told IBD. ""His know-how, spark and ingenuity convinced him that the tomb of Tutankhamun was somewhere in the Valley of the Kings.""After Davis gave up on the dig, Carter had to find another backer to fund a continued search.Carter quit his stable job as an inspector for the Egyptian archaeological service in 1905 to free up time for his search. Some of the hardest years of his life followed.Carter's quest for the tomb was almost an obsession. But he knew that to complete it he would need financial backing. After Davis left the quest, Carter teamed up with a new financial supporter, wealthy Briton Lord Carnarvon. The difficulty was convincing him to keep writing the checks even as Carter found nothing year after year.When Carnarvon grew frustrated and was about to cut off Carter's financing, Carter modified his approach to appeal to Carnarvon's sense as an investor. In those times, archaeologist teams kept half of what they found and returned the remainder to Egypt. Carter knew the cost of financing another dig was a fraction of the reward possible if they found the tomb. He explained the economics to Carnarvon and said if he wouldn't pay to keep digging, Carter would from his own pocket. The pitch was so compelling — blending economic reasoning with scientific precision — it convinced Carnarvon to keep writing the checks. ""He got one guy to buy in and sometimes that's all it takes, is one person to make something really big happen,"" Creasman said.Carter's sharp tongue might have made it difficult to sell his idea, but he ""was smart enough and eloquent enough in tales about Tutankhamun's lost tomb to be enticed and trusted by millionaire investors looking to cash in on antiquities, and the glint of gold to come,"" Cross said.Just imagining your success isn't going to do much. Success comes to those who visualize how to get there. Carter provides an example. While still antiquities inspector, Carter looked back and examined all the successful digs in the Valley of the Kings. Not just his, but everyone's. Most archaeologists randomly dug. But Carter applied his detailed grid-block system of analysis to past discoveries. This allowed him to build a holistic picture in his mind of what was explored, and what wasn't. By ""retroactively applying to all the work done in the Valley of the Kings … he knew areas that other people had missed,"" Creasman said. By studying past records, Carter knew others ""dug 10 feet to the right and 20 feet to the left, and 15 feet over here. They had not dug everything, everywhere.""Perhaps it was another example of how Carter elevated archaeology by blending facets of his unique mind as an artist would. Carter's attention to detail allowed him to visualize what parts of the valley were ""clean territory — an area no one has ever excavated,"" Creasman said.""He had this map in his head, along with internal motivation,"" Creasman said. ""I haven't done everything I can do until I've done this. When people obsess on a thing, they can't let it go.""Carter loved his life's work — ever since starting out as an artist. That passion drove him to keep looking and learning. Others who were purely driven by money would have given up. ""Working in the Valley of the Kings is like magic, the silence and the absolute power of the cliffs surrounding the valley makes every Egyptologist willing to spend his entire life working and working, running after a dream that might or might not ever come true,"" El-Awady said.His passion yielded success even when he wasn't trying. In addition to exploring and drawing, Carter loved horses and riding the west bank of Luxor, El-Awady says. ""One of his greatest discoveries happened when the leg of his horse got stuck in a hole that turned out to be the symbolic burial of King Mentuhotep II (Dynasty 11),"" El-Awady said. ""In this tomb, the beautiful statue of the king was discovered.""Carter brought ""long-term planning, the need for a disciplined approach to finding and excavating sites, and the necessity for recording everything with photographs, drawings, or in writing,"" Fagen said. ""He really was one of the first modern archaeologists, with a unique eye for detail, and always a mind for the long-term outcome of the project.""Get instant access to more trading ideas, exclusive stock lists and IBD proprietary ratings for only $5.Apply your unique interests and abilities to your profession to reinvent what's possible.Overcame: Many failed attempts to find King Tut's tomb and loss of financial backing""All we have to do is to peel the shrines like an onion, and we will be with the king himself.""

The small-cap Russell 2000 fell 0.7% after touching an all-time high earlier in the session.Volume crept higher on the NYSE but slipped on the Nasdaq.The Dow's outperformance was somewhat misleading.

The 50-day line was reclaimed in June.Pepsi's earnings popped 7%, topping views by about 6%. Revenue came in above expectations but only narrowly so.Pepsi's image is tied to its namesake soft drink, but the company's brands include Doritos, Cheetos, Frito-Lay, Ruffles and Quaker Oats. In Q2, revenue in the snack segment grew 4%, while overall revenue growth was only 2%.Meanwhile, chip stocks of a different order did well.

12,EL,"Sugar stockpiles are poised for a record as slowing demand growth and surging production creates the worst-performing commodity of 2018.Consumers have become increasingly wary of the health impact of their sweet tooth, and companies from canned-fruit maker Del Monte Foods Inc. to snack-food seller Mondelez International Inc. are touting products made with less sugar. While global consumption is still rising, the pace of growth has slowed to an average 1.4% in recent seasons, down from 1.7% over the past decade, according to researcher Green Pool Commodity Specialists.That's coming at a time when production is booming, especially in India, the world's No. 2 producer. Farmers in Thailand are also collecting massive crops. World stockpiles are set to swell to the highest ever this season and stay near the record next year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sugar futures in New York have already slumped 25% in 2018. That's the biggest loss on the Bloomberg Commodity Index, which tracks returns for 22 components.""Unless there's a weather issue, it doesn't look that the bulls have any hope for a sustained rally,"" said Donald Selkin, a New York-based chief market strategist at Newbridge Securities Corp., which oversees about $2 billion. ""Everybody is trying to do away with sugar and sugary products. You see that in supermarkets and grocery stores. Demand is going to remain less than what's been in recent years. The price is doomed to stay low for a while.""On Monday, raw sugar for October delivery fell 1% to 11.4 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.Investors are setting up for more declines.In the week ended July 3, money managers more than tripled their net-short position, or the difference between bets on a price increase and wagers on a decline, to 54,736 futures and options, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released Monday. The move came as short holdings increased 15%, while long bets fell almost 7%.Global production will top demand by 19.6 million metric tons in the 12 months that end Sept. 30, the biggest overhang ever, Brisbane, Australia-based Green Pool said in a report last month. The excess would be more than enough to meet annual demand in China, the world's top importer.After farmers collected a mammoth crop, the Indian Sugar Mills Association said July 3 that processors are seeking to increase export quotas to a record 6 million tons. The group estimates the country's output at as much as 32 million tons, a gain of 58% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, in Brazil surging ethanol stockpiles and tumbling prices for the biofuel mean cane millers could process more of the crop into sugar.Of course, crops can still fail, especially if the weather turns worse than expected. Dry conditions have hurt plants in Brazil's central southern region, the world's biggest-producing locale. The potential for an El Nino weather pattern later this year could also mean some damage to Asian crops.But in a market where demand slowing, small supply shocks can often be absorbed. While health concerns and taxes on sugary drinks that erode consumption have been more pronounced in developing economies, Green Pool said that these factors are now being ""replicated"" in emerging markets.""All the bearish elements that had sugar pinned down initially are still in place, and some are even worse,"" said Frank Jenkins, the president of JSG Commodities in South Norwalk, Conn. ""We are looking for a long period of time with a very substantial surplus. We are in the fourth or fifth inning of this bear market.""

These law-abiding newcomers must feel like idiots, watching what's happening on the southern border.Hundreds of thousands of Central American migrants are walking right in. They're not waiting in line. They're using ""asylum"" requests as their E-ZPass. Just 12% of requests from El Salvadorans, 11% from Guatemalans and 7.5% from Hondurans are actually granted, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Never mind, the request gets them in.It's a shameful distortion of a program intended to provide a haven for true victims of state-sponsored religious, ethnic and political persecution. The U.S. offered asylum to Hungarian anti-communists after their uprising was crushed by the Soviets in 1956; to Cubans fleeing Castro's prisons; to Vietnamese after the fall of Saigon to the Communists in 1975; to Chinese political dissidents escaping the crackdown after Tiananmen Square in 1989; and more recently, to Chinese Christians and Muslims threatened for practicing their religion.Not to be confused with what's happening on the southern border. Migrants walk up to a border agent with a familiar story. Women typically plead they're victims of an abusive boyfriend or husband, and men claim they're escaping gang violence. They're detained briefly, but many are then released into the United States and given a date for an asylum hearing.Being granted asylum means hitting the jackpot. Asylees get the Refugee Cash Assistance program, including medical care, a housing allowance and hundreds of dollars a month in cash. All inclusive, as the Sandals getaway ads say. In contrast, immigrants who go the green card route are ineligible for most benefits for years.Half who use asylum as their excuse for crossing the border never even file a claim or show up at a hearing. They're also winners. After all, they made it inside the U.S., unlike the East Asian waiting 12 years to enter as a legal worker.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLast weekend, open borders advocates held 700 marches across the country, protesting the Trump administration's policies. One target was Attorney General Jeff Sessions' recent clarification that domestic abuse is not sufficient grounds for seeking asylum. A few immigration judges have granted asylum on those grounds, but it's not how asylum is defined.House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., accused Sessions of ""staggering cruelty."" But Sessions is right. The asylum law ""is not a general hardship statute,"" he says. If every hardship qualifies for asylum, it will mean everyone can come in.That's the marchers' objective. And increasingly the goal of the progressive flank of the Democratic Party. Their rhetoric suggests any limit on immigration is a crime against humanity. New Yorkers like Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who toppled Congressman Joe Crowley last week, and Cynthia Nixon, running to unseat Gov. Andrew Cuomo, are calling for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency.A similar battle is raging inside the European Union, which is overwhelmed by mostly bogus asylum claims from North African migrants. More than 70% of their claims are rejected, according to special envoy of the U.N. High Commission on Refugees, Vincent Cochetel. But the migrants who are turned down for asylum stay anyway, eluding deportation. They're straining public schools and government benefits and provoking a backlash against German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government.Last weekend, EU leaders tentatively devised a plan to screen asylum seekers in disembarkation centers along the North African coast, before they make their way across the Mediterranean to Europe. Trump is proposing something similar to vet asylum applicants on the Mexican side of our southern border, before they enter the U.S.In America and Europe, demagogues tell us to have a heart and let everybody in. But the public understands that immigration affects public schools, wages, taxes, even cultural identity. That's why we have immigration laws.The aspiring Americans who obey those laws and wait their turn deserve our respect. Allowing other immigrants to jump in front of them using flimsy asylum claims is a slap in the face.More Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

14,EL,"Blue-Model Fail: By any standard, San Francisco is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. So why has it suddenly become an unappealing place to visit and to live? As with so many U.S. cities, it suffers a host of urban maladies. Blame the far-left Blue Model of urban governance, which now afflicts most major American cities.Yes, the city by the bay is extraordinarily beautiful. But that's a result of geography and the city's distant past, not of its current political class, which is about as far-left on the urban political spectrum as any city in America.Many were surprised that a Chicago-based medical association recently said ""no thanks"" to future conventions in San Francisco, once a cherished favorite conference or meeting site for groups of all sorts, setting off alarms.The San Francisco Travel Association, which revealed the cancellation, refused to name the medical association involved. Perhaps it hopes to change the group's decision. But it did say that the loss would be significant, costing the local economy some $40 million from about 15,000 attendees.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd apart from the shock value, this cancellation may be the tip of a very big iceberg. The local NBC News affiliate was brutal in its assessment as to why the cancellation happened: ""The amount of trash, feces, and used drug needles scattered throughout the city's streets and sidewalks is making it harder to convince companies to return to San Francisco."" Ouch.No, San Francisco hasn't collapsed. It's still a big city, filled with nice restaurants, extravagant hotels and wealthy residents, many made rich by the Silicon Valley tech boom. It's not poor, or even struggling. But despite the superficial trappings of its tech wealth, it is changing, and not for the better.That gives it much in common with other major American cities.Because San Francisco's superficial wealth masks a serious problem: As with so many other major cities, it has hollowed out. Middle-class families have fled, no longer able to afford to live there, or appalled at what the city has become. The cancelled medical convention was  symbolic of that disenchantment.One recent report shows why. It notes that the city had logged more than 16,000 complaints containing the word ""feces"" in just one week. Many of those reports linked a growing amount of fecal matter on streets and in alley to the near-ubiquitous encampments of homeless people and vagrants, who have flooded into the city due to its tolerant and even friendly policies. It's a serious problem.San Francisco proudly calls itself a ""progressive"" city. It follows what writer and scholar Walter Russell Mead calls the progressive ""Blue Model"" of governance. Yet, the policies it follows — high taxes, inane regulations, petty nanny-state authoritarianism, tolerance for rising lawlessness and disorder on its streets in the name of ""compassion"" — are the very ones that have driven middle-class and working-class citizens out. Only the rich and the so-called homeless, who have been welcomed into the city and are a growing issue, can afford to live in the city.Still, it might be unfair to single San Francisco out. A new study of Census data from 2010-2017 by the online publication 24/7 Wall Street and reported by USA Today finds that many other major American cities are losing population to other areas, even faster than San Francisco. But, unlike San Francisco, none of them have a booming Silicon Valley to bail them out as their middle-class residents seek greener pastures elsewhere.Looking at the Top 10 biggest net migration losers on the list for the seven years is instructive: It includes Chicago (which lost 296,320 people from 2010-2017), L.A. (-93,959 people lost), Detroit (-54,640), St. Louis (-39,894 people), Cleveland (-33,117), Memphis (-30,000), Milwaukee (-27,959), Flint, Mich. (-22,658), El Paso, Texas (-21,829), and, of course, New York City (-21,503).Those cities' hard-working middle class residents are leaving, rather than face growing urban decay, welfare-based poverty, loss of major businesses, poor-performing public schools, artificially high local housing prices, crime and a hostile political class that focuses on superficial measures of class-leveling and ""equality"" rather than creating opportunities for all.We looked at the list and did a bit of research of our own. What we found was that virtually all of the top 10 cities on the list that had a net loss of population to other cities and states have been governed almost exclusively by liberal or far-left Democratic regimes since at least the 1960s. Their problems aren't accidental. They're systematic.For years, these Blue Model politicians have taxed, spent and regulated on the people's behalf, with poor or even abysmal results. That's why the massive shift of population is taking place. It also accounts, perhaps, for the surprising rise and success of President Trump.As urban researchers Joel Kotkin and Wendell Cox noted in 2017, ""In 2016 alone, states that supported Donald Trump gained 400,000 domestic migrants from states that supported Hillary Clinton. This came on top of an existing advantage in net domestic red state migration of 1.45 million people from 2010 through 2015.""San Francisco, Kotkin and Cox observe, is a case in point:  ""In the San Francisco Bay Area, techies are increasingly looking for jobs outside the region, and some companies are offering cash bonuses for those willing to leave. A recent poll indicated that 46% of millennials want to leave the Bay Area. Meanwhile, these 'best and brightest' have been gravitating to lower cost areas such as Austin, Orlando, Houston, Nashville, and Charlotte.""Fed-up big city residents in Blue cities and states, in short, are moving to smaller cities and towns in Red states. It's a political transformation that complicates the Democrats' hopes of recapturing the White House in 2020 and Congress this year.The failure of America's big cities should be a warning siren to Democratic Party advocates of Blue Model governance. Because of the Blue Model's failure, America is rapidly segregating itself economically. It's unhealthy for America, unhealthy for our big cities, and unhealthy for our democracy. And it shows no signs of ending any time soon.YOU MIGHT ALSO LIKE:In Illinois, A Looming Battle Over The Bankrupting 'Blue Model'How Decades Of Democratic Rule Ruined Some Of Our Finest CitiesDetroit, North Korea, The City Of Broken Lights

17,EL,"Southwest (LUV) on Tuesday launched cheap airfare deals, with select one-way flights costing as little as $49, a biannual offering from the carrier that comes a day after it forecast weaker ticket sales following an accident in April.XThe 72-hour cheap airfare bonanza is good for flights between Aug. 12 and Dec. 12. One-way tickets generally start at $49, $79, $99 and $129. A one-way flight from El Paso, Texas, to Los Angeles, for instance, starts at $49. Eighty-nine dollars can get you a one-way ticket from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., to Havana, Cuba.The discounts for discount flights, however, don't apply to flights on Friday and Sunday. And the fares are only valid on nonstop flights.

22,EL,"Adobe Systems (ADBE) and Stamps.com (STMP) are innovative U.S. companies, in very different businesses, and at very different stages in their development.So, how are their stock charts similar? Both are offering investors buy opportunities in the ramp up to their earnings reports.Weighing in with a market capitalization of nearly $108 billion, Adobe is a serious large cap player. Now a 36-year-old company, Adobe is the originator of PDF files and the related Acrobat software. Its Photoshop image-editing software is a household name. And its Adobe Creative Suite programs are a publishing industry staple.Over the last several years, the San Jose, Calif.-based outfit has transitioned from a provider of desktop software applications to a cloud-based, software-as-a-service model. Adobe's updated Creative Suite, dubbed Adobe Creative Cloud, has been a centerpiece of this transition.Analyst consensus expects the company to report a strong 51% EPS gain when it delivers its first quarter results on June 14. That is about even with the average gain over the past three quarters. Sales growth is projected at 22%, just below the three-quarter average.Adobe stock price took a dip Tuesday in mildly lighter than average trade, dropping for another test of its 10-week moving average after breaking out from a flat base in January. The stock is up about 17% since that breakout at 186.37. A series of tight weekly closes, just above support at the stock's 10-week moving average, are a good sign. These suggest institutional investors are holding steady ahead of earnings.Adobe has rebounded off support at its 10-week line twice since its January breakout. That makes the current rebound a bit more risky, but still actionable. The stock should only dip nominally below the line, if at all, before a rebound. The higher the volume on the bounce, the better. The buy range is the same as with any buy point: 5% above where the stock price touches the line.For its part, Stamps.com has a market capitalization of less than $4 billion. That puts it near the low end of the midcap spectrum.Headquartered in El Segundo, Calif., the company introduced internet-based postage to the market under the name StampMaster in 1996. It went public under the stamps.com name in 1999 and turned profitable on an annual basis in 2005.Since 2010, the company has increased sales and earnings every year. But the first quarter may mark an inflection point. Analyst consensus expects a mere 4% gain in EPS, while revenue growth is projected to slow to 17%. That would be the company's weakest performance in both categories in 15 quarters.For the year, consensus views see Stamps.com earnings down 19%. Meanwhile, sales are expected to grow a healthy 37%.The first-quarter earnings view sets a low bar. If Stamps.com were to top that target, investors may or may not drive shares higher. Some may be looking for an exit ahead of slowing earnings. At the same time, Stamps.com has itself been discussed as an attractive acquisition target for Amazon.com (AMZN).In any case, the stock is hovering just above a 215.86 buy point in a cup-with-handle base. It is still about 6% below its October high. That could present some mild overhead supply issues as investors who bought during the stock's big August gap-up look for a point of exit.But Stamps.com's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a healthy B. Its Up/Down Volume Ratio is also in good standing, at 1.2. This suggests institutional investors are in buying mode. And the stock's relative strength line has been trending higher since December, reinforcing a possible breakout.RELATED:Adobe Systems Seen Bumping Heads With Salesforce.comAdobe Launches Ad Network As Stock Faces A Key TestStocks With Rising Relative Price Strength: Stamps.com

26,EL,"The best growth stock mutual funds rewarded investors with returns between 26% and 46% in 2017, handsomely beating the S&P 500's advance of 21.83%. This strong performance partly explains why 113 funds landed an IBD Best Mutual Funds 2018 Award in the growth category vs. just nine the prior year.By comparison, no value stock funds made the winners' list this year, and the number of award-winning blend funds that have both growth and value components got cut in half to just 11.One year's outperformance is not all that's needed to win a Best Mutual Funds Award. Mutual funds need at least $100 million in assets and must beat their benchmark for the past one, three, five and 10 years ended December 2017, showing they can do well as stock market trends and conditions evolve over the long haul.So, what exactly contributed to these results and what's in store for the rest of 2018?Among the top five award winning growth funds, Primecap Odyssey Aggressive Growth (POAGX) tops the list with one- and 10-year average returns of 33.59% and 15.06%, respectively. The S&P 500 returned an average annual 8.5% in the past 10 years. The $11 billion fund invests in stocks across all sectors and market caps, targeting companies with prospects of rapid earnings growth that may not be reflected in their stock prices.At the end of 2017, the fund held 22% in small and micro caps — a significant overweight vs. the index's 1%. It also had major overweights in health care and technology — both sectors that were strong performers. Managers are not afraid to make strong sector or stock bets if they see solid long-term potential.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseTop 10 holdings represent 33% of assets and include Nektar Therapeutics (NKTR), Sony (SNE), Abiomed (ABMD), BlackBerry (BB) and Micron Technology (MU), which rallied between 52% and 386% last year.T. Rowe Price New Horizons (PRNHX) came in second, with returns of 31.49% for one year and an average annual 13.16% for 10 years. Midcaps and small caps comprise 69% and 25% of the $23 billion fund. Manager Henry Ellenbogen seeks out small companies that can become much larger. This usually includes disrupters and companies that promise durable growth.""Market leadership is likely to narrow as the bull market ages. As always, unforeseen risks, such as geopolitical turmoil, also pose challenges,"" Ellenbogen said in an email. ""Global macroeconomic events, including commodity price volatility, could affect performance."" He also pointed out that a regulatory attack on leading technology and internet companies is possible, which could have unintended consequences and heighten inflationary concerns.""As such, we will closely monitor global economic and political conditions and be cautious around new bouts of risk taking,"" Ellenbogen added. ""Nevertheless, we remain confident in our ability to find and hold smaller companies that can compound wealth by becoming durable and sustainable businesses, even through the downturns and valuation adjustments that are part of every market cycle.""American Century Select (TWCIX) surged 28.93% last year and an average annual 8.62% for the past 10 years. Veteran manager Keith Lee and his team run the $3 billion large-cap growth fund by selecting high-quality companies with strong growth prospects, while also limiting risk. As a result, the fund sports a turnover of just 19%.""We're looking for very long-term, durable franchises that have sustainable growth over long periods of time, and that allows us to really limit the amount of turnover we have,"" said co-portfolio manager Chris Krantz. Traits of such companies include strong management teams, strong competitive positions, good returns on capital and the ability to achieve a higher return on capital over time, he added.In addition, the fund is valuation-sensitive, so it looks to buy stocks that are reasonably priced. Top 10 holdings represent 43% of the fund and comprise leading stocks such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Mastercard (MA), Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN).Last year, the fund benefited from consumer staples companies that have ""stronger-growing franchises that weren't as impacted by consumer preferences,"" said Krantz.Beauty product maker Estee Lauder (EL) was a strong contributor with a 68% jump in share price. ""They have wonderful brands, a great management team and the ability to continue to grow. A lot of consumer staples companies are struggling to sustainably grow,"" Krantz said.Costco (COST), which rose 22% in 2017, ""is another company that while there are some concerns out there about online competition to Costco, Costco is a value proposition to the consumer, because the prices they offer is a competitive advantage that we think will be enduring. They provide value to the consumer that you just can't find anywhere else,"" explained Krantz.With consumers spending more money online, global electronic payment firms such as Mastercard and PayPal (PYPL) have a ""great business model that has high margins, high returns on capital and as consumers change their shopping preferences, whether by channel or by category, they're still spending with the same means. That's a secular growth area,"" he said.Blend funds are part of the mutual fund style box and combine growth and value investing. This year's cream-of-the-crop blend funds include Carillon Scout Mid Cap I (UMBMX), sporting a one-year return of 24.02% and a 10-year average annual return of 11.13%, and Primecap Odyssey Stock (POSKX) with 25.96% and 10.3%, respectively.T. Rowe Price's Institutional U.S. Structured Research (TRISX) and Capital Opportunity (PRCOX) rose 24% last year and an average annual 9% the past 10 years.Manager Ann Holcomb says that both funds follow the exact same strategy through a team-managed style where each research analyst is responsible for making the buy and sell decision within their own area of expertise. About 30 analysts are responsible for their own slice of the portfolio, overseen by three managers who oversee the big picture and make sure the portfolio is constrained in terms of the level of active risk.Top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). Last year, about two-thirds of the fund's outperformance came from stock selection, plus one-third from being underweight energy and telecom and overweight information technology.For 2018, Holcomb has ""cautious optimism for the rest of the year. Valuations are still pretty full, but fundamental underpinnings for earnings growth are still there. We have tax reform — it hasn't really made its way into earnings yet. We should still be the beneficiaries of further regulatory relief. Rates are still low, though rising. The consumer is healthy.

27,EL,"Things are looking up for Libya oil traders.XThe North African country where militants disrupted oil production for months just a year ago is now closing in on Saudi Arabia as the third-biggest source of seaborne supply to Europe after Iraq and Russia, the International Energy Agency said Thursday. Even as the U.S. is reviving its own oil industry and exporting, Libya managed to ship more crude to America in the fourth quarter than a year earlier while supplies from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and Iraq declined, the report showed.""Libya is holding onto its recent gains,"" the IEA said. While it remains a modest global exporter by volume, the politically divided nation also boosted exports to China, according to the report.The revival hasn't gone unnoticed by international oil companies. Earlier this month, France's Total (TOT) bought the Libyan assets of Marathon Oil (MRO) for $450 million. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA), BP (BP) and PetroChina (PTR) have agreed on annual deals to buy Libyan crude.Libya pumped 1.02 million barrels of oil a day in February, the fourth consecutive month when its output exceeded 1 million barrels daily, the IEA said. Production stood 350,000 barrels a day higher than in February last year when militant attacks and protests disrupted flows, it said.""That risk remains, although recent incidents have tended to be resolved swiftly,"" the IEA said.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersThis year, Libya's biggest oil field, Sharara, shut for just one day earlier this month due to a closed pipeline, according to the state-run National Oil Corp.

28,EL,"Kirk Kerkorian was on his way to LaGuardia Airport after a business trip to New York City. Halfway there he ordered the driver to turn back to his hotel.The reason: He'd forgotten to tip the room maid.The billionaire deal maker, an eighth-grade dropout who overcame a hardscrabble youth to become one of the richest men in the world, never forgot where he came from. And how hard it was to make a buck.""I think it very much informed his approach to life later,"" says William G. Rempel, author of ""The Gambler: How Penniless Dropout Kirk Kerkorian Became the Greatest Dealmaker in Capitalist History.""That deal making included starting Trans International Airlines, three times building what would then be the largest hotels in the world and purchasing Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio.His career had an unlikely genesis. His father was a successful farmer in California's rich San Joaquin Valley until he lost it all in the Depression of 1921-22. The family moved to Los Angeles when Kerkorian (1917-2015) was five years old. Ironically, much of his later success is rooted in the difficult times he experienced in his youth.In a phone interview, author Rempel continued: ""That poverty, that desperation, that uncertainty gave him a comfort with risk, and with that comfort came a willingness to place big bets.""It also imbued Kerkorian with a scrappiness. He even thought about becoming a professional boxer; he'd compiled a 33-4 record and won the Pacific Coast welterweight title as an amateur. While he may not have had a killer instinct, he certainly didn't lack confidence.Kerkorian was booked to fight a more experienced, undefeated boxer. After watching his opponent warm up in the ring, he called over his manager/brother Nish and said, ""I can't fight this guy."" Kerkorian wasn't afraid of his opponent, he was afraid he ""might hurt him.""His confidence was warranted. Kerkorian knocked him out within seconds of the first round. But boxing was probably not the best career choice. In a twist of fate and luck, his boss at the heating company where he worked took him along on a flying lesson and Kerkorian was hooked.He signed up for flying lessons, eventually became a flight instructor, and during World War II took on the dangerous task of ferrying RAF planes from Canada to Scotland. The flights required a stiff tailwind, and many aircraft (nearly including one Kerkorian piloted) didn't make it.After the war, he started a charter service that flew between Los Angeles and Las Vegas; Bugsy Siegel and John Wayne were regular customers. He saw a future in aviation and steadily expanded what started as Los Angeles Air Service into Trans International Airlines (TIA), a major supplemental carrier at the time.Kerkorian seemed to have a special wisdom to see deals where his contemporaries didn't. For example, when, after a rough landing, an insurance company declared a BOAC (a forerunner of British Airways) Constellation a total loss, Kerkorian offered $150,000 for it with the proviso the insurer throw in four new (or rebuilt) engines, which it gladly did.Kerkorian promptly leased the engines to TWA for $150,000, invested that amount in rebuilding the plane, and ultimately (after leasing it elsewhere) sold it to El Al for $750,000.It is the kind of deal Kerkorian repeated time and again. ""I think there was an instinct,"" Rempel said. ""He also did his homework. He didn't turn to advisors with MBAs. He searched (on his own) for things outside the common wisdom, looking for hidden assets.""In 1962, Kerkorian sold TIA to Studebaker in a deal valued at approximately $10 million — plus an approval-of-purchaser clause. By the following year, the automaker was in free fall, and its board tried to sell TIA to Continental Airlines. If successful, it would have impacted TIA employees' seniority and pensions. Kerkorian said no way. He would not leave in the lurch the employees who had been there for him in the beginning.""All he had growing up was family and the loyalty of friends,"" Rempel said. ""He put value in people.""So he agreed to purchase the airline back — for $2.5 million. He'd purchased a large parcel of land on the Las Vegas Strip with his share of the initial TIA sale, so he had to go into debt to repurchase the airline. He willingly put up every property he owned as collateral and covered the rest with his personal savings. He did this time and again, because, Rempel said, ""He didn't have an attachment to things. Things didn't matter. He didn't have toys growing up. He didn't even have the same house from one month to the next. Things were what he traded.""In 1968 he sold TIA again, this time to Transamerica Corp., but a last-minute hang-up, a technicality over a class of stock, threatened to squelch the deal. Kerkorian needed the proceeds to pursue his Las Vegas dreams, but wasn't prepared to net any less than the original amount agreed upon. So at the meeting where the final papers were to be signed, Kerkorian called it off and started to walk out. But he was stopped, and Transamerica adjusted the terms to the original level.That money was used to help build the International Hotel, at the time (1969) the largest hotel in the world. In subsequent years, he built even larger properties, the MGM Grand Hotel (1973) and the MGM Grand (1993), each the largest hotels in the world when they were constructed.While the mob may have started Las Vegas, it was Kerkorian's vision of the modern leisure industry that created its current incarnation.When we think of the marketing of Las Vegas as an ""entertainment center instead of just being known for gambling with ancillary activities, we forget that Kerkorian had been (an innovator) a long time before,"" noted Michael Green, an associate professor of history at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.""When (he) opened the International, it had two showrooms, not one. ... The hotel had a youth hostel and activities for young people. ... This is the kind of thing we might expect today, but not back then.""He recognized value in Vegas just as he did with his purchase of MGM. The studio was bleeding cash when he made a tender offer for 1 million shares — initially for $10 a share more than the stock was then selling for. It seemed to produce one bomb film after another. He considered the company's real estate, vast library of classic films (""Singing in the Rain,"" ""Wizard of Oz,"" ""Gone With the Wind"") and even its symbol, Leo the Lion, as unvalued assets.Kerkorian revealed another aspect of his personality in 1985, when he sold MGM to Ted Turner. Turner signed on to a deal that was unsustainable, so Kerkorian restructured it, helping Turner finance the purchase. He didn't want to squash Turner. CNN could have been KNN, but Kerkorian kept changing the deal to accommodate Turner's needs.""You see in his dealings with Ted Turner and others that a good deal is a deal that benefits both sides,"" Rempel said.Early in his career, Kerkorian sold a used DC-4 to Pacific Northern Airlines. The company's mechanics complained that the aircraft leaked so badly it posed a safety hazard even when parked on the ground. When the airline's executives protested, Kerkorian apologized, said he was unaware of the plane's condition and immediately returned the full purchase price without question.Certainly Kerkorian had setbacks in his career, but his reputation for honesty as personified by actions such as these made it so he was able to get multimillion-dollar loans on his signature alone.When he died in 2015, his estate was valued at around $4 billion, but not because he didn't try to give much of it away. Mostly anonymously, he gave millions to charities such as the American Red Cross. But following the devastating 1988 earthquake that hit his parents' native Armenia, he spearheaded and donated $1 billion to relief efforts.""His acts were pure charity,"" Rempel said. ""He felt it wasn't charity if you expect something in return. He didn't want his name on buildings and no credit for any gift.""Toward the end of his life, Rempel says, Kerkorian confided to a friend that he wanted ""to give it all away — and start over. He so much enjoyed making deals.""Deal maker who founded a charter airline and helped create the modern Las Vegas.Overcame: A poverty-stricken background and a lack of education.Lesson: Use your background as your strength.Quote: ""When you're a self-made man, you start very early in life. ... You get a drive that's a little stronger than somebody who inherited.""

32,EL,"Square (SQ) says Bitcoin had an ""immaterial"" impact on its fourth-quarter results, which topped expectations, but the digital payment processor is holding a ""small amount"" of the cryptocurrency on its balance sheet to help future transactions using its mobile ""Square Cash"" app.X In announcing its fourth-quarter results late Tuesday, Square said the Cash app had 7 million monthly active users in December. Square management added that it is absorbing the Bitcoin concept into its operations, albeit tentatively.Jack Dorsey, who serves as chief executive of both Square and Twitter (TWTR), said Bitcoin could have an impact going forward.""Bitcoin for us is not stopping at buying and selling. We do believe that this is a transformational technology for our industry and we're going to learn as quickly as possible. We also believe that it does provide an opportunity to get more people access to the financial system,"" he said, according to the Seeking Alpha transcript.During the fourth quarter, however, Bitcoin ""was really immaterial,"" said Chief Financial Officer Sarah Friar, according to a transcript provided at website Seeking Alpha.""We were just beginning with the product,"" Friar said. She called the bigger January rollout ""a really exciting milestone.""As for Square's balance sheet, Friar added: ""We've kept a very small amount of Bitcoin that's held by Square. That allows us to just add a little bit more liquidity as we are growing, but our intent is not to hold a lot of Bitcoin on the balance sheet.""For regular purposes, Square Cash is being used at locations such as McDonalds (MCD), Walmart (WMT), and ride-hailing service Uber, Square says.San Francisco-based Square in November began testing a Bitcoin exchange so that users of its Square Cash app could buy and sell the digital cryptocurrency.

33,EL,"Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) on Tuesday clocked a fourth-quarter same-store sales increase that just beat estimates, but the fast-casual Mexican chain sees 2018 comps decelerating from last year.X The forecast comes as analysts wait for new leadership to step in and offer clarity on how the company plans to rebound following a handful of food-safety scares over the past two-or-so years.Chipotle on Tuesday said was making ""good progress"" on its attempts to find a new CEO. The company said in November that it was looking for a new chief executive with ""demonstrated turnaround expertise"" to replace Steve Ells, who founded the company in 1993. Ells, Chipotle said, would become executive chairman once the search concluded.How that progress might sit with Wall Street remains unclear. Cowen analysts said in a research note this month that survey data indicate that Chipotle's ""quality as well as value perceptions are near trough levels both among the general population as well as the brand's core 18-34 year old consumer base.""""Upcoming efforts to improve these measures and in turn drive sales are unclear until a new CEO is hired,"" they added.The company on Tuesday forecast same-store sales gains in the ""low single digits"" this year, compared to a 6.4% boost seen in 2017.In a statement, Ells said that ""while there is still work to be done, we are starting to see some success,"" in the turnaround efforts.For the fourth quarter, Chipotle's same-store sales rose 0.9%, above Consensus Metric forecasts for a 0.7% gain. Revenue rose 7.3% to $1.1 billion, missing estimates for $1.117 billion.Chipotle earned $1.34 per share during the quarter, when factoring out a 21-cent per-share bump it got due to the GOP's tax legislation. That was better than views for $1.33.Shares rose 1.2% after hours in the stock market today, after rising in the minutes following the earnings' release.Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM), which reports Thursday, was unchanged after hours. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) picked up 0.5%. McDonald's (MCD), which reported earnings last week, rose 0.3%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.The company said it planned to invest more than a third of the savings resulting from the Trump tax cuts into its employees. CFO Jack Hartung said Chipotle would make its managers and crew eligible for one-time cash and stock bonuses, and improve other benefits.In the days leading up to Tuesday's earnings, some analysts wondered whether Chipotle would use the occasion to announce a new chief executive.Chipotle's stumbles have resulted in Monty Moran's departure from the role of co-CEO in 2016. The company has also shaken up its board and spent more to strengthen its safety standards. It has focused on new menu products and ways to improve traffic and the experience of dining there overall.The launch of Queso didn't do as much for sales as expected, although the company changed the recipe after customers complained that it had an off-putting, grainy texture. Chipotle also faces more competition from smaller rivals that have used the Chipotle formula — serving food marketed as higher quality on an assembly-line format — for their own success, Cowen said.Already, as Nomura-Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote last month, two ""dream candidates"" for the CEO job at Chipotle had apparently been ruled out.Domino's Pizza (DPZ) CEO Patrick Doyle, who will step down from that position in June, had been seen as one potential candidate. But at the company's investor day in January, Doyle suggested the speculation about what he'll do post-Domino's wasn't close to accurate.""There are all sorts of conspiracy theories out there on what I'm going to do and every single one of them is incorrect,"" he said.Ron Shaich, the former CEO of Panera Bread who was also a rumored candidate, was perhaps bit more direct, tweeting: ""why in the world would I ever leave Panera to go try to solve Chipotle's problems?""YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Options Play Helped Control Earnings Risk With Restaurant BrandsJack In The Box Sells Qdoba In Hot Year For Restaurant MergersDomino's Pizza Shows Improved Relative Strength; Still Shy Of Benchmark

36,EL,"A solid concentration in top-performing stocks, including Facebook (FB,) Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Bank of America (BAC), and a strong fund management team have helped Fidelity Advisor New Insights Fund (FNIAX) beat the S&P 500 and its large-growth Morningstar category in the past one, three and five years.X Those leading stocks, along with Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), account for nearly a fifth of the $30 billion fund's assets.Since its inception in 2003, New Insights has been managed by the legendary Will Danoff, who ran it identically to its widely followed $134 billion Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX). In 2013, John Roth, who also manages $8 billion Fidelity Mid-Cap Stock (FMCSX), joined as co-manager, bringing with him his midcap expertise. Since late 2015, Danoff and Roth have been splitting the management of the fund 60%-40%.The fund focuses on companies that have strong growth prospects, solid management teams and whose potential is misperceived by the public.""If we think Facebook can sustain 30% growth for longer than people think, or we see Mark Zuckerberg's genius ultimately being applied to Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, video ... we're not seeing anything that other people may not see, but we think the good news will last longer,"" Danoff told IBD.Having two managers may well be the reason why New Insights is more diversified at the top than Contrafund with top 5 holdings representing 17.3% vs. Contrafund's 24.1%. In addition, 26.7% and 37.9% of each fund's assets are in the top 10 holdings, further drawing the distinction.New Insight also holds nearly 10% more midcaps, is somewhat underweight technology and has a lower overweight in financials vs. the benchmark and its peers than Contrafund. Both sectors have been strong performers in the past several years.As a result, New Insight's performance has been trailing a bit that of Contrafund's, returning 22.91%, 11.89% and 14.35% the last one, three and five years vs. Contrafund's 27%, 13.45% and 15.92%. Both funds pulled back slightly in the recent, albeit short, market correction, but quickly recovered ground and are up 5.44% and 6.57%, respectively vs. the S&P 500's 2.41% year to date.Regarding concerns that we're late in the economic cycle, Danoff notes the differences between now and conditions that led to bear markets like 2008-09.""The starting point (after the crisis) was quite drastic,"" said Danoff. ""So even though we've had this long economic expansion, I don't feel like people are high-fiving themselves. Up until very recently, most companies were managing their costs conservatively and controlling their capital spending. ... The world is much more global, U.S. companies are able now to sell their products all over the world and the big companies in the S&P 500 are now much less capital intensive, so they're high margin, high growth and they're highly cash generative.""But it's not just the top hot stocks that determine a fund's longevity and strong performance. Other winning names include Adobe Systems (ADBE), Netflix (NFLX), PayPal (PYPL), Visa (V), Estee Lauder (EL), Activision Blizzard (ATVI) and United Health (UNH), each of which soared between 40% and 87% last year, compared with the S&P 500's 21.8% return.Netflix, which the fund has owned since early 2015, has been benefiting from a strong international momentum for its brand and stronger-than-expected subscriber additions in the U.S. and overseas."" Netflix is crushing it overseas,"" said Danoff. ""They have some pricing power, the service is outstanding and it's a subscription model offering great value.""The top name for creative design programs, Adobe has successfully transitioned to a recurring revenue model by moving its product lineup to the cloud. Last month, the company said that its longtime CFO Mark Garrett will be retiring, though he'll stay on until they find a replacement. Adobe's earnings jumped at least 40% in each the past four quarters, while revenue increased 22% to 27%. The company also raised its fiscal Q1 and 2018 guidance after adjusting for President Trump's tax cuts. Adobe's stock is up 12.5% year to date.Cosmetics giant Estee Lauder has been experiencing strong growth. Its most recent Q2 results saw a 25% EPS rise on sales that grew 17%, primarily driven by strong advances in its skin care product lineup. Analysts expect the company to grow its market share from a current 15% as the company further builds out its e-commerce business. It also stands to benefit from the recent tax reforms. The stock is up 9.8% this year.Customer relationship software maker Salesforce.com (CRM), which rallied 49.3% last year and has risen 6.6% so far in 2018, stands to benefit from a growing product offering and low customer attrition despite strong competition in the sector. The company earnings accelerated in the past two quarters, jumping 63% in the most recent one. Sales grew 25%. Salesforce.com also raised its 2018 sales guidance to $12.5 billion and plans to reach $20 billion by fiscal 2022. Earnings guidance was also upped. It is due to release its next earnings report Feb. 28.In the midcap arena, the fund holds names such as Under Armour (UA), U.K.-based Metro Bank and LogMeIn (LOGM). The fund bought Under Armour last quarter as a starting position and Roth says they'll continue to work on it going forward.""It's a great brand, the stock got to be pretty expensive and expectations were pretty high, they struggled a bit and they got massively re-priced, the Street turned on them and investors turned on them, and then it became an interesting opportunity. ... The ultimate bet is that brand's still good.""RELATED:In A Volatile Market: Go To Cash Or Stay The Course?

But lost in all the for-the-TV-cameras outrage is what former President Obama and wanna-be-president-so-bad Hillary Clinton think of some Americans and where they live. They believe the sh!tholes are in America and consider the people who live in them to be sh!tholes themselves.X Before we get too far, let's concede that whatever language Trump used, he is largely correct, even if he was vulgar in his description — a charge he denies, by the way. Millions in miserable countries want to immigrate to the U.S. where life is far better. They want to escape the lousy and intolerable conditions. It's human nature.Let's allow Reason's Nick Gillespie explain it with a little more color.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth Perspective""Most immigrants who come to America do indeed come from places they'd rather not live or work. . . . Whether their homelands are technically shitholes or something less offensive to contemporary ears isn't really a question. People come here because they think it's going to be better than where they're from.""Now back to the disrespectful Obama and Hillary Clinton comments that neither the media, nor the shrieking Democrats, nor the childish celebrity class made much over when they were said. Of course that's because they were said by the darlings of those groups, the objects of their adolescent adoration.First, we have the comments Obama made in 2008  about demoralized middle Americans while at a campaign fundraiser in, of course, San Francisco.""It's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""The Hoover Institution's Victor Davis Hanson was nearly perfect in his assessment of the comments when he said that Obama was seeking ""to reinvent the country into two groups,"" one of them ""the 'lazy' Americans who in times of economic stress 'typically' revealed their innate ignorance through racism and nativism.""The reaction, or lack of reaction, from the media, Democrats and celebrities was similar to the silence that followed when at a 2016 fundraiser, near-president Hillary called half of Trump's supporters a ""basket of deplorables."" A day later she said she regretted using the word ""half"" — did she mean to use ""all""? — but everyone knew who she was talking about and exactly what she meant. In her mind, at least half of Trump's supporters were lowbrow crackers living in fetid places.The insults of both were directed toward a group that can be ridiculed with impunity in today's culture. Obama, Clinton and others seem to forget that they are Americans. They are though, and they deserve more respect than to be thought of as s*!tholes.Click here for more Commentary and Opinion from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market?

54,EL,"Glen W. Bell Jr. wasn't one to move with the rest of the pack in the nascent days of the fast-food industry.While burgers were the standard fare at stands like McDonald's Drive-In in the early 1950s, Bell opted to introduce the American consumer to Mexican food.""An innovative product will set you apart,"" said Bell (1923-2010), the founder of Taco Bell and pioneer of the Mexican chain fast-food segment, in ""Taco Titan: The Glen Bell Story,"" a 1999 biography by Debra Lee Baldwin.That was his goal when in 1951 he added homemade crisp-shelled tacos to the menu of his Bell's Burgers stand (it also served hot dogs) located in a Hispanic neighborhood in San Bernardino, Calif. — at 19 cents a pop.Bell recalled the response of his first taco customer: "" 'That was good. Gimme another.' Right then I knew we had a winner.""From those humble beginnings, Bell laid the groundwork for Taco Bell, which he started in 1962, serving what his customers called 'Tay-Kohs.'Armed with determination, resourcefulness and a strong entrepreneurial spirit, Bell not only transformed Taco Bell into a restaurant dynamo, he also revolutionized the chain restaurant business by pioneering and popularizing a new category — the Mexican quick-service restaurant — which Taco Bell continues to dominate.Today, Taco Bell is a subsidiary of Yum Brands (YUM) and the No. 1 Mexican-inspired quick-service restaurant brand. Taco Bell represents approximately 30% of Yum's operating profit, according to Yum. Last year, system sales (includes results of company-owned and franchise restaurants) rose 6% to $9.66 billion, including the 53rd week.""The Mexican chain fast-food market was Bell's creation,"" Darren Tristano, food service trend expert and advisor to Technomic, a food industry research and consulting firm, told IBD. ""He looked at the niche of tacos, which at the time wasn't a big mass food opportunity, and really built that business. He brought tacos (and Mexican fare) to the American consumer in the chain restaurant (venue).""Taco Bell remains a giant in its field. The size of Taco Bell ""dwarfs"" every other Mexican fast-food chain in the category, which also includes Taco John's and Del Taco Restaurants, Tristano says.Taco Bell's menu today includes various types of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos and other related items.Bell began formulating his recipe for success as a leader as he ventured on the path to overcome financial woes as a youth and as he pursued his goal to start a restaurant business.At every juncture, with every experiment, setback and win, Bell learned what he called his ""recipes for success"" — 60 lessons outlined in his biography.His first two recipes were key ingredients for running his restaurant chains and important to his success:""You build a business one customer at a time. In the early days, I never closed when there was a customer waiting even though I had put in 12 hours and was eager to go home. … One happy customer is worth his weight in gold.""Find the right product, then find a way to mass-produce it. When I had my hamburger stand, similar takeout stands were spreading all over San Bernardino. If my business was to survive and grow, I would have to apply what I knew about quick service to a different product.""That's where the taco came in. Key to Bell's success was the way he ran Taco Bell's operations, says Dan Jones, who owns four Taco Bell franchises in California — two in Long Beach, one in Azusa and one in Montebello. Jones started at Taco Bell in 1965, running its original restaurant in Downey, Calif.""He was really concerned about the quality of the food, the customer service and cleanliness of the restaurants,"" Jones told IBD. He was very strict on operations. (The franchisees) were motivated by that. We knew the standards by which Taco Bell was supposed to run.""Franchisees knew how to run a restaurant profitably by allocating certain food, payroll and other costs according to certain percentages set by these standards, Jones says.If a franchisee was not following the standards, Bell would send troubleshooters to help them with their operational problems.Jones, who worked in various posts at the Taco Bell corporate level for 11 years and has been a franchisee since 1976, describes Bell as a ""mild-mannered and gentle man"" who never raised his voice.Bell created a culture where he motivated by setting a good example.""You wanted to work for him to grow the company,"" Jones said. ""He was the most honorable person I ever met and an awesome guy to work for.""The franchisees put in 60 hours a week because they ""loved being part of a dynamic company,"" Jones says.In the early years, he was active in helping franchisees. For example, if someone had a low-volume store, Bell would do something like lower the rent or reduced the royalty.Bell also hired people to whom he could delegate responsibility.""Find people who know things you don't,"" he said in his biography. ""I'm an entrepreneur, not an administrator. Taco Bell prospered because I recognized my limitations, hired professional managers to make up for them, and knew when to let go.""Another recipe for success: ""Respect your competitors and learn from them. At first, no one, not even the McDonald brothers, fully recognized the potential of fast food. But we did know, because of the customers' response, we were onto something. We experimented and continually made changes. Our 'market research' was to observe our competitors and to borrow their best ideas.""Bell learned a lot eyeing other entrepreneurs and competitors, especially the McDonald brothers.""One thing I learned from the McDonald brothers is don't sell everything your customers ask for,"" Bell said. ""Decide what you're going to sell, then make it the best it can be.""When Bell came up with the idea to sell tacos at his Bell's Burgers in 1951, he needed to develop the recipe for the best taco — one that could be made and served quickly and was good to eat. At the time, tacos served in Mexican restaurants were made with soft tortillas. Bell wanted tortillas that were ""delicately crisp"" and ready to be filled. After weeks of experimentation, Bell developed a crisp-shelled taco that was quick to assemble and tasty.Tristano calls Bell a visionary. ""The biggest trend he recognized was that Mexicans were immigrating to this country, and there was an opportunity to feed them,"" he said. ""More importantly, he Americanized Mexican food in a way he was able to create demand for his product from the American consumer.""Before Taco Bell started expanding throughout the country, no one knew what Mexican food was, says Jones, who was a franchisee consultant at the time the first Taco Bell in Florida opened.At the time, people didn't know what they were eating or even how to pronounce the names of the food on the menu, Jones says. But that didn't stop the Florida eatery from being a success.""The food was great,' Jones said. ""We couldn't make tacos fast enough.""After Florida, Bell pushed Taco Bell's expansion across the country.Bell was also a visionary in identifying the void in the market for more exotic multicultural fast food.Bell developed Taco Bell during a time when the burger market was taking off with McDonald's (MCD) and Burger King.Bell focused on franchising. ""This was his way of building an empire in a very short time span,"" Tristano said. ""Franchising has proven to be a strong growth vehicle, especially in fast food. Access to capital wasn't as common back then. He was able to build stores without having to operate them or finance them.""The first Taco Bell franchise opened in Torrance, Calif., in 1965. Bell's first venture in the restaurant business was in 1948, when he opened Bell's Drive-In, in San Bernardino. The idea to build a restaurant came to him after he studied the success of the McDonald brothers and their namesake burger drive-ins first founded in San Bernardino.Between 1954 and 1955, Bell and a business partner built three drive-thru taco stands in Southern California called Taco Tia. Bell's partner wasn't in favor of expanding Taco Tia into Los Angeles. Bell sold his interests in the taco stands. Later in the 1950s Bell and a new group of partners opened a chain called El Taco, which Bell also sold his interests in.Taco Bell went public in 1970.In 1978, Bell sold 868 Taco Bell restaurants to PepsiCo (PEP). PepsiCo spun out Taco Bell and its other restaurant chains in late 1997 to Tricon Global Restaurants. With the purchase of two other chains, Tricon Global restaurants changed its name to Yum Brands in 2002.Bell was born in Lynwood, Calif. At 16, with his family struggling financially, Bell ""rode the rails"" across America looking for work, according to his biography. Bell joined the Marine Corps in 1943, and served in the Pacific. While in Guadalcanal, his job was to serve meals to high-ranking officers.That's where he gleaned one of his key recipes for success:""Any job is an opportunity to learn. You would think that serving food to generals in Guadalcanal wouldn't have much relevance later on. But it taught me how to estimate how much food was needed based on the number of people served. That knowledge gave me confidence to start a restaurant.""Pioneered and popularized Mexican quick-service restaurantOvercame: The competition from the burger-chain giants to convince American consumers to eat Mexican fast foodLesson: Learn from your wins, setbacks and experiments.""An innovative product will set you apart.""

56,EL,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) caught an upgrade Thursday following its Kite Pharma buyout and the likelihood its new CAR-T cancer medications will allow it to diversify away from its maturing hepatitis C franchise.X Maxim Group analyst Jason McCarthy upgraded Gilead to a buy rating from hold. He has a 94 price target on the stock which, by the closing bell on the stock market today, advanced 1.5% to finish at 74.78.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own extracted immune system cells. They are reprogrammed to seek and destroy cancer cells before being reintroduced to the patient. Due to their nature, it can take weeks to manufacture these drugs.But a visit to a Kite manufacturing facility in China left McCarthy impressed. The entire process takes 16-18 days for Gilead/Kite's CAR-T drugs. Kite's facility in El Segundo, Calif., can handle 4,000 patient treatments per year.A program called Kite Konnect gives healthcare providers, patients and Gilead access to real-time tracking of the CAR-T process. Production is now semi-automated. Gilead has plans to automate production in the future to increase capacity and decrease costs.""We were impressed and left clear with the notion that Gilead (and Kite) can overcome manufacturing challenges to commercialize in the U.S. and globally, especially China, this new innovative therapy,"" he said in a note to clients.Now's the time to buy Gilead, McCarthy said. Investors get access to the recently-bought CAR-T drugs for free plus Gilead's hepatitis C franchise. Gilead's hepatitis C drugs set records for being among the strongest drug launches in history.IBD'S TAKE: Novartis was first to cross the finish line with its CAR-T therapy, but others are on its tail. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown on the growing CAR-T market and which competitors are set to turn that market on its head.In more recent years, though, the hepatitis C unit has struggled as the market matures amid high cure rates. Now, the market is entering its fourth year and comparisons are getting easier, McCarthy said.""What's important is not to lose sight of the fact that Gilead had $2.7 billion in free cash flow last quarter,"" he said.Buying into CAR-T helps diversify Gilead. Gilead finished acquiring Kite in October, just before the Food and Drug Administration approved Kite's drug known as Yescarta, for some adults with some large B-cell lymphomas. Approvals are also expected in Europe, China and Japan.McCarthy expects Gilead to generate more than $5 billion in the coming years with a global presence in late-stage B-cell cancer. Further, CAR-T therapies are now being integrated with other forms of cancer treatment.""Kite could be the first that keeps on giving,"" he said.But Gilead isn't alone with its CAR-T offering. Novartis (NVS) was first to gain approval with a drug called Kymriah, approved to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in some patients up to age 25.Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are also partnered with Celgene (CELG) to develop their own CAR-T therapies.RELATED:Why Amgen Could Have An Edge Over These Rivals In Preventing MigrainesHow Celgene, Gilead's Pricing Woes Continue To Haunt Biotech StocksDow Stock Merck Topples After Withdrawing Keytruda Application In Europe

57,EL,"Climate Hysteria: With climate change activists and the big media still in high dudgeon over President Trump pulling out of the Paris Climate Deal, yet another study shows no acceleration in global warming for the last 23 years. Piece by piece, the church of global warming is being dismantled.The University of Alabama-Huntsville study, conducted by climate scientists John Christy and Richard McNider, shows that not only is the temperature rising far more slowly than predicted, but that the Earth's atmosphere appears to be less sensitive to changing CO2 levels than previously assumed.How do the study's authors know this? They corrected a mistake that many other studies and model forecasts leave uncorrected: First, they used only satellite data, the most comprehensive and accurate temperature numbers available.No Hidden Agenda: Get News From A Pro-Free Market, Pro-Growth PerspectiveThen, they took out the temporary, yet significant, impact of both volcanoes and the El Niño and La Niña climate episodes that periodically wreak havoc on weather around the world.Once removing the influence of those naturally occurring events,  the study's authors were able to come up with a stable base temperature for the world. Doing this, they found that the rate of global warming currently was 0.096 degrees Celsius per decade — exactly what it was 23 years ago.This casts serious doubts on the dozens of models used in coming up with the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's dire forecast of massive global warming based on rising levels of CO2 in the atmosphere, mainly from human activity.XGiven that CO2 levels have risen sharply in recent decades but the pace of warming has remained essentially the same suggests that CO2 doesn't have the warming effect that many models assume.Rick Moran, writing at the American Thinker, puts it this way: ""The UAH paper destroys the models that predict rising temps that correlate with rising CO2 levels.""Yep. And it means that the U.N.'s prescription for this surge in CO2 — the massive downsizing of the global economy and the imposition of rigid socialist planning on all industrial economies — is nothing more than quackery, the worst kind of medicine.But it's the science that is important. Recent analytical studies of global warming models used for the U.N. predictions have found they tend to ""run hot"" — that is, predict far more warming than actually occurs. This study goes a long way to explaining why.And over time, the difference in temperature estimates is enormous. Going all the way back to 1880, the study notes that most climate models predict nearly 4.1 degrees Fahrenheit rise in temperatures. But the calculated value from the actual data are less than half that, 2 degrees F.And by the way, this is a published, peer-reviewed journal study, not a bunch of estimates from questionable mathematical models that were created to serve a political purpose, not a scientific one. It is of course in the interest of the researchers and the governments that fund them to find catastrophic global warming. And that's exactly what they do.Sadly, this is yet another study that the media will, for the most part, ignore. That's especially true since Christy, a scientist with an impeccable reputation, is known for poking holes in the global warming religion's dogma.At some point,the left-leaning big media will be forced to recognize the growing evidence of the global warming fraud — just as the holier-than-thou media have in recent days had to come to grips with the tragic reality that the media outlets they work for are filled with serial sexual predators.RELATED:Global Warming And Climate Change: Facts And Fiction Global Warming: Who Are The Deniers Now? N.Y.

58,EL,"A rising generation of advisors grew up with cutting-edge technology. Now they're using it to reach their target market.XAcross America, young, diverse advisors seek to win over communities that have rarely sought out financial planners. To market themselves, these advisors are harnessing social media and other technologies in new ways.By definition, niche marketing involves narrowly focused outreach. Social media enables advisors to reach a small subset of the general population that they're ideally suited to serve.Can Tech Tools Help Millennials Avoid A Looking Retirement Crisis?Mulichannel Strategy Is needed To Reach Mobile-Toting ClientsStrides In CRM, Artifical Intelligence Software Hold Promise For AdvisorsPursuing Target Markets In New WaysBrian Thompson, a certified financial planner in Chicago, launched his firm in 2016 with an emphasis on advising gay professionals. He has sought to build visibility by designing a website geared to his audience.""The website screams that this is the right place if you're looking for an advisor who looks like you and reflects what you're looking for,"" Thompson said. ""I use very deliberate language to signal safety to the people I'm targeting.""To capitalize on content marketing, Thompson writes a blog and aims to add video and audio elements to his website. His goal is to make it easy for LGBTQ consumers to discover his firm online.""People are very specific in what they're searching for (on the internet),"" he said. ""So I have to keep current on trends in social media and search engine optimization rather than get complacent.""Advisors are learning that they can use online content not just to showcase their expertise, but also to engage prospects and learn from them. By inviting comments on their blog posts, educational videos and podcasts, advisors can gain a better understanding of their followers and hone in on their needs.Advisors who market themselves to underserved communities often expand their social media horizons. They may experiment with different tools and test the results.Jiyao Xu, a Los Angeles-based certified financial planner, seeks to attract young Chinese professionals in the U.S. He recently created a profile of his newly opened firm using WeChat, and he shares it with his friends and online followers.IBD'S TAKE: If you want to understand the state of the market, pay attention to the major averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (take a free trial) for timely market analysis and highlighted growth stocks breaking out of proper bases.While he's still assessing WeChat's effectiveness in helping him gain clients, Xu is harnessing technology in other facets of his business. He uses MailChimp for his newsletter and Squarespace to design his firm's website.""It's very hard to reach the people that I want to reach,"" Xu said. ""I'd love more tools to help me reach Chinese professionals living in the U.S. of a certain age and income. So I'm doing lots of pro bono stuff like public education events"" instead of relying solely on social media marketing.To reach their target market, advisors like Xu combine high-tech and high-touch outreach strategies. In October, Xu volunteered to educate consumers at a ""Financial Planning Day"" event in Los Angeles.Similarly, Mark Boujikian regularly conducts educational sessions at local libraries that are free and open to the public. A certified financial planner in Rolling Hills Estates, Calif., Boujikian wants to raise consumers' financial literacy — and build his business in the process.While Boujikian resides in a seemingly affluent area, he says that many locals are ""property rich but have minimal retirement assets and low cash flow."" He seeks to educate them about financial matters and win some of them as clients.""They may need an advisor but either don't have the means to hire one or they're insulated by a language barrier,"" he said.In 2017, he has led 18 sessions in nearby libraries. They consist of a 45-minute PowerPoint presentation followed by Q&A. The talks attract 35 to 40 attendees on average, he says, and he offers a free follow-up consultation.""About 90% accept my offer so that can mean 30 or more meetings with each one lasting 90 minutes,"" Boujikian said. ""It's a lot of time, but I typically get two to three clients out of it.""In tracing social media's evolution, Boujikian sees more opportunity to connect with people to educate rather than sell to them. He expects online resources to feature what he calls ""more financial hacks — tips and tools to bring people together to learn and improve their financial literacy.""Like many advisors eager to teach and inform, Boujikian is passionate about spreading financial wisdom to a wider audience. That's especially important when certain segments of the population resist or express skepticism.Miguel Gomez, a certified financial planner in El Paso, Texas, faces what he calls ""an uphill battle"" in convincing some members of the Hispanic community to hire an advisor. He says that many of them lack trust in financial institutions and stash cash at home.""Technology has given me a voice to educate, to tell people it's OK to invest,"" Gomez said. His uses Facebook to post information and both Zoom and GoToMeeting to conduct remote conferences.RELATED:Advisors Gain Edge As Anti-Fraud Advocates

64,EL,"Want to know how MFS Growth Fund (MFEGX) outperformed 75% of its large-cap growth peers this year? Look at its portfolio, rich in leaders, featuring the entire cast of FAANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Netflix (NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — as of Sept. 30. Their year-to-date gains range from Alphabet's 34% to Netflix's 59%.XThose FAANG stocks help make technology the $16.6 billion fund's largest sector, with a 28% weighting. Among the fund's other tech stocks are big contributors such as digital media and marketing software firm Adobe Systems (ADBE) and graphics-chip maker Nvidia (NVDA). Those two are up 79% and 96% respectively.The fund's diversification helps too. Big contributors include nontech names like cosmetics maker Estee Lauder (EL), which is up 61% this year. All together, the fund was up 29.4% in 2017 going into Thursday, according to Morningstar Direct.That's well above its 2.21% gain for all of 2016. ""We were doing well for most of 2016, but (we) lost a lot of ground in November on the 'Trump Trade,' "" said co-manager Paul Gordon. He was referring to the late 2016 stock market rally in which many investors favored lower-quality, more-cyclical stocks that they expected would benefit from policies enacted by a Republican White House and Congress.But the fund caught up big-time when investors started favoring growth stocks at the beginning of the year.The fund's performance relative to its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Direct has slipped somewhat in the past three months too. ""September '17 was a lighter version of the same (low-quality, cycle-focused) trade on the prospects of tax reform, which set us back a little that month,"" added Gordon. ""However, we maintain our focus on owning cross-cycle, above-average growers.""That translates into seeking stocks whose growth is above average and is sustainable no matter which way the political winds blow. ""We are looking for stocks that can grow earnings and free cash flow at rates above the market's growth for the long duration,"" Gordon said, referring to himself and co-managers Eric Fischman and Matthew Sabel.Gordon likes the long runway that he sees still in front of Nvidia. ""The thesis here is that Nvidia is exposed to some of the areas of technology with the largest potential addressable markets, and they have strong competitive market strengths in each,"" Gordon said.Nvidia chips have been popular in gaming, which provides about 60% of the firm's sales, Gordon says. In addition, data center operators have seen in recent years that strings of GPUs (graphics processing units) can power their computer needs more efficiently than regular CPUs, so now Nvidia's GPUs are being used in high-performance data centers, machine learning and driverless automobile functions.""Growth has accelerated in their data center business as well as in their autonomous-driving business,"" Gordon said. ""Nvidia has leadership in each. And it's able to spend to build share in each.""Adobe's earnings per share (EPS) growth has accelerated, rising 42%, 44% and 47% in the past three quarters.Gordon likes the stock's strategic position. ""We like the market they're in and their transition to subscriber selling (from legacy software),"" Gordon said. ""It expands the number of people who've bought the product, it reduces piracy, it makes revenue more recurring and it improves free cash flow conversion.""Gordon likes the firm's rate and duration of growth, which he says should lead to higher incremental margins.IBD'S TAKE: You can see how Adobe's strengths — like its 48% three-year EPS growth rate — stack up against its peers' at the stock's easy-to-read IBD Stock Checkup page.Netflix EPS grew at a triple-digit clip in three of the past four quarters. The fund has built its stake in recent portfolio disclosures.Gordon expects the internet content distributor to keep doing good things in the near term. ""They've been able to offer an incredible amount of content at attractive prices,"" he said. ""So they've done a tremendous job of raising their subscriber base in the U.S. and internationally. That's led to an ability to get pricing (increases) because they provide value.""Gordon added, ""We think there are still huge opportunities for (their subscriber) number to grow in the coming year.""Amazon is another name in which the fund has boosted its stake in recent disclosures. He likes both halves of its business. ""We think of Amazon as almost two companies within one,"" he said, citing Amazon Web Services and the firm's e-commerce side. ""We see potential for both businesses to be much bigger down the road.""Nor is Gordon antsy about Amazon's hefty investment spending. ""Amazon has always spent and typically run fairly low margins, and it's paid off over time,"" he said. ""It's an area to watch. But they have earned the trust of investors that their investments will pay off in time as future market-share gains.""Facebook is a third name in which the fund has been building its stake. ""The core Facebook business is still growing at a high rate,"" he said. ""And they've only started to monetize businesses like Instagram and WhatsApp.""Facebook has also positively surprised many investors. ""About a year ago they guided that the core business could decelerate as they slowed ad loads — ads that you see in Facebook streaming.

71,EL,"Gilead Sciences (GILD) jumped early Thursday after the Food and Drug Administration approved what is known as a CAR-T drug, dubbed Yescarta, to treat an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.XThe late Wednesday approval follows two weeks after Gilead closed its acquisition of Kite Pharma, which developed the drug, and after Novartis' (NVS) CAR-T drug was approved in late August, making it the first of its class to win approval.By the closing bell on the stock market today, Gilead climbed 2% to close at 81.59. Shares are currently forming a flat base with an 86.36 entry.CAR-T drugs are made using a patient's own immune cells. The cells are extracted, reprogrammed to fight cancer and are then reintroduced to the patient's body. Juno Therapeutics (JUNO) and Bluebird Bio (BLUE) are also working on CAR-T drugs in partnerships with Celgene (CELG).Gilead's drug is approved to treat adult patients with what's known as large B-cell lymphoma after two or more previous treatments. This includes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common form of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, accounting for three out of five cases, Gilead says.IBD'S TAKE: A Washington, D.C.-based expert expects President Donald Trump to sign an executive order to bring down drug prices ""any day."" That could make things harder for biotechs and drugmakers. Head to IBD Industry Themes for a breakdown.There are an estimated 7,500 patients with hard-to-treat diffuse large B-cell lymphoma eligible for CAR-T therapy, Gilead says. The FDA estimates that of 72,000 cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosed each year, roughly 25,000 are new cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.Yescarta is ""a new option for patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma who have run out of treatment options and face a dire prognosis,"" said Louis DeGennaro, chief executive of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, in a statement.RBC analyst Brian Abrahams says Gilead is at the beginning of what could be a ""potential multibillion-dollar franchise."" The approval came a month ahead of expectations, demonstrating the high unmet need in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, he said in a note to clients.Gilead is pricing Yescarta at $373,000, which is below the $475,000 price tag for Novartis' drug, Kymriah. Kymriah was approved in late August to treat a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients age 25 and younger.Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, though, notes that Novartis is taking an outcome-based approach to pricing with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services in which the firm will only be paid for patients who respond within one month of treatment with Kymriah.""Based on the 83% response rate in their pivotal trial, we estimate the real list price to be less than $394,000 per treatment, placing Yescarta at a less than 5% discount to Novartis' drug on a net price basis,"" he wrote in a note to clients.RBC's Abrahams estimates that Gilead will pull in $90 million in 2018 on a gradual launch. He expects Yescarta sales to grow to at least $1 billion by 2026 solely as a third treatment in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. But CAR-T drugs are being investigated to treat a myriad of blood cancers.""If we increase pricing and assumed approval in all indications (second treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, pediatric and adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia), in our current model, we could see $2.7 billion in peak revenue potential,"" he said.Leerink's Porges is less bullish on Gilead. Yescarta's list price is higher than he expected, but Gilead's core business is still facing competitive challenges and patent expiries. He kept his market perform rating on the stock.Getting the most out of its Kite acquisition will require expanding Yescarta's use, Porges said.""The announcement does not provide the justification for the premium Gilead paid for Kite's cellular therapy platform,"" he said. ""Gilead is depending on broadening to earlier lines of treatment, expanding to other indications and development of additional products to generate an adequate return on the acquisition.""The label for Yescarta warns of cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities. The former is associated with flulike symptoms including fever. Cytokine release syndrome was seen in 94% of patients in clinical trials, with more-severe cases in 13% of patients.In comparison, the label for Novartis' Kymriah notes that the more-severe cytokine release syndrome occurred in 49% of patients, Porges said.Due to the potential for cytokine release syndrome and neurological toxicities, Yescarta is available only through a restricted program called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. This means facilities administering the drug must be certified and abide by specific rules for administration.The program requires that two doses of an immunosuppressive drug be available prior to Yescarta infusion. Patients must be monitored at a facility for a week following treatment for signs of cytokine release syndrome. Follow-up monitoring is required for four weeks after infusion.Ultimately, Gilead plans to have 70 to 90 U.S. medical centers capable of administering Yescarta. The drug has a median turnaround time of 17 days and a 99% manufacturing-success rate from a facility in El Segundo, Calif, Gilead said.RELATED:6 Top Biotech Companies In Innovation Earn Recognition In New AwardsHow Novartis' Cancer Approval Validates Gilead's $11.9 Billion Kite DealAnalysts Mixed On Gilead-Kite, But One Key Rival Stands To Benefit

But new CEO Gregg Lowe's discussion of turnaround plans with analysts during the conference call sparked a rally that sent shares past a 29.94 buy point in a cup-with-handle base formed deep within a multiyear correction.On the IBD 50 list, China's Jupai Holdings (JP) remained unstoppable, soaring more than 6% and giving it a 154% gain following an August breakout.Another China-based name, Autohome (ATHM), hammered out a 4% gain after Credit Suisse initiated coverage on the stock with an outperform rating and a 70.80 price target.

74,EL,"Kite Pharma is edging closer to approval for a cutting-edge cancer treatment that fights the disease by rebuilding a patient's own cells — a technology that could benefit thousands of people and pave the way for blockbuster drugs.XKite's ultracustomized treatment is a key entry in an area of great promise in cancer research and has attracted about a dozen drugmakers, including Bluebird Bio (BLUE), Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), Celgene (CELG) and Novartis (NVS). The latter got a major FDA approval in August, giving Novartis the lead in this emerging field.Those firms and others are developing their own cancer-fighting systems that harness the same underlying process used by Kite, which is now a unit of Gilead Sciences (GILD). The approach, called CAR-T therapy, uses bioengineering to retrain a patient's infection-fighting white blood cells to seek out and destroy cancer cells.Analysts say Kite's manufacturing process stands out in the CAR-T field for its shorter turnaround time to treatment and success rate.For Kite's groundbreaking work, Investor's Business Daily named the company an IBD Biotech Innovator in the inaugural edition of the awards.How IBD Chose The Biotech Innovator Award Winners: IBD asked equity analysts, ETF and mutual fund managers and university professors to identify the top biotech companies based on their innovative research. We asked them to focus on companies with pioneering drugs likely to launch in the next several years and reach blockbuster, or near-blockbuster, sales of $1 billion or more a year. The award winners selected by IBD editors are the six most-cited companies. To find profiles of all the award winners and details of their work, go to our full Biotech Innovators special report.)David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer, told IBD that current cell therapies are ""just the beginning … . This is an area that's really set up to undergo big changes over the next few years.And Kite has recently enlisted a powerful ally.In late August, Gilead of Foster City, Calif., agreed to acquire Santa Monica, Calif.-based Kite for $180 a share in an all-cash deal valued at $11.9 billion. The deal closed Oct. 3. Kite already was trading at all-time highs, near 140, since the start of summer, after going public at $17 a share in mid-2014. Gilead stock rose above 86 from about 75 after the companies announced their merger, but closed Friday at 81.17.The alliance brings Kite an established partner with financial heft and industry breadth just as the biotech ingenue prepares to beef up production and distribution of its flagship drug.That treatment — axi-cel, short for axicabtagene ciloleucel — is designed to fight an aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer affecting the immune system that is the sixth most common cancer in the U.S. Kite is expected to get drug approval this year.Gilead is hitching its star to Kite with expectations of gaining a string of successful cancer-fighting products at a time when Gilead's strongest portfolio of medications, for treating hepatitis C, is losing steam.Kite expects the manufacturing process it honed to develop axi-cel will serve as the foundation for future treatments, including those to destroy solid cancer tumors and cancers of the cervix, head and neck.Pharmaceutical companies typically look to fill out their product pipelines by acquiring companies with a technology they don't have. That's where Gilead's purchase of Kite comes in.""It wasn't just a 'one and done' kind of an acquisition. … It was more of a long-term play with multiple product opportunities, and we could see this playing out for decades to come,"" Gilead CEO John Milligan said on a conference call with analysts following the purchase announcement.Even with sales of its hepatitis C products crimped, revenue is growing from Gilead's HIV/AIDS drugs. The company is expected to end the year with revenue of $24 billion to $25.5 billion, down from $30.4 billion last year.Gilead is the No. 3 company by market cap among the 453 companies in IBD's biotechnology industry group, trailing leader Amgen (AMGN) and just behind Celgene.Gilead has ""a substantial balance sheet where they could help fund the launch (of Kite products) in Europe, help expand Kite's manufacturing capacity beyond its facility in El Segundo (Calif.) and help propel other early-stage projects forward,"" Jefferies analyst Biren Amin told IBD.In return, Amin said, Gilead gets ""an early- to midstage oncology pipeline, which they didn't have. Kite allows them to diversify away from hepatitis C longer term.""Kite isn't saying how much it will charge for its treatment until the product is approved, but Amin said analysts estimate costs will range from $250,000 to $300,000 for one person's full course of the therapy. The company has built the capacity to produce between 4,000 and 5,000 patient therapies a year, Kite spokeswoman Christine Cassiano said.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make a decision on Kite's axi-cel drug by Nov. 29. Kite hasn't disclosed a brand name for the drug.If that timeline holds, Kite's drug could reach blockbuster status — annual sales of $1 billion or more — in 2020, according to Amin.Kite won't be the first biotech company to receive FDA approval for a CAR-T drug. Novartis got the green light from the FDA on Aug. 30 for its therapy for certain types of leukemia in children and young adults.If Kite's axi-cel drug is approved by the FDA, it will become the first therapy of its kind to treat non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients with advanced cases of the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that originates in the immune system.The therapy involves extracting and filtering a patient's blood to remove key components of the immune system called T cells, and engineering those cells in the lab so they express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that is programmed to escort intruder-destroying T cells directly to proteins found on the surface of cancer cells. These modified T cells are infused back into the patient, where they multiply and become the body's cancer fighters.Researchers affiliated with the National Institutes of Health developed the early science that underpins the process and, in 2012, licensed it to Kite. Kite is one of about a dozen biotech firms that have received permission to use the agency's version of the technology, according to Amin.Kite's study found that about eight months after a single infusion of their treatment was administered, 39% of patients with advanced non-Hodgkin lymphoma for whom chemotherapy no longer worked were in complete remission, with no sign of malignancy.""There's no rocket science there,"" said Kite's Chang about the company's multistep manufacturing process, which he said takes 17 days ""vein to vein."" That, he says, is the shortest turnaround time among companies trying to develop their own versions of a CAR-T drug.There is an art to the manufacturing process, and observers say Kite's deft approach and high success rate in its clinical trials has set the company apart.""One thing we paid a lot of attention to was making sure that every manufacturing was as successful so that there is a cell product to be given back to the patient,"" Chang said. ""We were able to treat everybody who enrolled in our clinical study, with the exception of a single patient. That's one out of 111 patients — or less than 1% — who was not able to be treated.""Kite aims to automate more of the drug development process as part of a collaboration with General Electric (GE) offshoot GE Global Research. The initiative could help Kite reduce manufacturing costs, speed up processing time and minimize variability in the results. Kite also is researching ways to change how the cells are manipulated with growth factors to make the supercharged cells more effective once they are returned to the patient, Chang said.The company is investigating how to equip a person's cells so they are able to ""go after"" more than just one type of cancer, he said. Kite is even looking to develop an ""off the shelf"" CAR-T product that could be used by any patient, he says.""When we talk about innovation, it's about execution as well as making the right choices, hopefully, to guide on your programs,"" said analyst Amin. ""They're doing that.""RELATED:Besides Kite Pharma, Which Companies Rose To IBD Biotech Innovators Status?Get The Details On All 6 Biotech Innovator Award-Winning Companies And Their WorkBluebird Is Among The Biotech Stocks Near New HighsWhy Biotech Stocks Had A Catch-Up RallyWill Novartis Acquire This Company?

80,EL,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) has all the trimmings of a retail rock star: It routinely tops earnings and sales forecasts, posts double-digit same-store sales growth and continues to gain market share.XThe specialty beauty chain missed comp guidance slightly (11.7% vs. estimates for 12%) and its Q3 profit outlook came in light, but management also raised profit guidance for the year and raised the low end of its full-year same-store sales outlook.Any other retailer would likely be lauded for such a beat-and-raise quarter. (See Thursday's retail rally: Even after paring gains, Signet Jeweler's (SIG) surprise venture into positive comp territory helped shares rise 16.7% for the day.)But Ulta shares are getting slammed the morning after, gapping down 10% to a 15-month low of 209.32 in the stock market today, more than 30% off their recent all-time high of 314.86 in early June. And some analysts are cutting their price targets.So what gives?Calling Ulta ""one of the most controversial names under (our) coverage despite generating the strongest growth profile in our space,"" Wells Fargo analyst Ike Boruchow pointed to its ""very strong"" same-store sales growth that nonetheless missed targets for the first time since Q3 2013 — providing an imperfection for investors to obsess over, particularly as Amazon (AMZN) becomes a hotter topic than it has been in the past.""While this seems explainable (traded sales for margin, GMs beat plan) it creates a hole for investors to poke at as the concerns around slowing beauty category trends, a more competitive (department) store backdrop and the looming Amazon unknown all remain top of mind,"" he wrote.Amazon hasn't traditionally been a pressing worry for beauty names for the following reasons: Sephora and Ulta each have a hold over loyal repeat customers, beauty shopping requires some degree of in-person sampling, and Amazon isn't known for having a strong selection of prestige cosmetics and skin-care brands. Estee Lauder (EL) management said in its most recent earnings call that it has no plans to distribute on Amazon in fiscal 2018.But recent reports that high-end beauty retailers like Violet Grey could partner with Amazon, and the acquiescence of major brands like Nike (NKE) (and perhaps La-Z-Boy (LZB)) to sell their wares directly on the e-commerce titan, might be contributing to concerns that the floodgates could soon open.Add to that reports of beauty-product discounting from major department stores and Ulta's own slowing sales growth, and the worry is more apparent.IBD'S TAKE: Holding or buying stocks into quarterly reports is risky. But here's an earnings options strategy that significantly reduces risk while letting you capitalize on big post-earnings gains.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan lowered his price target to 240 from 270, and said Ulta is likely to trade lower in the near term ""given broader multiple contraction amongst retail stocks, slowing growth, and fears of increased competition from Amazon."" He has a hold rating on Ulta.But not everyone is worried.Cowen analyst Oliver Chen, who rates the stock an outperform, believes Ulta is ""expensive, worth it, and can hold its own"" against Amazon, highlighting its 25.4 million rewards program members, 15.3% salon sales growth and attractive product assortment.And Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said management countered concerns over Amazon by ""citing strong velocity in key overlapping categories of investor concern.""Nevertheless, she cut her price target to 260 from 330, and is ""rethinking our valuation paradigm for ULTA shares given ongoing industry/consumer changes."" She has an overweight rating on Ulta.""The issue here is valuation,"" wrote Wells Fargo's Boruchow, ""as we feel the stock will have difficulty achieving multiple expansion in the face of slowing category dynamics, a deceleration comp trend and macro concerns (namely Amazon).""RELATED:Retail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchMacy's Hits 7-Year Low, Ulta Slices 200-Day As Beauty Gets OldHere Are The Winners And Losers From Amazon's Reported Violet Grey Deal As La-Z-Boy Eyes Amazon, Williams-Sonoma's Online Growth Tops Retail

84,EL,"Immigration: Another promise fulfilled? As part of a deal that would give so-called ""dreamers"" a path to permanent residency or citizenship in the U.S., President Trump unveiled a 70-point immigration plan that leans heavily toward reinforcing the U.S. border against illegal crossings. It's long overdue.Trump's plan, submitted on Sunday to Congress, is part of a quid pro quo to toughen our border security while giving those who are the children of illegal immigrants a shot at staying here permanently.It goes a long way toward doing what Trump promised during his campaign in 2016: get tough on America's border security, which, under President Obama, had become an open joke. Among other things, the plans would give federal agents more power to nab illegals as they cross and to detain, hold and deport them more quickly if they're caught on U.S. soil. He also calls for a border wall and more agents to police the border with Mexico.Among its 70 provisions, the plan goes a long way toward closing many of the loopholes in U.S. law that have for years made a travesty of our nation's border — including lax asylum standards, unaccompanied alien children, visa overstays and giving all levels of government, federal, state and local, the power detain those here illegally. This would, in effect, put an end to the so-called sanctuary movement, which is really little more than a refusal to obey U.S. law.The goal of all this, the White House said, is to enact major changes in border security, enforcement inside the U.S. and the legal immigration system.""If you don't solve these problems then you're not going to have a secure border, you're not going to have a lawful immigration system and you're not going to be able to protect American workers,"" a senior unnamed White House official told the Washington Times.It will certainly be interesting to see how congressional Democrats, who created the ""Dreamer"" problem in the first place, respond to Trump's offer. With the support of Congress, President Obama issued a 2012 executive action that kept an estimated 800,000 illegal immigrants who were brought to the U.S. as children from being deported.Democrats have used the unlawful presence of those youthful immigrants as a PR weapon to portray anyone who opposes their legalization as racist, even hateful. Now, with Trump willing to deal for better border security in exchange for legalizing the Dreamers, we'll see how serious the Democrats really are.But even this deal will have unanticipated costs. A recent estimate by the Center for Immigration Studies notes that the Dreamers, once legalized, will be able to bring in close to a million and a half near-relatives, mostly poor people from Mexico and the so-called Northern Triangle of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. This represents a potential significant expansion in both welfare spending and Medicaid outlays for the mostly poor newcomers.We're all for a deal that would finally secure our border and to make the Dreamers permanent residents, but we're wary. We remember quite well the 1986 immigration reform, which went from being the immigration reform to end all reforms, to an immigration fiasco that led to less-secure borders and more illegal immigration.""There were actual promises at the time that, going forward, there would be stronger border enforcement,"" Edward Meese, who served as attorney general under President Reagan, told the Daily Signal recently. ""We felt it worth a try, as a means of stopping illegal immigration. I agreed with (Reagan), along with the rest of the Cabinet, about trying out the (immigration reform) commission's recommendations.""Once passed into law, however, the ""enforcement"" part of the deal was forgotten. All we got was amnesty, and another flood tide of illegal immigrants. From roughly 3.5 million illegals in 1990, estimates today put the illegal population at somewhere from 12 million to 22 million.This should never happen again, and Trump knows it. Everyone talks about how ""tough"" and ""strict"" this new plan is. In fact, what Trump has offered to pro-immigration groups and lawmakers for the Dreamers is incredibly generous. All he's asking in return is for Congress to take the border seriously, to fund the wall, and to send those who don't belong here back to their home countries. Our advice: Remember 1986. If Congress won't take our border security seriously, Trump should say no deal.RELATED:Can Trump Win His Battle Against Leftist Judges And Open-Border Radicals Over Immigration? Jeff Sessions Will Actually Enforce Immigration Law — And It's About Time Trump's Right: Law-Breaking 'Sanctuary Cities' Must Obey The Law Click here to get more Political Commentary and Analysis from Investor's Business Daily.Want to make more money in the stock market.

Shares in the company are up 17% in 2017.

88,EL,"Part of a financial advisor's job is to alleviate a client's anxiety about money. Now more than ever, a related anxiety involves losing money to fraudsters.XAdvisors who serve as anti-fraud advocates find an entirely new way to add value to their client relationships. Steering individuals away from potentially costly scams affords peace of mind to harried consumers, especially seniors who may fall prey to cyberattacks or other deceptive schemes.""Today, more people understand that we as advisors can help prevent fraud,"" said Christian Cordoba, a certified financial planner in El Segundo, Calif. ""It can be a big differentiator. We can get out ahead of it through discussions, education and awareness-raising.""The scourge of fraud hit home for Cordoba in 2014, when a single client in his 80s fell victim to a scam. Informed that he won the lottery, the elderly man wired over $3,000 to the caller.When the fraudster requested more money before releasing the supposed lottery winnings, Cordoba's client maxed out his credit cards. Only when he sought to withdraw funds from his investment account did he alert Cordoba of the situation.""We managed the rest of his assets so we got involved when he called us,"" he said. ""Coupled with the frequency and amounts being requested, it created a pattern that concerned us.""Today, Cordoba cites the scam as a cautionary tale in his public seminars — and highlights his role in helping clients avoid massive fraud losses.""A lot of people think, 'It'll never happen to me,' "" he said. ""Then they hear this story"" and other examples of elder fraud and identity theft, and they join forces with their advisor to become more vigilant.Over the past year, Cordoba highlights two new types of fraud. First, he's hearing about scammers pretending to represent the Internal Revenue Service over the phone or via email. And he's warning clients not to wire money to anyone based on an email plea, even if it appears to come from someone they know, such as a grandchild.""It's always better to call to confirm rather than rely solely on an email request,"" he said.For advisors who gain expertise in fraud prevention, the challenge often becomes increasing their client outreach. Knowing how to stop scams is only half the battle.""We tell clients that you need to talk to us when you're making major financial decisions,"" said Matt Archer, an advisor in Raleigh, N.C.As an example, he recalls a client — a widow in her 70s — who met someone through online dating who repeatedly asked her for money. She wound up wiring over $100,000 and took out a loan to send even more funds.""She had a hard time telling me about it,"" Archer said. ""This was over 18 months ago and she's still paying back the loan.""To prevent fraud, Archer now communicates more frequently with clients whenever they request a wire transfer. He also alerts them about the dangers of social media and how some online networking sites geared for seniors are often targets for tricksters.As part of his efforts to help clients combat fraud, Archer updates them about best practices in cybersecurity and shares steps to ward off threats. He emails clients about illegal schemes and forwards Better Business Bureau scam alerts.""We overcommunicate with clients via newsletters, emails and social media,"" he said. ""We want to stay top of mind, and educating clients on how to fight fraud helps us do that.""In order for advisors to offer fraud prevention tips, they need to sharpen their knowledge of a rapidly evolving field. That requires a commitment to learning about the latest scams — and how their clients can guard against them.Archer participates in online training programs sponsored by his firm's broker-dealer. A recent session covered cyberhacking and installing firewalls.Similarly, John McCafferty takes classes on fraud prevention measures offered by his firm, Edelman Financial Services in Alexandria, Va. He has learned how to spot warning signs of money laundering and phishing (emails that lure people to reveal personal data).""There are savvy fraudsters and they're getting savvier as time goes on,"" McCafferty said. ""That's why we differentiate ourselves by taking the time to talk about all this. Clients are often pleasantly surprised when I suggest they take anti-fraud action steps.""McCafferty tailors his fraud prevention advice to address each client's needs. For instance, he might urge midcareer professionals to get their aging parents an unpublished phone number to minimize junk calls. Or he might propose that an entrepreneur who runs a business from home use a paper shredder to dispose of credit-card mailers and other unwanted material that contains personal data.RELATED:What's The Stock Market Doing Now?

89,EL,"JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon on Friday said that Bitcoin ""will end badly"" and become a black market after governments crack down, adding to the debate over the cryptocurrency's prospects that has played out publicly in recent days among prominent financial figures even as he faces an allegation of market abuse.X""So right now, these crypto things are kind of a novelty,"" Dimon said in an interview on Friday with CNBC-TV18 in New Delhi. ""People think they're kind of neat. But the bigger they get, the more governments are going to close them down.""Among those governments has been China, where regulators plan to ban digital currency trading on domestic exchanges. Large exchanges have halted trading, and the nation has also banned the form of digital-asset fundraising known as initial coin offerings.While JPMorgan has been more receptive to blockchain, the technology that provides the infrastructure to process Bitcoin transactions, Dimon last week said that Bitcoin was ""a fraud"" and that any JPMorgan trader dealing in the currency would be fired pretty much instantaneously.The claim that Bitcoin is ""a fraud,"" however, could become an issue with regulators in Sweden.Blockswater, a London-based company whose technology is intended to improve crypto-market liquidity, has reported Dimon to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority and accused him of market abuse after that remark.Blockswater, in a report dated Sept. 17, accused Dimon of ""spreading false and misleading information"" about Bitcoin, a currency whose value is still sensitive to cheerleading or trash-talking from big names in the financial world. The company also alleged that JPMorgan Securities Ltd. traded two exchange traded notes that were tied to Bitcoin on the Nasdaq Nordiq exchange ""before and after"" his comments.JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment.Bitcoin's value was down 1.5% at $3,611.77 in late-afternoon trading. Shares Nvidia (NVDA), whose graphics cards are increasingly used to process Bitcoin transactions, closed down 1% on the stock market today. AMD (AMD), whose graphics cards have also been in demand for cryptocurrency mining, fell 0.8%.IBD'S TAKE: As cryptocurrencies grow, they've become tougher to ignore by the financial industry's old guard. Here's what some Wall Street giants are doing in the digital currency space.Dimon last week argued that forming a currency is among the first things that governments do, and that they like to keep track of the flow of that money supply. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor to Allianz, said last week that Bitcoin's value assumed ""massive adoption"" that governments were unlikely to allow.On Friday, the woman interviewing Dimon argued that all currencies, whether backed by a central bank or libertarian coders, are arbitrary to an extent, and created out of thin air.""It says 'legal tender,' "" Dimon countered. ""You have to take this as payment. It's very cheap to do, it's very easy to move back and forth. JPMorgan moves $6 trillion around the world every day, very efficiently, very quietly, very effectively, and very cost efficient.""Roger Ver, a Bitcoin investor known as ""Bitcoin Jesus,"" argued in an interview with Bloomberg Television this week that Dimon and others ""just don't understand Bitcoin at this point"" and that those qualities were also among Bitcoin's strengths.""Bitcoin, unlike the U.S. dollar or the euro or the yen or anything else for that matter, you can send and receive any amount of it, with anyone, anywhere in the world, basically for free, and there's nothing anybody can do to stop it or block it, or freeze your account or control it in any way,"" he said.

90,EL,"Climate Change: Global warming is ""settled science,"" we hear all the time. Those who reject that idea are ""deniers."" But as new evidence trickles out from peer-reviewed science studies, the legs beneath the climate change hypothesis — that the earth was doing just fine until carbon-dioxide spewing human beings came along — is increasingly wobbly.A new study published in the journal Nature Geoscience purports to support action by global governments to reduce carbon dioxide output in order to lower potential global warming over the next 100 years or so. But what it really does is undercut virtually every modern argument for taking radical action against warming.Why? The study admits that the 12 major university and government models that have been used to predict climate warming are faulty.""We haven't seen that rapid acceleration in warming after 2000 that we see in the models,"" said Myles Allen, professor of geosystem science at Oxford and one of the authors of the study. ""We haven't seen that in the observations.""And, of course, he's quite right. As we've noted here numerous times, the much-feared ""global warming"" trend seems to have halted somewhere around 1998. We know this is true because satellite temperature readings — the most accurate temperature gauge since it takes in the entire atmosphere, not just parts of it — show there's been virtually no change.Based on the U.N.'s models, temperatures should have been shooting up sharply starting in about 1995. By this year, model temperatures show we should have had just under a 1.0 degree centigrade rise in temperature, a significant temperature spike in what is, in geological time, an extremely short period. It was those models that were used to sell the world on the idea that we needed a drastic reordering of our global economic priorities immedialy.The reality: virtually no change in temperature. Put simply, the models are wrong.And yet, advocates of the global warming dogma continue to ruin the careers of scientific apostates and hurl insults like calling skeptics ""deniers"" — which likens those who disagree about global warming science to those who ""deny"" the existence of the Holocaust — while denying painfully obvious facts about ""climate change.""As we noted back in May, we noted that the Sunday Telegraph of Britain had reported that temperatures had dropped sharply early this year following the supposed ""hottest year on record"" in 2016. How could that be? 2016 was an El Niño year, which are always unusually hot.""In recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more than 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Niño."" Not only that, but despite doom-and-gloom prognostications by global warming's biased, bought-and-paid for ""scientist"" forecasters, ice in the Arctic and Greenland both grew this year.Recent revisions of climate data have all been in one direction: Older data have been revised to show cooler temperatures, more recent ones, warmer temperatures. Statistics would suggest that random errors would be not all in one direction.So it looks suspiciously like scientist-statisticians who are getting big fat checks from governments that have every interest in selling the idea of inevitable and disastrous global warming are, if you will, cooking the books.This might be merely an academic dispute if not for one thing: To remediate it, the United Nations and a legion of scientists around the world riding the global warming gravy train are seeking to have the world spend 2% of its GDP just to slow climate change.That's about $1.5 trillion a year, at current levels of world GDP, an enormous amount. And most of it would come from the U.S. and a small handful of other rich nations. A huge tax on you to remedy a phantom threat, in short.No one doubts the climate is changing. That's why it's called ""climate,"" not ""stasis."" The scientific knowledge of climate is still in its infancy.But now that we have further evidence in the form of another peer-reviewed study that shows the global warming models are flawed at best, fraudulent at worse, we do agree with global warming advocates on one thing: We need to take action.So once again, we call on President Trump to pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. That bad deal won't change the climate one bit, but it will hurt the world economy and lower Americans' standard of living.And we ask: Based on the growing evidence, who are the real deniers?RELATED:Science Unsettled: Why Trump Should Dump The Paris Climate Deal U.N.'s Global Warming Fraudsters Are More Interested In Climate Cash Than Climate Change Is Global Warming Science Just A Fraud? Check out all of IBD's Political coverage, including the award-winning editorial page.New to investing?

91,EL,"Last week, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin ""a fraud,"" and Allianz Chief Economic Advisor Mohamed El-Erian said the currency's value should be ""at least half of what it is."" This week, the man known as Bitcoin Jesus has parted the clouds to cast a healing light on the cryptocurrency and offered a prophesy.XRoger Ver, the CEO of Bitcoin.com and a fervent Bitcoin evangelist (hence the nickname Bitcoin Jesus), told Bloomberg Television that one year from now the pricing of Bitcoin would be ""at least double."" He said the cryptocurrency ""was one of the most important inventions of humankind."" And he said that the Jamie Dimons of the world ""just don't understand Bitcoin at this point.""Ver added that Bitcoin was governed by mathematics rather than politicians, and he said a Bitcoin account was far easier to open and use than an account with a traditional bank.And Ver suggested that China, which according to reports this month plans to crackdown on cryptocurrency trading, is likely to find itself on the wrong side of history.""Anything that China tries to ban is something you should invest in,"" he said. ""YouTube, Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Google (GOOGL) — all these things are astounding successes.""Bitcoin is likely to peel off into another variation in November, Ver said, as developers continue to debate how best to expand the cryptocurrency's infrastructure and speed up transactions as interest grows in digital cash.Bitcoin Cash, another cryptocurrency, sprouted out of the original Bitcoin this summer amid those disputes. It was created after an update to the cryptocurrency's network didn't go far enough for some developers, who wanted bigger increases in the data blocks that store details about transactions.IBD'S TAKE: As cryptocurrencies grow, they've become tougher to ignore by the financial industry's old guard. Here's what some Wall Street giants are doing in the digital currency space.Bitcoin hovered around $4,000 Wednesday, according to CoinMarketCap. The bitcoin-tracking ETF Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) closed up 0.7% at 710.00 in the stock market today and has shot up 15% so far this week.Bitcoin tanked last week following reports of China's restrictions and the comments from Dimon and El-Erian.But investors have stepped back into the cryptocurrency now that they have a better sense of China's potential influence on it.RELATED:Why Bitcoin Is Rebounding After Getting Trashed Last WeekBitcoin Dives Again: BTCChina To Halt Trades; China Shutdown 'Certain'Here's The Latest Financial Leader To Cast Doubt On Bitcoin

92,EL,"Known retail disruptor Amazon.com (AMZN) is at it again, reportedly.WWD said Wednesday, citing market sources, that online cosmetics-retailer Violet Grey could partner with Amazon to sell its luxury brands through the e-commerce behemoth.Violet Grey was founded in 2013 by Cassandra Grey, the wife of late ex-Paramount Pictures CEO Brad Grey. The company has a brick-and-mortar presence on Melrose Place in Los Angeles, offering ""expertly curated beauty products and exclusive offerings, all tested and approved by Hollywood's leading hairstylists, skin care experts, and makeup artists.""X Its e-commerce site features photo shoots with celebrities such as ""Game of Thrones"" star Emilia Clarke and stories like ""Lessons on Hair Volume"" and ""Violette's Rules of Foundation.""Why does it matter? The news of Violet Grey's potential deal with Amazon is likely what's weighing on specialty retailer Ulta Beauty (ULTA) in the stock market today. Ulta fell 3.65% to 247.24, hitting a fresh 2017 low intraday as shares continue their downward trajectory from early June.Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan, who wrote that he was ""unsurprised"" by the report, called a potential Amazon-Violet Grey deal a ""negative for retailers, including Ulta and Sephora, and to (a) lesser extent department stores, which rely on beauty to drive foot traffic.""Macy's (M), Kohl's (KSS) and peers certainly have their own troubles, and a recent Wall Street Journal report — on department stores discounting prestige beauty products — sent Macy's shares to a seven-year low. J.C. Penney (JCP) has seen beauty sales grow, thanks to its Sephora shop-in-shops.One small online beauty retailer getting the backing of Amazon doesn't pose an imminent threat to cosmetics stores or retailers that carry makeup and skin care. The worry, though, is what it indicates about Amazon's interest in entering the space — and how hard the e-commerce heavy will pummel away once it has something in its cross hairs.Grocery stores, after all, could tell its counterparts in beauty a thing or two.Estee Lauder (EL) and L'Oreal-owned brands are also sold on Violet Grey.""We ultimately think it makes sense for companies such as Estee Lauder, L'Oreal, and LVMH to offer a limited assortment of prestige beauty brands for sale on Amazon, given the substantial shift in consumer shopping behavior online,"" said Astrachan.He thinks the owners of brands sold on Violet Grey would have right of refusal to sell on Amazon, but if a deal were to happen, ""we would anticipate the independent brands would be most likely to embrace Amazon, with a likely far-more-limited assortment of larger brands being offered for sale in time.""Estee Lauder shares rose 0.2% intraday to 98.92. The stock is at the edge of the buy zone from a 94.57 cup-with-handle base entry point.Prestige beauty brands keep a tight cap on distribution in order to assert control over pricing and brand image. But this news and e-commerce focus is ""modestly favorable"" to both L'Oreal and Estee Lauder, said Astrachan, especially since a broader online presence would ease Estee Lauder's reliance on mid-tier department stores for its sales.... Exactly what kind of impact Amazon is looking to make on the beauty space. And it might be too early to panic, says one expert.Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Murphy said that Violet Grey's estimated revenue is ""well below"" $5 million a year (while noting Ulta's market cap has taken a $550 million hit so far Wednesday), and that it has a ""tiny"" social-media presence compared to Ulta and Estee Lauder. But it does have ""decent"" traction with celebrities, she said.And according to Piper Jaffray, Violet Grey carries 130 brands, mostly skin care and cosmetics. But only 15 of the brands overlap with Ulta's offerings, such as Dior, Giorgio Armani, MAC and others.""Bottom line, while we recognize the ""headline"" risk of seeing AMZN & any category (in this case, beauty) in the same line, we don't see a near-term risk for the beauty category being disintermediated by Amazon at this juncture,"" wrote Murphy.She has an overweight rating and 330 price target on Ulta Beauty.Amazon, meanwhile, rose 1.2% to 1,052.80, hitting a record high but in buy range from a 1,016,60 entry.

94,EL,"Macy's (M) shares hit a seven-year low and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) breached its key 200-day moving average amid a report that department stores are now discounting prestige beauty products, a segment once thought to be untouchable by price slashers.XLord & Taylor and Macy's-owned Bloomingdale's are following Macy's in offering slight discounts on beauty products, according to the Wall Street Journal.Macy's fell 7% to 21.08 in the stock market today, hitting its worst levels since September 2010 amid the latest retail rout. Kohl's (KSS) shares skidded 4.2%, cutting its 50-day. Kohl's is near a recent 52-week low. Nordstrom (JWN) tumbled 2.7% to 46.24.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) sank through its 200-day line for the first time in 16 months. Ulta fell 2.9% to 268.82, continuing a downward march from a recent all-time high of 314.86 in early June.Specialty beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora have typically been regarded as Amazon (AMZN)-resistant companies, immune to the promotional downward spiral facing apparel sellers and the woes befalling Macy's and other department stores. Both also have strong rewards programs that court shoppers' loyalty.But Monday's story in the Journal, while not indicative of greater discounting at Ulta or Sephora, may point to concerns over potential ripple effects. It is unclear how much pressure specialty beauty retailers would experience should heavy cosmetics discounting at department stores become widespread.Estee Lauder (EL), a prestige brand found at major department stores (and to a certain degree at Ulta and Sephora), fell below its 50-day moving average for the first time in three months. Shares closed off session lows, losing just 1 cent to 94.27, but that's below the rising support line.Estee Lauder cleared a 94.57 entry point from a cup-with-handle base in late May, rising as high as 98.40.

100,EL,"After announcing earlier this month a phased termination of the ""Dreamers"" program (aka DACA), President Trump appears to be moving quickly to strike a deal with Congress to put in place legislation to implement this quasi-amnesty program that President Obama launched by executive order in 2012.Obama's order protected about 700,000 illegal immigrants who arrived as minors between 1991 and 2007 — brought by their parents, as the story line goes.Since 2007, another wave of foreign minors has been entering the country, this time unaccompanied by parents. Since 2012, they've come in large numbers — they now number more than 250,000. It's hard not to see moral hazard.Dreamers have an appealing case for special dispensation. They are American more than foreign, having lived all but their earliest years here rather than in their place of birth. Their illegal immigration is viewed as their parents' doing, not theirs.Obviously, the same cannot be said of the new wave of ""unaccompanied alien children,"" as they have been termed by Homeland Security. They have come under their own steam, primarily from the Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras).This suggests one feature of any Dreamer legislation, namely that the DACA cutoff date of 2007 be retained, that the new law not cover later arrivals, not be open-ended. Minors coming alone afterward are a distinctly different class.Pro-immigration activists claim they have not been attracted by the prospect of protection under DACA or Dream legislation or some future iteration of same. More-skeptical observers might disagree.Either way, these unaccompanied immigrants are here now. We must deal with them promptly. Otherwise, they too may live most of their lives here, becoming just as appealing tomorrow as Dreamers are today.Legislation replacing DACA should also include provisions to deal with these newer arrivals and to halt this novel form of illegal immigration.Three reforms would work wonders.The first would be to revise the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), which has exacerbated the problem. In order to prevent child trafficking, TVPRA requires that all minor immigrants arriving at our border from noncontiguous nations be given an immigration court hearing before they can be sent home.In contrast, Mexican minors apprehended crossing the border illegally can be returned or removed to Mexico expeditiously, if not immediately. What's fair for Mexicans should be fair for kids from the Northern Triangle, which should be designated contiguous territory under TVPRA. This would prevent Northern Triangle natives from exploiting TVPRA as a pretext to enter the country illegally.The practical result of TVPRA at present is that many unaccompanied alien children never show up for their court hearings, which are almost always long delayed, given the overload in the immigration court system. They become de facto quasi-legal permanent residents.So, secondly, Dreamer legislation should provide President Trump the resources to do more of what he is doing already, namely hiring more immigration court judges to reduce the backlog of 600,000 immigration cases, particularly those of these unaccompanied minors. Judges will sort out which of these immigrants genuinely qualify for TVPRA protection and legal permanent residency and those who do not.Thirdly, with Congressional backing, President Trump should pressure Mexico to halt unaccompanied Northern Triangle minors from entering and traversing Mexico in order to enter the U.S. illegally and to accept back any who do make it to the U.S. border.Mexican authorities can separate purely economic migrants, who should be repatriated, from genuine refugees and asylum-seekers. Mexico is better situated to repatriate economic migrants to its immediate southern neighbors than the U.S. more than a thousand miles away.Many migrants are legitimately fleeing violence and human trafficking. The Northern triangle is notoriously violent. According to Insight Crime, which tracks organized crime in the Americas, El Salvador had a murder rate of 91 per 100,000 in 2016, followed by 59 per 100,000 in Honduras. By comparison, Mexico is safe — with a murder rate of only 19 per 100,000. Mexico can serve as safe haven for Northern Triangle refugees.Hundreds of millions of people around the world would like to come to the U.S. Many live in poverty and in violent societies. We simply cannot admit them all.Already, we admit more legal immigrants than any other nation on earth. Turning a blind eye to high levels of illegal immigration on top of that is irresponsible, especially when we have many American children living in poverty and violent conditions (Chicago's murder rate was 28 per 100,000 in 2016). They deserve our first attention.Amnesty programs, such as a legislative replacement of DACA, must not be open-ended and must include safeguards which prevent the recreation of virtually identical classes of amnesty-seekers in the future.RELATED:Can Raise Act Make Immigration Work For America Again? Can Trump Win His Fight With Leftist Judges And Open-Borders Radicals Over Immigration? Jeff Sessions Will Actually Enforce Immigration Law — And It's About Time

Starbucks (SBUX) has 13.3 million active Starbucks Rewards members in the U.S., up 11%, said the coffeehouse giant last month.Ulta Beauty CEO Mary Dillon said on Thursday night's earnings call that the program's growth rate is starting to moderate slightly, but ""we still expect to see rapid growth in loyalty membership well above square footage growth.""And brands are probably interested in the customer insights that Ulta can glean from its fast-growing loyalty program, said Oliver Chen, an analyst at Cowen.Ulta's same-store sales growth of 14.3% in Q1 comes on top of the prior-year period's 15.2%, and includes 10.9% in comparable sales in physical retail locations. That's highly unusual, to say the least, given the pummeling that department stores and many other mall-based chains have gotten.Dillon said she was ""particularly proud of these results in light of the challenging environment many retailers are experiencing.""And that isn't expected to stop anytime soon.""We believe the momentum has legs to continue through FY17 and beyond,"" wrote Cowen's Chen of Ulta's same-store sales.E-commerce sales jumped 70.9% during the quarter, which Piper Jaffray says is Ulta's highest level since 2014. And unlike other retailers, the effort to drive digital growth isn't weighing on brick-and-mortar stores.""ULTA e-commerce growth has not cannibalized physical store sales,"" wrote Piper Jaffray's Erinn Murphy. ""The number of online-only shoppers is very low, but omnichannel shoppers continue to increase, up 140 bps y/y to 8.6%.""Total traffic growth during the quarter rose 77% as mobile traffic popped 107%.IT Cosmetics, Tarte, Too Faced, Mario Badescu, Becca, Anastasia, Clinique, Lancome, Benefit, Tonymoly, Yes Too, and the Ulta Beauty collection were among the quarter's top performing brands, said Dillon.Clinique is owned by Estee Lauder (EL), and the cosmetics giant recently acquired Becca and Too Faced as well. Last year, Estee Lauder debuted the millennial-focused Estee Edit at Sephora. J.C. Penney (JCP) has a number of Sephora store-within-a-store operations.""Growth in Ulta and Sephora is positive for Estee as it diversifies sales from weaker channels like midtier department stores"" said Stifel's Mark Astrachan.RELATED:Why Ulta Beauty Shares Fell Out Of Buy Range Ahead Of Earnings
"
110,EL,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares sliced through their 50-day moving average and tumbled right out of buy range intraday Wednesday, after getting a downgrade to hold from buy from Edward Jones. It believes Ulta's earnings growth should continue at an above-average pace but that opportunities for profit margin expansion are slowing.""While we expect profit margins still have some room to expand, we do believe it will become more difficult over the longer term as more business shifts to online,"" wrote Brian Yarbrough of Edward Jones. ""Online sales have lower profit margins than sales in the stores.""Shares of Ulta were down 3.5% to 280.51 on the stock market today, undercutting their 289.37 entry just one day ahead of the specialty beauty retailer's earnings report after the close Thursday.Beauty products maker Estee Lauder (EL) edged up 1.1% to 93.03, nearing a 94.57 buy point, while e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) slipped 0.8% to 24.85. Estee Lauder soared following its earnings report earlier this month, while e.l.f. Beauty fell sharply.Prior to this tumble, Ulta had been climbing toward the 300 price level. By early May, shares had doubled from February 2016, hitting an all-time high of 301.40.Beauty products are a particular sweet spot in retail, and stores like Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora have flourished despite the broader shopping trends that have spelled gloom for other stores.When Ulta reports Q1 results Thursday, profit is expected to rise 24% to $1.80 a share on a 19% revenue rise to $1.27 billion. Expect laser-focus on same-store sales growth, a closely watched metric in the retail space.Consensus is for 11% growth, according to Piper Jaffray. Double-digit same-store sales growth is something of an anomaly, as other retailers turn in declines or mild single-digit comps.IBD'S TAKE: Ulta Beauty has reported same-store sales growth of 16.6%, 16.7%, 14.4% and 15.2% in the most recent four quarters. Consensus is for 11% comp growth in Q1, says Piper Jaffray. There are reasons why Ulta and other specialty beauty retailers haven't succumbed to the ""Amazon effect.""Edward Jones still appears fairly positive on the company's outlook.""We believe the company offers one of the most compelling growth stories in the retail landscape due to its store-growth opportunity,"" wrote Yarbrough, ""and because it operates in an attractive industry and has the potential to realize further profit expansion.""Ulta's premarket tumble is similar to that of home improvement chain Lowe's (LOW). Lowe's, which was near a buy zone, fell below its 50-day line Tuesday. Lowe's fell 3% to 79.85 Wednesday on weaker-than-expected earnings and sales.RELATED:Another Wild Ride From Ulta Beauty After Earnings?

""But the current pricing assumes massive adoption, and I don't think that governments will allow the amount of adoption that is currently priced in.""He said the currency would likely live on as a peer-to-peer form of payment.Bitcoin had tumbled nearly 9% on Wednesday, retreating below $4,000, just weeks after it flirted with the $5,000 barrier amid predictions that the cryptocurrency could hit $6,000 by the middle of next year.Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC), a bitcoin-tracking exchange traded fund, tumbled 18.6% to close at 566.00 in the stock market today, dropping below its 50-day average. It has plunged more than 40% from a high reached less than two weeks ago.Bad news surrounding the turbulent cryptocurrency market has continued to pile up in recent days. Analysts have said that, as a younger market, public perception matters more for cryptocurrencies, and can account for wild price swings day to day.China reportedly plans to shut down the trading of digital cash on domestic exchanges, although over-the-counter trading could be spared, according to recent reports. The nation will also reportedly crack down on initial coin offerings, or the raising of money via digital cash, which have become more popular.Even as others in the mainstream financial world find it more difficult to ignore bitcoin, concerns have grown about the security and fraud risks that have been associated with cryptocurrencies and digital fundraising. The SEC in July said that securities law ""may apply"" to initial coin offerings.IBD'S TAKE: As cryptocurrencies grow, they've become tougher to ignore by the financial industry's old guard. Here's what some Wall Street giants are doing in the digital currency space.Also Tuesday, the messaging platform Kik Interactive launched its initial coin offering for Kin, the company's digital currency. The company hopes Kin will become the foundation of a new digital economy that would exist within the Kik social network. The currency could also eventually trade on digital coin exchanges.However, as the website Coindesk reported, the URL of a scam website purporting to be related to the Kin offering made the rounds on social media, bilking fundraisers out of thousands of dollars.That came as JPMorgan's Dimon launched a blistering attack on bitcoin Tuesday, when said he'd fire any trader dealing in the currency ""in a second.""""It's worse than tulip bulbs,"" he said of the cryptocurrency at the Barclays Global Financial Services Conference. ""It won't end well. Someone is going to get killed.""At a separate conference on Tuesday, Dimon added: ""Governments, the first thing they do, is form a currency. They like to control the currency. They control it through a central bank. They also like to know who has it, where it is, where it's going.""He said that governments look at digital currencies as ""a novelty."" But he added that if one were in a nation hit by economic and political strife, like Venezuela or North Korea, they might be better off using bitcoin than that nation's currency.RELATED:Goldman Eyes $5 Billion Growth Plan; JPMorgan Calls Bitcoin A 'Fraud'Bitcoin Dips Amid China's Currency Crackdown; Kin ICO ComingHere's The Latest Bitcoin Rival That's About To Hit The Market

118,EL,"Ulta Beauty (ULTA) shares broke out of a flat base Wednesday as cosmetics conglomerate Estee Lauder (EL), which owns a number of brands sold at Ulta, posted a view-topping quarter.Ulta shares rallied 0.6% to 290.36 on the stock market today, topping a 289.37 entry point, after climbing 1.9% on Tuesday. Ulta hit an all-time high of 291.50 intraday. Minus a slight dip below its 50-day moving average last month, the stock has been on a steady upward climb above that key level since November.Specialty beauty retailers such as Ulta and LVMH (LVMUY)-owned Sephora are having a moment as they enjoy popularity with younger shoppers flocking to the latest makeup trends.For Q3, Estee Lauder's adjusted diluted profit grew 24.7% to 91 cents, crushing consensus views for 73 cents compiled by Zacks Investment Research, while net sales grew 8% to $2.86 billion, above Zacks views for $2.81 billion.Estee Lauder shares gapped up 4.4% to 91.30, hitting their highest level since August, and e.l.f.

Shake Shack now sees flat comps vs. prior guidance for a 2%-3% rise.""We are clearly dissatisfied with our comp result in Q1, but as a reminder our small comp base is made up of only 32 Shacks, the majority of which exist in the Northeast region which was most affected by cold weather and the holiday shift in March,"" CEO Randy Garutti said in a statement.Stock: Shares plunged nearly 7% to 30.85 in late trading. Shack Shack had closed down 2.6% to 33.16 on the stock market today. Habit Restaurants (HABT), which topped earnings views late Wednesday, rallied 1.6% to 19.20.Buckingham research analyst John Zolidis, who expected a 1% bump in Shake Shack's same-store sales, said the results would have to compete with a strong showing a year ago, when nicer weather and the introduction of Chick n' Shack helped results.Shake Shack, which began trading in 2015, has been opening new stores. That has raised concerns about whether the company's plans to move beyond where it is already popular will pay off.Goldman Sachs, in a note last month quoted by CNBC, cited ""declining novelty and therefore excitement around unit opens as a risk to new store productivity, and … cannibalization as a growing risk to traffic trends at SHAK, as the company continues to add density in markets outside of N.Y.""Zolidis said new-store results could be better than expected, but added ""we continue to expect that new unit performance will decline over time due to geographic expansion into less productive markets.""Shake Shack stepped up expansion plans. It expects 12 net openings of licensed locations this year, as opposed to 11 earlier. The company now expects to add 23-24 U.S. company-owned stores, up from 22-23.""We remain committed to executing our strategy of growing in premier locations, investing in our teams and delivering a great guest experience,"" Garutti said.Estimates: First-quarter EPS down 18% to 14 cents, with revenue up 5% to $98.72 million.Results: EPS fell 6% to 16 cents as sales climbed to $99.8 million.

An alliance of environmentalists, plaintiff attorneys, public-sector spending interests, public officials, and others is attempting to induce him to investigate the fossil-fuel industry in general and Exxon in particular.The argument is that Exxon supposedly knew long ago that increasing atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations would engender a series of climate catastrophes, which purportedly already are visible; but then misled the public writ large and its own investors over decades about those risks in order to protect the value of its fossil-fuel assets.Evidence of this perfidy is asserted to exist in a number of internal memorandums at Exxon, Shell and other firms, reflected, for example, in Exxon's internal recognition that rising GHG concentrations created climate risks, and in Shell's decision to increase the height of a North Sea drilling rig in order to withstand rising seas, even as the industry proclaimed uncertainty about the future climate effects of greenhouse-gas emissions.Please allow me to translate all that: Exxon and other fossil-fuel companies ""knew"" things decades ago about which the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to this day reports (page 14) as large uncertainties. That ""knowledge"" was based upon climate models that remain very poor in their actual ability to predict temperatures and climate phenomena.Accordingly, Exxon ""knew"" that increasing GHG concentrations would cause about twice as much warming as has actually occurred! And: Making investments in the face of uncertainty about the nature and magnitude of future dangers is evidence of duplicity.Wow. When you pay an auto insurance premium, is that evidence that you ""know"" you will cause an accident? Or do you do so out of caution?But never mind. Let us focus instead on the common assertion that the dangers of GHG emissions already are ""significant and growing"" and that Exxon knew it decades ago. It is absolutely true that anthropogenic climate change is ""real"" in the sense that increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations are having a detectable effect, important evidence of which, perhaps counterintuitively, is declining temperatures in the lower stratosphere.But the temperature records are not consistent with a looming crisis view. Atmospheric temperatures have been roughly flat since 2002. (1998 was a strong El Nino year, and so a few years of cooling followed). Largely because of another very strong El Nino, 2015-16 was hot, but surface and atmospheric temperatures have declined sharply since then.More generally, the temperature record since the late 19th century does not correlate well with increasing GHG concentrations. No one claims, for example, that the warming observed from 1910 to the mid-1940s was caused by man.Global temperatures appear to be on a longer-term upward trajectory, but the degree to which that trend is man-made is not known; the Earth since roughly 1850 has continued to emerge in fits and starts from the Little Ice Age.Increases in sea levels have been roughly constant at about 3.3 mm per year since the early 1990s, despite increasing GHG concentrations. There is a close correlation between sea levels and the El Nino/Southern Oscillation.The Arctic sea ice has been declining, although more slowly in recent years, while the Antarctic has been gaining mass. There has been no trend in total U.S. tornado activity since 1954, and a declining trend in strong-to-violent tornadoes.There has been no trend in the frequency of tropical cyclones since the early 1970s, no trend in the frequency of global hurricanes, and no trend in tropical accumulated cyclone energy (crudely, the destructiveness of cyclones and the cyclone season). The annual number of U.S. wildfires shows no trend since 1985. The Palmer Drought Severity Index shows no trend since 1895. There is no correlation between U.S. flooding and increasing GHG concentrations.And IPCC in its latest report does not support (Table 12.4) the various assertions about catastrophic future impacts of increasing GHG concentrations.And so the argument that ""Exxon knew"" that apocalypse was looming is preposterous. Can anyone doubt that this political campaign is designed to extract many billions of dollars from the fossil-fuel sector in a repeat of the 1998 tobacco shakedown?In a constitutional republic governed by the rule of law, public officials are not supposed to pick out a politically unpopular group and then try to find ways to hammer it. Instead, upon discovering actual evidence that a crime has been committed, those officials are supposed to gather additional facts leading them to file charges against the parties suspected to have committed those crimes, individuals who enjoy a presumption of innocence until convicted in a court of law governed by the rules of due process.Many seem to believe that none of that matters because they dislike the oil industry. They will applaud politicized prosecutions a lot less when they find themselves the targets of big, powerful government.

122,EL,"The post-earnings shock has worn off. After diving in late trade Thursday on a same-store sales decline, shares of Shake Shack (SHAK) are heating up early Friday after getting an upgrade to buy from Buckingham Research Group. Meanwhile, Starbucks (SBUX) is looking to recapture the luster of its hit Unicorn Frappuccino.Analyst John Zolidis bumped up his rating on Shake Shack to buy from neutral with an unchanged price target of 39, as he believes "" the trendy burger chain has now passed its most difficult compares from a same-Shack basis"" and is opening new locations ""at very robust volumes."" He also pointed out that the company's comp base is only 32 stores big, though the optics of same-store sales remains important.In the first quarter, Shake Shack profit grew 25% to 10 cents a share as revenue climbed 42% to $76.7 million, topping consensus for 8 cents EPS and $74.7 million in sales. (The company joined Wingstop (WING), Del Taco (TACO) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) in beating forecasts late Thursday.)But same-store sales tumbled 2.5% as the premium burger-and-fries chain faced tough comparisons from a balmier Q1 last year that included the allure of Chick'n Shack sandwiches.Management upped its full-year revenue guidance but took comp outlook down to flat from previous guidance for 2%-3% growth.""We believe SHAK is now set up to start exceeding estimates and to resume the beat-raise pattern that existed prior to 4Q16 results,"" wrote Zolidis on Friday. ""We see this putting a floor in the shares and providing justification for valuation expansion even as shares remain expensive on near-term results.""Wedbush analyst Nick Setyan, however, reiterated his neutral rating with a 33 price target, and called the lowered same-store growth outlook ""realistic.""Shares of Shake Shack shot up 9.2% to 36.18 in the stock market today. The recent IPO is still looking to turn itself around, after pricing at 21 a share at the start of 2015 and rocketing all the way up to 96.75 by May of that year. The stock's 50-day moving average crossed below its 200-day line in March. Friday's action helped shares gap up above both their 50-day and 200-day lines.Meanwhile Wingstop, shot up 11.4% Friday afternoon, gapping out of a cup-with-handle buy point. El Pollo Loco leapt 11.2%. Del Taco edged up 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: As smartphones become more common, running a successful fast-food restaurant could become more about going digital.

On its earnings call last week, Starbucks' new CEO, Kevin Johnson, had promised one new entirely new drink into Happy Hour this year that is going to be as good as Unicorn or better.""The coffee-drink ""happy hour,"" which runs from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m., today through May 14.Part of that attempt is its new Midnight Mint Mocha Frappuccino and S'mores Frappuccino, and a Starbucks-themed Snapchat lens to encourage Snap (SNAP) selfies at Starbucks. The company said there will be a new lens every other day through the happy hour period.McDonald's, which competes in some fashion vs. Shake Shack and Starbucks, rose 0.35%, hitting a new all-time high.RELATED:Dunkin' Brands Sales Miss In 'Increasingly Challenging' MarketWhere Does Starbucks Go From Here?

123,EL,"In mid-April, the leader of CalExit, a movement to have California secede from the United States and become an independent nation, announced that he was dropping the effort and moving to Russia.But by their words and actions, California's political leaders have made it clear that on matters of law enforcement the state has already seceded.In recent weeks, the governor, attorney general, legislative leaders, and even mayors and city councils have stumbled over each other to announce that the state will not participate in any national effort to secure the nation's borders or crack down on drug-dealing street gangs and violent criminals.Some undeniable legacies of the Obama administration have been the explosion of violent crime in many U.S. urban centers, a widespread increase in drug trafficking, and an accompanying record-setting number of fatal drug overdoses.While the causes or even the existence of these facts are disputed by liberal/progressive political and academic leaders and their followers, it is also undeniable that the only candidate for the presidency who consistently targeted the increases in violence and drugs under the Obama administration was the candidate who won the election.While the deniers and hecklers continue their resistance, sometimes violently, the new president is working to address the pervasive crime, violence, and drugs that most Americans outside of Hollywood, the Beltway, and academia are witnessing firsthand.In an article in the City Journal in late April, Manhattan Institute scholar Heather MacDonald laid out a game plan on fighting crime for the Trump administration.Among her suggestions is to widely report existing data about the relationship of criminal commission and victimization among different racial groups with police responses, including shootings, to expose the false narrative that police are racially targeting blacks when the data makes it clear that they are targeting criminals.Other suggestions include: evaluating Obama-era consent decrees on police agencies, on the basis of whether they are helping or hindering the ability of police to protect people living in urban neighborhoods from criminals; expanding Department of Justice data collection on the impact that different sentencing and policing policies have on crime and recidivism; cracking down on sanctuary cities; reversing the previous administration's failure to prosecute gun crimes; and pursuing partnerships with private enterprise to refocus prison rehabilitation on productive work and marketable skills development.Most law enforcement leaders have made clear that they would welcome these initiatives, as would the leaders of most states which are experiencing increased crime.California is the exception.For several years, the one-party Golden State has been in denial about the increases in crime which have occurred since it enacted several laws to sharply reduce the consequences for criminals.Although state politicians and academics promised that these new laws would reduce crime, the data indicates the opposite outcome.The FBI Preliminary Uniform Crime Report released in January 2016, which counts crimes in cities with populations of 100,000 or more, found that in California there was a 12.9% increase in violent crime and a 9.2% increase in property crime from January through June 2015.The same report found that large cities outside of California had just a 1.7% increase in violent crime and a 4.2% drop in property crime.In April 2016, the California Police Chiefs Association reported that the 2015 increases in violent and property crimes in the state's largest cities is also occurring in smaller communities across the state.The report projected that California cities with populations of less than 100,000 suffered a 15.25% increase in property crime and a 15.41% increase in violent crime, while smaller cities outside of California had a 6.5% drop in property crime and only a 1.3% increase in violent crime.The report also noted that the increase in property crime in California's smaller cities is the largest year-over-year increase since at least 1960, while the increase in violent crime is the largest year-over-year increase since 1990.The FBI's Uniform Crime Report released last September indicated that for the nation as a whole the 2015 violent crime rate increased 3.0%, while California's rate increased 2-1/2 times as much, 7.6%. (All rates are reported as the number of crimes per 100,000 population.)The property crime rate for the nation as a whole declined 3.4%, while California's increased 7.2%. That is, California's net change in the property crime rate was 10.6% greater than the nation's as a whole.Looking at the country's 10 largest states, all nine of the others had decreases in property crime. Georgia had the largest decline at 10.0%, while Florida had the smallest at 4.1%. California alone had an increase in property crime, and a substantial one.The FBI Preliminary Crime Report released last January indicated that in 2016 violent crime increased in two-thirds of California's largest cities. Data analysis found that of the 69 California cities listed in the report, 46 had increases in  violent crime last year.Some cities saw increases of more than 50% in crimes, including murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. In Los Angeles, violent crime rose 16.8% compared to 2015.Cities with the largest violent crime increases included Moreno Valley (+66.3%), Burbank (+50.7%), Fremont (+41.6%), El Cajon (+27.8%), Santa Maria (+26.1%), Rialto (+22.7%), Riverside (+22.5%), and Pasadena (+18.1%).The largest increases in murder were reported in San Jose (+127%), Santa Ana (+116.6%), San Bernardino (+100%), San Diego (+41.1%) and Berkeley (+35%). Rapes increased in many cities, including in Corona (+166%), Fremont (+73.6%), Fairfield (+70.5%) and Elk Grove (+68.4%).For four years running, all but one of the bipartisan efforts by the California Legislature to reform realignment and Proposition 47 measures that released thousands of criminals from prison and reduced the sentences for most new crimes, failed to get enough votes to pass. Gov. Brown vetoed the only one that did reach his desk, and it was an extremely mild reform at that.Last year, George Soros and Brown pooled $10 million to convince voters to pass Proposition 57, which was promoted as giving nonviolent criminals who behaved well in prison a chance for release on parole.According to the state's district attorneys, for the purposes of Prop. 57 an example of a nonviolent offender is a residential burglar with priors for rape and aggravated assault.In his State of the State address earlier this year, the governor failed to even mention crime. By my rather rigid standards, this constitutes a denial that there is a crime problem. The predictable response from the left is that violent crime is nowhere near as high as it was in the early 1990s, so there is nothing to worry about.Tell that to the family of the police officer in Whittier gunned down last February by an ex-con and violent street gang member who was left on the streets by Gov. Brown's ""Public Safety Realignment"" law, or the thousands of other Californians who have become victims because of it.It is clear that the Trump administration's aggressive new efforts to reduce crime and protect public safety across America will not be felt in California.

124,EL,"Climate Change: We keep hearing the ""science is settled,"" yet once again data emerge showing that there has been no appreciable warming now for 19 years. Memo to global warming advocates: People are starting to notice.Of course, it is pretty clear from the record that temperatures have risen in the past 150 years or so. But that should hardly be surprising, given that the period lasting into the early 19th century was known as the ""Little Ice Age.""But more recently, alarms were sounded over the rise in 2015 and 2016 of global temperatures, even though the rise was a result of a temporary phenomenon — the ""El Nino"" effect of warming seawaters in the Pacific that create higher temperatures and weather disruptions around the world.As Christopher Booker of the Sunday Telegraph in Britain noted this week, after being repeatedly warned about 2016 being ""the hottest year on record,"" we now have arrived at this: ""In recent months global temperatures have plummeted by more than 0.6 degrees: just as happened 17 years ago after a similarly strong El Nino.""By the way, those temperature readings are courtesy of satellites, which provide the most comprehensive and accurate temperature readings of all. Many of the scariest headlines come from far more limited, and localized, temperature readings, which can be deceptive.Scare headlines about disappearing arctic ice are similarly being shown as overblown if not outright false. The Danish Meteorological Institute reports that since December Arctic temperatures have pretty much been below -20 degrees Celsius. Arctic ice and the Greenland ice cap are both expanding, not shrinking.Knowing this, it pays to be skeptical of model-based data — not actual measured ones — that suggest a need to spend massive amounts of money to keep a purely hypothetical threat from taking place. It makes no sense.We've been told that the world will have to spend 2% of GDP, or roughly $1.5 trillion each year, to keep the threat of global warming at bay — even though estimates show that even if everything requested by the Paris Climate Change Accord were done, the effect on global climate would be negligible.What's galling is that, thanks to the fracking revolution, the U.S. is already sharply cutting its emissions of CO2. In February, the American Interest noted that ""U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions hit a 25-year low the first six months of 2016, continuing the progress that the EPA says we made in 2015.""So, temperatures and the output of CO2 are both falling? Meanwhile, recent reporting suggests the models on which the supposed global warming ""science"" is based have turned out to be highly questionable, unable to predict even past warming — something a model is supposed to be able to do.As we noted recently, since the 1997 Kyoto Accord, U.S. output of greenhouse gases has plummeted 7.3%, despite U.S. GDP growing by 52% during that time. Our greenhouse gas footprint is shrinking, not growing. Meanwhile, nations such as China and India that are boosting their output of greenhouse gases dramatically remain untouched by any of the recent anti-global warming agreements — including the damaging one that Obama agreed to in Paris in late 2015, but never submitted to the Senate for approval.Which raises a big question. The Trump administration right now is under intense pressure both here and abroad to remain in Obama's fraudulent Paris climate deal, which, as far as we can tell, is intentionally designed to destroy the U.S. economy and lower Americans' standard of living.Given the bad science and the enormous costs on which the Paris deal is based, why continue to give it any credence at all?President Trump should do himself and the U.S. a favor and withdraw from the Paris deal. As the renewed decline in temperatures shows, the only real threat Americans face is an unholy alliance between global bureaucrats and financially corrupted scientists eager for massive amounts of new spending so that they can stay employed. Time to put them all out of business.RELATED:If Global Warming Is Real, Why Do Government Scientists Have To Keep Cheating?Five Reasons Why Ridicule Is The Proper Response To Global Warming AlarmistsWith Trump, The U.S. Can Escape The Paris Climate Deal TrapIs Global Warming Science Just A Fraud?

127,EL,"Situational ethics define the liberal media. There is no pursuit of truth. There is only a double standard.When former President Barack Obama bowed to dictators in Cuba and Iran, it was ""historic"" diplomacy. When President Donald Trump talks up meeting with autocrats, that's another dangerous and disgusting sign of his lack of respect for human rights.The Washington Post front page on May 2 carried the headline ""Praise for strongmen alarms rights advocates: Trump's vocal affection for totalitarians marks major U.S. policy shift."" Pictures included Russian President Vladimir Putin, Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and the crackpot North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.So, what was different when President Obama launched a Russian ""reset"" with Putin? And when Obama praised Muslim Brotherhood tyrant President Mohammed Morsi in Egypt, that was smart? Did the Post freak out on the front page in 2008 when then-presidential candidate Obama stared down Hillary Clinton and said he would talk to dictatorial regimes, that refusing to talk is ""ridiculous""?You won't find a Washington Post headline on ""Obama's vocal affection for totalitarians.""What about the media's happy talk for murdering brutes? Go back a few months to Cuban dictator Fidel Castro's death. ""Revolutionary remade Cuba,"" read the Post headline. The obit gushed that he was ""a romantic figure in olive-drab fatigues and combat boots"" and a ""spiritual beacon for the world's political far left."" The New York Times preferred to describe him as ""the fiery apostle of revolution.""Do we really need to revisit the media's opportunistic tendency to kiss dictatorial rings to gain access for softball interviews? Should we have to recall Scott Pelley celebrating the ethics of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Dan Rather babbling to deposed Iraqi ruler Saddam Hussein or 20 different anchors lauding Castro to his face?Nevertheless, CNN anchorman Jake Tapper opened his show on May 1 with blazing snark, saying: ""The world according to Trump: Journalists are the enemies of the people, but he would be honored to meet Kim Jong Un. ... President Trump today saying he would be honored to meet where North Korea's despotic dictator under the right circumstances. And that is not the first maniacal and murderous strongman he has opened up to in the past day.""Trump called the North Korean tyrant a ""pretty smart cookie"" on Sunday, and Tapper offered a rebuttal, saying: ""Kim Jong Un had his uncle murdered. That doesn't make Kim Jong Un a smart cookie. That makes him a murderer.""This on the network that confessed it squashed tales of torment and murder for years in order to keep its Baghdad bureau open, to distribute only ""news"" that was acceptable to that great humanitarian Saddam Hussein.Here's another CNN blast from the past. In June 1994, former President Jimmy Carter went to Pyongyang and hugged North Korean despot Kim Il-Sung. CNN anchor Frank Sesno summarized it, saying: ""Jimmy Carter, Korean peacemaker! Did his trip to Korea reduce the threat of war?"" Carter even called the Stalinesque dictator the ""Great Leader"" without getting scalded.And let us not forget CNN was founded by Ted Turner, who did embarrassing interviews with ""murderous strongman"" Fidel Castro and broadcast a documentary in 1988 called ""Portrait of the Soviet Union"" that fawned over the Communist revolution with lines like this howler: ""Once, the Kremlin was the home of czars. Today, it belongs to the people.""Tapper concluded his commentary by quoting Ronald Reagan, saying that ""a violation of human rights anywhere is the business of free people everywhere."" That sounds great. But that same press fought Reagan tooth and nail in his day, assaulting him for being a crazy Red-baiting warmonger for statements like that.It's good for journalists in free countries to question leaders about their commitment to advocating human rights instead of pragmatically enabling dictators. Unfortunately, our media display a reflexive habit of questioning only Republican presidents. The Carters, the Clintons and the Obamas skate free.

128,EL,"There is much to cheer about President Trump's first decisions as president. Conservatives are almost certainly going to love his Supreme Court pick, his stepped-up efforts to deport criminal aliens, the approval of two oil pipelines stubbornly blocked by the previous administration and more.Trump remains a potential time bomb, however, both because of his genuine, anti-trade beliefs and because of his unwholesome character. Leave aside the distractions about crowd sizes and voter fraud. There is an aspect to Trump's egotism that is more than unseemly or clownish; it's aggressive. He enjoys disparaging and demeaning others personally, often about things (like their appearance or their ""time of the month"") that few over the age of 11 would stoop to.These two strands -- Trump's misguided view that trade is bad for America, and his penchant for humiliating others -- came together this week. The president of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, canceled a meeting with President Trump, signaling an escalation of tensions with our southern neighbor. This is entirely our fault.It's one thing to stress getting control of our borders. Even those who believe that immigration is a net positive for the nation agree that illegal immigration must be better policed. But cracking down on illegal immigration should mean getting our own house in order. It should mean policing all of our borders, not just the one with Mexico, and it should mean due diligence about visa overstays.Visitors who overstay their visas amount to at least half, and probably closer to 60%, of those entering the country illegally now. They arrive at airports, not across the Rio Grande. The great wave of illegal crossings from the south crested in 2007 and has declined steadily since. As immigration hawk Mark Krikorian noted in 2015, ""Border crossings really are way down."" Well, some border crossings are way down, others not. More Mexicans cross the border heading south now than north. In other words, net migration from Mexico is negative.One of the blessings the U.S. has always enjoyed is having good neighbors. As Aaron David Miller put it, ""The United States is the only great power in the history of the world that has had the luxury of having nonpredatory neighbors to its north and south, and fish to its east and west.""But that can change. Not content with proposing a totally unnecessary wall across our entire southern border (double fencing is much cheaper, easier to maintain and effective), President Trump felt the need to insult and humiliate Mexico. It began with the accusation that the Mexican government was ""sending"" the illegals who crossed the border and somehow complicit in their traffic of crime and drugs. In fact, the Mexican government cooperates with the U.S. in fighting drug trafficking and other crimes. Just last week, Mexico extradited drug lord ""El Chapo"" to the U.S. for prosecution. Further demeaning our friends to the south, President Trump made forcing Mexico to pay for a wall part of his stump speech and has refused to drop the demand.Naturally, Mexicans are offended and outraged by this insult. ""We're not paying for your f------ wall,"" fumed former Mexican president Vicente Fox. And they're worried, and should be, that Trump has proposed to ""renegotiate"" the NAFTA trade agreement, which he describes as ""the worst trade deal maybe ever signed anywhere, but certainly ever signed in this country.""One reason that fewer Mexicans are attempting to enter the U.S. illegally since 2007 may well be that NAFTA has succeeded in improving the jobs picture there. (Another reason is surely that the birthrate has declined, which always reduces emigration.) Fred Smith, founder and chairman of FedEx, estimates that NAFTA makes the U.S. $127 billion richer every year than it would be without it.So the two areas of maximum importance to stability and prosperity in our hemisphere, trade and mutual respect, are both under assault by our president.It is not written in stone that Mexico will remain a stable nation and friendly neighbor. Mexico is under stress due to falling oil prices, corruption and other woes. The peso has lost 10% of its value due to fears about NAFTA, and as Jose Cardenas notes in National Review, a left-wing, Hugo Chavez-like demagogue named André Manuel López Obrador could stand to benefit from the current uncertainty and understandable resentment.Good fences may make good neighbors. But this wall, and particularly the way Trump has rubbed Mexicans' noses in it, may turn a good neighbor bad fast.

130,EL,"Coca-Cola (KO) will pay $3.15 billion to buy Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) out of an African bottling joint venture after the Budweiser brewer's takeover of the U.S. beverage company's partner in the region.Wednesday's  announcement comes just over two months after the companies said they were in negotiations following AB InBev's completion of its takeover of SABMiller. Coca-Cola also agreed to buy AB InBev's interest in bottling operations in Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Swaziland, Lesotho, El Salvador and Honduras for an undisclosed sum.For Coca-Cola, the acquisition of AB InBev's 54.5% stake in the venture provides a firm footing in a region that is probably one of the last where it can grow its core soft drinks products, said Sasha Naryshkine, an analyst at Johannesburg-based money manager Vestact Ltd. The transaction continues AB InBev's asset pruning following its purchase of SABMiller, coming only days after the brewer agreed to sell its central and eastern European assets to Asahi Group Holdings Ltd.""Considering the speed that this deal was done I would expect AB InBev to continue selling noncore assets quickly,"" Naryshkine said. ""It's a good price for Coca-Cola.""The U.S. drinks maker is looking to speed up the refranchising of its bottling operations as it seeks to reduce exposure to facilities that are more capital-intensive and lower-margin.Consumer and retail companies reported $306 billion in mergers this year, a 45% decline on the $556 billion in 2015, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AB InBev agreed to buy SABMiller for about $100 billion, a deal included in last year's figures.Rothschild advised Coca-Cola on the bottling deal and Lazard advised AB InBev.The deal with AB InBev is subject to relevant regulatory and minority approvals and is expected to close by the end of 2017, the companies said.

Rigs have risen in 26 of the past 29 weeks. Oil rig counts rose by 12 in the Permian Basin and by one in the Eagle Ford. The rig count was flat at 24 Colorado's DJ Niobrara play.Total U.S. rig counts were up by 13 to 637.Brent climbed 2.2% to settle at $55.21 per barrel, up 0.9% for the week. U.S. crude rose 2% to $51.90, up 0.3% for the week.But U.S. shale bellwether Continental Resources (CLR) closed down 0.6% in the stock market today. EOG Resources (EOG) edged up 0.1%. Diamondback Energy (FANG) rose 0.8%. Parsley Energy (PE) added 0.5%. Among oil majors, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 0.3%, BP (BP) climbed 2.1%, Chevron (CVX) rose 0.9% and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) added 1%.IBD'S TAKE: U.S. shale oil companies have been the biggest winners on the OPEC and ""NOPEC"" deals but shale companies still have debt and workforce issues that could hamper a quick uptick in drilling.U.S. shale firms should get a boost next year from rising oil prices after OPEC and top producers outside the cartel agreed to cut production by nearly 1.8 million barrels per day.Goldman now sees West Texas Intermediate crude at $57.50 per barrel, up from a prior outlook of $55 per barrel. For Brent crude, it now sees $59 per barrel up from $56.50. Earlier, Goldman warned that oil could fall to the $30s if OPEC couldn't reach a deal.While it's temping for members to cheat on deals, Saudi Arabia and other big producers are showing signs they will stick to the agreement.""Ultimately, our work on Saudi Arabia's fiscal balance suggests that the kingdom has a strong incentive to cut production to achieve a normalization of inventories, even if it requires a larger unilateral cut, consistent with comments last weekend by the energy minister,"" Goldman analysts said in the note.Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak also said Friday that all Russian oil companies, including Rosneft, will make cuts as part of the deal. And the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. told customers in the U.S. and Europe that it would cut back shipments starting Jan. 1, according to Bloomberg.""Every country is already taking steps to do what they say they are going to do which, by my estimation, will put oil in a global supply deficit early next year,"" Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group, wrote in his morning energy report.But a stronger dollar has weighed on oil prices after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday. Libya also is a drag on prices. The OPEC member is exempt from the output cuts and reports said it reopened a pipeline from the Sharara and El Feel oil fields.Still, the oil market is expected to rebalance next year.Earlier this week OPEC raised the demand outlook for its crude to 32.6 million barrels per day next year, up from 32.5 million barrels. The higher demand, coupled with the cooperation of Russia and other non-OPEC countries to cut production will ""bring forward the rebalancing of the oil market to the second half of 2017,"" OPEC said in its monthly report.RELATED: Chevron Cuts Spending To Keep 'Dividend Printing Machine' Going

132,EL,"During these last twenty-three months of my first term in Congress, I crisscrossed 820 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border between El Paso and Eagle Pass, Texas, many times talking about international trade. Despite the campaign rhetoric, I believe that under a Trump Administration we have a real opportunity to improve North American Competitiveness in the rest of the world through an upgrade of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).This belief was confirmed during several days of discussions on energy, commerce and rule of law in Mexico with business and political leaders.Our recently concluded election cycle has almost made NAFTA a new four-letter word. Supporters of NAFTA have probably inflated the economic gains of the accord and detractors have likely overestimated the resultant job losses. While the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico have grown, there have been both winners and losers.It is undeniable that U.S. trade with Mexico and Canada has more than tripled since the signing of the agreement and, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, goods exported to Mexico and Canada last year supported almost 3 million U.S. jobs — that's over a quarter of the total jobs supported by U.S. exports.According to the International Trade Commission, Canada was the leading market for U.S. exports last year and Mexico ranked second. Canada and Mexico were second and third, respectively, as suppliers of U.S. imports. My home state of Texas exported more than any other state in the Union and Mexico is our number one trading partner, surpassing the next four largest — Canada, Brazil, China, and South Korea — combined.The 29 counties I represent contain more U.S.-Mexico border than any other district in Congress. Being home to nine out of the top 50 busiest land ports of entry in our country, I have learned something very simple — the U.S., Mexico and Canada are not competitors, but partners who build things together. We do not just sell goods to each other, but we jointly produce them. In North America, a product moves across borders multiple times before being finally sold to a consumer.An example in my hometown of San Antonio is the Toyota Motor Manufacturing plant that produces the Tundra and Tacoma pickups. This assembly plant employs 2,299 members of the San Antonio community and supports 356,000 jobs in the U.S.The success of this plant depends upon a trade relationship with Mexico. Based on the geographic proximity to the border, Toyota — as well as all U.S. automakers with production plants in Texas — is able to enhance competitiveness by using auto suppliers' Mexico-based parts operations. Toyota purchases up to $1 billion annually for their Mexico supply chain, supporting final truck assembly in San Antonio.Christopher E. Wilson from the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars described how the phrase ""Hecho en México"" or ""Made in Mexico"" label can be misleading because, ""a large portion of the money U.S. consumers spend on Mexican imports actually goes to U.S. companies and workers … a full 40% of the content of U.S. imports from Mexico was originally made in the United States.""Additionally, U.S. content contained in Canadian imports is 25%.The same, however, cannot be said for Chinese imports, which have only 4% U.S. content. Wilson further accurately explains that China and other Asian economies represent a larger threatening source of competition for the U.S. economy and that continued and improved economic cooperation with Mexico and Canada is one of the best ways for the United States to improve its global competitiveness and defend American industry.In order to grow our economy, we cannot just buy American; we have to sell American throughout the world.By enhancing the existing economic integration in North America fostered by NAFTA, the next Administration has an opportunity to design a more competitive North American marketplace. President-elect Trump has made it clear he is not interested in pulling completely out of NAFTA but rather strengthening it. My suggestion to President-elect Trump's new U.S. Trade Representative, Secretary of State and Secretary of Commerce would be to focus on the following areas as a means of achieving NAFTA 2.0.Regulatory cooperation especially in the energy sector: Combined, Mexico and Canada account for nearly 50% of crude oil imports to the U.S. and the U.S. exports of petroleum products have increased to Mexico by 152% over the last decade according to the Energy Information Agency. The energy relationship between the U.S., Mexico and Canada represents an area of additional growth that can be stifled by an uncertain regulatory environment. Overly burdensome government regulations can reduce market access for U.S. goods, services, and investments. Guidelines, rules, regulations, and laws for government procurement and other regulatory regimes should be transparent and based on sound science, cost-benefit analysis and risk assessments.Intellectual property rights, digital trade in goods and services and cross-border data flows: Strong protection of intellectual property rights leads to innovation that creates new lifesaving drugs or disruptions in industries, leading to new opportunities. Any trade agreement should reflect a standard of protection similar to that found in the United States and Governments should never be involved in the violation of intellectual property rights, including cyber theft and piracy. Electronically delivered goods and services should receive no less favorable treatment under trade rules than physical products, and measures that impede digital trade in goods and services, restrict cross-border data flows, or require local storage or processing of data should be eliminated.Labor and environmental provisions: The American worker can compete with anyone if given a level playing field. All trade agreements should adopt and maintain fundamental internationally recognized core labor rights and effectively enforce labor laws. Likewise, common sense environmental laws that promote and protect clean water and clean air for generations to come should be hallmarks of any deal. The utilization of clean and renewable energy sources should have a common benchmark and the means to hold those who cheat accountable.Elimination of trade distortions and unfair competition favoring state-owned and state-controlled enterprises: Ninety percent of the exporters in Texas are small or medium sized companies. Small businesses should have equal access to international markets, and barriers that disproportionately impact small businesses should be eliminated. Companies should not be regulated by a government entity that is also a competitor, and state-run entities that receive government subsidies should not be allowed in competitive industries. To allow fair completion, trade agreements should combat government corruption by strengthening anti-bribery and conflict-of-interest laws.Lowering barriers to agricultural exports. The United States continues to lead the world in agricultural production, but the majority of the world's consumers and the highest growth markets exist outside of our borders. Protectionist approaches that close off markets or impose arbitrary caps on specific products undercut opportunities for producers and raise prices for consumers.Modern border: When we talk about border security we must talk about international commerce at the same time. Improving the movement of legitimate goods, services, people and animals will allow us to better focus on illegal border traffic. To better facilitate commerce we need to continue to streamline our customs process to eliminate costs, invest in border infrastructure, and modernize the movement of goods and services.It has been almost 25 years since President George H.W. Bush signed NAFTA in my hometown of San Antonio. A lot has changed in American politics and our economy since then.Before the election, Mexico was one of our strongest trading partners and since the election that fact has not changed. Mexico will continue to be a strategic trade partner for North American Competitiveness. Just as we build things together, the United States and Mexico will modernize NAFTA together.

134,EL,"Wasn't one vapid pretty boy named Justin from Canada enough?At least Justin Bieber is eye candy without the heartburn. Justin Trudeau, on the other hand, is the twinkly-eyed boy toy who makes informed adults wanna hurl.For more than a year, the liberal Canadian prime minister enjoyed drool-stained global press coverage as the ""hot hipster"" and ""dreamy sex symbol"" with great hair and a tribal Haida tattoo. He basked in Ryan Gosling-esque memes about his commitment to feminism and touched off ""Trudeau-mania"" with a series of shirtless selfies and photobombs.But this weekend, the sane world saw the baby-faced Commie apologist for the naked twit he truly is.Mourning the death of repressive dictator Fidel Castro, Trudeau hailed his longtime family friend as a ""larger than life leader"" who ""served his people for almost half a century."" Actually, El Comandante ruled with an iron fist and firing squads — serving himself to all of the island's land, private businesses and media, along with his own private yacht, private island, 20 homes, fleet of Mercedes limos and bevy of mistresses.Trudeau's ridiculous mash note to the ""legendary revolutionary and orator"" caused the social media backlash of the year. The hashtag #TrudeauEulogies erupted to mock Trudeau's soft-soaping of tyranny.""As we mourn Emperor Caligula, let us always remember his steadfast devotion to Senate reform,"" one Twitter user jibed in Trudeau-speak.""Although flawed Hitler was a vegetarian who loved animals, was a contributor to the arts & proud advocate for Germany,"" another joked.""Kim Jong Il will always be remembered fondly for his leadership and contributions on climate change,"" another chimed in.Stung, the Canadian tundra hunk's office announced Monday that he will not attend services for his beloved Uncle Fidel, who had served as a pallbearer at his former Canadian PM father's funeral. But if Trudeau thinks the damage to his celebrity brand is temporary, he has another think coming.Our neighbors to the north are now discovering what disillusioned Barack Obama worshipers realized too late: Beneath the shiny packaging of supermodel progressivism lies the same old decrepit culture of corruption.Political watchdogs have been buzzing about Trudeau's shady fundraising ties to Chinese communist moguls. Like Obama, Trudeau promised unprecedented transparency in government — ""sunny ways"" that would shed open light on how the Liberal Party was conducting the people's business. Dudley Do-Right's party declared there would be ""no preferential access, or appearance of preferential access"" in exchange for campaign cash and purported to ban favor-seekers with direct business before the government from attending political fundraisers.Behind closed doors, however, Trudeau was selling out to wealthy Chinese-Canadians and Chinese nationals seeking government green lights for their business deals. According to his conservative critics, Trudeau and the Liberal Party have held 80 such cash-for-access fundraisers crawling with lobbyists and access traders over the past year.The Globe and Mail newspaper revealed last week that Trudeau and his Liberal Party fundraisers had secretly organized one tony $1,500-per-head private residential gala in May attended by Chinese billionaires and bankers gunning for federal approval of projects. Echoing the operations of the Clinton Foundation pay-for-play money machine, the nonprofit Trudeau Foundation and the University of Montreal raked in $1 million from a wealthy Chinese businessman a few weeks after the fundraiser. The donation includes funding for a statue of Pierre Trudeau, who once wrote a book hailing Chairman Mao.The self-aggrandizing Commie fanboy apple doesn't fall far from his cultural Marxist tree.

135,EL,"In October 1945, as he prepared to announce the signing of Jackie Robinson to break the color barrier in Major League Baseball, Branch Rickey visited his friend, the well-known broadcaster Lowell Thomas.""Branch, all hell will break loose!"" Thomas told Rickey, as recounted by Lee Lowenfish in ""Branch Rickey: Baseball's Ferocious Gentleman."" ""No, Lowell,"" Rickey replied. ""All heaven will rejoice.""Rickey, then the Brooklyn Dodgers' president and general manager, is remembered for his courage and foresight in breaking baseball's color line, the unofficial racial barrier which had stood firmly since the late 1800s. Robinson played his first game as a major leaguer 70 years ago this week.Rickey often said that he was drawn to the cause of racial equality when, in 1903, he observed Charles Thomas, the only black member of the Ohio Wesleyan University baseball team, being denied a hotel room in South Bend, Ind. ""I never felt so helpless in my life,"" said Rickey.A 1949 Newsweek profile noted that Rickey spent ""two intensely secretive years"" considering the implications of breaking baseball's color barrier, not even informing the Dodgers' scouting department of his potential move.""When Robinson was signed, it effectively opened up the biggest pool of talent in history,"" said Daniel R. Levitt, co-author with Mark L. Armour of ""In Pursuit of Pennants: Baseball Operations from Deadball to Moneyball.""Rickey's innovations are seen throughout baseball today. He established the first ""farm system"" for developing major league talent and encouraged the use of statistical analysis in evaluating players. He promoted modern training methods and equipment.More broadly, Rickey elevated and exemplified the baseball general manager position, a role that most often had been taken on by an owner or team president. Under Rickey, it would include everything from player development to scouting.Rickey left an ""unmatched resume in the game,"" wrote Armour.  ""As a general manager he dramatically changed how teams find and develop players, and what players are allowed to play the game. His place as the greatest GM in baseball history is secure.""Wesley Branch Rickey (1881-1965) was born in Stockdale, Ohio, to Frank and Emily Rickey. Lowenfish writes that the family had a ""hardscrabble existence,"" trying to subsist on a vegetable farm.Born into a pious family, Rickey's name derived from John Wesley, a founder of Methodism. The name ""Branch"" came from scripture, possibly from a passage in the Old Testament.Rickey studied at Ohio Wesleyan, arriving on campus as ""the picture of the hayseed,"" according to Lowenfish, and experienced a difficult transition. He made his mark on both the football and baseball fields, showing ""plenty of pep and ginger"" as a catcher.In 1903, Rickey witnessed the stellar performance of Charles Follis, who is believed to have been the first black professional football player. Follis' on-field achievements, combined with his poise in the face of racial pressures, impressed Rickey, planting a seed for his determination years later to integrate baseball.After signing a minor league baseball contract in 1903, Rickey debuted in the majors with the St. Louis Browns in 1905. His playing career over four seasons was pedestrian. While catching, he allowed a stunning 13 stolen bases in a single game, setting a dubious record. Following an arm injury and a bout of tuberculosis, Rickey enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School. He also became the baseball coach at Michigan.In 1913, Rickey became an executive for the Browns, signing future Hall of Famer George Sisler and later managing the team for more than two seasons. In 1919, Rickey joined the St. Louis Cardinals as team manager and president. In 1925, he was fired as manager by owner Sam Breadon, a serendipitous move which allowed Rickey to focus exclusively on being an executive.Rickey revamped the Cardinals' roster, laying the groundwork for six pennants and four World Series during his 24 seasons there. He quickly released players who did not meet his standards, turning around a previously mediocre franchise. Rickey acquired eventual stars Joe Medwick and brothers Dizzy and Daffy Dean, who shaped the Cardinals' ""Gashouse Gang"" in the 1930s.Though Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis was dismissive of Rickey's farm system, fearing it would destroy the existing structure, Rickey used it to great success.  The World Series-winning 1942 Cardinals were built with players Rickey's system developed, including Stan Musial, the best player in franchise history.Rickey reshaped the entire organization:""The farm system allowed Rickey to institute the 'Cardinal Way,' "" said Levitt.  ""It was an organizational philosophy extending from the lowest farmhands to the Major League team. It instituted organizationwide training techniques and defined what sort of players the team's scouts would seek.  There became a pride in being a Cardinal. Rickey was the first baseball executive to develop this kind of organizational framework.""Rickey joined the Dodgers before the 1943 season. The core players of Brooklyn's six World Series teams between 1947 and 1956 were acquired and developed under Rickey. With Brooklyn, Rickey hired the first team statistician, opened a team spring training facility in Vero Beach, Fla., and implemented new training techniques, including the use of pitching machines.Rickey was acutely aware that he needed to sign the right player to break baseball's color barrier.""Mr. Rickey knew he needed a superb player or the man wouldn't stand a chance,"" said Carl Erskine, a member of the Dodgers from 1948 through 1959 and a teammate of Jackie Robinson for nine seasons. ""Robinson was a four-letter man at UCLA. His best sport may have been football, not baseball.  And he had to be intelligent.  Jackie certainly was.""Mr. Rickey said to Jackie: 'If a fight starts on the field, I'm picking you. You're quicker, you're faster, and you're stronger. You're going to win the fight. But are you strong enough not to fight? You must tell me that you're willing to commit yourself not to fight.' When Jackie said, 'I think I can do it,' Mr. Rickey read to him a paraphrased version of 'Turn the Other Cheek,' a verse in the Bible, about having the courage to resist.""Rickey, according to Erskine, stressed the Christian faith of both of their mothers in making his plea and offer to Robinson. ""That was a critical moment, often unmentioned in history, when Jackie made the commitment.""Robinson, who debuted 70 years ago this week, was National League Rookie of the Year in 1947 and led Brooklyn to the World Series. Robinson's struggles and triumphs are an integral part of American history, and his importance to baseball and its growth is immense.Rickey encouraged Cleveland to sign Larry Doby, the first African-American to play in the American League, because he did not want to ""corner the market on black players,"" wrote Lowenfish.""Mr. Rickey unselfishly gave up a Hall of Famer for the American League to be integrated,"" said Erskine. ""That was selfless and is too often forgotten.""The African-American players whom Rickey signed, including Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella, were central to Brooklyn's success throughout the 1950s. After losing a power struggle, Rickey left the Dodgers for the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1950. While the team struggled during his time as general manager, Rickey acquired many of the top players on Pittsburgh's 1960 World Series-winning team, including Roberto Clemente.""There was no one quite as good at seeing greatness in raw talent,"" Lowenfish told IBD. ""In evaluating players and hiring quality scouts, nobody quite matches Rickey.""But, while his farm system allowed him to acquire players cheaply, ""he was hated because he made the money and the players didn't,"" said Lowenfish. Erskine said that Rickey was often referred to as El Cheapo, connoting a reputation for miserliness which Rickey had difficulty shaking, even though he sometimes spent profusely on players.Some suggested that Rickey's decision to sign Robinson also had underlying financial motivations.  Others criticized Rickey for never coming to the ballpark on Sundays, as he honored the Sabbath to pay homage to his mother.Erskine said that Rickey tested players, trying to learn how they processed information.""He helped many players excel, through his patience and his unique methods. In spring training, he used to talk to players as they worked out. He wanted to see if you had aptitude.""He had a $5 bill which he'd lay on home plate. He'd say: 'Son, I want you to throw the ball with your hand backwards to the plate. If you can hit that $5, you can have it.' He often gave us little tests which helped him make judgments about players. He wanted to know if you could learn unconventionally.""On Dec. 9, 1965, Rickey died at age 83 of heart failure in Columbia, Mo. Nearly a month earlier, he had collapsed while giving a speech during his induction to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame and never regained consciousness. He was survived by his wife, Jane, and five daughters.""Mr. Rickey was a human dynamo,"" said Erskine. ""He truly kept going until he stopped.""Rickey's most prominent contribution will always be signing Robinson to break baseball's color barrier:""To me, Rickey and Robinson were the right combination,"" said Lowenfish. ""The years when they were together were vital to the country. Rickey was the indispensable man in that move. He also deserves credit for two other revolutions: the farm system and trying to establish the Continental League, a rival league which didn't succeed but which certainly prompted expansion.""What he was able to achieve was remarkable. Given his humble beginnings and extraordinary achievements, Rickey really was the Horatio Alger story writ large.""Innovative baseball executive who helped break baseball's color barrier by signing Jackie Robinson.Overcame: Widespread resistance to baseball's integration and to many of his innovations.Lesson: Importance of thinking strategically and maintaining focus on long-term goals regardless of opposition.""Ethnic prejudice has no place in sports, and baseball must recognize that truth if it is to maintain stature as a national game.""MORE ABOUT LEADERS:Roy Campanella Was A BattlerEwing Kauffman Applied His Winning Formula To Sales, Education, BaseballVin Scully Prepared To Become Baseball's Master Storyteller

136,EL,"Syria: President Trump sent a loud message to Syria's Bashar al-Assad for his use of deadly Sarin gas against his own people: Your days of terrorizing your own people with chemical weapons are about to end. But many others are getting Trump's message, too.""Tonight, I ordered a targeted military strike on the air base in Syria from where the chemical attack was launched,"" Trump said, speaking from Mar-a-Lago in Florida. ""It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons.""Two U.S. ships in the Mediterranean launched 59 Tomahawk missiles, striking Shayrat Airfield in western Syria, which U.S. intelligence believes has been used as a base for deadly chemical attacks against Assad's own people — including the 100 murdered this week in a Sarin gas attack.""Using a deadly nerve agent, Assad choked off the lives of men, women and children,"" Trump said Thursday, visibly moved, adding: ""No child of God should ever suffer such a horror.""So it's official: ""Leading from behind,"" as official U.S. foreign policy, is dead. ""Leading"" is back.Trump has clearly signaled that, after 8 years, the U.S. is ready to re-engage in the Mideast and elsewhere. This has been clear in recent weeks, as he's pointedly met with a handful of moderate and U.S.-friendly leaders in the Mideast to build a new coalition of sorts and to reassert U.S. leadership in the region.Just this week, he met with Egypt's Egypt's President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and with Jordan's King Abdullah II, and he's recently talked with the Saudis and with Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu. He engaged Germany's Angela Merkel, Britain's Theresa May and Japan's Shinzo Abe. It's clear Trump's intent on re-establishing the damaged ties from President Obama's tenure.But equally clear, the strike by 59 Tomahawk missiles against the Syrian military base from which chemical weapon attacks were likely launched, was a broader message from Trump to other recipients:It's not our job to wargame what comes next, or play armchair general. We're not beating a drum for war, or for U.S. troops to be sent back to the Mideast.But Assad crossed a red line, one that poses a danger to all of civilization. The last time he did that, we did nothing. Now, a new president is showing Assad — and the rest of the world — that such murderous acts will have very serious consequences.And that's a very good thing for America and the world.RELATED: Can Trump Clean Up Obama's Mess In Syria?Cold War 2.0: Obama Doctrine Of Weakness Has Reawakened The Russian Bear Kerry's Syrian 'Cease-Fire' Is Really Just Capitulation

137,EL,"On March 16, a 14-year-old girl was allegedly pushed into a boys bathroom at Rockville High School in Maryland and raped by two other students during school hours. Police arrested two freshmen who recently arrived from Central America, 18-year-old Henry Sanchez and 17-year-old Jose Montano. Sanchez, a Guatemalan, has a pending ""alien removal"" case against him. Montano, from El Salvador, is a minor, so his immigration status was not released.The Washington Post reported, ""The two took turns holding the girl down and sexually assaulting her as she cried out, fought back and repeatedly told them to stop, according to police affidavits filed in court.""Montano and Sanchez were charged with first-degree rape and two counts of first-degree sexual offense. This inflammatory story about immigrants was seen as Trump-reinforcing news, so ABC, CBS, NBC, PBS and MSNBC aerobically avoided it. CNN mentioned it once in passing for about 100 words.A reporter for WTTG, the Fox News station in the nation's capital, asked White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on March 21 whether the reported crime would change government policy that insists public schools can't discriminate in admitting students based on their immigration status. Spicer replied: ""It is horrendous and horrible and disgusting what this young woman in Rockville went through. ... I think part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this.""But none of these networks could be shamed into caring.CNN ""Reliable Sources"" host Brian Stelter actually criticized Fox for making the Rockville alleged rape a national story. He said: ""Rapes and assaults and murders are local news stories on a daily basis. But when do they break through to become national news, and when do they not?"" According to him, Fox pumped up the story to help President Trump.Stelter then cited the story of an alleged white supremacist from Baltimore who drove to New York City and stabbed and killed a 66-year-old black man, saying, ""But this story received almost no coverage on Fox or CNN or anywhere else, for that matter — another example of a crime, but not a crime that fit the political agenda of those pro-Trump hosts on Fox.""He was wrong. ABC gave that crime three stories over a 24-hour period, and NBC reported it briefly. One reason for its low profile may not be political. The New York Times first reported that murder in a local ""About New York"" column by Jim Dwyer on page A-19.But CNN's Brian Lowry underlined Stelter's point, saying: ""It really dovetailed with the theme Fox wanted to push: Fox's immigration agenda. ... And I also think the fact that they could use it to buttress their point that this is the kind of coverage you won't get on other media, that's just a win-win for them.""This is the liberal blindness that the ""news"" czars demonstrate. An immigrant convicted of raping or killing someone is an inconvenient fact if you're a liberal, but it's a fact. Somehow, the girl allegedly raped in Rockville is not a fact, just as Kate Steinle being murdered in San Francisco by an illegal immigrant was not a fact. The left must always define what the relevant ""facts"" are, and its supposedly overflowing compassion will never reach the victims of inconvenient crimes.

But not so much for Estee Lauder (EL).MAC remains the No. 1 preferred cosmetics brand among both upper- and average-income young women, but its decreasing market share among those groups prompted her to downgrade MAC parent Estee Lauder to neutral.Specialty beauty stores are still on top: LVMH-owned Sephora dominates as the most-preferred beauty destination for affluent young women (41%), followed by Ulta (20%). Among average-income female teens, they're neck and neck, with Ulta at 29% and Sephora at 27%. Both gained share among the latter group.Broadly, teens are dedicating more and more of their allowance to cosmetics and skincare. Among young women, beauty products now occupy 11% of ""wallet share"" -- i.e. the proportion of annual spending on each category, per Piper Jaffray's definition -- up from 8.5% five years ago and 7% a decade ago.IBD'S TAKE: For a look at Amazon's struggle to elbow out specialty beauty retailers like Ulta and Sephora, read: ""Why Amazon Has Been Powerless Against Beauty Stores.""Separately, Wissink raised her estimates on Ulta following its investor day conference on Thursday, as she sees the beauty retailer becoming ""a much larger business with the potential to double earnings.""Piper Jaffray rates the stock overweight with a 290 price goal.Ulta upped its Q3 and full-year guidance Thursday, prompting an 11.4% surge that largely erased the slide that occurred after the company's last quarterly report, which topped expectations but offered slightly light guidance.Shares of Ulta fell 1.3% in the stock market today.

142,EL,"NEW YORK -- For Doug Stephens, the free event seemed like a good way to learn how to flip homes. An online ad for the December gathering sported pictures of Tarek and Christina El Moussa, the stars of HGTV's ""Flip or Flop"" who buy rundown homes, renovate them and try to sell them for a profit. Stephens watched ""Flip or Flop"" regularly, along with 2.8 million other Americans, so he went.The El Moussas, however, did not show up. In a prerecorded video, the couple told attendees that they were busy working and filming their show. Undeterred, Stephens paid $1,997 for three days of classes and $1,000 for real estate software. But the classes turned into a sales pitch to buy additional courses that cost thousands more, said Stephens, a pastor and teacher from Havana, Fla.""They weren't really teaching at all,"" he said.The El Moussas, like many reality TV stars before them, are capitalizing on their fame by offering pricy classes. At free events in hotel ballrooms, instructors tell attendees that if they pay to enroll in three-day courses, they'll learn how the couple flips homes and also gain access to investors who will give them cash to buy properties, even if they have low credit scores or a weak job history. They'll earn back their money quickly, the instructors say, and will get refunds if they don't flip a home within a certain amount of time. But about a dozen people interviewed by the Associated Press said those promises did not pan out.Stephens said his instructor avoided answering questions, told attendees not to speak to each other and spent a lot of time hyping the program. The homework on the first day was for attendees to call their credit card companies and increase their credit limits, he said. On the last day, Stephens said, the instructor pushed them to buy training sessions, some of which cost around $26,000.The classes featuring the El Moussas are run by Zurixx, an education company based in Utah. Zurixx has partnered with other reality TV stars to create education programs under different names, some of which also have been the subject of complaints from students. The El Moussas' program, Success Path Education, is Zurixx's most popular and the couple receives a percentage of the Success Path classes sold, the company said. The El Moussas are a big draw, with ""Flip or Flop"" ranked as HGTV's second-most watched show. Roger Behle, the El Moussas' attorney, said the couple did not have time to be interviewed for this story.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission, which aims to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive business practices, has received 50 complaints about classes connected to Zurixx since 2013, according to documents reviewed by the AP. And in May, the Better Business Bureau office of St. Louis warned people about Success Path events in the city, citing the more than 150 complaints it received about classes related to the company.Zurixx said the complaints represent a tiny percentage of the more than 370,000 people who have attended its events and the 75,000 who have paid for its products. The company said that nearly all its students have filled out positive evaluations and that it does not mislead people or push attendees to buy additional classes. Zurixx also said that it asks students to increase their credit limits and open new cards to have access to funds for unexpected business costs.Zurixx provided contact information for 13 people, including Billy Batson of North Port, Fla., who said he has flipped 17 properties since he paid $25,000 for a mentor and one of Zurixx's classes two years ago. Batson said he probably could have been successful without the training, but that the process would have taken longer. Batson said Zurixx paid for a trip to Las Vegas for him and a girlfriend so he could talk to students.""It's been a really great life-changing experience,"" he said.This summer, Zurixx held dozens of free Success Path events across the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico as HGTV aired the fifth season of ""Flip or Flop."" More free seminars are scheduled in November, including in New York, Minneapolis and San Jose, Calif. HGTV spokeswoman Audrey Adlam said in a statement that the network and its parent company, Scripps Networks Interactive (SNI), are not associated with Success Path and other classes.Other reality TV stars have had trouble with their real estate classes, most notably Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who starred on NBC's ""The Apprentice."" Trump was sued over his Trump University both by students and New York's attorney general, who contended the real estate classes were merely a vehicle to sell more training that cost as much as $35,000. Trump has said he will prevail in the lawsuits.Customers who took some of Zurixx's other classes had complaints that echoed criticisms of the El Moussas' offerings.Susan Martin went to a free Zurixx event featuring reality TV stars Andy and Candis Meredith of ""Old Home Love,"" a show that aired on HGTV and its sister channel, the DIY Network. She ditched day two of her $1,997 three-day class, she said, because she was told to raise her credit limit and buy $23,000 in additional education. Brian Samuels, a manager for the Merediths, said the couple did not have time to be interviewed because of their shooting schedule.Martin, a retired bookkeeper from Chico, Calif., received a refund after she wrote a negative review on the Better Business Bureau website.MORE ABOUT HOME FLIPPING:Home Flipping Is At Heights Not Seen In Years, With Record Profits2015 Saw Most Home Flippers In U.S. Since 2007, RealtyTrac Says5 Markets Offer Home Flippers Best Profit Potential

144,EL,"The CNN screen graphic at 6 p.m. on Sept. 12 was blunt: ""PENCE REFUSED TO CALL DAVID DUKE 'DEPLORABLE.'"" Donald Trump running mate Mike Pence had granted Wolf Blitzer a 30-minute interview, and what he received in return was a reckless leftist smear.Let's be clear about this interview. Blitzer offered 39 hostile questions or interjections about Trump's tax returns, medical records and charities, and made offensive remarks before asking a single question about policy. In the middle of this contentious exchange, Blitzer arrived at Hillary Clinton's recent gaffe of calling Trump backers a ""basket of deplorables.""Blitzer obnoxiously underlined that some Trump backers were truly deplorable: ""David Duke, for example, (and) some other white nationalists, (would) fit into that category of deplorables. Right?""Pence protested: ""I'm not really sure why the media keeps dropping David Duke's name. Donald Trump has denounced David Duke repeatedly. We don't want his support, and we don't want the support of people who think like him."" Blitzer pushed back: ""So you call him a deplorable. You would call him deplorable."" Pence replied, ""I'm not in the name-calling business, Wolf.""CNN ignored that denouncement of Duke and his backers. It was spiked in favor of a cheap National Enquirer-style ""Pence Won't Deplore Duke"" headline.It's the kind of ""gotcha"" journalism that has the public disgusted with the press. Whatever Pence answered would have been deemed wrong and exploited by the media. Had he uncorked the easy answer and called Duke deplorable, Blitzer and everyone else would have had their headlines read, ""Pence Admits Hillary Was Right."" Pence chose not to give them that luxury, so he gets ""Pence Won't Deplore Duke.""Do you imagine, in your wildest imagination, Blitzer posing any of these questions to Clinton running mate Tim Kaine?In an interview on Aug. 28, Blitzer's colleague, Jake Tapper, asked Pence about Duke's support for the umpteenth time. Tapper at least offered a ""that must really bother you"" expression. For his part, Pence blasted it over the fence, explicitly making a comparison between Duke and Seddique Mateen, saying, ""The fact that...a contemptable individual like that supports my running mate is no more relevant than the fact that the father of a man who killed 49 people in Orlando, Florida, was cheering Hillary Clinton at one of her rallies.""CNN could grill Kaine about a sympathetic September 2 story in The New York Times about the Democratic vice presidential nominee seeking out communist priests as his mentors in El Salvador and Nicaragua. He ""walked miles"" to meet Rev. James Carney, who even the Times reported took ""an extreme view of liberation theology that supported the taking up of arms against military oppressors."" Kaine's mentor, Rev. Jack Warner, believed ""the gospel is an extremely communist document.""Were these priests ""deplorables""? Did Kaine's hunger for their Marxist mumbo-jumbo make him deplorable?Here's another question CNN will never ask:""Hillary Clinton's husband has been exposed as a serial philanderer. He was impeached. He committed perjury, and was disbarred. There is also the accusation by Juanita Broaddrick that he raped her. Is Bill Clinton deplorable?""Instead, Blitzer & Co. unloads smears designed to help Hillary Clinton because they know she is in trouble. And CNN is all too willing to do Clinton's dirty work. Media credibility continues to erode in the polls because there is nothing the press won't undertake to slander conservatives.

146,EL,"Spain is dangling on the edge of a very dangerous fiscal precipice. Not only is its government budget still deep in the red, but its social security fund is about to completely run out of money. Once that happens, the real fun begins.As recent reports note, Spain's social security fund will run out of money sometime in 2018. The reason? ""Bonus payments"" to pensioners, similar to expansions in Social Security benefits for current retirees and women that Hillary Clinton seeks to put in place in the U.S. Unless the Spanish government finds the money to patch the coming social security blowout, deep cuts in benefits or steep rises in taxes will have to be made.And this is a problem that won't just go away with improvement in the business cycle. ""The financial problems are not a temporary problem,"" noted Spain's El Confidencial newspaper, as translated by financial advisor and blogger Michael Shedlock. ""Revenue from social security contributions is not sufficient to meet payment obligations.""How bad is it? Well, so far this year there's a 12.24% deficit in social security contributions vs. the forecast. That gap will likely worsen in coming years, as more workers opt for retirement and fewer people enter the workforce. Payments to some people already deep in retirement may have to be cut — adding to the already disruptive fiscal chaos that has roiled Spain, despite its rebound from the financial crisis.This is not a new problem. Quite the contrary. A study back in 1997 by the National Bureau of Economic Research noted that Spain's social security program has generous incentives for workers to retire early — thus contributing highly to its underfunding in the long run. The study by economists Michele Boldrin, Sergi Jimenez-Martni and Franco Peracchi shows ""that the Spanish (social security) legislation generates strong incentives to retire early and that Spanish workers tend to do so.""Now, at least in part thanks to those incentives, Spain's social security system is on the verge of real insolvency. From a surplus of more than 2% of GDP as recently as 2015, Spain expects the fund to plunge into the red by 5% of GDP by 2021. Such a reversal could well lead to social unrest, riots — heck, even revolution. Already, semi-autonomous Catalonia is seeking to separate completely from Spain and has announced one of its first acts of independence: creating a workable social security system.As the edgy financial website Zero Hedge correctly notes, ""Spain cannot print euros."" That means it will be forced to borrow even more for its bankrupt pension system (if it can — a reluctant EU might not be so thrilled by that prospect), slash benefits or raise taxes — all of which will impose profound pain on a country still trying to dig itself out of its fiscal crisis.We mention this only because but for the grace of God, there goes the U.S. By 2034, the U.S. Social Security program, too, will be bankrupt. We have one edge on Spain: We can print our own money. But as we've found over the past eight years of quantitative easing, that doesn't exactly solve the problem. And anyway, while inflation is virtually zero today, there's no guarantee it will be the same in 18 years.As the Independent Institute's MyGovCost.Org blog noted, ""when (U.S. Social Security insolvency) occurs, the amount of benefits projected to be paid to all Social Security recipients will automatically be cut by 21% across the board."" Spain can expect something similar, but it will only have to wait two years for it — not 18.""The political choices that will shape the future for America's retirees are being made in Spain today,"" the blog post said. That's why it's imperative that politicians stop kicking the Social Security can down the road and address the problem as soon as possible. If not, future generations will curse this generation's political elites for their failure to do anything.Today, the total unfunded liability of the U.S. Social Security program is in excess of $25 trillion. There are already 60 million Social Security recipients, with some 10,000 baby boomers retiring each and every day. Three out of five current retirees depend on Social Security for their income. Knowing this reckoning is coming and doing nothing is malfeasance of the worst sort. 
"
147,EL,"The most absurd plank to appear in either party's platform this year is the Democrats' call to ""raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it."" It is policy written for the nation's very wealthiest enclaves, but incoherent for economically distressed regions. Looked at from El Paso, Texas, where the median hourly wage is only $12.70, a national $15-per-hour minimum sounds no saner than a $29-per-hour minimum would in Washington, D.C.Until very recently, even proponents of minimum wage increases acknowledged that a minimum should retain some rational relationship to a labor market's median wage -- a ratio called the Kaitz Index. If the minimum wage is too far below the median wage, it would fail in its goal of lifting low-wage workers toward the middle class. If it is too close, its distortions would be too great for too many jobs.Writing for the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project in 2014, University of Massachusetts professor Arindrajit Dube observed that ""a natural target is to set the minimum wage to half of the median full-time wage."" Last year, Larry Mishel and his colleagues at the Economic Policy Institute likewise focused their analysis of viable minimum wage increases on the Kaitz Index and targeted a ratio of just over 0.5.The critical insight of the Kaitz Index is this: Minimum wage increases are the byproduct of a healthy labor market, not the catalyst for one. Where the rising tide of wage growth has lifted most but not all ships, a rising minimum might help buoy those otherwise caught below the water line. But in the absence of economic trends that push wages higher, a rising minimum will not create those trends. Rather, it will leave the lowest-wage workers and their employers high and dry.The ""Fight for $15"" movement turns economic reality on its head, pushing a single minimum regardless of whether a market appears capable of bearing it. Henrietta Ivey, the Fight-for-$15 activist who spoke at the Democratic National Convention on Thursday night, might feel that ""$15 an hour should be a no-brainer"" because ""this is one of the richest countries in the world"" and ""it'll help us have a livable lifestyle,"" but those are not arguments that anyone would hire her at such a wage.It is no coincidence that the Fight for $15 first gained momentum in prosperous cities where median wages significantly exceed the national level. The median wage in Silicon Valley is $28; in Washington, D.C., $25; in New York, $22. The University of Washington has found that a minimum-wage increase to $11 per hour in Seattle (median wage of $23) produced little net benefit or cost to workers. But that says little about what undesirable effects an $11-per-hour minimum might produce two hours away in Yakima, where the median wage is $15.71.Such sharp variations across America's enormous and diverse labor market make the federal minimum wage a dangerously blunt instrument. But state and local governments can set higher minimums for their own labor markets, and many have done just that. The 13 states with the highest median wages all have minimum wages at least $1 above the federal minimum. Analysts focused only on the national Kaitz Index of 0.41 (a $7.25 federal minimum wage and a $17.40 median) conclude America lags behind the 0.46 average for a basket of peer economies like Japan (0.39), Canada (0.45), Korea (0.46), Netherlands (0.48), United Kingdom (0.48) and Australia (0.53). But factor in state and local minimums and the American Kaitz Index jumps to 0.47 -- precisely in line with international benchmarks and the 0.5 rule of thumb.Perhaps the federal minimum could go 10% higher; plainly it cannot double. In places like El Paso, Myrtle Beach (median wage of $12.20) and Porterville, Calif., ($13.84), a $15-per-hour minimum would be 10%-20% above the median. Unless the activists and politicians in New York, San Francisco and Washington believe their own cities could handle such distortions in their own markets -- minimums in the range of $24 to $34 -- they should be hesitant to suggest it for the weakest local economies. Nationwide, 20 million jobs are in markets with a median above $20 per hour, but 11 million jobs are in markets below $15; 43 million are in markets below $17.None of this was controversial just two years ago, when Dube wrote for Brookings that ""no one expects that the minimum wage should be set equal to the median wage."" But for large swathes of the country, ""no one"" now includes the Democratic Party. Perhaps a $15-per-hour federal minimum wage is just an opening bid. But if this is the Democrats' version of Donald Trump's ""make Mexico pay for the wall,"" it is just as irresponsible and deserves the same derision.

148,EL,"The Federal Reserve is forcing the bond market to realize interest rates may go up in two weeks.While Fed Chair Janet Yellen had been warning that every meeting is ""live,"" including the March 14-15 gathering, traders remained unconvinced — until this week's parade of Fed speakers hammered home their willingness to consider a hike. The odds of an increase have jumped above 70%, from 40% on Friday, futures prices show. The two-year Treasury yield, the maturity most sensitive to Fed policy expectations, surged to 1.26% Tuesday in New York, heading for its steepest two-day climb this year. The 10-year Treasury yield added 2 basis points to 2.39%.New York Fed President William Dudley capped two days of hawkish comments from U.S. central bankers when he said the case for tightening has become much more compelling. His interview with CNN came hot on the heels of comments from Fed San Francisco President John Williams — saying he expects a rate increase to get "" serious consideration"" at the coming meeting. Fed Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Monday policy makers should raise rates ""sooner rather than later,"" without paying excessive attention to market expectations.""Any time we're as close to full employment and as close to the 2% inflation mark as we are, and monetary policy is still accommodative, the odds of a rate hike at any given meeting should be 50-50, at a minimum,"" said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.Janney has called for three hikes in 2017 since the start of the year, LeBas said. And ""if you're going to get to three, you probably start in March.""President Donald Trump is preparing to outline fiscal plans in a speech Tuesday night, potentially bolstering the case for a tax-cut-propelled pickup in the economy.Looking at the U.S. overnight index swap curve, and adjusting for the spread between the policy rate and shorter-term OIS rates, the probability of a 25-basis-point increase next month stands at about 60%, double the odds of a week ago, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Jeffrey Rosenberg at BlackRock and Mohamed El-Erian at Allianz SE last week joined Fed officials in saying traders haven't been doing enough to prepare in case the central bank moves. At the same time, El-Erian warned in an opinion piece that ""the higher probability of a Fed hike still doesn't make it a done deal.""Even if the Fed has little true intention of accelerating the pace of rate increases, it may be helpful for Yellen that investors aren't complacent about the possibility of such a move. It would leave less work to prepare traders in case circumstances did develop to warrant a boost sooner than the second quarter, when most economists see a rate rise.""Odds of more than 50% are reasonable"" when betting on a March rate move, said Hiroki Shimazu, an economist at the Japanese unit of MCP Asset Management in Tokyo. ""There's an optimistic tone in the stock market. There's inflation pressure. That will push the Fed to hike rates.''The February employment report on March 10 may add evidence the U.S. economy is expanding just as policy makers prepare to meet, he said.Rosenberg said the U.S. is on the verge of a breakout in inflation, and there are signs that costs for goods and services are gathering momentum. The price index for personal consumption expenditures probably hit the Fed's 2% target for the first time since 2012, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before the report Wednesday.A bond-market metric projecting expectations for consumer prices over the coming decade climbed to 2.09% last month, the highest level in more than two years. The so-called break-even rate is derived by calculating the difference between yields for nominal and inflation-linked bonds.The last time futures showed a 10-point jump in expectations for the March hike was Feb. 15, when the U.S. reported an increase in its consumer price index. Yellen also spoke, saying she hopes the economy allows the Fed to raise rates at a faster pace.It'll be up to Yellen to clarify her plans when she speaks Friday.""The market's a bit confused about March,'' said Peter Jolly, head of market research at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Sydney. ""Janet Yellen is going to have to make the case for it if that's what they want to do. I'd still be betting against March.""

""NO WAY! Build plant in U.S. or pay big border tax.""Toyota already builds Corollas from a factory in Mississippi and had produced more than 500,000 units as of early 2015. While Japan's largest automaker is planning to build a Corolla plant in Mexico, it's slated for Apaseo el Grande, Guanajuato. The company has a factory in Baja, near the California border, building Tacoma pickups.Hours before Trump's tweet, Toyota President Akio Toyoda said he would take the president-elect's decisions into account when planning the automaker's Mexico operations, just after Ford Motor (F) scrapped plans to build a $1.6 billion new plant in the country.Toyota's American depositary receipts were down 0.5% in recent action.Trump's attacks on the auto industry are in keeping with his pledges to revive U.S. manufacturing that has steadily migrated to countries with cheaper labor for decades. He targeted General Motors (GM) earlier this week for building a version of its Cruze compact south of the border.Ford's move on Tuesday closely followed a decision by United Technologies' (UTX) Carrier air conditioning unit in November. Carrier was planning to move from Indiana to Mexico but reversed course on Trump's urging.Toyoda told reporters at a New Year's gathering that he'll handle the situation after understanding it better, when asked for a reaction to the news that Ford had canceled a plan to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico following criticism by Trump.

What's more, Castro had left his country in shambles, creating a metaphor of sorts with the broken-down — or out of gas — Cuban economy matching the state of his funeral car.And given the number of coincidences that have gone with the communist dictator's death — that he died on capitalist shopping-fest Black Friday, that he died on ideological archenemy Augusto Pinochet's birthday — it was impossible to not think the gods were at least smiling.Some also pointed to the similarities between Castro's funeral car breakdown and the Ayatollah Khomeini's undignified ending, where his body and coffin were tossed around by an overenthusiastic mob in 1989, or Zairean kleptocrat Sese Seko Mobutu's, whose corpse somehow lacked a proper embalming and stank to high heaven for all the funeral's attending dignitaries in 1997.But there was a more serious message in what we saw on Sunday in the sight of Castro's funeral ashes sitting on top of a military green giant cigar box and being pushed by sweaty soldiers: that the Cuban political elites can no longer shelter themselves from the economic failures they so casually inflict on the rest of the Cuban people.Consider how big and humiliating this breakdown is. All the world was watching as Cuba's supposed communist ""success story"" was put on a final grand parade. The funeral was supposedly to recount the esteem and regard held by Cubans of Castro's 54 year rule. Instead, the procession — symbolic in that it retraced Castro's  final road  to seizing power in 1959. If things couldn't go right for something like this, what could they go right for?Something happened that made the Russian-made jeep malfunction at the critical moment — whether bad maintenance due to a lack of spare parts, an angry or unmotivated workforce paid just $20 a month, a shortage of gas, or a lack of investment and upgrades.  If it was the first possibility, it points to an important lesson from Adam Smith: that of the invisible hand.Smith postulated that large numbers of forces go into the creation of an economy based on individual self-interest and those forces eventually span the entire economic ecosystem, including the players at the top. Austrian School economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek expounded further on it, explaining that central planners, acting without price signals, cannot know what the value or worth of anything is and their acts naturally create shortages and inefficiencies.The Castro elite, modeled on the old Soviet nomenklatura, have shielded themselves well from the depredations of  central planners. Castro had his own island of plutocratic delights and according to Forbes magazine, went out nearly a billionaire with a $900 million fortune. For a long time, he was able to avoid the consequences of socialist central planning. That he wasn't now, suggests a regime that has pretty well spent itself.Bob Gates, in his CIA memoir, ""From The Shadows,"" observed a similar phenomenon as the old Soviet Union reached its last legs — a story about how Soviet leader Yuri Andropov, when he was running the hated and feared KGB, had a group of guests visit him at the Lubyanka prison which was the Moscow headquarters of his great spy empire — only to find that their bearskin hats had been stolen by petty thieves inside the building. It was stories like that suggested to Gates and others that the end was near.It may well be that Castro's regime may be on its way out with that sort of signal too.RELATED:The Fidel Castro Myth Debunked: The Death Of A Tyrant, Not A HeroCastro's Funeral: In Lieu Of Flowers, Send Agents To Arrest The Rest Of The DictatorsBrent Bozell: Media Still Honoring Castro And His Debacle

152,EL,"Both Donald Trump and daughter Ivanka reportedly met Monday with Al Gore to discuss global warming. The Trumps couldn't have wasted their time more if they had spent their entire day eating Cap'n Crunch straight out of a family-size box while watching a marathon of ""The View"" reruns.There's a strong temptation to call Gore a crackpot, but what he truly is is a swindler. He's made a fortune out of peddling fear where none should be. Apparently his net worth is roughly $200 million. Bloomberg News calls him ""Romney-rich."" There's no way he could have reached those financial heights without running the Great Global Warming Scam. Years of his climate exaggerations were gold for his investment portfolio: He makes up stories about a monster, then sells the frightened townspeople the weapons he tells them they need to slay the dragon.But the monster is of course no more real than the Big Bad Wolf. He's been talked about but never seen. There's a reason for that.In January we listed five ways that we know Gore has been running a global warming racket, and as the year closes we are finding items that we could add to the list.First, there are reports that ""show global temperatures are dropping fast.""""It is obvious that the world is cooling after El Nino and nobody knows how much it will as global temperatures bottom out,"" Global Warming Policy Forum science editor David Whitehouse wrote in the Watts Up With That blog.Then there's this from Climate Depot: Princeton physicist William Happer says that ""if global warming were any other branch of science it would have been abandoned a long time ago.""Climate scientists are, of course, obsessed with man's carbon dioxide emissions. But Happer says this is essentially nonsense.""All of the geological evidence indicates that CO2 is a minor player"" in previous eras of warming, he said last week in a Climate Depot podcast.""We've had ice ages with 10 times more CO2 than we have today. That's not supposed to happen, according to current computer models, but it did happen.""Trump ran as the candidate who said that man-made global warming is a ""hoax."" We think it's more fraud than hoax, but his point is well-taken. That he and his daughter would give Gore even a minute of their time is a bit unsettling. The Tennessee preening horse is central to the climate deception and deserves not even a courtesy visit or call from the incoming administration. Let's hope the Trumps walked away from the meeting realizing that Gore is a con man.RELATED:The Growth Of Global Warming Nonsense: Surely We've Reached Peak MadnessFive Ways We Know That Al Gore Is Running A Global Warming RacketGlobal Warming: Trump Is Adult Supervision The Climate Kids Need

153,EL,"A murderous tyrant died the day after Thanksgiving, but instead of giving thanks, the response from some in the civilized West has been to ignore Fidel Castro's reign of terror and keep his propaganda alive. More than a few national leaders will even attend his funeral.But in doing so, these ""mourners"" would self-identify as ""leaders"" who aren't fit for the job. No honorable person would attend this barbarian's funeral. The decent people of their countries should have every one of them arrested the moment they return home, as the local law allows.On what charges? That would depend on the country. Certainly any government official from the U.S. who would attend should be charged with treason, an offense so serious that it is the only crime defined by the Constitution. One of its core elements is giving enemies of this country ""aid and comfort.""Of course the enemy of the U.S. in this instance is not the people of Cuba but the Castro regime that has committed some of the worst atrocities in our Hemisphere in history. Any American who would attend Castro's funeral would be providing that regime with aid and comfort on the world stage.The first national leader to be arrested should be Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau – probably the most useful of all the idiots and certainly the most idiotic of them all. But he can't be arrested for treason, since Canada's treason law doesn't apply to this case, and he might not even go anyway.However, this witless pretender committed a crime against decency when he hailed Castro's ""dedication and love for the Cuban people."" He also called him a ""remarkable"" and ""larger than life leader who served his people"" and felt ""deep sorrow"" after learning of Castro's death.Predictably, because these points are always the last refuge of Castro apologists, Trudeau praised the ""significant improvements"" El Jefe made ""to the education and health care of his island nation.""Anyone who would actually believe the regime's propaganda about near universal literacy deserves to be treated by the health care system that everyday Cubans have to endure. Halfway thinkers such as Michael Moore have promoted the Cuban health care system as a model.And maybe it works well for a few top party members and moneyed travelers.But the facilities the average Cuban is treated at are ""filthy"" clinics and hospitals where ""patients have to bring their own towels, bed sheets, pillows, or they would have to lay down on dirty bare mattresses stained with blood and other body fluids.""Rivaling Trudeau for useful idiocy is former President Carter. In a statement he said that he and wife Rosalynn shared their ""sympathies with the Castro family"" and remembered ""fondly our visits with him in Cuba and his love of his country.""It would be a surprise if Carter didn't attend, given his love of dictators. If he goes to Havana, I suggest he just stay. Apparently it is his kind of country.It's unclear at this point if outgoing President Obama will travel to Castro's funeral. Reports say he is ""pondering"" attending. If he goes, then he deserves the treatment that anyone who engages in treasonous behavior gets. Arrest him.He should not be protected by the office he has shamed. Nor should Vice President Joe Biden or Secretary of State John Kerry if either one or both is assigned to go. If they do, arrest them and their boss who gave them their orders.If this sounds radical, remember that the political left certainly believes presidents can and should be arrested. Moveon.org even got a positive response to a petition demanding the arrests of President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for war crimes.For those who don't believe the Castro regime to be an enemy of the U.S., consider this: Castro made an alliance with the Soviet Union, the Cold War enemy of America, and invited the belligerent communist state into our back yard.The 1962 Cuban missile crisis that followed could have begun a nuclear war that would have claimed millions of U.S. civilian casualties. Never forget than Castro gangster Che Guevara was publicly in favor of using nuclear weapons on New York City. So was Fidel.Naturally a snake basket of deplorable European leaders will attend. But that sort of foolishness should be expected from socialist Europeans who, as a class, are the least-sophisticated thinkers on Earth, though they try hard to position themselves as wise.Expect Latin American despots Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Nicolas Maduro from Venezuela and others to also be there. And what an opportunity it could present. They could be in the same place at the same time, allowing agents from The Hague to arrest them all at once for the cruelty they've inflicted on the people of their countries.In lieu of flowers, please send your oppressors to Havana where they can be scooped up and prosecuted for their crimes.RELATED:The Fidel Castro Myth Debunked: The Death Of A Tyrant, Not A HeroDespite Obama's 'Normalization,' The Castros' Cuba Is As Repressive As EverAfter Kissing The Cuban Snake, Much To His Surprise, Obama Gets BitObama Says He 'Welcomes' Castro's America Bashing

154,EL,"United Airlines (UAL) delayed delivery of $5 billion in Boeing (BA) jets on Tuesday, following a similar delay from Southwest Airlines (LUV) in June, and may add more used jets to its fleet as carriers look to cut costs.United said it would delay accepting 61 737-700s it ordered from Boeing earlier this year but didn't give a new delivery date. The carrier will still take delivery of four of the jets ordered but upgrade them to the larger 737-800.United said the delay will save the airline $1.6 billion in capital costs and come as United looks to improve profitability through 2020 in an effort to beat out rival Delta Air Lines (DAL).United shares climbed 5% to 66.06 in the stock market today, coming amid its investor day Tuesday and late Monday disclosure from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) that it has bought a stake in United Airlines, Delta and American Airlines (AAL) in Q3. Buffett also said Berkshire has bought Southwest shares after Sept. 30.Boeing fell 1.25% to 148.11. Southwest added 2%. Delta gave up most of its gains to close up just 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: The delivery delays are trickling down to aerospace supplier TransDigm, which gave weak 2017 guidance and said it is cautious about the commercial transport aircraft market.In June, Southwest said it would delay delivery of 67 Boeing 737 Max8 planes by as much as six years, but would accelerate six 737-800 orders to 2017 from 2018 as it will retire older 737s. And in July, American Airlines pushed back the delivery of 22 Airbus (EADSY) A350 widebody aircraft.Meanwhile, oil prices remain cheap after crashing two years ago. This has made flying older aircraft economical and reduced the need for newer planes with more fuel-efficient engines.Boeing has said cheap fuel hasn't affected long-term demand for aircraft, but carriers are able to push back delivery of new models by deploying used planes.Meanwhile, the company said late Tuesday that it is consolidating facilities in its defense and space business, transferring some jobs and closing sites in El Paso, Texas, and Newington, Va. The net result is a reduction of 500 positions. Boeing has trimmed its workforce by almost 17,000 this year.RELATED: Boeing: 'Realistic Possibility' Of Midsize Jet, Stretch 737; Stock In Buy ZoneUnited: Airlines Within Airlines Are 'Doomed To Fail'Warren Buffett, Who Called Airline Stocks A 'Death Trap,' Invests In Big 4Boeing Gets $3.2 Billion China Southern Order As China Travel Booms

155,EL,"Financial guru Mohamed El-Erian says the struggles of Germany's Deutsche Bank could pose a threat to expansion in the European economy even if the danger isn't as severe as the worldwide freeze of credit markets in 2008 after the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings.""It is not a Lehman moment. It is not a situation that ends up causing a sudden stop to the global economy in which growth collapses, trade collapses,"" El-Erian, Allianz SE's chief economic advisor, said Thursday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. ""Why? First, the rest of the banking system, particularly in the United States, is stronger. Second, Deutsche Bank actually has liquidity and has access to the (European Central Bank).""Deutsche Bank stock has plunged by almost half this year amid concerns that the costs to resolve regulatory probes will erode the company's financial strength as Chief Executive John Cryan also contends with tougher capital requirements and diminished trading revenue. Bloomberg News reported last week that some hedge funds moved to reduce their financial exposure to Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest lender.""There is uncertainty,"" especially about the company's hard-to-value assets, said El-Erian, adding that he'd like to see improved transparency. ""If we're not careful, it is going to create another headwind to European growth. It is a warning that Deutsche Bank needs a new business model.""Cryan plans to eliminate thousands of jobs as part of an overhaul announced last year to help boost profitability. He told Germany's Bild newspaper last week that he doesn't plan to raise capital and ruled out government assistance.El-Erian's remarks build on other comments he's made in recent months about the resilience of the financial system after U.S. banks built their capital following the credit crisis. When U.K. voters opted in June to exit the European Union, El-Erian spoke about how the shock wouldn't be as severe as when Lehman collapsed.The Bank of England helped stabilize markets there with a suite of stimulus measures including the reduction of interest rates in August, he said Thursday. Still, El-Erian has called the U.K. vote part of a larger, and troubling, trend against global commerce at a time when political divisions immobilize democracies from taking measures to stoke economic expansion.""The biggest risk is you don't get the fiscal stimulus, you don't get the structural reforms, but you get the populist reaction against trade,"" El-Erian said. ""For me, the biggest risk is that you don't actually transition to a better growth model, you just weaken the existing growth model further.""

156,EL,"To bring back customers following last year's foodborne illness scare, Chipotle has deployed chorizo, better food-safety protocols, promotions, this love story video, and  even a drone pilot program.But customers still appeared squeamish. Traffic at the fast-casual Mexican chain was still disappointing, CNBC reported Tuesday, citing a report from M Science on StreetAccount.Shares closed down 3.4% at 423.02 on the stock market today, after nearly retaking their downward sloping 200-day line Monday for the first time in a year. Meanwhile, Taco Bell parent Yum Brands (YUM) rose 1%, while Qdoba parent Jack In The Box (JACK) fell 1.7%. El Pollo Loco (LOCO) edged up 0.4%, and Del Taco (TACO) dipped 0.3%.Chipotle's stock has tumbled since last year. The broader restaurant sector, meanwhile, has struggled to compete with cheaper groceries, their own competitive value deals and broader consumer anxieties.IBD'S TAKE: Despite restaurant stocks' struggles, shorter-term opportunities do exist. For more see this story  about restaurant stocks, and IBD's column The Short Side. In July, Chipotle said its efforts to bring back customers were paying off and touted its Chiptopia loyalty program, which had attracted more than 3.6 million participants by then.Those efforts, the company said, had helped cushion falling same-store sales that month. For Q2, comp sales still plunged 23.6%, though that was an improvement over Q1's 30% dive.More changes could be coming — activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square in September disclosed a 9.9% stake in the fast-casual chain, prompting speculation on how he might influence the company.RELATED:Do McDonald's Japan Sales Point To 'Pokemon Go' Fatigue?Why The Next Apple Could Come From A Drone Wildcatter

In turn, Didi will become the de facto ride-hailing leader in China, valued at more than $35 billion. Uber's most recent valuations put it north of $68 billion.Verizon Communications (VZ) agreed to buy Fleetmatics (FLTX), a vehicle tracking system maker, for $2.4 billion, or $60 per share. The acquisition expands Verizon' push into web-connected vehicles, part of the Internet of Things.

Merck (MRK) had succeeded with a similar patient group in a trial of its competing drug Keytruda, though it was aiming at a smaller potential market. Merck stock jumped 10.4%, hitting its highest level since June 2001.Earlier, Merck was reported to be talking with Biogen (BIIB) about a possible Biogen buyout, as was Allergan (AGN). This further boosted Biogen's stock a day after its partner Ionis Pharmaceuticals (IONS) announced the unexpected success of a clinical trial of nusinersen, a treatment for a rare spinal disease with blockbuster potential.

Department stores, grocery stores, restaurants and airlines also declined, but recovered somewhat by week's end.The sell-off among consumer stocks triggers a warning for the broader U.S. economy amid falling business investment and homebuilder spending. Consumer spending rose at a strong 4.2% annual rate in Q2, but if that falters, the economy may not be able to match its anemic Q2 GDP growth of 1.2%.Texas Roadhouse (TXRH) beat Q2 earnings estimates, with EPS up 57% to 47 cents, but revenue growth of 12% to $508.8 million missed views.

159,EL,"Martin Marietta Materials (MLM) fell well short of second-quarter forecasts Tuesday after rival Vulcan Materials (VMC) badly missed quarterly estimates Monday.Martin Marietta, which makes crushed stone, sand and other aggregates for the construction industry and supplies chemicals to various industries, reported a 56% increase in second-quarter earnings per share to $1.90 on a 7.7% hike in revenue to $915.40 million. Analyst consensus was for $2 EPS and $946.74 million revenue.The wide earnings miss dashed hopes that Martin Marietta would record a second straight quarter of better-than-expected earnings. It beat earnings forecasts in the first quarter after missing the prior four straight quarters.Coming as it did after Vulcan badly missed, Martin Marietta's results raise a red flag about strength of the construction industry recovery, although it, like Vulcan, blamed the miss largely on inclement weather.Martin Marietta Chairman and Chief Executive Ward Nye said in a written statement that aggregates pricing rose, and when combined with cost cuts, that led to a 340 basis point increase in gross profit margin to 23%.""This gross margin expansion was achieved despite record or near-record rainfall and its attendant effects in many of our key markets, notably Texas, North Carolina and Colorado,"" Nye said. He added that the El Nino weather effect, which causes more storms and rainfall than normal in parts of the country, began in spring of 2015 and concluded at the end of May. With that gone, construction activity will likely pick up again.Martin Marietta shares closed up 1.1% at 198.50 on the stock market today, remaining in buy range after breaking out early last month.IBD'S TAKE: After consolidating from last September through the first part of July, Martin Marietta's stock is trying to stay above the 193.97 entry point it passed on July 7. To see how it fares vs. other big construction suppliers go to the IBD Stock Checkup.Rival Vulcan rose 0.2% to 116.56, after a 6% loss on Monday when it dropped below its 50-day average. It ended below that support line Tuesday. Vulcan Materials missed on both earnings and revenue growth Monday. In addition to bad weather, it cited project delays, indicating it could return to stronger growth later this year.Meanwhile, Martin Marietta and Vulcan continue to benefit from the housing recovery and will also likely get a boost from the $305 billion federal highway bill signed into law last December that will begin to take effect later this year and roll out over the next five years.Among other large construction materials suppliers, Eagle Materials (EXP) fell 2%, Summit Materials (SUM) dropped 4.3%, and Ireland's CRH (CRH) retreated 0.4%.

161,EL,"Coordinated attacks on passengers at Istanbul's international airport killed at least 41 people on Tuesday as the fallout from Syria's civil war tore through the terminal at one of the busiest travel times of the year.Islamic State is likely responsible for the killings, Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said in televised remarks. Once an affiliate of al-Qaeda, Islamic State carried out beheadings and crucifixions as it took parts of Syria and northern Iraq. While losing ground in recent months, it is striking abroad more frequently and claimed responsibility for similar airport attacks in Brussels in March.""First I heard the gunfire, then the explosions,"" Koray Arslan, who was at the nearby domestic terminal, said in a phone interview. ""They were very powerful. I could feel the tremors under my feet.""The attacks, which also injured about 150 people, went off in rapid succession at the airport around 10 p.m. Many of Turkey's children ended school terms this month, which coincides with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.The ""attack shows terrorism is a global threat,"" Yildirim said from the Istanbul airport, where he assessed the situation and met with emergency personnel. ""Our country has the necessary power and determination to overcome over these heinous attacks.""Istanbul Governor Vasip Sahin said three suicide bombers took part in the attack near security checkpoints at the entrance to the airport's arrivals hall. Justice Minister  Bekir Bozdag told lawmakers in parliament that one attacker had sprayed gunfire from a Kalashnikov rifle at people around him before blowing himself up.None of the attackers got past security controls, according to a Turkish official who asked not to be identified because he's not authorized to talk to the press. He said two of them detonated their vests at the arrival hall, and a third in a nearby parking lot.Turkish Airlines, the national carrier, has suspended all flights until 8 a.m. on Wednesday.There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Both Islamist and Kurdish militants have carried out bomb attacks in Turkey in recent months, hammering the nation's vital tourism industry.Erdogan said in an e-mailed statement that the Istanbul airport attack was an effort to hurt Turkey's image. ""For the terrorist organizations, there's no difference between Istanbul and London, Ankara and Berlin,"" he said.Foreign citizens are among the dead and injured, although the majority were Turks, the Turkish official said.The attack is ""yet another reminder, as if any was needed, that Turkey faces the perfect storm of terrorist threats,"" Anthony Skinner, a director with U.K.-based forecasting company Verisk Maplecroft, said by e-mail. The spread of violence in Turkey is scaring off tourists. Last month saw the biggest slump in visitor numbers on record and travel to the country has dropped for 10 straight months.The attack is also the latest to target airports and the aviation industry in the Middle East and Europe, coming three months after suicide bombers struck Brussels airport. It serves as reminder of the vulnerability of airport lobbies and other public places where large numbers of people congregate, said Hans Weber, an aviation consultant in San Diego.""The probability of copycat attacks goes way up high after one of those attacks,"" said Weber, who advised the U.S. federal government on airport security issues following the Sept. 11 attacks. ""From a terrorist perspective, Brussels was a success. You can see how they would be motivated to copy that.""Last year, a Russian passenger jet was brought down over the Sinai Peninsula after taking off from the Red Sea resort of Sharm El-Sheikh. Islamic State's affiliate in Egypt claimed responsibility for the incident.The U.S. is ""still collecting information and trying to ascertain"" who carried out the Istanbul blast, Secretary of State John Kerry said at a conference in Aspen, Colorado. He said such attacks have become ""daily fare"" at a time when the world needs to counter violence by non-state actors.The White House condemned the attack and expressed support for Turkey, a NATO ally. Both the main candidates to take over from President Barack Obama also weighed in. The presumptive Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, said the U.S. must ""deepen our cooperation with our allies and partners in the Middle East and Europe,"" and her likely Republican opponent, Donald Trump, said the U.S. must ""take steps now to protect America from terrorists.""Earlier this week, Erdogan ended a six-year rift with Israel and unexpectedly moved to mend ties with Russia, as he attempts to draw a line under diplomatic confrontations that had sapped the economy and left him increasingly isolated in the region.""This only affirms how it makes sense for Turkey to find more allies and narrow the battlefields,"" Nail Olpak, head of the Musiad business group said in a statement. The business group is allied with Erdogan. ""People have been massacred at a time of increasing hope,"" Olpak said.

162,EL,"This week, mosquitoes capable of transmitting Zika start biting in Florida, the Gulf States, and Southern California.It's the ""virus from hell,"" warns Peter Hotez, Dean of Baylor University's School of Tropical Medicine. He's urging women to delay getting pregnant. Hotez worries that expectant mothers in these states are already being bitten, and next spring they'll ""start giving birth to brain-damaged infants.""Doctors are investigating whether infants -- up to age 1 -- also could be impaired by these mosquito bites because their brains are still developingMeanwhile, New Yorkers face a different threat: sexual transmission. It's unknown whether local mosquitoes will spread the virus. But even without mosquitoes biting, New York already has more than any other state. The virus is being brought here by immigrants and travelers exposed in infested areas like Puerto Rico, Brazil, Honduras and El Salvador. Their sex partners need to know that the virus can survive in semen for six months or longer and also possibly spread through deep kissing.Dating tip: Ask to see his or her passport.The gravest danger is to women who can get pregnant, but taxpayers will also feel the impact. Area hospitals, including Mount Sinai and North Shore University Hospital, are preparing for a surge in Zika maternity cases. Health officials refuse to disclose how many will be uninsured immigrants whose health bills will be paid by taxpayers.Any pregnant woman -- here legally or not -- can get emergency Medicaid to cover prenatal care and childbirth. Babies born in the U.S. are automatically eligible for lifetime care if disabled, possibly costing $10 million per child.Anticipating public outrage, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiding the issue. The agency labels all Zika infections brought into the U.S. as ""travel related"" -- lumping together Americans who caught it on a trip and migrants coming here for care.Texas clinics are already seeing pregnant women from Central America with Zika.Next step: Looking for local mosquitoes carrying the virus. It's like ""looking for a needle in a haystack,"" Hotez says, describing the search in Texas. Health authorities won't actually know if Zika is being spread by mosquitoes until ""a patient comes in (with a fever, achy joints, or a rash) ... and a physician has the wherewithal to order a Zika test.""You can't buy a Zika test in a drugstore. But health departments are preparing to test patients exposed in affected countries or complaining of symptoms. Results take up to 20 days. New York City will be testing ""very large"" numbers of women for Zika, according to Deputy Health Commissioner Dr. Jay Varma. So far, 18 pregnant women have tested positive.A positive test means her unborn child could develop birth defects that doctors originally called microcephaly but now term fetal brain disruption syndrome. The virus halts growth of blood vessels in the unborn child's brain, causing the skull to collapse because of the absence of brain tissue inside.""Once a pregnant mother gets infected, that's it,"" says Hotez.But state and local health departments in the Gulf region are ""absolutely"" unprepared to combat Zika mosquitoes.That's also true in California, where the risk is high from Los Angeles to San Diego. Exterminating these mosquitoes ""is unrealistic with current budget and staffing limitations,"" says Chris Barker, epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis.Democrats accuse Republicans in Congress of endangering the nation's women by failing to rubber-stamp President Obama's $1.9 billion Zika emergency funding request. Nonsense. Only about one-third of the money is intended for the 50 states, and a mere sliver of that is for mosquito eradication. A whopping $500 million is foreign aid for Central and South America. Memo to lawmakers: Read the bill.CDC officials blather that a disease anywhere is a disease everywhere. Right, and hunger anywhere is hunger everywhere, too. We still feed our own kids first.No one can predict how the Zika threat will play out, but until we know, the priority needs to be protecting residents of the 50 states and Puerto Rico.

163,EL,"The home of the ""Happiest Place on Earth"" has been breeding killer jihadists and Muslim zealots for years.Omar Mateen, the cold-blooded mass murderer who gunned down 49 people at an Orlando gay nightclub and wounded 53 more before police took him out late Sunday, may have worked alone. But he operated in the larger context of a teeming, terror-coddling paradise.While tourists from around the world soak up sunshine and dreams at Disney World, Islamic extremism festers around them.Schools: The Muslim Students Association, founded by the radical Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood whose stated purpose is to wage ""grand jihad"" on America, is active at the publicly funded University of Central Florida in Orlando. The group defiantly brought unindicted terror co-conspirator Siraj Wahhaj to campus. He's the black Muslim convert and inflammatory imam tied by federal prosecutors to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and New York City landmarks bombing plots.Wahhaj served as a character witness for convicted terror mastermind Omar Abdel Rahman (the Blind Sheik), called for replacement of America's ""constitutional government with a caliphate"" and roots for our nation to ""crumble"" so Muslims can take over. UCF funded a Muslims ""da'wa"" (conversion) seminar and with an endowment by the Saudi-supported International Institute of Islamic Thought sought to create an Islamic Studies chair to ""help the Ummah regain its intellectual and cultural identity and re-affirm its presence as a dynamic civilization.""The IIIT, also a Muslim Brotherhood affiliate, donated at least $50,000 to a ""think tank"" run by Sami al-Arian that served as a front group for the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. While al-Arian, a Muslim Brotherhood member dating back to the 1980s, served as a computer science professor at Tampa's University of South Florida, he toured the country raising money for terrorism overseas.Investigative reporters and the feds caught al-Arian on tape inciting his attendees against America, Israel ""and their allies until death."" The left-wing academic pleaded guilty to a terror-fundraising conspiracy charge in 2006.Al-Arian brought Palestinian-born Ramadan Shalah to teach at USF and head his ""think tank"" for a spell. Shalah left the school in 1995 and resurfaced as head of Syria's Islamic Jihad. He remains one of the FBI's most wanted indicted terrorist fugitives.Apologist officials at USF, first exposed by counter-jihad researcher Steve Emerson as America's ""Jihad U,"" turned a blind eye to the terror helpers among them.Mosques: Mateen's homicidal hatred for gays didn't exist in a vacuum. Mateen's neighborhood mosque in nearby Fort Pierce, Fla., was also the house of worship of Moner Abu-Salha, an American jihad recruiter and suicide bomber who blew himself up in Syria last year. The Palm Beach Post reported this week that Abu-Salha had posted videos of an imam's death-to-gays rant on Facebook.Marcus Dwayne Robertson (a.k.a. Abu Taubah), a former U.S. Marine turned career criminal and bodyguard to the Blind Sheik, headed another mosque, Masjid Al-Ihsaam, in Orlando. He also founded the Orlando-based Fundamental Islamic Knowledge Seminary in 2008 and railed against gays and non-Muslims. Mateen was enrolled in Taubah's course.Just weeks before the Pulse nightclub massacre, another Orlando mosque, the Husseini Islamic Center, hosted a guest imam who had preached that ""gays must die"" and that Muslims should not ""be embarrassed about this ... let's get rid of them now.""Also in Orlando, the al-Rahman mosque led by Imam Muhammad Musri made headlines in 2010 after holding a fundraiser for the terrorist group Hamas.In Tampa, Sami al-Arian founded the al-Qassam mosque named after an infamous Syrian terrorist. Last fall, the mosque -- owned by the North American Islamic Trust, an unindicted terror co-conspiracy organization -- invited an exiled Muslim Brotherhood instigator and Hamas cheerleader to speak.In South Florida, the Darul Uloom Institute mosque in Pembroke Pines counted al-Qaida jihad pilot Adnan el-Shukrijumah (allegedly killed in a raid in Waziristan by the Pakistan military in 2014) and convicted jihadist Imran Mandhai -- who plotted with fellow mosque attendees Hakki Aksoy and Shueyb Jokhan to blow up power stations, synagogues and a National Guard armory -- among its worshipers.Shukrijumah's brother still lives in Broward County near the Darul Uloom mosque and has posted social media videos condemning ""moderate"" Muslims, blaming 9/11 on Jews and promoting the caliphate. Darul Uloom's imam is a gay-bashing, Christian-bashing, Jew-bashing bigot who has publicly stated that at least one of the 9/11 hijackers prayed at his mosque.Jails: Florida's prisons and penitentiaries are unfettered cesspools for jihad radicalization and recruitment. Convicted al-Qaida dirty bomb plotter Jose Padilla (a.k.a. Abdullah al Mujahir) was introduced to Islam while serving time for an armed road rage incident in Sunrise, Florida. The above-named Abu Taubah radicalized nearly 40 fellow inmates while behind bars on a weapons conviction. He was freed last summer by U.S. District Judge Gregory Presnell after time served despite prosecutors' pleas to add 10 years to his sentence based on enhanced terror charges.Gun-grabbers and bleeding hearts, wake up and stop playing Mickey Mouse politics. The problem isn't weapons. It's the weaponized Muslim hate-mongers and jihad enablers operating openly in our midst.

164,EL,"More than two-thirds (67%) of African-Americans are now investing in the stock market, according to Ariel Investments' 2015 Black Investor Survey, released this year. That's not the all-time high in percentage terms. But it's up 7 percentage points from Ariel's last such survey in 2010.Will this uptrend continue? To get answers, IBD spoke with Mellody Hobson, president of Chicago-based Ariel Investments, an African-American-owned mutual fund company with more than $10 billion under management. Hobson is also chairman of the board of trustees of Ariel Investment Trust and board chairman of DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.IBD:  In your surveys, stock investing by African-Americans, as a percentage, peaked in 2002, then generally slid until perking up in 2015. What's been causing the swings?Hobson: The market's dot.com period had been a remarkable time for investors. But when that bubble burst, the result was dramatic: It threw novice, first-time, African-American investors out of the market, and people who had gotten burned became leery of stocks. Since then, there's been a return to the market, especially via the growth of automatic enrollment in 401(k) plans.IBD: From here, will stock investing by African-Americans be growing more consistently?Hobson: With the wide use of auto enrollment in 401(k) plans, my gut instinct is yes. And millennials are likely to be a big part of this.But there are cultural issues -- we've identified five of these -- that have been holding us back. These include limits on market knowledge; misinformation -- such as you have to be wealthy to be an investor; and serious issues about trust in the market and fraud. African-Americans have also lacked the context to figure out how to get actively involved, and as first-time investors, we (the African-American community) tend to invest very conservatively. For instance, we consider buying a CD to be investing. These factors make it hard to catch up soon to the level of stock investing by whites (at 86% of respondents in 2015, according to Ariel's survey).IBD: However, your data show African-Americans are noticeably more optimistic than whites (75% vs. 50%) about the economy and more bullish on the stock market (65% versus (53%). Why?Hobson: It comes down to expectations: Traditionally, we've had lower expectations than whites. That's left us with more room for growth in this area: If you've faced discrimination, or fewer opportunities, you can be discouraged, or you can hope that things will get better. We tend to hold out hope.We've always been rooted in the idea that things will get better. We've been religious, and the church has always been a big factor in our lives. So if you overlay that with our views on the economy and bullishness, you'll find they're consistent.IBD: Do you think the recent violence in this country dims this optimism?Hobson: The African-American community would say that this has been going on a long time. As blacks we were taught about discrimination as children. It's just that recent events have made the lingering problems more evident to whites.But I don't think it puts our (positive) attitudes on hold because the undercurrents have always been there.IBD: Speaking of optimism and bullishness, your survey shows stocks are now African-Americans' top-choice investment. Why?Hobson: Traditionally, real estate had been African-Americans' be-all and end-all, the bricks and mortar that we understood and which could provide rental income. But attitudes changed as the real estate bubble burst in the 2007-09 period. That was followed by a rally in the stock market, which had bottomed in '09. As stocks recovered strongly, people began viewing the market through a more favorable lens.IBD: What are the preferred investment choices now?Hobson: Typically, we start investing through 401(k) plans. Within those plans, popular choices tend to be funds for large-cap stocks, as well as fixed income and balanced funds.And after they've gotten comfortable with retirement plan investing, some people have been opening up a brokerage account.IBD: What are the smart and not-so-smart stock investing moves by African-Americans?Hobson: On the plus side: I'm glad to see a willingness (60% of blacks and 78% of whites) to ride out the market's swings and stay invested.On the downside: 65% of African-Americans and 51% of whites believe that market-timing is important. This is just wrong -- and it's a notion investment firms and mutual funds companies have been fighting.  Another bad idea: acting on stock tips. Before buying a stock, you need to do research and be knowledgeable about it -- not just grab something heard about at the water cooler.IBD: Do many African-Americans use a financial advisor?Hobson: African-Americans are generally more novice investors than whites. Our prior research has shown that (as a group) we're more likely to seek the counsel of financial advisors. Like all people, African-Americans want financial security and a better life for their children.I don't think market professionals have yet been noticing this market. But it is a very real opportunity for them -- and over time, it's one they'll find valuable.IBD: What's the best way for African-Americans to gain knowledge about how to make money in the stock market?Hobson: I'd recommend getting a knowledgeable financial advisor that can help educate clients and explain financial terminology in a clear, understandable way. I also tell people to immerse themselves in publications' business pages so they can get used to the lingo and terminology, which will help educate them over time. Among publications, I particularly like Black Enterprise's coverage of personal finance and investing. Among the books people should read is my favorite, ""Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist,"" by Roger Lowenstein. Among internet resources, Morningstar.com does a great job, and I also particularly like HelloWallet.com.IBD: How did you get into this industry?Hobson: I didn't grow up in a household that discussed the stock market. I was one of six kids raised in Chicago by a single mom, and we worked hard to make ends meet. As a child, I was desperate to learn about money and financial security.I entered the investment world working as a college summer intern at Ariel Investments. Later, as I would give talks and speeches about investing, I discovered my community was a missing link when it came to public knowledge and awareness of savings and investments. So I decided to shine a light on this issue.IBD: What does your personal investment portfolio contain?Hobson:  To accommodate an expected long life, I am 100% invested in stocks. My family has a money manager and we favor value investing. I am not an active stock-picker. I have holdings in all six of Ariel's mutual funds. I also own shares in the individual companies -- Estee Lauder (EL), Starbucks (SBUX) and DreamWorks (DWA) -- in which I sit on the board and I have stock holdings in a few other companies, including Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB).IBD: What's the most important thing African-American parents can teach their children about money and investing?Hobson: It's important for a child to understand compound interest. That's what Warren Buffett calls the Eighth Wonder of the World.  This concept is so important because it explains how money can grow and shows how having high interest rate debt makes it so difficult to get ahead.The way it can be explained to a child:  Show through examples how money grows on top of itself.  Take a penny, add interest onto it. That makes it, say, a penny-and-a-half. After that, interest gets added to the (new total) of a penny-and-a-half, creating a higher amount, and so forth.

165,EL,"Events like these are often called “100-year floods,” and that can be misleading. The U.S. government began using the term in the 1960s to describe a flood that has a 1% chance of happening in any given year, not a chance of happening only once a century. It’s statistical probability -- and that can change over time.“Over the span of 30 years, which is the length of many people’s mortgages, there is a once in four chance it is going to happen,” said Mari Tye, a project scientist in the mesoscale and microscale meteorological laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo. “Over 100 years, there is a 67% chance.”And that doesn’t take into account other conditions that can alter the outlook, including changing climate or the effects of El Nino or La Nina.“That’s why the 100-year event is such a moving target, especially in an urban environment,” said Chuck Watson, director of research and development at Enki Research, which develops tools to measure hazards. “Someone builds a couple of parking lots, and you just turned a 100-year event into a 70-year event because of the impervious surfaces.”Asphalt doesn’t soak up rainwater; it just sends it somewhere else, such as into the house next door. When you add in natural climate cycles, the results are further skewed, Watson said from his office in Savannah, Ga. One of the influences of El Nino is to send more rain across the southern U.S. In a situation like that, the chances of a catastrophic flood might rise to 1 in 20.At least seven people died in Houston in April’s storm which dumped at least a foot of rain there. At least six more people have died in the flooding that began late last month, with rainfall reportedly amounting to as much as 30 inches in some locations, and hundreds have evacuated their homes.“If you get that much rain, there is no place for the water to go,” said Jill Hasling, who founded the Weather Research Center in the Texas city.The current flooding is worse in some ways than the one last May, Hasling said in an interview at the American Meteorological Society’s Hurricanes and Tropical Meteorology conference in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Parts of the city that were dry a year ago are inundated now.That flood damaged more than 2,500 homes and killed more than 30 people in Texas and Oklahoma, according to reports at the time. A little more than 35% of the state had been suffering some level of drought, but by the first week of June the share had dropped to less than 1%, the U.S. Drought Monitor reported.This reveals another problem with trying to quantify extreme events -- things can always get worse, which makes it difficult to come up with a worst-case scenario.“With all our records, we don’t know what the most extreme is, because they are rare,” Tye said. “You make an estimate of the probability and then another storm comes along that is worse.”As for Houston, Hasling has some advice: “There’s more than one flood a year in Houston. If you live in Houston, buy flood insurance. If you are not in the flood zone, buy it anyway; it will just be cheaper.”

166,EL,"The spread of the Zika virus has become so alarming that more than 150 health experts from over a dozen countries published an open letter urging the postponement or relocation of the Summer Olympics scheduled for Aug. 5-21 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Never before in world history have the Olympics been canceled due to a public health crisis.""The Brazilian strain of Zika virus harms health in ways that science has not observed before,"" the scientists warned. They added that an ""unnecessary risk is posed when 500,000 foreign tourists from all countries attend the Games, potentially acquire that strain, and return home to places where it can become endemic.""Imagine that! Global health experts are sounding alarm bells against the transmission of disease from one country to another, declaring that the risk is so great that the most famous international event of all should be called off to prevent it.Yet our open southern border allows an even greater number of people from Zika-plagued countries to invade our country every year, and thereby spread their diseases in our communities. The Zika virus besets most countries in Central and South America — not just Brazil — today.Countries having a problem with the Zika virus include Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru and Venezuela. Those are the same countries that are flooding our nation with illegal immigrants.President Obama demanded that Congress appropriate $1.9 billion to fight the Zika virus in other countries, but none of that money would be spent on securing our southern border against illegal immigration from Zika-plagued nations. Obama's clueless Secretary of State, John Kerry, told the graduating class at Northeastern University, ""You're about to graduate into a complex and borderless world.""Australia doesn't have a wide-open border with adjacent countries, but an expert there expressed concern about the risk of a single Zika-infected person entering that nation. ""A single person actually caused the epidemic that Brazil is struggling with now,"" Australian Professor of Health Sciences Charles Watson observed.In Britain, a professor of international public health, Jimmy Whitworth, warned pregnant women in that country to ""think twice"" before traveling to Texas and Florida, including Walt Disney World. Although Zika has not yet been found in American mosquitoes, Professor Whitworth expects that to change ""in two or three months' time"" because mosquito transmission is already occurring in Mexico and Cuba.It is through mosquitoes that the Zika virus can spread quickly from one infected person to others in the same community, causing terrible birth defects when pregnant women become infected.  This transmission by mosquito is similar to that of dengue, an untreatable disease also being brought into the United States from Central and South America.The Zika virus is not the only devastating disease that is brought into our Nation through illegal immigration. The Ebola virus with its 70% fatality rate has killed more than 11,000 people worldwide and caused a national panic in 2014 when it reached our shores through an African visitor who was not properly screened before he showed up in Dallas.Among refugees from Somalia who have been resettled in Minnesota, a shocking 22% are infected with latent tuberculous, which is more than five times the rate in the general American population. In addition to its harmful effects to health, TB is also very costly to treat: Easier cases cost $17,000 per patient, while the most serious strains cost $430,000 per patient using treatments extending over three years.Promoters of free trade insist that our economy can absorb these astronomical health care costs, but they drive up health insurance premiums for everyone. Illegal immigrants typically lack their own health insurance, and they show up at emergency rooms to demand medical care paid for by the American taxpayers.Measles cases are also brought to us mostly by immigrants. Measles outbreaks in detention centers for illegal aliens are commonplace now.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has officially advised pregnant women to postpone visiting the many Central and South American countries having a Zika epidemic. But if it makes sense to tell Americans not to go there, then why does the Obama Administration welcome infected people from those countries to come here?The World Health Organization concluded that canceling or moving the Olympics would not have a significant benefit in slowing the spread of the Zika virus. But their reasoning is due to the fact that the virus is already widespread in many countries in the Western Hemisphere, though not yet in the United States.We have no control over whether the Olympics are canceled, but we do have control over our borders. Billions of taxpayer dollars are currently spent on disease control that could be more cheaply and more effectively used to halt the flow of illegal aliens over our southern border.

167,EL,"With Apple's (AAPL) fiscal-second-quarter earnings report now in the rear-view mirror, investor attention is shifting to what the Cupertino, Calif.-based consumer electronics giant might announce at its upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference.Apple's annual WWDC will run June 13 through 17 in San Francisco. At the conference, Apple’s developer community will gather to learn about the future of Apple’s four software platforms: iOS, OS X, watchOS and tvOS.Wall Street will be closely watching announcements coming from the opening keynote address, which kicks off at 10 a.m. Pacific time on June 13.Based on rumors posted to tech news websites, Apple is likely to unveil a competitor to Amazon.com's (AMZN) Echo smart speaker. Echo is a room appliance that responds to voice commands and queries with the Alexa personal assistant program. Consumers can stream music and get sports scores, news, weather forecasts and other information just by speaking.Apple's me-too product would leverage the company's Siri voice-response program from its mobile devices. At WWDC, Apple is expected to release a software development kit to open up the device to third-party developers.Apple's Echo rival also could include a built-in camera so it can see you in addition to hear you, CNet reported Friday. With facial recognition technology, the Apple device could detect who is in the room and automatically pull up that person's preferences, such as the music and lighting they like, CNet said.One of the big announcements at the keynote is expected to be a sweeping overhaul of Apple Music, a service which was announced at last year's WWDC. Critics faulted Apple Music for being confusing, disjointed and inelegant. Its music offerings are seen as a mishmash of a subscription music service, streaming radio channels and song downloads.Apple is changing the user interface of Apple Music to make it more intuitive, Bloomberg reported this month. Apple also plans to better integrate its streaming and download businesses and expand its online radio service, Bloomberg said.The new version of Apple Music will be fully released as part of iOS 10 this fall.Apple is also expected to unveil the latest version of its Mac personal computer operating system. It is expected to change the nomenclature to MacOS from OS X, according to a report from 9to5Mac.Apple currently uses California locations to brand new Mac operating system releases. It started this trend with Mavericks in 2013 and followed with Yosemite in 2014 and El Capitan in 2015.At WWDC, Apple will also show off the latest versions of its Apple Watch and Apple TV operating systems. Software changes often signal changes to hardware.With Apple's heightened focus on services to drive incremental revenue and profit, the company is likely to play up services like Apple Pay, Apple Music, iCloud and the App Store at the conference.RELATED:Apple Shakes Off Concerns About Becoming The Next BlackBerryApple Has Largest Cash Stockpile, Twice That Of Microsoft’s.

168,EL,"Federal officials are warning that mosquitoes carrying Zika virus will start biting and infecting U.S. residents in the next month. Key trouble spots are southern Florida, Louisiana, Texas and southern California, but the risk could extend north to New York and San Francisco. The virus inflicts horrific brain damage on unborn children, as well as neurological disorders in adults. The Obama administration’s bungled response is increasing the danger.Americans are being told to DRAIN, DRESS, and DEET, meaning drain water lingering in their yard, wear long pants and sleeves and use bug repellent. In short, avoid mosquito bites.  Imagine the health of your unborn child depending on that.That makes as much sense as “Duck and Cover” did in the 1950s to keep safe from a nuclear attack.Now a pregnant woman’s safety hinges on how well her local government controls mosquitoes. It’s uneven. Fort Myers, Fla., has a $24 million budget and 27 planes for mosquito control. Cash-strapped San Antonio has only two spraying trucks.Most health departments lack equipment to detect Zika and combat mosquito invasions. Peter Hotez, Dean of Tropical Medicine at Houston’s Baylor Medical College, fears the epidemic’s extent won’t be known “until babies start showing up in delivery suites with microcephaly.”Also in Houston, Legacy Community Health is caring for a pregnant Zika patient, who recently arrived from El Salvador. One of over 150 pregnant women in the 50 states now testing positive for Zika. For each baby born with microcephaly, the lifetime cost of care could top $10 million.President Obama pins blame on Republicans for resisting his emergency Zika spending request. Baloney. Obama’s request earmarks over half a billion dollars for Zika programs in other nations, while shortchanging deteriorating public health facilities here in the 50 states.Obama is gung-ho to pay for mosquito control in South America but not here. Just like his Ebola boondoggle, which allocated more for public health infrastructure in Africa than for U.S. hospitals.Defending his overseas largesse, Obama says Zika is not something “you can build a wall to prevent” and “mosquitoes can’t go through customs.” Don’t be fooled.Mosquitoes fly about 400 yards max, not all the way from Brazil. Mosquitoes that can carry Zika already live in at least 26 states, ready to reappear with warm weather.If the president is serious about fighting Zika instead of Republicans, he can dip into Obamacare’s $2 billion a year public health slush fund. Right now a lot of that money goes for nanny state follies like videos showing how to exercise at your desk and healthy eating programs proven ineffective.Tragically, Obama’s Food and Drug Administration is delaying the release of genetically modified mosquitoes to kill Zika-carrying bugs. Pandering to eco-radicals. Even though the World Health Organization endorses this new technology, which can wipe out 90% of Zika mosquitoes in months.Another Obama agency, the CDC, repeatedly failed to act. The agency was warned in 2014 by the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists that local health departments were unprepared for mosquitoes. A 2015 report, “Before the Swarm” repeated the alarm.Even when WHO warned this January that Zika was coming, the CDC waited until April 1 to convene a “Zika Action Plan Summit” on what localities should do “if resources and technical expertise permit.”That’s a big “if.” Though local resources are lacking, the CDC insisted it was “not involved in local- or state-level mosquito control programs” and delayed help. Instead, the CDC has over 1,700 staff in 60 foreign countries and a self-declared mission to “improve health globally.”“You can’t rob Peter to pay Paul,” is how CDC Director Thomas Frieden dismisses suggestions to scale back international spending to meet the Zika threat here. What?Tell that to a mother who gives birth to a brain-damaged baby. She’ll have Obama’s misguided globalism to thank for her heartache. Time to make American safety the top priority.

169,EL,"In April, Steve Wynn announced plans to tear up the golf course that lies behind two of his Las Vegas hotels and replace it with a 38-acre man-made lake, about the size of 30 American football fields. Rising from the middle of the lagoon, Wynn said during a recent conference call, will be a 10-story mountain, accessible by zip line and electric ferry, that will serve as a launching point for nightly fireworks.Wynn will bring the pyrotechnics. The water comes courtesy of Crystal Lagoons, a Miami-based company that licenses technology for what is either the greatest real estate amenity since running water or the most chimerical since the Fountain of Youth.The company was founded a decade ago by real estate developer Fernando Fischmann. Frustrated by rough Pacific Ocean tides that made the coastline too dangerous for swimming, he developed technology for cleaning large bodies of water as part of his plan to build an oceanfront community in his native Chile. Today, the company boasts 60 lagoons in operation and says an additional 250 are in development from Singapore to Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The company plans to open offices in Dallas and Los Angeles as it seeks to seal 40 U.S. deals by the end of the year.Selling clear-water lakes to real estate developers is just a ripple on the surface of Fischmann's ambitions. He said he's working with students at MIT’s Sloan School of Management on a business model for building lagoons in public parks and is hatching plans to build ""floating lagoons"" on top of bodies of water that are currently unsuitable for swimming. His most audacious proposal is a system to cool an electric power plant and use the excess heat to power a desalination facility.The dream is ""to produce a huge impact,” Fischmann said. “Freshwater production is probably the most important problem facing the world.""Getting power companies to embrace the technology may take time, Fischmann said. In the meanwhile, a Boston Consulting Group study commissioned by Crystal Lagoons shows demand for 14,000 artificial lakes around the world.“You will see people taking the subway with swimming suits and sandals and going to the beach somewhere in the city,” Fischmann said.You can’t treat a mile-long lake as you would an oversize swimming pool and simply dump in a lot of chlorine. Fischmann, who trained as a biochemist, developed a system for monitoring the water chemistry in real time and delivering chemicals in tactical strikes on an as-needed basis. The company uses a special film to minimize evaporation and applies a UV coating on the bottom of the pools to tint them blue.The lakes, which cost about $250,000 an acre to build, require a fraction of the water needed to keep a golf course green. The company licenses its technology to developers in return for a single-digit percent of the project sales. Fischmann wouldn’t say how much money he’s making (he also withheld his age and other personal information), but said he recently insured the company’s intellectual property for more than $2 billion.""I think that people will like that it’s clear and clean and beautiful to look at,"" said Jackie Soffer, co-chairman of Turnberry Associates, which is building two 10-acre pools using Crystal Lagoons technology at SoLe Mia, a $4 billion mixed-use project her company is codeveloping in Miami with LeFrak Organization. Beyond the visual appeal, Soffer hopes the lakes will help developers woo more active homebuyers in a market saturated with golf courses.""I think people will swim or sail,"" Soffer said. ""This being South Florida, we'll probably have people doing yoga on paddleboards.""Power companies might be a harder sell.Most power plants, whether they depend on coal, natural gas or nuclear energy, produce electricity by making steam and using it to drive giant turbines. In the old days, plants were built near major bodies of water, which were then diverted through the plant, cooling the condenser and heating the water before dumping it back. These ""once-through"" systems are bad for aquatic life, says John Rogers, senior energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists. That's one reason they gave way to ""closed"" cooling systems in the 1970s. Still, as of 2011, more than 30% of U.S. power plants used once-through systems.Fischmann’s solution is to create such vast reservoirs that he can cool plants with water that passes by condensers in pipes, limiting evaporation. In 2014, a subsidiary of the Italian utility Enel tested Fischmann's technology to cool a power plant outside Santiago. The four-month experiment, funded by a Chilean economic development agency, proved that the ""technology could be applied in any thermal plant,"" according to the power company. For his next trick, Fischmann wants to use the heat transferred to water via the cooling process to power a desalination plant.Ultimately, the challenge is not only to create a better method for cooling, but to make it cost-effective to implement, said Eric Toone, a physical organic chemist who directs Duke University’s Innovation and Entrepreneurship Initiative. “That’s always the problem in energy (not will it work from a technical perspective -- that’s easy): Can you do it on a gigawatt scale and still produce power for eight cents a kilowatt?”Related:Food Feeds Real-Estate Development In Edgy AreasDevelopers Rehab Rust Belt Relics Into Luxury HotelsClean Energy Cultivates Farmland Leases As Crop Revenue Withers

170,EL,"Crude dropped after OPEC decided to stick to its policy of unfettered output.Futures fell on both sides of the Atlantic after closing on Thursday above $50 a barrel in London for the first time in seven months. While members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries rejected a proposal to adopt a new production ceiling, ministers were united in their optimistic outlook for markets. Prices extended losses after the number of rigs drilling for oil in the U.S. rose for the second time this year, according to Baker Hughes Inc.Oil has surged about 85% in New York from a 12-year low earlier this year amid disruptions in Nigeria, Libya, Venezuela and Canada and declines in U.S. output. OPEC needs more time to come up with a new production ceiling, outgoing Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri said after the meeting in Vienna, adding that it’s hard to find a target when Iranian supply is rising and significant Libyan volumes are halted.""The good news yesterday was that OPEC is getting along better,"" said Rob Thummel, a managing director and portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Advisors who helps manage $14.1 billion. ""The pain inflicted on U.S. producers, which was their goal, also hurt OPEC members. A reconciliation process is taking place.""West Texas intermediate oil for July delivery fell 55 cents to settle at $48.62 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices slipped 1.4% for the week after rising the prior three. Total volume traded was 33% below the 100-day average at 2:40 p.m. ET.Brent for August settlement slipped 40 cents, or 0.8%, to $49.64 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange. Prices closed Thursday above $50 for the first time since Nov. 3. The global benchmark crude closed at a 53-cent premium to WTI for August delivery.

171,EL,"Despite all President Obama's glowing advance and current talk about a new era of closer relationships between Cuba and los Estados Unidos, his controversial initiative to increase ties with the Communist regime just 90 miles off-shore has run into some significant, how you say, obstáculos en el camino.These bumps in the road actually began even before Obama arrived Sunday. Air Force One was literally on descent into Havana for the first U.S. presidential visit in 88 years when, as a sign of totalitarian hospitality, Cuban police rounded up dozens of dissidents demonstrating for democracy.Not that such brave souls pose any real threat to the Castros' control. Just to their PR image. Video of protesters conveyed by the media mob on the Obama family's carefully choreographed visit could threaten the lucrative goal of tourism with airlines and cruise companies already planning expanded links to deliver American wallets to the impoverished island.In a somewhat testy joint news conference Tuesday, Raul Castro, Fidel's little brother, appeared to try denying that his Communist government keeps political prisoners.The Castros are not accustomed to public accountability, let alone from ignorant members of a foreign proletarian press. But the Cuban host had reluctantly agreed to take one question while Obama could take two.CNN's Jim Acosta, son of a Cuban emigre, asked a double-barreled question:""I wanted to know if you have Cuban political prisoners and why you don’t release them.""""Give me the list of political prisoners,"" el presidente demanded disingenuously, ""and I will release them immediately.  Just mention a list. What political prisoners? Give me a name or names. After this meeting is over, you can give me a list of political prisoners. And if we have those political prisoners, they will be released before tonight ends.""Obama had already uttered his standard caveat that engaging with repressive regimes is better than isolating them. And he admits, ""The road ahead will not be easy.""""The goal of the human rights dialogue,"" Obama added, ""is not for the United States to dictate to Cuba how they should govern themselves, but to make sure that we are having a frank and candid conversation around this issue and hopefully that we can learn from each other. It does not mean that it has to be the only issue we talk about.""Indeed, the men talked of new scientific, commercial, agricultural, health and educational exchanges.Obama also ferried in a large contingent of congressional members, part of the Democrat's long-term effort to force Congress to lift the trade embargo on Cuba, while he undercuts it with side deals.The embargo is clearly an irritant to the Cuban leader. ""The most recent measures adopted by his administration are positive but insufficient,"" Castro complained in blunt opening remarks that did not make it into the official White House transcript.""I had the opportunity to discuss with the president other steps that we think could be taken in order to remove restrictions that remain in force, and make a significant contribution to the debunking of the blockade.""Castro also made it clear he has additional demands before allowing the American leader to pursue the fully-normalized relations he appears to so covet. (Does anyone else sniff that same desperation for a deal as Obama had over Iran's nuclear weapons program?)""In order to move forward towards normalization,"" the little fellow declared, ""it will also be necessary to return the territory illegally occupied by Guantanamo Naval Base.""The lease on that 45-square-mile facility, an offshoot of Cuban liberation from U.S. occupation after the Spanish-American War, is perpetual. It can only be voided by mutual agreement or failure to pay the $3,400 annual rent. Castro neglected to mention the nearly 4,000 Cubans employed there.Now, about the other half of Acosta's questions to Castro: ""One more question, who do you prefer -- Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?"" Castro demurred, claiming he's unable to vote in the United States, one of very few such Latin Americans, it seems.Absent from that exchange for some reason was any mention of another American presidential candidate, Republican Ted Cruz. His emigre father was imprisoned by the Bautista regime overthrown by the Castro brothers.RELATED:

173,EL,"Immigration: Meddling dangerously in American democracy with a not-so-secret motive, the Mexican government is quietly aiding its citizens in the U.S. to become eligible to vote in our elections.""Mexico is mounting an unprecedented effort to turn its permanent residents in the U.S. into citizens, a status that would enable them to vote -- presumably against Donald Trump,"" says Bloomberg Business.The story goes on: ""Mexican diplomats are mobilizing for the first time to assist immigrants in gaining U.S. citizenship, hosting free workshops on naturalization."" But contrary to the claim in the Bloomberg piece, the goal isn't solely to keep El Donaldo from being president. It's ultimately to seed a group of Spanish-speaking people who will someday help Mexico take back the Southwest.Don't laugh. It's not a paranoid vision. Mexico has never accepted U.S. sovereignty over what was once its land. And radical U.S. Latino rights groups -- including, most significantly, MeCha and La Raza -- have long agitated to return the Southwest to Mexico. What better way for a ""reconquista"" -- a reconquering -- of the Southwest than by the ballot box?""This is the other Mexico,"" Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto crowed in Los Angeles in August 2014, referring to the United States. He meant it. But he's not alone. He's part of a long line of recent Mexican politicians who, emboldened by the presence of an estimated 12 million of their own citizens living in the U.S., have chosen to pick at the scab of Mexican separatism.As far back as 1994, President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico proposed ""dual nationality"" for all people of Mexican extraction. That's about 33 million people in the U.S. Whose flag would they pledge allegiance to?Former President Vicente Fox, who in the context of Mexico is considered a conservative, has let it be known numerous times that he favors Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. No doubt he finds the prospect of Trump building a fence to keep out illegal immigrants offensive. But imagine if an American politician went south of the border and began pointedly politicking for one candidate over another? He would be loudly reviled as a Yanqui Imperialist.But this goes beyond mere politicking -- and extends into undermining U.S. law. Mexico has long offered a ""Guia del Migrante Mexicano,"" a comic-book style guide for those entering the U.S. illegally. Far from dissuading their citizens from coming here, they encourage it. Mexican officials and radical immigration groups then encourage Spanish-only ghettoization of Mexicans and Central Americans, along with a sense of grievance and victimhood for non-existent U.S. crimes.Mexican consuls in the U.S. have repeatedly criticized U.S. law officials when they enforce U.S. law against illegal immigration. They hand out so-called ""matriculas"" -- a form of ID -- and lobby to have them accepted to get everything from drivers' licenses to bank accounts. Most offensively, they spend huge sums for Mexican textbooks to be used in U.S. schools with large Hispanic populations, all but guaranteeing that the kids who learn from them will remain unassimilated into the American way of life.""After pressing us to educate Mexico's citizens, give them food stamps, deliver their babies, provide them with hospital beds and police their neighborhoods, the Mexican government also expects us to help preserve their loyalty -- to Mexico,"" wrote Heather Mac Donald, in a prescient article for the City Journal in 2005.Mexican presidents, past and present, along with other politicians, are no doubt sincere on some level. But they never quite seem to catch on -- their citizens come here by the millions because of the failures of Mexico's corrupt political class.Instead of meddling in U.S. politics and immigration policy for the false dream of reclaiming lost land, Mexico's officials would be wise to reform their own country by securing and promoting the rule of law, freeing up their markets, protecting property rights and ending the endemic political corruption that has driven tens of millions of Mexicans north.

174,EL,"Seems like an obvious question, given the drumbeat of environmentalist palaver and exhortations to cut water use still coming out of one-party Sacramento even as it rains.Because despite the El Nino storm front system, the state still remains in a drought, and once the storms vanish the drought will be right back where it left us. Still, El Nino presents an opportunity to store water for the more-typical dry years, if the state would just take the opportunities in front of it.Rep. Ed Royce, R-Calif., pointed that out at the kickoff of the California-Israel Water Summit in Beverly Hills on Monday, citing Israel's famous technology as a possible means of helping California find a long-term solution for its chronic water shortages.""We don't want this El Nino to be 'The Lost El Nino' because we could not fully capitalize on the opportunities in front of us,"" Royce said.Israel, in fact, is the world's foremost expert on turning chronic water shortages into actual water surpluses.""In 1948, we had twice the water we have today. And we now have 10 times the population,"" along with an economy that grew by a factor of 70, said David Siegel, who spoke at the event, which was also attended by Beverly Hills Mayor Julian Gold and officials from the Jewish National Fund at the Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce.Siegel said Israel should have been in pretty bad shape by now, but it's not the case. ""We're almost independent of the climate around us,"" Siegel said. Not only has Israel resolved its water shortages through its technology, innovation and startups, it's actually helping to supply water to its desert neighbors. And better still, it is exporting its model all over the world.Israel has 18 different technologies that it uses, from seeding clouds to cleaning brackish water. It has five desalination plants, is the world leader in drip irrigation, and recycles 90% of its wastewater ""so that we don't use drinking water to grow things,"" Siegel explained.It exports this technology to the world's most hopeless places, such as Africa. Now it's making a push to team its water-conserving and reclaiming companies with California companies, investors and venture capital firms. Thus far, it's not been an easy market to enter, Siegel noted, citing the regulatory climate, a problem that was echoed by other officials there as well.Still, there are signs the state may be ready for change, and not just because of the burnt-out lawns in Beverly Hills.""Half a million agricultural acres have gone fallow in the last year,"" Royce noted.Could the Israeli solutions be so comprehensive that they could supersede the need to restore the great aqueducts first initiated by Gov. Pat Brown (as Rep. Devin Nunes has explained)? Royce said the latter would continue to be worth working on. ""After all, the water is paid for,"" he said, and he noted that the water from the north is generally being wasted as outflow to the sea otherwise. But he wholeheartedly endorsed the idea of welcoming new expertise from Israel as well.The conference itself could be useful in that large numbers of government, labor, regulatory and private sector officials are slated to attend. ""That's why the conference is important,"" Royce said. ""Israel could jump-start the deployment of new technologies.""With that in mind, one wonders why it took California so long to invite the Israelis in to see if they can play David to California's ongoing Goliath.Correction: An earlier version misquoted David Siegel on Israel's population growth. The quote has been corrected in this version.

175,EL,"Cosmetics and personal care products are discretionary purchases.Granted, some people consider the products essential, and if you’re gripping the subway pole near the guy who decided to quit buying deodorant, maybe it no longer seems so discretionary.Yet, you only have to read the 10-K report for Estee Lauder (EL) to learn that personal care products and cosmetics are discretionary enough to take hits in economic downturns.One explanation is that people cut corners to save money during a recession. But Estee Lauder points out a more convoluted concern. “We generally extend credit to a retailer based on an evaluation of its financial condition, usually without requiring collateral,” the company 10-K reported.If the retailer is experiencing difficulties, the company may ""curtail or eliminate business with that customer.""The Cosmetics-Personal Care industry group sometimes can signal trouble before its widespread.In November 2007, when stocks peaked just before the recession’s official start, the personal care group had already been declining since mid-2007.So, with all the talk of a potential U.S. recession in 2016, it’s only natural to ask how the personal care group is doing.The group is doing quite well -- rising from No. 60 among 197 industry groups to No. 15, as of Tuesday’s IBD.Estee Lauder makes products covering skin care, makeup, fragrances and hair care.The company is expected to grow earnings 3% in fiscal 2016 ending in June. However, the Street expects earnings to grow 13% in fiscal 2017.Quality funds with positions in Estee Lauder include Fidelity Magellan Fund (FMAGX), which opened a position in Q4; Fidelity Balanced Fund (FBALX), which increased its stake 47% in Q4; and Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), which trimmed its position 0.5% in the fourth quarter.The stock is in the 5% buy zone after retaking an entry in soft trade.Prestige Brands (PBH) holds brands including Beano, Dramamine, Murine, Spic And Span and Anacin. The stock is building the right side of a base.In fiscal 2015 ended in March, Prestige Brands grew earnings 22% on a 20% pop in revenue. The Street expects EPS to grow 15% and 11% in fiscal 2016 and 2017, respectively.Funds have held a fairly steady exposure in Prestige. Wells Fargo Advantage Small Cap Value Fund (SSMVX) held almost 24,000 shares, as of Dec. 31.

The dollar rose for a fifth straight session, curbing demand for gold as an alternative asset.Bullion has benefited this year from expectations that slowing global economies will restrain the pace of U.S. rate increases. Lower borrowing costs boost gold’s appeal against interest-bearing assets such as bonds.“Gold is really getting whacked this morning,” said Phil Streible, a senior market strategist at RJO Futures in Chicago, in a phone interview Monday. “The Fed will raise rates eventually, and if we see stronger employment data next month, then maybe you’d see them raise rates in July.”Three of the world’s most influential bond investors warned against counting the Fed out even after Friday’s jobs report, helping damp gold’s rally.Bill Gross, who runs the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, said policymakers may act at their next meeting in June. Mohamed El-Erian, the chief economic advisor at Allianz SE, said the Fed may move twice this year, and Mark Kiesel, the chief investment officer for global credit at Pacific Investment Management Co., echoed the comments.Traders put odds that the Fed will raise rates this year at less than 50%, down from more than 90% at the start of January.In other gold-related news, China’s gold reserves rose to 58.14 million ounces at the end of April from 57.79 million ounces a month earlier, according to the People’s Bank of China.

Net Applications cautioned that the April data is preliminary.Still, Apple’s percentage of PCs in use on the Internet has been on the rise for several years. Its previous high was 8% in October. About year ago, in April 2015, Mac OS claimed 7.4% usage share.Net Applications data go back to November 2007, when Windows had 95.9% market share and Mac claimed just 3.4%.Conversely, Microsoft (MSFT) has seen its stranglehold on the PC market loosen. Its usage share of the PC market fell below 90% for the first time last month.Windows accounted for 89.2% of PCs on the Internet in April, down from 90.5% in March, Net Applications said.The top version of the Mac OS in use is Mac OS X 10.11, called El Capitan. It garnered 4% of the PC market in April, Net Applications said.The growth in Mac usage last month comes as the company is experiencing a decline in Mac sales.Last Tuesday, Apple said unit sales of Mac computers fell 12% year over year in the March quarter.

183,EL,"Immigration: The need to close America’s porous southern border was given greater urgency this week after reports that an ISIS suspect plotted to escort operatives across the border and drug cartels are helping ISIS set up a base near El Paso, Texas.Federal prosecutors say a 21-year-old Somali-American planned to open up routes to the U.S. through Mexico so ISIS terrorists based in Syria could penetrate the U.S. border and attack American cities.The jailed suspect, Guled Ali Omar, awaits trial on charges he conspired with several other Muslims in the Somali community in Minneapolis to join ISIS to fight in jihad against the West.The FBI secretly recorded Omar and his cell mate discussing several times the possibility of attacks in the U.S, as well as murdering an FBI agent. Images from the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center, as well as that of Osama bin Laden, were found on Omar’s phone.Most chilling was the account of a plot to help ISIS fighters from Syria infiltrate the U.S. through Mexico, which wouldn’t be hard to do thanks to the lack of border enforcement by the Obama administration.Under Obama's loose immigration policies, which allow removable aliens to remain in the country, many illegal immigrants who commit additional crimes while in the U.S. are being ignored, even though local police have urged ICE to take control of criminals in their jails and kick them out of the country.According to newly obtained government figures, ICE last year opted not to deport but to release 19,723 criminal illegal immigrants, including 208 convicted murderers, more than 900 convicted sex offenders and 12,307 convicted drunk drivers.Overall, those released into virtually every U.S. state carried a total of 64,197 convictions among them, or an average of 3.25 convictions each, according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis. The data also reveal that the released group committed a total of 8,234 violent crimes.It’s not known how many of these released immigrant felons are members of dangerous gangs, such as MS-13, or affiliated with terrorists groups. But many go on to commit additional crimes after they are released into the general U.S. population.And there is new evidence that drug gangs have formed alliances with terrorist groups such as ISIS.According to a Judicial Watch, a Washington-based government watchdog agency, Mexican drug traffickers are helping ISIS terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the U.S. to explore targets for future attacks.""Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir -- an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso,” Judicial Watch said in a new report quoting Homeland Security sources. ""Khabir trained hundreds of al-Qaida fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, and has lived in Mexico for more than a year.”He reportedly now trains thousands of men -- mostly Syrians and Yemenis -- to fight at an ISIS base near Juarez.Staking out U.S. targets is not hard for Khabir, who actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article published earlier this month that the U.S. border is so open that he “could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.”A top Mexican diplomat says in the article she can't understand why the Obama regime is “culpably neglecting this phenomenon,” adding that “this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States.”Neither can we. That wall can’t come soon enough.

184,EL,"San Francisco might manage a $15 minimum wage without much of a dampening effect on employment, but what about a $36-an-hour minimum?That's roughly the equivalent of the challenge now facing El Centro in California's Imperial County, where the $15 minimum wage will equal 95% of the average wage in 2015.It's only logical to expect that El Centro, whose nearly 19% jobless rate in February was the highest of any metropolitan area in the U.S, will have an enormously more difficult time adapting to a $15 wage than San Francisco and San Jose, where average wages are close to $40 and joblessness is just 3% to 4%.Yet California, almost unbelievably, has ignored the dramatic economic disparities from the Bay Area to the Central Valley to the communities near the Mexico border and has embraced a one-size-fits-all $15 wage, phased in by 2022. It puts the Golden State out a limb where neither New York nor Oregon dared to go as those liberal states pushed their minimum wages into uncharted territory.Oregon took a three-tiered approach, putting its minimum wage on a path to $14.75 in the Portland metropolitan area by 2022, while the wage will top out at $13.50 in midsize counties and $12.50 in so-called ""frontier"" areas.New York City will get a $15 minimum wage by 2018, with the surrounding counties getting there by 2022. But the minimum wage for the rest of the state is on course to get to $12.50 an hour by 2021 — with one exception. Quick-service chain restaurants throughout New York will be on the hook for a $15 wage, including small businesses operating a single franchised location. New York's fast-food wage applies to a broad range of limited-service or takeout places, including Subway, Starbucks (SBUX), Wendy’s (WEN), Shake Shack (SHAK), Yum Brands’ (YUM) Taco Bell, Dunkin’ Brands’ (DNKN) Dunkin' Donuts and Jamba’s (JMBA) Jamba Juice.On the same day that Gov. Jerry Brown signed the minimum wage law, Dunkin’ announced plans to open 29 franchised stores in the next few years. Such deals don’t come together overnight, and the adoption of a $15 statewide minimum was seemingly sudden and abrupt. Still, the possibility of a $15 wage initiative on the fall ballot has been in the news, so some businesses still see opportunity amid much higher wages.Yet the biggest batch of new Dunkin’ Donuts is slated for Contra Costa County, a suburban county in the East Bay area of the broad San Francisco metropolitan statistical area. With above-average wages and a 4.5% jobless rate, the economy of Contra Costa County will have a far better chance to sustain a $15 minimum wage than Imperial County, an agricultural area bordering Arizona and Mexico.Rather than a great leveler, a $15 minimum wage may end up widening geographical disparities as the high wage scares employers from adding jobs in economically depressed areas.Dunkin’ Brands CEO Nigel Travis told CNN last year that New York's $15 fast-food wage would mean ""probably less hiring, probably less growth.""In its third-quarter conference call, the company told analysts that one franchise that raised prices in response to a minimum-wage hike lost sales, so it’s advising that the best approach is to focus on increasing sales, not prices.An early warning of the potential downside of adopting a much higher minimum wage came from Wal-Mart (WMT), which earlier this year announced store closures in Los Angeles County and the city of Oakland while scrapping plans for two stores in a low-income part of D.C.The New York Farm Bureau warned that a statewide $15 minimum wage would threaten the financial viability of close to 20% of farms. Particularly if farmers in neighboring states didn’t face a similar hike, the high wage would shrink the size of the state’s agricultural industry and cause farming operations to shift to less labor-intensive crops.Now California has gone where New York feared to go -- at least in most of the state -- and the agriculture industry is bracing for the fallout. One supplier of farm labor predicts a 10% drop in agricultural hiring.The consequences of a $15 wage also may be understated for another reason: When you add up all the nonwage costs -- paid sick leave, extra payroll taxes and the ObamaCare employer mandate to offer health insurance -- California's statewide $15 minimum will really amount to $18.52 for full-time workers.

185,EL,"With drought in Brazil and flooding in Argentina threatening crops, the weather is getting nasty enough for hedge funds to take notice.Money managers more than doubled their wagers on a rally for agriculture prices, pushing their holdings to the biggest since July, after betting on declines just last month. The investors are now the most bullish on soybeans since May 2014 and trimmed the bets on declines for corn for the fifth time in six weeks. The Bloomberg Agriculture Subindex of eight farm products is heading for its best April rally since 1996.Dryness is such a problem for the corn harvest in Brazil, the third-largest exporter, that the government suspended import tariffs for six months, signaling that it may have to import the grain. Excessive rains in Argentina, the third-largest soybean grower, prompted the nation’s two biggest exchanges and the agriculture ministry to cut outlooks for the crop. Adding to the positive outlook for prices is China’s stabilizing economy and a weaker U.S. dollar that boosts the appeal of supplies from American farmers.“Now that we’ve started planting, we’re thinking about how the growing season will pan out, and we’re putting some more risk premium into the market, it’s been beaten down so much,” said Chris Narayanan, the head of agricultural research at Societe Generale in New York. “If the weather gets worse in Brazil and you have hot, dry weather in the U.S., you could see another massive rally.”Combined positions across 11 agricultural products rose to 368,088 futures and options in the week ended April 19, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data published three days later. That compares with 177,770 a week earlier.The Bloomberg Agriculture Subindex climbed 1.5% last week, after reaching the highest since July. The recent price gains have stoked speculation that futures may be bottoming after reaching multiyear lows as recently as this month. Market participation expanded amid the rebound, with surging trading volumes and rising open interest.The Buenos Aires Grain Exchange cut its forecast for Argentina’s soybean crop by 6.7% to 56 million metric tons, after parts of the country received six times the normal amount of rain in April. The country is the biggest exporter of soybean meal and vegetable oil. In Brazil, some states have gone a month without rainfall, which may bring woes to the safrinha, or second corn crop, that’s approaching pollination and grain-filling stages, Brett Wong, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said in a report.As conditions deteriorate for South American crops, threats are increasing to U.S. growing areas. The shift from El Nino to La Nina weather patterns may come as early as July, Wong said. That would mean higher summer temperatures and drier U.S. conditions, potentially lowering yields for corn and soybeans. Rains in American cotton areas already have disrupted plantings of that crop, and investors more than doubled their net-long position in the fiber to the highest since February.Ample global inventories can help cushion crop losses from inclement weather and limit price rallies. While the Bloomberg Agriculture Subindex rose last week, the measure tumbled 3% on Friday, the biggest drop since August. The ratio of corn stockpiles to demand will be elevated for the season that starts this year, Goldman Sachs Group (GS) said in a report last week. The bank said it was bearish on corn and soybeans and cut its outlook for wheat prices.While South American crop concerns helped boost prices in recent weeks, traders may turn their focus to U.S. planting soon, where weather is favorable, said Fiona Boal, director of commodity research at Fulcrum Asset Management in London, which oversees about $4 billion.For now, “it’s been an impressive and swift move off some pretty horrid levels, so farmers are going to be sitting on their planters with a big smile,” Boal said.

186,EL,"When Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera escaped through a $2 million high-tech tunnel engineered explicitly to get him out of a Mexican maximum security prison in July 2015, pundits and media made hay with the humongous embarrassment that it left for the Mexican government.After all, this was El Chapo's second escape in 13 years. And he was known for his pioneering work with high-tech tunnels used to smuggle drugs across the U.S.-Mexican border. They should have known better.Well, that's old news -- particularly since they caught him again.Now it's the open-borders Obama administration's turn for embarrassment.In an exclusive interview for The Guardian, Chapo's U.S.-based daughter, Rosa Isela Guzman Ortiz, said that Chapo twice came to visit her in Southern California while he was on the lam.So let's get that straight: The world's most wanted man, a drug dealer whose wars with the Mexican state led to 100,000 deaths in the past decade, waltzed across the U.S.-Mexican border -- twice -- just like that? That's what she said, and there's no reason to disbelieve her.This is the same border that President Obama and his minions have declared safe and ""better than ever"" before tens of thousands of Central Americans, many unaccompanied minors, crossed over in 2014 and 2015.Now Chapo has proven something even worse: that anyone, anyone, can get across, even criminals with famous mugshots who have lawmen on both sides of the border on the lookout.It's a bad revelation for the U.S. because it proves that terrorists, nuclear dirty bombs, enemy troops and cartel henchmen could get across as often as they like, too. It can even be called an advertisement for the border now.Naturally, the Obama administration is not embarrassed; it never is. But if that's not an argument for a wall or some other means of enhanced border security, what is?

187,EL,"The rise of anti-establishment political forces in the U.S., where Donald Trump leads the GOP field, and in Europe represents an ""uncertainty premium"" that markets have yet to price in, said Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, on Thursday.Trump echoed his anti-free-trade rhetoric, which could hurt prospects for top U.S. exporters like aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and industrial conglomerate General Electric (GE).""If I'm losing $505 billion with China, if I'm losing $58 billion a year with Mexico in terms of deficits, what do I want that kind of trade for anyway?"" Trump said Thursday while responding to criticism from Mitt Romney. ""Who needs that kind of trade?""Markets haven't paid attention to the Republican or Democratic races, which has seen Bernie Sanders also ride an anti-establishment surge, but that will change by the summer, El-Erian said on CNBC.When asked if markets should account for a ""Trump premium,"" he said that has been difficult to assess because while the real estate mogul is a front-runner, he lacks the backing from the party establishment.""It will make a difference as to who emerges,"" El-Erian said. ""It will make a difference as to what the plans are and how comprehensive they are.""El-Erian didn't mention specific stocks, but Trump's stance on trade comes amid a backlash against other trade-promotion efforts.Boeing and General Electric have already fought against conservative Republicans in Congress opposed to the Export-Import Bank's charter, which expired last year but was later renewed.Trump has also been vocal in saying that trade agreements such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) have made the U.S. weak and that he would abolish them. U.S. railroads such as CSX (CSX), which operates mainly in the U.S. and Canada, and Kansas City Southern (KSU), which runs in the U.S. and Mexico, could be affected.Meanwhile, Sanders has said that free trade has been ""a disaster for the American people."" And Hillary Clinton previously sounded favorable notes on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal but now opposes it.Boeing closed essentially flat while GE edged up 0.1%t. CSX, which is trying to fend off an offer to merge from Canadian Pacific (CP), rose 1.4%.Kansas City Southern gained 1%. It rose above its 50-day average earlier this month and was trading just below its 10-week line. Canadian Pacific added 1.7%.

188,EL,"The collapse in crude oil prices has slashed the U.S. oil rig count by 75%, but those expecting Texas to suffer an economic meltdown as it did during the 1980s should think again, economists say.First, the bad news. The Dallas Federal Reserve's region, which is more exposed to energy markets, had another bad month. While its general activity index improved slightly to -31.8 in February from -34.6 in January, it remains deep in contraction and at levels not seen since the recession.The production subindex was also up slightly but still negative, while gauges for new orders and employment were at their lowest since 2009.Layoffs in the energy sector began at the blue-collar level and are working their way up to the white-collar level, according to Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research at the Greater Houston Partnership.The Texas unemployment rate rose in December to 4.7%, thought it's still below the national average of 4.9%. A 70% plunge in crude oil prices since June 2014 has been a big culprit.Since 2014, Houston-based oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) has cut 22,000 employees worldwide, or 25% of its workforce. Rival Schlumberger (SLB), also based in Houston, has laid off 34,000 globally, or 26% of its workforce, since the end of 2014.Energy's problems are also impacting everything from homebuilders to restaurants. During their most recent quarterly earnings reports, KB Home (KBH), PulteGroup (PHM) and Lennar (LEN) each reported weakness for homes in the Houston market.Meanwhile, Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) reported seeing some weakness in its Texas chains, and Polaris Industries (PII), a maker of all-terrain vehicles and motorcycles, also found that oil and gas regions hurt Q4 earnings and predicted continued softness this year.So, while things are grim, it's important to keep some perspective. Texas has a population of more than 26 million people, spread out in 254 counties and living in several dozen metropolitan areas and countless rural communities. While Houston has a significant exposure to oil, major cities such as Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and El Paso do not.""The economic impact varies across the state,"" said Bud Weinstein, associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University. ""The oil-producing regions of the state have been hit the hardest.""Texas also has a $16 billion rainy day fund, largely derived from the energy sector, which can cover any shortfalls in state tax revenue caused by the oil bust. Texas also relies less on oil and gas taxes than other energy-heavy peers do.The Lone Star State generates about 9% of its revenue from oil and gas taxes vs. more than 40% for states like Alaska and North Dakota.Texas is better suited to withstand sustained low prices than it was during the 1980s, when the bottom fell out of the oil market. With help from the rise of technology, health and other industries, the Texas economy is more diverse.Oil and gas represents about 14% of the state's economy vs. more than 20% in the 1980s, Comptroller Glenn Hegar told lawmakers last month.The Dallas-Fort Worth area, a laggard during the economic recovery after the recession, currently has thriving business services and technology sectors. Its tax incentives, major international airport, and affordable housing costs have attracted companies seeking to relocate their headquarters. For example, Toyota Motor (TMC) is moving its U.S. base to the Dallas suburb of Plano.The petrochemical sector, which often runs counter-cyclical to oil, is performing well, with Dow Chemical (DOW) and Chevron (CVX) building projects in the Houston area.Lastly, limits on interstate banking helped exacerbate the economic crisis in Texas during the 1980s, when collapsing oil prices as well as overbuilding in commercial and residential real estate led to smaller Texas banks failing.Today, big banks such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC) and Bank of America (BAC) have footholds in Texas. Although each lender has boosted its energy loan loss reserves (JPMorgan alone increased its reserve to $1.5 billion for Q1), sustained low oil prices are unlikely to lead to widespread banking failures.Like any industry during a downturn, the Texas oil sector will be forced to become more efficient.""The energy industry will be smaller,"" Jankowski said. ""It will find a way to produce the same amount of oil with fewer people and more technology.""

189,EL,"Charlton Heston had already starred in 1952's Oscar-winning “The Greatest Show on Earth” and was Moses in 1956's “The Ten Commandments.”But he wasn’t the first choice for the lead in 1959’s “Ben-Hur,” playing a Roman slave who earns his freedom and becomes a champion charioteer. Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, Marlon Brando, Rock Hudson and Leslie Nielsen all turned down director William Wyler.Once Heston got the part, he spent four weeks learning to drive a chariot for the race that remains one of the most spectacular scenes in movie history. It took five weeks to shoot on an 18-acre set, the largest ever built, with 15,000 extras.“Ben-Hur” was another Heston box office smash, made for $15 million and raking in $90 million worldwide (equal to $731 million now), saving MGM from bankruptcy.It won 11 Academy Awards, including Oscars for best picture and, for Heston, best actor -- a record that only “Titanic” in 1997 and “The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King” in 2003 would equal.Heston (1923-2008) was born John Charles Carter in a suburb of Chicago. The family soon moved to rural St. Helen, Mich., so his father could work at a sawmill.The boy was shocked when his parents divorced when he was 9, and he lost touch with his father. A loner, he spent much of his time hunting and fishing.His mother married Chester Heston, who would provide his stepson’s surname for the stage and screen. (Charlton was his mother’s maiden name). They moved to Winnetka, Ill., where the youngster saw his first professionally produced play, Shakespeare’s “Twelfth Night.”“He was hooked,” wrote Michael Munn in “Charlton Heston: A Biography.” “He joined the high school drama class. From that moment on, he never wanted to do anything else in life but be an actor. He certainly had a gift for it, which he developed through sheer enthusiasm and determination.”In 1941, his senior year, Heston was recruited for a Northwestern University play, Henrik Ibsen’s “Peer Gynt,” to replace the lead when he dropped out. It was to be staged and filmed. The resulting amateur silent movie with subtitles was his first time on the screen, and he used the name Charlton Heston. He entered NU in the fall.“The film was an incomparable learning experience for me,” he wrote in “In the Arena: An Autobiography.” “Somehow I left behind the nerd I’d been in high school. Now I was at NU, on a drama scholarship I’d earned, with an actual movie under my belt. … I managed to find the confidence that has never left me since.”In one of the acting courses, he met actress Lydia Clarke. But World War II interrupted his education, and in 1943 he began serving two years in the Army Air Corps. After training at bases around the country in radio and aerial gunnery on a B-25, he married Lydia in March 1944 (they would have a son and daughter). He flew to the Aleutian Islands off Alaska, but the Japanese had been driven out a few months earlier, never to return.Later, once he became famous, he was given top secret clearance to narrate classified instruction films for the military.Charlton and Lydia moved in 1948 to New York City, where he appeared in a Broadway revival of Shakespeare’s “Antony and Cleopatra” and had roles in dramas on CBS (CBS) TV’s “Studio One.”A Hollywood producer offered him a film contract, and he went West to make 1950’s crime drama “Dark City.”Then he turned down the lead in another picture, opposite Marilyn Monroe, because he wanted to be in a new play, ""The Tumbler,"" directed by Lawrence Olivier in February 1951. Critics hated it, but Heston said he “learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise.”The Heston couple decided to keep their apartment in New York and rent one in Los Angeles in 1952, so that they could do theater and movies. She made a few films, and he was in front of the cameras eight times that year.His most important movie was Cecil B. DeMille’s “The Greatest Show on Earth.” While playing the circus manager, Heston had to work with a crew of actors and real-life circus pros. The film received the best picture Oscar and earned $36 million in the U.S. (adjusted for the price of movie ticket inflation, it would be equivalent to $321 million today).“When I went to DeMille’s office the next morning after he picked up his Oscar to congratulate him, he said, ‘You’ve gotten some fine personal notices for this picture, but I want to read you one that may be the best review you’ll ever get in your life,’ ” Heston wrote. “He then read me a letter from a man who was enchanted with the picture … and concluded, ‘I was amazed at how well the circus manager did in there with the real actors.’ ”Heston's career stalled as he made forgettable films over the next three years.Then DeMille cast him as the star of “The Ten Commandments” because he thought Heston had an uncanny resemblance to the statue of Moses by Michelangelo in Rome.“Heston had meticulously prepared himself for the role, reading 22 volumes on the life of Moses, and he could recite whole passages of the Old Testament,” wrote Munn.The filming in Egypt was as lavish as the final film, with 10,000 extras on the set. DeMille recalled of Heston, “Before the big scene, he’d go off by himself for half an hour in costume and walk up and down in solitary thought. … When he came to the set and walked through the crowd of extras, their eyes following him, and they murmured reverently, ‘Moussa! Moussa!’ To them, Moslems all, he was the Prophet Moses.”The $90 million (worth $731 million now) that “Commandments” earned in the global market was exactly as much as “Ben-Hur” would.For this next spectacular, Heston was cast as the Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur in the Roman-ruled Jerusalem of 26 A.D.When Stephen Boyd's Messala, a childhood friend who is now a Roman leader, orders Ben-Hur to name critics of the government, he refuses and is made a galley slave. During a battle, he saves the life of the admiral (Jack Hawkins), who has all the charges against him dropped. Ben-Hur wins the chariot race against Messala, who dies soon after crashing in the race.""Ben-Hur"" is ranked No. 2 among the American Film Institute’s Top 10 epic movies, just below “Lawrence of Arabia” (“Commandments” is No. 10).Over the next decade, Heston continued to portray strong leaders in epics:“El Cid” in 1961, as the 11th century Spanish hero in the wars against the Moors.“55 Days at Peking” in 1963, as a U.S. soldier battling Chinese rebels in the early 1900s.“The Greatest Story Ever Told” in 1965, as John the Baptist.“The Agony and the Ecstasy” in 1965, as Michelangelo battling the pope over the Sistine Chapel.“Khartoum” in 1966, as a British general in North Africa.""Planet of the Apes” in 1968, as an astronaut who time-travels to a future Earth ruled by apes.Heston served as president of the Screen Actors Guild from 1965 to 1971, but his politics increasingly clashed with more liberal members'. He had marched for civil rights and campaigned for gun control, but in the 1970s he often voted Republican. By 1998, he was president of the National Rifle Association and served until 2003.“Even those in Hollywood who did not care for Heston’s political stances could not help admiring his professionalism on the set,” Beverly Gray, a film historian and author of “Roger Corman: Blood-Sucking Vampires, Flesh-Eating Cockroaches, and Driller Killers,” told IBD. “He took pride in always showing up on time, knowing his role and never demanding what might be called the perks of stardom. Temper tantrums and other forms of self-indulgence were for him out of the question.”Heston’s remaining career was mixed. His successes included the science-fiction classic “Soylent Green” (1973), a theater production of Herman Wouk’s “The Caine Mutiny” (1985) and a starring role in the TV soap opera “The Colbys” (1985-87).When director James Cameron was asked why he cast Heston as the CIA director in 1994’s “True Lies,” he explained, “I need someone who can plausibly intimidate Arnold Schwarzenegger.”After announcing that he was diagnosed with the first stage of Alzheimer’s disease in 2002, Heston died six years later at 84.Star of epic films such as “The Ten Commandments” and “Ben-Hur.”Overcame: Partisan prejudices of Hollywood.Lesson: Have the courage to say truths that are unpopular.“Political correctness is tyranny with manners.”

190,EL,"Morality: Pope Francis chose the U.S.-Mexican border for his angriest attack yet on the free market, comparing private employers to slave owners. Pope St. John Paul II, who lived under statism, knew better.Speaking to Mexican businessmen and union officials on his final day after nearly a week in Mexico, in the heavily industrialized Ciudad Juarez across the Texas border from El Paso, the Catholic Church's Supreme Pontiff declared, ""God will hold the slave drivers of our days accountable."" He added that ""the flow of capital cannot decide the flow of people,” and blasted a “prevailing mentality"" in favor of ""the greatest possible profits, immediately and at any cost.” He later celebrated Mass practically on the border.The message couldn't be clearer: The people of God are south of that line, and their oppressors are north of it.This most casual of Popes has a now-infamous penchant for ill-considered, off-the-cuff remarks that the Vatican's damage control operation routinely has to walk back or explain away. But in this case the sentiments were too well-planned and orchestrated for excuses to work. Francis is an enemy of economic freedom and many of the policies that have made America and the rest of the Western industrialized world great.One might be tempted to charge that he is bringing the Catholic Church's moral teaching back to the ""dark ages"" of many hundreds of years ago, before man liberated himself economically and conquered so much poverty via technological progress.In fact, even in the Middle Ages the Catholic Church strongly defended the principle of private property.St. Thomas Aquinas, a doctor of the Church still held as its greatest theologian, wrote in his Summa Theologica: ""Because the division of possessions is not according to the natural law, but rather arose from human agreement ... the ownership of possessions is not contrary to the natural law, but an addition thereto devised by human reason.""The Church's traditional concerns with capitalism have focused on abuses that are alien to modern-day America, such as lack of a just wage, rest time and days off, an unhealthy workplace, the absence of unemployment benefits, pensions and health insurance, and no right to form a union.Pope Leo XIII in his 1891 encyclical ""Rerum Novarum"" stated that ""the poor and badly off have a claim to especial consideration ... and must chiefly depend upon the assistance of the State. And it is for this reason that wage-earners, since they mostly belong in the mass of the needy, should be specially cared for and protected by the government.""In 1991, Pope St. John Paul II wrote an encyclical commemorating the 100th anniversary of Leo's, titled ""Centennimus Annus.""  And in that teaching, he asked if it could be held that ""after the failure of Communism, capitalism is the victorious social system, and that capitalism should be the goal of the countries now making efforts to rebuild their economy and society? Is this the model which ought to be proposed to the countries of the Third World which are searching for the path to true economic and civil progress?""According to John Paul, ""The answer is obviously complex. If by 'capitalism' is meant an economic system which recognizes the fundamental and positive role of business, the market, private property and the resulting responsibility for the means of production, as well as free human creativity in the economic sector, then the answer is certainly in the affirmative, even though it would perhaps be more appropriate to speak of a 'business economy,' 'market economy' or simply 'free economy.'""That Pope, unlike the current one, was a Pole who lived under both the Nazis and a collectivist state ruled by Moscow. The current Pope ought to consider the reflections of his saintly predecessor.

They also want their investments to reflect their values, so they ""do their research beforehand on what they want and don't want to support,"" Das adds.In terms of investment products, he sifts through more choices than ever.

That's way up from just two or three years ago.""For financial advisors, part of the challenge of harnessing the sustainable-investing niche is staying on top of ever-changing societal trends. The issues that investors care about can ebb and flow based on a range of factors.When George Gay started to focus on SRI in the late 1980s, global headlines included the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 and anti-apartheid protests in South Africa. At the time, Gay was a certified financial planner and chief operating officer of First Affirmative Financial Network in Colorado Springs, Colo.""Today, new areas of concern include sustainable (retail) food chains and factory farming,"" said Gay, now First Affirmative's chief executive officer. ""These things are getting more complicated.""Gay's firm, which works with about 100 financial advisors across the U.S., hosts an annual SRI conference for financial planners to discuss the latest developments and investment strategies within their niche. For example, advisors often compare notes on how to serve millennials who embrace ""impact investing."" Gay finds that ""younger clients are more interested"" in SRI and advisors often want to attract more entrepreneurs and professionals in their 20s and 30s.Advisors engage in deep discussions with their clients about their values -- and the types of investments that they like and dislike. To gain a better sense of an investor's preferences, financial advisors often ask clients to fill out a questionnaire.Investors will check boxes of stock screens they'd like to set up. Examples include seeking companies with high marks for gender diversity or avoiding companies that make or sell military weapons.""We use their answers to craft portfolios that are aligned with their values,"" said Allan Moskowitz, a certified financial planner in El Cerrito, Calif. ""I had a client who was a doctor. He was looking to avoid funds with Coke (KO) or Pepsi (PEP), because he felt they caused obesity.""Moskowitz, who has focused on SRI for 25 years, says that the niche has soared in popularity. In addition to joining First Affirmative's network, he says that clients find him through his website and a listing on National Green Pages, an online directory. He has also adopted a lifestyle that embodies his values.""I bought an office building 1-1/2 years ago and lowered my carbon footprint by about 80%,"" he said. ""I have solar panels on the roof. I drive a Nissan Leaf.""He also seeks to hold companies accountable for their stated commitment to ESG standards. A shareholder activist, he has joined coalitions to fight ""greenwashing"" (when organizations falsely claim they're environmentally friendly) and highlight other social-justice issues.All the effort pays off. Moskowitz says his clients appreciate working with an advisor who walks the talk.""Clients in this niche are stickier,"" he said. ""They're loyal. My retention rate is high.""

192,EL,"Few industry groups escaped the market's wrath Monday. IBD's Leisure-Toys/Games group was one that did.It climbed more than 1%, fueled by a heavy-volume advance by Hasbro (HAS), which reported Q4 results ahead of the open. The Pawtucket, R.I.-based company earned $1.39 a share, up 14% from last year and 9 cents over views. Revenue climbed 13% to $1.465 billion, topping forecasts for $1.365 billion. Sales rose 23%, excluding pressure from the strong dollar.The 13% rise was Hasbro's biggest quarterly sales gain in nearly five years. Results got a boost from toys based on Disney's (DIS) ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens,"" such as action figures, masks and lightsabers, and Universal Pictures' ""Jurassic World"" products. Sales from boys' toys jumped 35%, but girls' toys fell 17%.Hasbro advanced 1.5% Monday, reclaiming its 200-day moving average as it works on the right side of a seven-month consolidation. It's been an outperformer, rising 11% this year. Highly regarded Fidelity Contrafund owned shares as of Dec. 31.The Transformers and Nerf maker raised its quarterly dividend by 11% to 51 cents a share. For the full year, Hasbro's EPS rose 11% to $3.51 a share. Analysts expect a 12% increase this year and 9% the next. Global rights to produce Disney's ""Frozen"" and other Disney Princess dolls transferred to Hasbro from Mattel this year.IBD's toys and games subgroup rallied to No. 17 in Monday's issue, up from No. 151 six weeks ago. It spiked more than 5% intraday Thursday, after Bloomberg reports that the two major toy makers began discussing a possible merger late last year. On Monday, Hasbro CEO Brian Goldner said on the company earnings conference call that he is open to potential ""add-on acquisitions.""Mattel (MAT), which makes ""Star Wars""-based Hot Wheels toys, last week reported Q4 profit that increased 21% to 63 cents a share on flat sales of $1.99 billion, beating forecasts on both the top and bottom lines. It benefited from an 8% revenue increase in Barbie dolls and a 26% jump in its wheels segment, which includes Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars, on a constant-currency basis. The stock soared 14% Tuesday to a 14-month high, surpassing a 28.03 handle buy point in robust trade. It's well extended past the entry.The El Segundo, Calif.-based company's Q4 profit marked its first quarterly gain in more than two years. Analysts expect full-year EPS to resume growth at 12% this year and 25% in 2017, after big declines the past two years.Mattel leads Hasbro with respective Composite ratings of 92 and 90, but its EPS Rating lags at 46 to 78. Mattel has a 97 RS, reflecting the stock's 18% advance this year, while Hasbro's RS is a respectable 87.Other stocks in the toy maker group include Jakks Pacific (JAKK), which is trading below 7 a share and near nine-month lows. It has a subpar 61 Composite Rating.

194,EL,"Adam Smith immortalized ""The Wealth of Nations,"" but prosperity in today’s world increasingly depends on the wealth of cities. In the United States, the 25 largest metropolitan areas churn out more than 40% of all economic output; the top 65% account for 65%.Cities thrive because proximity, density and closeness produce an environment where human creativity and cooperation flourish. Cities attract the best and brightest and let them reach for the stars. New ideas emerge, percolate, mutate and spread. Most of humanity’s economic progress has sprung from the perpetual churning of ideas and enterprises that takes place in the urban milieu.Looking around the country, we find huge gaps in major metropolitan areas’ economic fortunes -- for every booming Dallas-Fort Worth, there’s a sclerotic Detroit.Adam Smith's principles, put forth more than two centuries ago, go a long way toward explaining why some areas do so much better than others. In ""The Wealth of Nations,"" the Scottish economist linked prosperity to a political economy of freedom, built upon private property, market incentives, free trade, specialization and a culture of commerce.To see how Smith’s wisdom applies to the wealth of cities, we use an index of economic freedom for U.S. metropolitan areas that focuses on three broad factors -- size of government, the tax burden, and labor-market freedom. The result is a single number that ranks each Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) from zero to 10 on economic freedom, with zero being lowest and 10 being highest.MSAs that score highly on the index tend to have relatively low taxes, smaller government spending and public employment, less dependence on government transfers, pay rates largely driven by market forces, and below-average union membership. In short, these cities limit government and give markets more breathing space, letting businesses and individuals make the decisions that shape local economic activity.Economic freedom varies among the nation’s 380-plus metropolitan areas -- from a high of 8.52 in Naples, Fla., to a low of 3.32 in El Centro, Calif. Among the largest cities that account for most of the nation’s economic vitality, the freest MSAs are centered on Tampa, Houston, Dallas, Miami, Orlando, Denver, Atlanta, San Antonio, St. Louis and Phoenix.Does greater freedom produce more vibrant local economies, ones that grow faster and create more jobs? To focus on the bigger cities that are the primary engines of the U.S. economy, we looked at the 100 largest MSAs -- those with populations above 542,000. We divided these into five groups of 20, arrayed from highest to lowest in economic freedom.The freest MSAs saw their economies grow by 30% from 2001 to 2013, after inflation. The next group expanded by nearly as much -- 27.5%.  After that, average growth declined substantially as economic-freedom scores waned.Turning to job creation, the freest 20% recorded average employment gains of 17% from 2011 to 2014. The rate of job creation fell by half for the second-freest 20%, then nearly halved again for those at the bottom.Most likely, these numbers reflect lighter tax burdens, which improve market incentives for activities that contribute to growth and job creation -- working, investing, building job skills, starting businesses. MSAs with freer labor markets also create an edge by shunning high minimum wages, strong unions and other interventions that raise the cost of adding workers. State-level right-to-work laws are particularly important in restraining union power. Freer MSAs are also likely to attract companies looking to relocate to more business-friendly environments.Unemployment rates are lower in MSAs with greater labor-market freedom, averaging 6.1% for the most-free group and 5.8% for the second 20%. Unemployment then rises steadily as economic freedom scores decline, reaching 7% for the least-free group.Perhaps surprisingly, the average cost of living is nearly 35% lower in the most-free MSAs than in the least-free group, suggesting a link between economic freedom and higher living standardsHousing prices contribute heavily to variances in living costs. MSAs with greater economic freedom impose fewer impediments on new housing, so supply-increases blunt price pressures. The same applies to other markets -- less government meddling and greater market competition help keep prices low.The combination of low taxes and living costs makes paychecks go further. Wage rates are often quite high in places with low economic freedom, such as New York and Los Angeles. After adjusting for differences in taxes and living costs, however, average hourly wages are nearly $16 in the 40% of MSAs scoring highest in economic freedom. Adjusted pay in the least-free group falls to $12.40.The less-constrained capitalism of the freest cities doesn’t widen the rich-poor gap. Income inequality, measured by wage dispersion, is lowest for the middle 20%, but the most-free cities show significantly less inequality than the least-free ones.The evidence suggests that Americans recognize that metropolitan-area economic freedom makes them better off. Among the 100 largest MSAs, the freest 20% attracted a net in-migration of 9 million people from 1992 to 2011, while the least-free 20% showed a net loss of more than 7.1 million. The net gain for the freest group was 24%, compared to a net loss of 14% for the least-free MSAs.Economic freedom in U.S. cities faces a constant threat from those who would raise taxes, spend more on pet projects, redistribute wealth or impose restrictions on how others use property. The metropolitan areas that resist these demands reap the gains of greater economic freedom.Michael Cox is founding director of the Cox School of Business at Southern Methodist University and former chief economist at the Dallas Fed.

197,EL,"Islamophilia: President Obama is conferring legitimacy on a Baltimore mosque the FBI just a few years ago was monitoring as a breeding ground for terrorists, after arresting a member for plotting to blow up a federal building.IBD has learned that the FBI had been conducting surveillance at the Islamic Society of Baltimore since at least 2010 when it collared one of its members for plotting to bomb an Army recruiting center not far from the mosque in Catonsville, Md.Agents secretly recorded a number of conversations with a 25-year-old Muslim convert -- Antonio Martinez, aka Muhammad Hussain -- and other Muslims who worshipped there. According to the criminal complaint, Martinez said he knew “brothers” who could supply him weapons and propane tanks.“He indicated that if the military continued to kill their Muslim brothers and sisters, they would need to expand their operation by killing U.S. Army personnel where they live,” FBI special agent Keith Bender wrote. Martinez said that in studying the Quran he learned that Islam counsels Muslims to “fight those who fight against you.""Sentenced to 25 years in prison in 2012, Martinez also stated in a social media posting that he wanted to join the ranks of the “mujahideen” in “Pakistan or Afghanistan (a country that struggle[sic] for the sake of allah).” Most of ISB’s board members are from Pakistan.To help disrupt the plot, the FBI reportedly put an undercover agent in the mosque, which upset the leadership there. After protests, the FBI sent an official to ISB to take questions and mollify concerns the bureau was spying on Muslims.Members of the mosque complained that the FBI tried to “entrap” Martinez and other Muslim terrorism suspects by sending “spies with Muslim names” into the mosque.“If I was the president of the mosque, I would not let you come here without strip(-searching) you,” one member angrily told the FBI official, ""because you might drop something (like a bug) to hear what’s going on here.” “The Muslim Link"" newspaper described the questioner as Pakistani.This is the mosque that will be honored with a visit from Obama on Wednesday, the first U.S. mosque visit of his presidency.It’s now abundantly clear the White House failed to properly vet the venue. Reportedly, it let the Council on American-Islamic Relations choose the site, even though the FBI has banned CAIR from outreach because of known ties to the Hamas terrorist group.“For a number of years we’ve been encouraging the president to go to an American mosque,” CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper said. “With the tremendous rise in anti-Muslim sentiment in our country, we believe that it will send a message of inclusion and mutual respect.”As we reported Tuesday, ISB is affiliated with the Islamic Society of North America -- which federal prosecutors in 2007 named a radical Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas front and an unindicted terrorist co-conspirator in a scheme to funnel more than $12 million to Hamas suicide bombers — and ISB has helped organize the terror-tied ISNA’s conferences.The Shariah-compliant mosque was led for 15 years by a radical cleric — Imam Mohamad Adam el-Sheikh — who once represented a federally designated al-Qaida front group. El-Sheikh also has argued for the legitimacy of suicide bombings, according to the Washington Post.We also first reported that ISB board member and vice president Muhammad Jameel has blamed American foreign policy — namely, U.S. support for Israel — for terrorism and the rise of Osama bin Laden.""I hope (his death) does not camouflage the bigger picture, which is to look at what gave rise to OBL and what are the root causes of terror,” Jameel said in a local 2011 interview. ""Just eliminating him does not resolve the longer-term problems, which I consider to be (U.S.) foreign policy.”ISB board members are required to have “an in-depth understanding of the Shariah,” and “must take Islam as the way of life,” according to recently amended articles of incorporation papers filed with the state of Maryland.We have also learned that ISB invited one of the imams of the Boston Marathon bombers’ mosque to headline a 2013 fundraiser for its Islamic school.Then-Islamic Society of Boston imam Suhaib Webb spoke at the 25th anniversary banquet of ISB's Al-Rahmah School -- even though two days before 9/11, according to an FBI surveillance report, Webb was raising cash for a Muslim cop-killer together with al-Qaida cleric Anwar Awlaki, the hijackers’ spiritual leader.So let’s recap. The mosque that is hosting the commander in chief, while receiving his historic benediction graduated a terrorist who plotted to blow up a local Army recruiting station, hired an imam who condoned suicide bombings and blames American “foreign policy” for terrorism.Obama has to be willfully blind not to see all these ties to terror.

201,EL,"If you're pregnant or planning to be, rethink your vacation plans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are warning against travel to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and 22 countries in Latin America where mosquitoes are carrying the Zika virus and infecting people they bite.The biggest danger is to pregnant women, whose babies are at risk of being born with abnormally small and damaged brains. Already, nearly 4,000 Brazilian newborns are affected. Brazil, Jamaica, Colombia and El Salvador are urging women to delay getting pregnant for up to two years. Countries affected are being urged to lift their abortion bans.Zika is also linked to Guillain-Barré syndrome, which causes paralysis and nerve damage in men and women.  And there’s even a concern that a person infected with Zika can transmit it sexually.For now anyway, Americans have only a small worry -- contracting Zika from a mosquito bite while traveling. But the World Health Organization warned on Sunday that mosquito-borne Zika will soon spread to all countries in the Western Hemisphere except Canada and Chile.Unbelievably, the CDC says that it has no intention of helping communities in the U.S. eradicate mosquitoes, even though it’s helping other countries across the globe fight mosquito-borne diseases.Florida, Texas and southern California have mosquitoes that can spread Zika year-round, scientists report in the medical journal Lancet. The Midwest and East Coast are at risk in the spring and summer, says the report. They are ""conducive to seasonal Zika virus transmission.” In the East, mosquito season begins in April, which is just around the corner.CDC's Lyle Petersen, director of vector-borne diseases, predicts that Zika will hit the U.S., but ""we don't expect very large outbreaks."" How many cases are acceptable to the CDC?  For a family, the answer is zero.Having a baby with an abnormally small, damaged  brain  is a lifelong heartbreak. And even children born with normal-size heads may have hidden brain damage that appears later, says Marcie Treadwell, a fetal medicine physician at the University of Michigan. There is no vaccine or treatment for Zika and no way to halt the birth defects short of abortion.""We really need to up our game,"" says Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, who concedes that vaccines and treatments could take years to develop.Meanwhile, the CDC's approach -- travel warnings and advising pregnant women to wear long sleeves and pants -- falls way short. The agency should be helping local health departments prepare aggressive campaigns to eradicate  mosquitoes. But the agency flatly refuses, stating that the CDC ""is not involved in state- or local-level mosquito control programs.""So why does the CDC spend millions of dollars in foreign countries to fight mosquito-borne illnesses?The CDC is suffering from its own ailment -- mission confusion. That explains how it bungled Ebola and even failed the straightforward task of keeping the nation’s medical stockpiles up to date. The agency is more concerned about dictating what Americans eat and drink -- fighting harder against sugary sodas than deadly diseases and hospital infections.Cities and states need to ramp up their mosquito-eradication capabilities for a possible Zika threat. The mosquito species causing the outbreak in Brazil doesn't live in most parts of the U.S., but WHO reports that the species found here are also capable of spreading Zika. With such uncertainty, let's choose caution over complacency.Scientists are trying to stop Zika by destroying the main type of mosquito that carries it. They've genetically engineered a male mosquito whose offspring automatically die. But environmentalists are whining about eradicating a species.Good grief! There will still be more than 3,000 mosquito species left.  Given a choice between bugs and human babies, the priority is obvious.Mosquitoes are to blame for more than half the deaths in human history. The U. S. nearly eradicated the most dangerous species here half a century ago, but they’re back, and we’re compelled to wage the war again -- and win.

202,EL,"Charcoal cleanser. BB creams. The 10-step Korean skin-care regimen.The modern woman's bathroom counter likely looks very different from her grandmother's, and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) knows it. Stocked with both higher-end prestige products and value-focused mass brands, the specialty beauty retailer has carved out a unique space for itself amid offerings from department stores, drugstores and the ever-looming 800-pound gorilla, Amazon (AMZN).While the beauty shopper of yesteryear might have frequented a favorite department store cosmetics counter for all her Estee Lauder (EL) or Lancome supplies, today's consumer doesn't feel as tied to specific brands.""The beauty bag is more diverse -- so there's category loyalty and interest but there is less buying across a single brand range,"" Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink told Investor's Business Daily. The average shopper is ""mixing and matching brands more routinely.""As brand loyalty wanes, the rising concept of ""destination loyalty"" may begin to matter more, particularly as a plethora of competitors vie for attention, including not just department stores like Macy's (M) or privately held Saks but drugstores like CVS Health (CVS) and big-box retailers Target (TGT) and Wal-Mart (WMT).Ulta and rival Sephora, owned by Paris-based LVMH (LVMUY) have become the reigning specialty stores in the beauty space. Sephora lines its glossy black-and-white shelves only with prestige brands such as Dior, Nars and Yves Saint Laurent, while Ulta offers a mix.Conventional drugstore brands like Revlon and L'Oreal are featured alongside edgier titles at Ulta, such as Smashbox and Urban Decay. Ulta also offers both a full-service salon in every store and ""brow bars,"" or eyebrow treatment areas, at some of its almost 900 locations.Traditionally, customers who opted for a department store makeover would have to ""go home and try to figure out how she did it,"" said Wissink. But makeup trends once relegated to the service model are now accessible online and via other venues.Now, anyone can simply hop on YouTube and look up, say, a video tutorial from beauty guru Michelle Phan on contouring -- highlighting and shading facial features to the cosmetically challenged -- or head to their local Ulta for a makeup consultation.The sample-friendly ""test-and-trial"" nature of specialty beauty stores -- minus the salesperson pressure -- appeals to shoppers who want to experiment with a new look. Ulta has ""floating artists and salespeople who can talk intelligently about a beauty trend who aren’t (commissioned) to sell you a specific brand,"" said Wissink.""You might be buying a $3.99 compact of glittery eye shadow and a $49 base compact and putting on $7 mascara,"" said Wissink. ""That’s the Ulta way.""Ulta also has a rewards program, offering samples and perks in exchange for shopper loyalty. The Ultamate Rewards program membership has grown to over 18 million members, and those members offer the company precious insights into their shopping habits, including frequency of salon service use, spending patterns, favorite products, and other data.""That’s very valuable information,"" Ulta Beauty Chief Financial Officer Scott Settersten told IBD. ""It helps us position new stores, where we’re going to build those stores -- we like to go where we already have an existing customer base, so it’s very valuable.""In a bid to capture and keep customers, the company has been shifting from discounts and delving into direct email marketing with personalized messaging. Its hold over shoppers is proving to be strong: More than 80% of the company's sales come from loyalty program members, said Chief Executive Mary Dillon in last August's earnings call.Ulta's online sales, while a single-digit fraction of its overall net sales in 2015, has been growing at a 40% to more-than-50% clip every quarter without weighing on same-store sales.""It’s been incredible,"" says RBC Capital markets analyst Brian Tunick of Ulta's e-commerce growth. ""It’s been one of the biggest parts of the story. But at the same time, their store comps have been high single digits as well. In retail today, there’s not a lot of companies that are showing positive store traffic.""In the fourth quarter, reported on March 10, Ulta's e-commerce sales leapt 44.2%, while retail-only comps rose 10.4%. And the company's per-share profit climbed 25% to $1.69 on 21% revenue growth to $1.27 billion, both beating consensus estimates. Ulta also announced an accelerated share buyback program.Ulta shares continue to float in buy range after breaking out of a period of consolidation on March 11, gapping up past the key 50-day and 200-day levels.Following the results, a bevy of analysts upped their price targets, including those from Piper Jaffray, Nomura, RBC and Jefferies, though concern over the stock's apparently full valuation lingered.""We continue to like the strength of the business model, ULTA's unique market positioning and future growth prospects,"" wrote Jefferies' Randal Konik in March. ""However, we believe valuation already prices in these positives.""Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel called out the company's accelerating comps amid share gains in low- to -mid-tier markets. ""We continue to expect that with minimal mall and (e-commerce) penetration, ULTA remains isolated from the main issues facing retail as the company’s self-help initiatives drive ongoing top- and bottom-line growth,"" Siegel wrote in a note to clients last month.Any talk of e-commerce typically leads to talk of mega-retailer Amazon. But even after the online one-stop shop and known brick-and-mortar killer set up its own storefront in 2013, Amazon Beauty, the beauty space has not been subject to as much disruption as some initially feared.A mild assortment of higher-end brands means the e-commerce giant is still at a disadvantage to specialty players when it comes to the top-shelf stuff. And while one might think that Amazon would be a perfect place to conveniently restock supplies, most cosmetics and skin care shoppers actually like being in stores to play with samples and try out new makeup techniques.That appeals to Ulta's core customer, the ""beauty enthusiast and beauty enthusiast on a budget,"" says the company's Settersten.""(They're) not so prone to this replenishment concept, so when you think about our e-commerce business it’s not people just necessarily price shopping or looking for convenience,"" he said.Plus, consumers can't exactly get a haircut over the internet.""(Ulta is a place to) have your hair done, your nails done, your eyebrows waxed,"" said RBC's Tunick. ""That’s what’s unique here.""

203,EL,"Homeland Security: Jihadist terrorist group members have been caught crossing our border, and Mexican authorities tell of an Islamic State compound near El Paso. Will President Obama, like JFK, address the ""clear and present danger""?Texas law enforcement reports members of Islamist terrorist groups crossing the Mexican border into the Lone Star State in recent years. And there have long been suspicions regarding an ISIS presence near Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, based on Mexican sources in law enforcement and armed forces who spoke to the governmental investigative organization Judicial Watch.A 68-page report from the Texas Department of Public Safety told of 143 ""land border crossing encounters with watch-listed individuals in southwest border states between November 2013 and July 2014,"" who were among well over 400 individuals from Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria and 30 other Mideast, African and Asian countries crossing or trying to cross into the U.S. without authorization. In response, Rep. Ron DeSantis, R- Fla., last month convened the House Oversight Committee’s National Security subcommittee he chairs to address the issue of terrorists exploiting our porous southern border. And DeSantis has brought his concerns front and center in his U.S. Senate campaign.With it this easy for terrorists to enter America -- and we don't know how many have come here undetected -- is there any doubt that the U.S. homeland is vulnerable to an ISIS attack like the ones last month in Brussels, killing 32, and last November in Paris, slaughtering 130?President Obama likes to say, ""you know, the Cold War's been over for 20 years."" But the threat of Islamist terrorists using Mexico as a launching ground for jihadist attacks within America smacks of another Cuban missile crisis.In the fall of 1962, the U.S. discovered that the Soviet Union was deploying nuclear missiles within the territory of its communist surrogate, Cuba, just 90 miles away from our shores. The Russians, naturally, lied and denied. But Obama's Democrat predecessor, President John F. Kennedy, presented satellite photos to Moscow proving the missiles' presence.""This urgent transformation of Cuba into an important strategic base -- by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction -- constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the Americas,"" Kennedy told the nation on Oct. 22nd of that year. He added that ""missiles in Cuba add to an already clear and present danger"" from the Soviet Union.JFK also pointed out that ""the 1930s taught us a clear lesson: aggressive conduct, if allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately leads to war.""Kennedy took action, blockading Cuba. (He also added a dose of appeasement, secretly withdrawing U.S. nuclear missiles from Turkey and Italy.)ISIS is of President Obama's own doing; it would not be what it is, in control of so much of Iraq and Syria and so rich from the oil there, if not for Obama's pullback of U.S. forces from Iraq more than four years ago. Will he, like JFK, investigate and take action against whatever terrorist presence there is just south of our border?Or will he tolerate this clear and present danger?

206,EL,"Last week, French President Francois Hollande met President Obama in Washington to discuss joint strategies for stopping the sort of radical Islamic terrorists who have killed dozens of innocents in Brussels, Paris and San Bernardino in recent months. Hollande at one point explicitly referred to the violence as ""Islamist terrorism.""The White House initially deleted that phrase from the audio translation of the official video of the Hollande-Obama meeting, only to restore it when questioned. Did the Obama administration assume that if the public could not hear the translation of the French president saying ""Islamist terrorism,"" then perhaps Hollande did not really say it -- and therefore perhaps Islamist terrorism does not really exist?The Obama administration must be aware that in the 1930s, the Soviet Union wiped clean all photos, recordings and films of Leon Trotsky on orders from Josef Stalin. Trotsky was deemed politically incorrect, and therefore his thoughts and photos simply vanished.The Library of Congress, under pressure from Dartmouth College students, recently banned not just the term ""illegal alien"" in subject headings for literature about immigration, but ""alien"" as well. Will changing the vocabulary mean that from now on, foreign nationals who choose to enter and reside in the United States without being naturalized will not be in violation of the law and will no longer be considered citizens of their homeland?Did the Library of Congress ever read the work of the Greek historian Thucydides, who warned some 2,500 years ago that in times of social upheaval, partisans would make words ""change their ordinary meaning and … take that which was now given them.""These latest linguistic contortions to advance ideological agendas follow an established pattern of the Obama administration and the departments beneath it.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper’s described Egypt’s radical Muslim Brotherhood as ""largely secular."" CIA Director John Brennan has called jihad ""a legitimate tenet of Islam,"" a mere effort ""to purify oneself.""Other administration heads have airbrushed out Islamic terrorism by referring to it with phrases such as ""man-caused disaster."" The effort to combat terrorism was called an ""overseas contingency operation,"" perhaps like Haitian earthquake relief.The White House wordsmiths should reread George Orwell’s 1946 essay ""Politics and the English Language,"" which warned that ""political writing is bad writing"" and ""has to consist largely of euphemism.""Obama has said the greatest threat to future generations is ""climate change,"" a term that metamorphosed from ""global warming."" The now anachronistic term ""global warming"" used to describe a planet that was supposedly heating up rather quickly. But it did not account for the unpleasant fact that there has been negligible global temperature change since 1998.Rather than modifying the phrase to ""suspected global warming"" or ""episodic global warming,"" the new term ""climate change"" was invented to replace it. That way, new realities could emerge. Changes of all sorts — historic snows, record cold, California drought, El Nino storms — could all be lumped together, supposedly caused by man-made carbon emissions.Volatile weather such as tornadoes, tsunamis and hurricanes was sometimes rebranded as ""climate chaos"" — as if Western industry and consumer lifestyles were responsible for what used to be seen as fairly normal occurrences.The term ""sanctuary cities"" describes municipalities that in neo-Confederate fashion deny the primacy of federal immigration law and refuse to enforce it.Attorney General Loretta Lynch used the term ""justice-involved youth"" to describe young criminals arrested and charged with crimes. From such terminology, one might think the offenders’ ""involvement"" meant that they were parole officers or young lawyers.So what is the point of trying to change reality by making up new names and phrases?It’s mostly politics. If Hollande had used the label ""skinheads"" to describe European right-wing movements, the White House might not have altered the video. If a half-million right-wing Cubans were pouring illegally into Florida each year, or if 100,000 Serbs were crossing the border from Canada, the Library of Congress might not object to calling them ""illegal aliens."" Clapper and Brennan are unlikely to claim that the Crusades were largely secular or an exercise in self-purification.The Obama administration probably would not describe rogue police officers charged with crimes as ""justice-involved police."" If cities with conservative mayors declined to enforce the Endangered Species Act or federal firearms statutes, they probably would not be known as ""sanctuary cities,"" but rather as ""nullification cities.""Orwell also wrote about a futuristic dystopia ruled by a Big Brother government that created politicized euphemisms to reinvent reality. He placed his novel in the year 1984, warning Westerners about what was in their future.We are now 32 years beyond 1984, but we are at last living Orwell’s nightmare.

208,EL,"Oil closed above $41 a barrel in New York after terrorist attacks in Brussels, amid forecasts that U.S. crude inventories climbed from an 86-year high.Futures were little changed after earlier falling as much as 1.8% following explosions in a Brussels airport departure hall and a subway station. U.S. crude stockpiles are forecast to have risen last week, keeping supplies at the most since 1930. Oil gained Monday after OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla El-Badri said that 15 or 16 nations will attend oil-output freeze talks on April 17 in Doha, Qatar.""The oil market initially reacted to the Brussels attacks,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. ""The drop was short-lived. The market has a lot of support.""Oil slumped to a 12-year low in February before rising on speculation that stronger demand and falling U.S. output will ease a global surplus. The drop in production outside OPEC and a decline in U.S. drilling show that the group's strategy of letting the market rebalance itself is working, El-Badri said in Vienna on Monday.West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery fell 7 cents to settle at $41.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Futures climbed as much as 0.9%. Total volume traded was 13% above the 100-day average at 4:36 p.m. The April contract rose 1.2% to $39.91 on Monday, when it expired.Futures retreated after the settlement when the American Petroleum Institute was said to report U.S. crude supplies rose 8.8 million barrels last week.Image provided by Shutterstock.

209,EL,"A deal among top oil producers looked more likely Tuesday as an agreement to freeze output appeared possible even without Iran, but oil prices fell nonetheless after terrorist attacks rocked Brussels.A senior OPEC delegate told the Financial Times that Saudi Arabia would join the oil freeze pact regardless of whether Iran joins.“There is agreement from many countries to go along with a freeze -- why make it contingent on Iran,” the delegate said.Brent crude closed up 0.6% to $41.79 a barrel. U.S. crude fell 0.2% to $41.45.In the stock market today, BP (BP) fell 0.55%, Chevron (CVX) shares fell 0.9%, and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) 1.1%.Producers from OPEC and non-OPEC countries are expected to meet in Doha, Qatar, on April 17 to discuss freezing output at January levels. Top producers were supposed to meet in Moscow on March 20, but Iran balked at the meeting.Last month, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Qatar and Venezuela agreed to freeze production, but only if other major producers joined in. Earlier this month, Kuwait similarly said it would join the pact if Iran, along with all other major producers, did as well.Iran currently produces 1.1 million barrels per day, but it had produced 2.5 million barrels per day before sanctions over its nuclear program were implemented. Iran has said it plans to boost output by 1 million barrels per day over the next 6 to 12 months.On Monday, OPEC Secretary-General Abdalla Salem el-Badri said Iran may join the freeze in the future. El-Badri also said that some OPEC members wouldn't attend the meeting in Doha, but that 15 or 16 countries in total were scheduled to attend.But a Libyan OPEC official said the country had no plans to attend the meeting in Doha. Libya is only producing 400,000 barrel a day, down from the 1.6 billion it produced before the 2011 civil war.""Clearly, they have to allow us to go back to our production when the security situation in the country improves,” the official told Reuters.Also Monday,  Schlumberger (SLB), the largest oilfield services provider, said it sees first-quarter revenue falling 15% on spending cuts. Schlumberger shares were 1.7% lower Tuesday.Transocean (RIG) CEO Jeremy Thigpen told Bloomberg that he doesn't see rig pricing rising for another three years. Transocean shares plunged 5% Tuesday.
"
210,EL,"Fraud: Ten years ago Monday, Al Gore said we had only a decade left to save the planet from global warming. But Earth has been doing just fine. Why do we listen to this man?While preening at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2006 during the premiere of his ""An Inconvenient Truth"" fib-umentary, Gore made his grand declaration. The former vice president said, in the words of the AP reporter taking down his story, that ""unless drastic measures to reduce greenhouse gases are taken within the next 10 years, the world will reach a point of no return."" In Gore's own words, he claimed we were in ""a true planetary emergency.""Ten years later, he's probably hoping that everyone has forgotten about his categorical statement.The terrible truth for Gore is that there is no planetary emergency. Not one of the dire predictions he and the rest of the alarmist community made has come to pass. In fact, there is plenty of evidence that they have been running a racket. Here's how we know:One, Earth hasn't warmed in nearly 20 years. Yes, 2015 supposedly ""smashed"" the previous temperature record. But actually it was the third-warmest year on record — or maybe ""not even close to the hottest year on record,"" says James Taylor of the Heartland Institute.The global average temperature, a devilish thing to determine anyway, depends on what temperature readings are being used and who is ""adjusting"" the data to fit their political purposes. The scientific community cannot be trusted to provide honest numbers. And 2015 was, after all, an El Nino year. Higher temperatures, with no link to man's activities, were expected.Two, predictions that climate change — the rebranding of ""global warming"" when it turned out that predicted warming wasn't happening — would cause catastrophic weather damage haven't panned out.German insurance giant Munich Re says losses from natural disasters were lower in 2015 than in 2014 and lowest since 2009. The facts are sharply at odds with Gore's 2012 claim that ""dirty weather"" caused by ""dirty fossil fuel"" has created ""extreme weather"" that ""is happening all over the world with increasing frequency.""Three, despite all the self-congratulatory international conferences and pseudo-agreements, the world has done nothing to ""fight global warming.""He cannot claim that his deadline has been extended because some governments have forced their citizens to cut carbon dioxide emissions. CO2 levels keep climbing and now exceed 401 parts per million in the atmosphere. It is simply not the dangerous greenhouse gas we've repeatedly been told it is.Four, in the mid- to late-2000s, Gore repeatedly predicted that an ice-free Arctic Ocean was coming soon. But as usual, his fortune-telling was wrong. By 2014, Arctic ice had grown thicker and covered a greater area than it did when he made his prediction.Five, Gore's movie, which somehow won an Oscar, was found by a British judge to contain nine errors. The judge said it could not be shown to students unless it included a notice pointing out the errors.Gore will never apologize for peddling deceit, never admit he was wrong. Best thing to do is ignore him.

212,EL,"The sophisticates who appear on television to explain foreign policy to the ordinary folk like to describe the intricate differences between Sunni and Shiite, and Leninism and Maoism.But Julio Cesar Pino, the tenured Kent State history professor also known by his Muslim moniker, Assad Jibril Pino, has apparently found a way to love the Islamic State, the founder of al-Qaida, and Fidel Castro too.All these anti-American allegiances are supposedly mutually exclusive, but it's funny how evil so often just ends up being plain, old evil. And coalescing with the nearest available other manifestations of evil.The FBI is investigating Pino for possible associations with ISIS. In a Facebook post, Pino apparently wrote that ""Sheik Osama (May Allah be Pleased with Him) was the greatest, and desrves (sic) praise for kicking off this jihad."" A glance at Pino's background indicates he should have been investigated years ago. Communism ""brought justice"" to Cuba, the Havana-born Pino is on record claiming, for instance.Pino's native Cuba was in the terrorism business when al-Qaida was just a gleam in Osama bin Laden's eye, as scholar and former National Security Council staffer Roger Fontaine long ago documented. ""Castro's targets for subversion and terrorism have included such Latin-American military dictatorships as General Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic as well as democratic leaders Romulo Betancourt of Venezuela and Jose Napoleon Duarte of El Salvador,"" Fontaine was pointing out three decades ago.""Cuban-aided terrorism helped destroy Uruguayan democracy for a decade and contributed greatly to the erosion of Chile's democratic institutions under Salvador Allende,"" Fontaine wrote in a Heritage Foundation terrorism analysis.Meanwhile, in El Salvador ""Cuban-supported guerrillas and terrorists attempted to wreck the March 20, 1988, legislative and mayoral elections with the bomb and the bullet, just as they had six years earlier when Salvadorans went to the polls in that country's first free election."" That same month, Fontaine noted, ""a former pilot of Panama's strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega said that planeloads of Cuban arms had been flown into that country.""Pino had a different take on that era: ""Our brothers and sisters in Central America were being butchered by American-trained death-squads daily. Poverty and unemployment inside the United States surged while the rich grew fatter under the presidency of Ronald Reagan. ... Quickly, I turned into a cynic,"" and in 2000 converted to Islam after reading the Koran on a passenger jet — presumably one that wasn't hijacked.Pino got a history Ph.D from UCLA, was a Fulbright Scholar and Phi Beta Kappa member. So the lesson here may just be: Even the immigrants who come here supposedly to become highly-educated contributors to American society can turn out to be a threat to the homeland.

214,EL,"Accountability: The infamous and deadly ""gun walking"" scandal President Obama stonewalled and then dismissed as ""phony"" years ago may finally get the attention it deserves, thanks to two recent developments.For those who don't remember, Fast and Furious was a Justice Dept. program that allowed illegal gun sales in the U.S. to Mexican criminals, allegedly as a way to track them. But internal documents later revealed that the plan was to use Fast and Furious as a pretext to impose stricter rules on gun sales.Whatever their intentions, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents almost immediately lost track of most of the 2,000 or so guns sold through the program.That is, until they start showing up at murder scenes on both sides of the border, including one that claimed the life of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry.If was only after Terry's tragic death that this woefully misbegotten program came to light. And then, ""the most transparent administration in history"" initially lied about the program to Congress.And then Team Obama set about to stonewall investigations into who was responsible by withholding documents — for which former Attorney General Eric Holder earned a contempt of Congress rap — and later claiming executive privilege.The administration's strategy, abetted by a compliant media, seemed to work, and the bloody scandal has been dormant for years despite the lack of answers or accountability.But this week breathed new life into Fast and Furious.First, there was the raid on drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's hideout, which turned up a .50 caliber rifle sold through Fast and Furious. This is not some sporting rifle that the administration sold. This one measures more than 4 feet long and can bring down a helicopter.Next, Obama-appointed District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson tossed out Obama's executive privilege claim.Jackson noted that a 2012 inspector general report was based on many of these same documents, so there was no credible reason to keep internal emails, memos and other documents from congressional investigators.The executive privilege claim was always a dubious one. It's meant to protect the president's ability to have an open dialogue with his staff, not as an excuse to sweep any potentially embarrassing documents under the rug.House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz called the district court ruling ""an important step forward.""But don't expect the White House to suddenly become cooperative. Jackson gave the administration until Feb. 2 to turn over the documents, which happens to be Groundhog Day. And like the classic movie, the administration will likely repeat its foot-dragging efforts in the hope that it will be safely out of office before anyone really knows what happened and why.Republicans in Congress and the public at large should demand that the administration come clean now, if for no other reason than to honor Brian Terry's service.

215,EL,"No single stock screen will be the best in every uptrend. Different uptrends reward different kinds of stocks, and the screens reflect that reality. For example, during the last bear market, the aggressive and growthy complexion of the IBD 50 (then the IBD 100) faded.Stocks making the list on Oct. 27, 2008, included El Paso Electric (EE), Campbell Soup (CPB), Procter & Gamble (PG) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).The mention of those equities alone said, ""It's a bear market.""As of early November, the 85-85 screen has been the top-performing screen over the past six months. The 85-85 was up 6.1%, while the S&P 500 gained 1.1% and the IBD 50 1.5%.What can be made of this? There are two ways to use a screen — the micro approach and the macro approach.The micro approach studies the list to find stocks that might be near buy points and that have few misses by CAN SLIM standards .The macro approach looks for patterns in the list. What kind of stocks are making the list — small caps or big caps? Which sectors or industry groups are plentiful? Are the stocks making the screen aggressive or defensive?Let's contemplate two screens — the IBD 50 and the 85-85, also known as Your Weekly Review in Friday's newspaper.Generally, the IBD 50 is a collection of stocks that have higher ratings than those in the 85-85 screen. Because the IBD 50 has higher ratings, these stocks should do better in a long and strong uptrend.Quality growth stocks, though, will likely correct more sharply than defensive stocks when the market runs into trouble.What is the advantage of the 85-85 screen?The 85-85 will pick up more turnaround stocks than the IBD 50. (A turnaround stock is less likely to have strong annual ratings over the past three years.) The 85-85's looser standard means that it's also more likely to pick up stocks benefiting from sector rotation. It also will pick up more small and thinly traded stocks than the IBD 50.The sector rotation angle has been apparent recently. Small bank and S&L industry groups accounted for 40 of the stocks in the 85-85 at the end of October.Yet only two bank stocks made the IBD 50 — Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) and Signature Bank (SBNY). Many of the 85-85 bank stocks are thinly traded. Some, though, still attract quality mutual fund holders, as the table shows.

246,EL,"The meat products industry group has emerged as the No. 1 group out of 197, as of Thursday's IBD. The rise could be partly defensive, with money managers shifting to companies showing steady growth in the belief they will hold up better than high fliers as the market turns lower.But companies in the group have seen have seen solid earnings and sales growth in recent quarters. Five of the nine stocks in the group have Composite Ratings of 90 or above.Supply and demand have driven the story in several of these stocks. Commodity prices have been falling, making feed cheaper. Cattle herds are growing after several years of declines. One factor is the years of Western drought, which forced cattle ranchers to reduce herds but now may be coming to an end as El Nino brings rains.The No. 2 stock in the group by Composite Rating is Hormel (HRL), the maker of Spam, Jennie-O Turkey, Skippy peanut butter, Black Label Bacon and Muscle Milk. The company noted in recent presentations and in its most recent earnings report that its grocery products and refrigerated foods products business were benefiting from input-cost deflation.Growth in China has also been a factor.Tyson Foods (TSN), the nation's largest meat packer by sales, forecast another year of record profits in its Nov. 23 earnings report.""Our chicken business is strong, pork continues to do well, and we think the worst is behind us in beef,"" Chief Executive Donnie Smith said in a conference call.Chicken producers have weathered an outbreak of avian flu that forced the destruction of large flocks.Hormel reported sales declines of its Jennie-O turkey because of bird flu, but it said the product has become the ""clear category leader"" and is being embraced by health-conscious millennials.While that hurt some producers, it helped Cal-Maine Foods (CALM), the nation's largest egg producer and top-ranked in the meat products industry group, which was unscathed in the disease outbreak.It benefited as the price of eggs soared. Over the last two quarters, year-over-year earnings growth was triple-digit, while sales grew at 71% and 44% clips. After-tax margins were north of 40%. But analysts see the good times coming to an eventual end. They forecast a 31% EPS decline in fiscal 2017.Cal-Maine's stock has given up ground in recent weeks and is now trading below its 200-day moving average.Acquisitions have also been a factor in the industry group. Tyson recently bought Hillshire Brands, which has given it a bigger footprint in the packaged food business.Hormel Foods last year paid $775 million to buy organic processed meats maker Applegate Farms. Hormel says it's the No. 1 organic and natural producer by market share in value-added proteins.

265,EL,"Here's the one word that could have made you a lot of money in 2015: postage. Stamps.com (STMP), a provider of online postage and shipping services, has more than doubled this year amid a string of better-than-expected earnings reports. It's currently just out of buying range after clearing a 106.53 flat-base buy point.For a monthly fee of $15.99, individuals, businesses and online retailers can go to Stamps.com to print postage stamps, saving a trip to the post office and sharply reducing the cost of traditional postage meter service. Customers also can turn digital photos, designs or logos into stamps.The El Segundo, Calif.-based company, founded in 1996, has reported three straight quarters of strong profit and revenue growth, beating Wall Street estimates each time.The stock's fundamental and technical metrics put it at the top of the highly ranked Internet retail group, ahead of even IBD Leaderboard stock Amazon.com (AMZN).Stamps.com's success is owing partly to acquisitions that have helped it expand into the fast-growing shipping business. Last month, Stamps.com completed its $215 million purchase of Endicia, which helps businesses run their shipping operations.It joins the 2014 acquisitions of package shipping firms ShipWorks and ShipStation, which helped boost the company's Q3 results.""The combination of some great acquisitions ... along with increasingly effective marketing spend has resulted in material upside for 5 quarters in a row,"" investment bank Craig-Hallum said in a Nov. 6 research note.

266,EL,"Immigration: A new border surge is on us, with illegals pouring in from Central America and well beyond. Yes, it's the work of political forces taking advantage of U.S. weakness. But it has major complicity from the White House.On Monday, Costa Rica announced a ""deal"" with Panama, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, Mexico and the International Organization for Migration to transport least 8,000 Cuban migrants holed up at its border to San Salvador by airlift. It will then transport them by bus through Guatemala and into Mexico, with the goal of depositing them at the U.S. border for illegal entry.The Cubans, who had been been denied travel visas by Nicaragua, could then take advantage of the Cuban Adjustment Act for permanent residence in the U.S.The 1995 rule, familiarly known as ""wet foot, dry foot,"" was a relic of an earlier era, when Cuban refugees really did flee the horrors of communism for freedom.Today, the migrants leave for economic reasons, according to a report Monday in the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, which interviewed new Cuban arrivals.This deal is notable in that Uncle Sam wasn't invited to it. Despite the cultural and language affinity that Cubans have with the rest of Latin America, it's just to dump them at the U.S. border and let the gringos pay. Win-win for them, lose-lose for us.It's a significant story because the border surge is now bigger than ever. As word spreads about President Obama's unguarded border and the decades-long judicial backlog on deportations, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has released new data showing that illegal immigration among unaccompanied kids and families soared in October and November.Citing CBP statistics, CNS News reported that 10,588 unaccompanied aliens under age 17 were caught at the southern border over the last year, a 106% rise over the year earlier. As for illegal families, the rise was 173%.That's a crisis with profound implications for the U.S. and its integrity as a nation. According to experts cited by the Heritage Foundation, it's a likely ""new normal.""Because what we are seeing isn't just Mexicans or Central Americans crossing anymore. The now well-financed, tech-savvy Central American criminal networks are smuggling thousands of Africans, Asians, South Americans and Middle Easterners to the U.S., the same way they'll sneak the 8,000 Cubans in.There's little doubt they'll all make it. President Obama's recent announced deportation program, for families rejected for asylum in U.S. courts after the new year, was really a warning to illegals to get lost for a while. It's no serious effort to enforce immigration law.Like Europe's elites, Obama seems determined to erase the face of America as it is and replace it with a chaotic free-for-all. After all, he's been seen reading Fareed Zakaria's ""The Post-American World.""As Donald Trump and others note, a nation with no borders is no nation at all. Our breach is growing wide.

267,EL,"The practice of shopping for high-end makeup has not yet gone the way of book-buying and succumbed to the weight of Amazon's (AMZN) can't-beat-'em discounts and free shipping — contrary to the hand-wringing over the 2013 launch of the e-tailer's luxury beauty portal.In fact, specialty beauty retail leaders Ulta (ULTA) and Sephora are doing just fine. More than fine, if anything.Ulta shares hit a new intraday high of 188.48 on Dec. 17, and Sephora continues to shine for luxury parent LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton (LVMUY).So what elusive ""It"" qualities does the specialty beauty industry have that make customers immune to the charms of Amazon?For one thing, it offers something that the pure-play e-commerce giant, by definition, can't offer: a satisfying in-store experience.""It's like a good glass of wine,"" said Piper Jaffray analyst Stephanie Wissink. ""You can find yourself in your own space for a period of time. That 15 minutes is glorious.""Vanity FairWalking into a Sephora is a bit like wandering backstage at a Victoria's Secret runway show — it's all flattering vanity lighting and glossy makeup kits and the tacit promise of looking like Gisele Bundchen upon exit. Ulta comes equipped with full-service salons and Benefit Brow Bars in-store for those seeking the full makeover-montage experience.""Ulta and Sephora provide a place to play,"" said Wissink, adding that there's an ""intangible benefit"" of being in the store.A Beautiful EducationPlus, the ""test-and-trial"" nature of beauty products prompts first-time buyers to head to a brick-and-mortar shop instead of ordering online, she said.Testers and samples abound at beauty stores. Buying items like lipstick and eye shadow on the Internet is a tricky business — what appears to be one shade in one's browser can be very different from what appears in one's mailbox.There is, however, potential for Amazon to steal share when it comes to replenishing products.""In theory, (cosmetics) should be the perfect online business,"" Nomura analyst Simeon Siegel told IBD. ""On the other hand, even repeat customers will walk into these stores and find new products all the time. There will always be an element of discovery with cosmetics.""YouTube and beauty bloggers offer a fairly well-rounded education online, for those willing to dedicate the time to it. But deciphering the latest makeup application techniques — think contouring or strobing — can be a little overwhelming.Ulta, which sells both mass brands like Revlon and L'Oreal, in addition to luxury brands like Urban Decay and Smashbox, offers makeup consultations at no charge. Sephora holds free makeup classes that conveniently allow shoppers some time to buy newfound products before the store officially opens for the day.No Seasons — Or DiscountsBeauty has the added buffer of not being a seasonal industry, say analysts, which keeps prices in check. Makeup colors keep changing, but the products generally remain the same. A facial cleanser knows no season. An acne cream is a year-round need.Contrast this to the season-dependent world of apparel, where fast-fashion retailers are pressuring traditional department stores and clothing boutiques.""There aren't four seasons; there are 52,"" said Siegel of the apparel space. When a product doesn't work, it goes on sale, and retailers have to hurry to push out inventory, creating what he calls a ""circular promotional death spiral.""Plus, prestige beauty brands have managed to keep pricing and distribution on a fairly short leash as they keep product availability exclusive to certain merchants.Still, there's nothing technically stopping Amazon from offering deals on Estee Lauder (EL) and other higher-end names.""My understanding is that luxury brands that are hesitant to partner with Amazon are concerned that this pricing consistency may be at risk,"" said NPD Group analyst Karen Grant.But even brands that don't have an official presence on Amazon are often sold via third-party sellers on the site. And counterfeit beauty products are a documented problem on Amazon, Alibaba (BABA), eBay (EBAY) and elsewhere.""(Brands) are deluding themselves into thinking Amazon doesn't have a large impact on their business because they're not officially distributed"" on the platform, said Scott Galloway, founder of research firm L2 and a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business.Amazon's luxury beauty portal has been a ""disappointment"" for the company so far, he said, but it ""shows no signs of giving up"" — outspending Sephora and Macy's (M) on beauty-related search-engine keywords on Alphabet 's (GOOGL) Google.And as the online retailer continues its assertive march toward retail domination, it holds a bargaining chip or two. Brands that choose to distribute via the platform can enlist its cooperation in erasing third-party listings, according to Galloway, who said once Burberry and Calvin Klein gave Amazon the go-ahead to sell a ""small number"" of their fragrance products, ""unofficial SKUs (stock-keeping units)dropped dramatically.""""The implicit message from Amazon is: Work with us, or we will (mess) with you,"" he said.No Specifics On RelationshipsAmazon would not provide specifics on its relationships with brands, but a spokeswoman told IBD that Amazon's luxury beauty segment is one its ""fastest-growing categories,"" and its online storefront offerings have resulted in ""more brands want(ing) to join Amazon's Luxury Beauty store.""For now, however, specialty beauty retailers are holding their own, especially as they build out their e-commerce reach.Ulta's online sales soared 56.3% in Q3 as it crushed estimates and boosted guidance. Sephora's e-commerce sales are ""rapidly increasing in all regions,"" according to LVMH's latest earnings report. Cowen & Co. analyst Oliver Chen wrote that ""Sephora is best-in-class with regard to their mobile/online execution."" Plus, it has been gaining share ""in all its markets,"" with same-store revenue growth ""particularly strong,"" said LVMH.And never discount the appeal of being part of an exclusive backstage club.Ulta's loyalty-program membership has been accelerating, quarter over quarter, reaching 17 million active members. By comparison, Starbucks' (SBUX) much-lauded rewards program has over 20 million members globally.Amenities ProvidedThe things that Amazon does so well — offering a wide variety and free shipping — are amenities Ulta and Sephora already provide. Members of both Ultamate Rewards and Beauty Insider (Sephora's loyalty program) have the added benefit of redeeming points for products.Over the summer, Sephora shoppers had the chance to redeem ""Epic Rewards,"" ranging from a foursome of full-size Givenchy lipsticks for 1,000 points to a trip to Paris to visit Lancome for 10,000 points. (Notably, the rewards promotion faced scrutiny for selling out items too quickly, prompting a social media backlash.)Perks like that have so far been enough to steer beauty buyers away from the less lavish space of an online megamart. Cowen analysts wrote Thursday that beauty is one area with an ""un-Amazon-able"" retail proposition, and that offering a differentiated shopping experience and/or selling a product with an ""emotional component"" offers a viable path to compete against Amazon.""Loyalty programs are extremely compelling,"" said NPD's Grant. ""It's like candy.""""(They) incentivize you to shop and to shop with them, and they do an excellent job of it,"" she said. ""Price isn't everything. But they also offer a good price and good service and all of the rest.""

268,EL,"It's understandable if executives at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual restaurant chains are feeling a little heartburn heading into the new year.
"
269,EL,"The recent E. coli outbreak at dozens of Chipotle restaurants was enough to give the whole restaurant sector indigestion, considering that Chipotle had been one of the industry's leading lights earlier in the year. Even before the E. coli news hit, though, Chipotle and other fast-casual chains were falling out of favor on Wall Street.
"
270,EL,"""It's been a tough market for high-beta restaurant stocks,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Andrew Charles told IBD.

In comparison, high-beta stocks have underperformed.""
"
271,EL,"Shares of Chipotle, Panera Bread (PNRA), Shake Shack (SHAK), Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) spent the latter half of 2015 heading south.

"
273,EL,"Fast Casual Off IPO Menu?
"
274,EL,"The challenge facing fast-casual restaurant stocks as they enter 2016 is figuring out how to recapture some of the magic that pushed the group to record highs during the first half of 2015. That won't be easy, considering the current mindset of many investors.
"
275,EL,"It's also unlikely that you'll see many new issues stepping in to give the fast-casual group a shot of adrenaline in 2016, says Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson.
"
276,EL,"""You're seeing harder market conditions for a lot of IPOs — not just for restaurants, but also for tech firms and other industries,"" Anderson told IBD.
"
277,EL,"Meanwhile, slowing same-restaurant sales growth has hit most fast-casual chains of late. Zoe's, Fiesta, El Pollo Loco and Habit logged decelerating comp growth during the first three quarters of the year. While Panera saw a year-over-year improvement in comp growth during each of its first three quarters of 2015, that came off easy comparisons with 2014, when gains were minimal.
"
278,EL,"Chipotle Stock Turns Toxic
"
279,EL,"The real trouble came for Chipotle, whose comparable restaurant sales growth decelerated in each of the first three quarters of 2015, all down sharply from 2014. During the second quarter, Chipotle's comp growth fell to 4.3% from 17.3% the prior year. Q3 comps grew 2.6% vs. 19.8% a year earlier.
"
280,EL,"Things got even worse earlier this month when Chipotle, in the throes of its E. coli crisis, warned that fourth-quarter same-store sales won't increase but instead will fall by 8% to 11%. The company also said that earnings per share will end up at $2.45 to $2.85 a share, well off the $4.09 that analysts had expected.
"
281,EL,"Amid new E. coli issues, Chipotle's stock fell 8.5% in the last week, 35% off its August peak.
"
282,EL,"The best performer among fast-casual stocks has been Shake Shack, which had its initial public offering in January. Its year-over-year comps grew 11.7% during the first quarter, 12.9% during the second, and 17.1% during the third. Even so, Shake Shack shares are down 58% from their high of 96.75, set in May.
"
283,EL,"All of the fast-casual players have faced rising competition — not just from each other, but also from privately held chains and small local and regional operations looking to hop on the fast-casual bandwagon.
"
284,EL,"""It's a very fragmented industry,"" Cowen's Charles said. ""There's not just one player you have to worry about, but many different types of players.""
"
285,EL,"Competition doesn't come just from other fast-casual chains, either. Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, a research and consulting firm, points out that some companies face increased competition from chains that don't fall under the fast-casual umbrella.
"
286,EL,"Panera Faces Bakery Rivals
"
287,EL,"""There are a number of menu categories that are starting to see some maturity, including bakery cafes,"" Tristano told IBD. ""Panera is the leader in the bakery cafe segment. It's not only seeing competition from other fast-casual chains, but also from Starbucks and drive-through chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN). A lot of fast-food players are really pushing the convenience of drive-through.""
"
288,EL,"Companies that focus on more narrow niches should fare better. Tristano points to Zoe's, which specializes in healthier Mediterranean dishes.
"
289,EL,"""That's a good category where there's not a lot of competition and plenty of room to grow,"" Tristano said.
"
290,EL,"Chipotle Pain, Qdoba Gain?
"
291,EL,"The Mexican category is ""still dominated by Chipotle,"" Tristano said, though he added that Qdoba Mexican Eats, owned by Jack in the Box (JACK), is continuing to grow in a lot of markets where it overlaps with Chipotle.
"
292,EL,"The wild card is how Chipotle's E. coli woes will affect the competitive landscape. The outbreak has spread across nine states and sickened more than 50 customers. The chain also came under question when 150 people who ate at a Boston Chipotle contracted norovirus.
"

"
303,EL,"""The appeal to consumers is higher-quality food in a faster time frame,"" Charles said. ""That's not going out of style.""It's understandable if executives at Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) and other fast-casual restaurant chains are feeling a little heartburn heading into the new year.The recent E. coli outbreak at dozens of Chipotle restaurants was enough to give the whole restaurant sector indigestion, considering that Chipotle had been one of the industry's leading lights earlier in the year. Even before the E. coli news hit, though, Chipotle and other fast-casual chains were falling out of favor on Wall Street.""It's been a tough market for high-beta restaurant stocks,"" Cowen & Co. analyst Andrew Charles told IBD. ""There's a very risk-averse type of investor out there, which you can see in the fact that two of the best restaurant performers have been big names like McDonald's (MCD) and Starbucks (SBUX) . In comparison, high-beta stocks have underperformed.""Shares of Chipotle, Panera Bread (PNRA), Shake Shack (SHAK), Zoe's Kitchen (ZOES), Fiesta Restaurant Group (FRGI), Habit Restaurants (HABT) and El Pollo Loco (LOCO) spent the latter half of 2015 heading south.Analysts say that a number of factors contributed to the decline, including slowing financial growth, overheated valuations and competition from an increasingly crowded field.Fast Casual Off IPO Menu?The challenge facing fast-casual restaurant stocks as they enter 2016 is figuring out how to recapture some of the magic that pushed the group to record highs during the first half of 2015. That won't be easy, considering the current mindset of many investors.It's also unlikely that you'll see many new issues stepping in to give the fast-casual group a shot of adrenaline in 2016, says Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson.""You're seeing harder market conditions for a lot of IPOs — not just for restaurants, but also for tech firms and other industries,"" Anderson told IBD.Meanwhile, slowing same-restaurant sales growth has hit most fast-casual chains of late. Zoe's, Fiesta, El Pollo Loco and Habit logged decelerating comp growth during the first three quarters of the year. While Panera saw a year-over-year improvement in comp growth during each of its first three quarters of 2015, that came off easy comparisons with 2014, when gains were minimal.Chipotle Stock Turns ToxicThe real trouble came for Chipotle, whose comparable restaurant sales growth decelerated in each of the first three quarters of 2015, all down sharply from 2014. During the second quarter, Chipotle's comp growth fell to 4.3% from 17.3% the prior year. Q3 comps grew 2.6% vs. 19.8% a year earlier.Things got even worse earlier this month when Chipotle, in the throes of its E. coli crisis, warned that fourth-quarter same-store sales won't increase but instead will fall by 8% to 11%. The company also said that earnings per share will end up at $2.45 to $2.85 a share, well off the $4.09 that analysts had expected.Amid new E. coli issues, Chipotle's stock fell 8.5% in the last week, 35% off its August peak.The best performer among fast-casual stocks has been Shake Shack, which had its initial public offering in January. Its year-over-year comps grew 11.7% during the first quarter, 12.9% during the second, and 17.1% during the third. Even so, Shake Shack shares are down 58% from their high of 96.75, set in May.All of the fast-casual players have faced rising competition — not just from each other, but also from privately held chains and small local and regional operations looking to hop on the fast-casual bandwagon.""It's a very fragmented industry,"" Cowen's Charles said. ""There's not just one player you have to worry about, but many different types of players.""Competition doesn't come just from other fast-casual chains, either. Darren Tristano, president of Technomic, a research and consulting firm, points out that some companies face increased competition from chains that don't fall under the fast-casual umbrella.Panera Faces Bakery Rivals""There are a number of menu categories that are starting to see some maturity, including bakery cafes,"" Tristano told IBD. ""Panera is the leader in the bakery cafe segment. It's not only seeing competition from other fast-casual chains, but also from Starbucks and drive-through chains like Dunkin' Brands (DNKN). A lot of fast-food players are really pushing the convenience of drive-through.""Companies that focus on more narrow niches should fare better. Tristano points to Zoe's, which specializes in healthier Mediterranean dishes.""That's a good category where there's not a lot of competition and plenty of room to grow,"" Tristano said.Chipotle Pain, Qdoba Gain?The Mexican category is ""still dominated by Chipotle,"" Tristano said, though he added that Qdoba Mexican Eats, owned by Jack in the Box (JACK), is continuing to grow in a lot of markets where it overlaps with Chipotle.The wild card is how Chipotle's E. coli woes will affect the competitive landscape. The outbreak has spread across nine states and sickened more than 50 customers. The chain also came under question when 150 people who ate at a Boston Chipotle contracted norovirus.Chipotle's woes could open up opportunities for other fast-casual chains to pick up market share.""For every loser, there will be a winner, and Panera will be the real winner at the start,"" said Maxim's Anderson.

304,EL,"Elections: Just months after handing out California driver's licenses to illegals, Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a law to automatically register every driver to vote. Supposedly, it's to raise turnout. More likely, it's inviting fraud.So how does opening up U.S. presidential elections to the votes of any of the citizens of El Salvador, Armenia, Mexico or China sound?Foreigners have complained for years about wanting to vote in U.S. elections and in California. And now they may get their wish — unless California's Gov. Jerry Brown is somehow kept from enacting AB 1461, a bill to automatically register every recipient of a California driver's license to vote.This latest law comes less than a year after enactment of AB 60, the state's law to issue driver's licenses to illegals. The media have played up that California is following Oregon. But unlike California, Oregon doesn't hand out driver's licenses to illegals.""The New Motor Voter Act will make our democracy stronger by removing a key barrier to voting for millions of California citizens. I applaud Governor Brown for his leadership and bold action to increase voter participation in our state,"" said the bill's sponsor, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who also counts the votes.Note his use of the words ""California citizens,"" not U.S. citizens. The Los Angeles Times has reported that state officials have openly moved at full speed to create a de facto ""California citizenship"" for illegals to get around the absence of amnesty.Don't think for a minute that this isn't about to include extending voting rights. California has one of the most abysmal databases of registered voters in the nation, according to Logan Churchwell, spokesman for True The Vote, an electoral integrity watchdog.Thirteen years after the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which required every state to maintain a proper voter-identification database, California is one of the few that still hasn't done it.The Department of Motor Vehicles is just as bad, Churchwell noted. Police departments from Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego and Long Beach won't touch it when searching for someone because the records are so disorderly and out of date, his organization found in a poll of police agencies.More to the point, illegals can do most of their paperwork over the Internet on the honor system and then obtain licenses by presenting a foreign passport or other recognized identification — including, ironically, a Mexican voting card — to a local DMV.After that, the same-day license will follow and from there, voter registration. The California database is explicitly not searchable for non-citizens, Churchwell notes. What's more, a rider was slipped into the bill to exempt illegals who vote from prosecution.Churchwell says that his organization found earlier that applications were being turned in with the voter applications still attached, even on illegals, until his organization got the state to stop it.But what's disturbing is the disingenuous reason why Brown and his Democratic machine buddies such as Padilla are citing: low voter turnout.They say that it's because too few voters are registered. After all, cities such as Huntington Park, South Gate, and Cudahy — all famous for the banana-republic-level corruption of their public officials — have voter turnout rates in the neighborhood of 11%.Far from a lack of motivation, these low-turnout areas are strongholds of illegal immigration. Illegals can't vote now — but with everyone registered and Padilla's office not concerned about checking anyone's status, the illegals will be casting votes that cancel the ballot choice of legitimate U.S. citizens and disenfranchise Americans in their own country.Brown, after all, meant it when he told an audience full of illegals last year, ""You're all welcome here.""According to the American Civil Liberties Union — which opposes the motor-voter law — California houses 3.3 million illegals, or a quarter of the nation's total. So the stage is set not just for extending voting to illegals but for swinging national elections, too.

306,EL,"In 2012, the Chilean government invited a group of journalists to the South American country to show off its innovations — language programs, new uses for llama fur, greenie aquaculture, microfinance, quake-proof skyscrapers and the world's most powerful telescope.But there was one thing missing amid all these new ideas: recognition for Chile's most spectacular innovation, the one that made the country's development into a first-world country possible.That concept? Chile's 35-year old private pension program, which a new report confirms is working spectacularly well.The tour took us to Santiago's Catholic University, where I found myself looking around for evidence of recognition of the university's role in igniting the free market revolution that transformed the country in the 1970s. Most of the economists who designed, created and implemented the new economy for Chile had gone to the Catholic University, the country's most prestigious, before getting additional instruction from the University of Chicago, where their Chicago Boys moniker comes from.The dean of the school's economics department, Sergio De Castro, was named Chile's finance minister in 1976, at which time he led a group of economists to create the original blueprint of the free market revolution from something he helped devise in the 1960s, known as El Ladrillo, or the little brick.Was there a picture of De Castro among all the storied paintings on the school grounds? Was there a plaque honoring the 20 or so economists whose training at this school led to the mother of all economic innovations in the free market revolution? Was there any acknowledgment of the role played by Jose Pinera, who designed and implemented the profoundly innovative private pension system, which up until then had never been tried — and which was copiously praised Milton Friedman?No, there wasn't.I actually pointed out to the university solons that for all their talk about wanting to be leaders in innovation, they were already leaders in innovation, yet any recognition of it was nowhere in sight. They didn't quite know what to say.The incident points to the trouble with Chile: a lack of economic information among large groups of citizens. Pinera, who was Chile's labor minister in 1978, knew that the idea of private pensions would have to be sold to the public. Economic ignorance was widespread, and he utilized the most important media outlet of the day, radio broadcasting, to give five-minute talks for the citizens on savings, ownership, control, responsibility and wealth building — which are the pillars of the Chilean Model — and have as their ultimate reward a comfortable retirement, which Chileans now do.His daily broadcasts led to sign-ups for the new private pension option that went well beyond expectations. At the time, Chile's leaders had expected 4% of the population to sign up, but got 25% right off the bat.Pinera is no longer broadcasting from the airwaves (although he does have an excellent website demonstrating the success of the idea), and successive socialist governments in Chile have pretty well limited their recognition of the Chilean Model to criticism of it, many of them still unhappy that it's not a state model that's providing such high returns.A Wharton professor, Olivia Mitchell, recently went down to Chile to sort the complaints out, and found that there was nothing to complain about — the system worked exactly as advertised, creating wealth and providing a dignified retirement for millions of people well beyond what the state could accomplish and, in fact, a much better one than Americans get with Social Security.All the issues that had been called problems were largely the result of widespread public ignorance of economics, Mitchell found. In other words, with Pinera no longer on the radio to explain that private savings really do create wealth, the people who should know better aren't educating the public.It's relevant, because the U.S. Social Security system is going bankrupt, and this year none of the presidential contenders seem to have the courage to address the issue with voters. It's the same old economic ignorance seen in Chile.Mitchell has a terrific piece in Forbes about the experience, testing and validating every detail that anyone who follows the Chilean model already knows. It's well worth a read.

307,EL,"Does it say anything to anyone that nowadays Cuban migrants, rather than take the jet stream on anything that floats to Florida as they used to, choose now to make lengthy stopovers in Central America first on the way to the U.S.? Why would anyone wanting asylum in America decide to detour through those hellholes when asylum is guaranteed just by reaching U.S. shores directly?The answer seems to be the development and reach of global smuggling networks that have grown as powerful as any better known non-state actors, such as terrorist groups and drug cartels. At last count, the United Nations said human traffickers worldwide rake in $36 billion a year. And they've been hugely empowered by the Obama administration's failure to enforce immigration laws.It's worth looking at because in addition to the strange logic of more and more Cubans fleeing Cuba via Central America, there's a new border surge of unaccompanied minors coming up from Central America, far bigger than last year's. And yes, they are related.The Associated Press reports this week that unaccompanied minors and family groups apprehended at the border soared 52% in August compared with the same month in 2014. That adds up to 9,790 arrests this year over 6,424 arrests the same time last year, which was near the peak of the 2014 Border Surge.These unaccompanied minors aren't the cute toddlers depicted by the media, but by and large teenage males (80%, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement), nearly all coming on the promise of some kind of work, a specialty of human traffickers.Nor is this ""a surprising uptick,"" as White House spokesman Josh Earnest said when asked about it Tuesday at a press conference.Anyone with a lick of sense would have been able to predict that admitting huge numbers of migrants with no penalty, as was done last year, was going to benefit the people who've been paid to get them here. The State Department itself has admitted that last year's border surge was the result of a marketing campaign by smugglers.Indeed, with U.S. courts backed up for decades with asylum claims, the president suspending deportations and ignoring immigration laws, anchor babies with illegal aliens, an open welfare system for those children and their parents, protection through DACA from deportation, and illegal aliens being awarded positions on city boards, it's virtually a no-risk proposition .Meanwhile, according to InsightCrime.org, a respected crime analysis website, the human smuggling pipelines — or routes used by these traffickers — develop from power voids. ""Generally, these networks are based in countries where lax border security, lenient immigration policies or easy access to fake documents make it easier for migrants to cross borders."" Sound like any place you know?Technology also plays a role. With the advent of cellphones, satellite phones, the Internet and other advanced communication, large organizations such as Big Labor, Big Business and Big Government are crumbling. It's given space for new bad-guy startups involved in people smuggling, according to Moises Naim in a new book, ""The End of Power,"" about the decline of traditional elites and the breakdown of power due to technology. Power is not shifting, but decaying, he argues, providing space for criminal groups and non-state actors to rise in the void. ""If the future of power lies in disruption and interference, not management and consolidation, can we ever expect to know stability again?"" Naim asks.There's plenty of evidence that smugglers are growing in power not just in Central America, but also here. This month, the Los Angeles Daily News ran an investigative report headlined ""Gang Leaders in El Salvador Testing Limits of Their Power in L.A., Rest Of U.S."" about the same gangs who smuggle migrants setting up power centers in America.With a report like that, it's pretty obvious that new border surges will be even bigger than recent ones. The media will focus on individual stories of the migrants, but that conceals the larger and uglier reality: the empowerment of non-state criminal actors who are as much a threat to the state as any conventional enemy.

It will keep every meeting in play.""TD expects the Fed will raise rates in March.Benchmark Treasury 10-year notes gained for a second day, as the yield fell one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 2.18% as of 5 p.m. New York time, based on Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The 2% security due in August 2025 rose 1/32, or 31 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 98-3/8.""Any September hike is going to be interpreted as hawkish,"" said Shyam Rajan, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America in New York, one of the 22 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.

""Although the growth data have been quite good and the labor market has improved further, both wage and price inflation have fallen short of expectations.""

316,EL,"RIPPED FROM THE PAGES OF IBD: February 25, 2014Justice: Mexico has bagged crime cartel boss Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in a major takedown. Problem is, Mexico has no death penalty, and its lax prisons are a joke. So why not try El Chapo in the U.S.?For Mexico, the capture of Guzman, kingpin of kingpins who ran Mexico's biggest and most powerful drug cartel, was the equivalent of the U.S. takedown of Osama bin Laden.His diabolical war over the past decade has left tens of thousands dead as he amassed a $3 billion fortune. At the least, the arrest deals a blow as strong as Colombia's nabbing of Medellin Cartel drug lord Pablo Escobar in 1993 or FARC narcoterrorist Raul Reyes in 2008.But there's a problem: Escobar and Reyes were more or less executed. Guzman is alive. If found guilty of his heinous crimes, he'd deserve execution too, if for no other reason than to protect Mexico from more killing.Yet he can't be put to death under Mexican law — even though Guzman stands charged with conducting a crime war that has left 86,000 Mexicans dead, bribing elements of the Mexican and U.S. governments, intimidating and murdering journalists, and terrorizing and robbing Mexico's struggling oil industry.His criminal activities don't stop at the border.El Chapo's smugglers allegedly have shipped millions of illegal immigrants into the U.S.His American mayhem allegedly stretches to beheadings in Arizona, shootings in Chicago, killings in El Paso, Texas, money laundering in Los Angeles, illegal immigrants dying of thirst in the Arizona desert, and a cut of no less than 25% of all imported drugs trafficked through the U.S.So long as he remains alive, he remains a threat to Mexico — and to us — by the fact that he can continue to run his crime cartel out of Mexican prison through bribes and intimidation of officials there.Mexican prisons are not like U.S. prisons, where the guards control the prisoners. No, they are nearly cities unto themselves, with open lines of communication to the outside as well as considerable inside control by the inmates.To see Guzman in prison only opens the door for Mexico to endure more of his same nightmarish drug war.We understand Mexico's intense desire to deal with El Chapo through its own system, given his crimes and the country's suffering. But Guzman represents a global security threat — not just to Mexico, but also to the U.S., Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Peru, Canada, Spain and other countries splattered by his bloody fingerprints.Courts in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Texas have sought to extradite him, with strong cases that can shut him away forever in a far-more-secure U.S. supermax prison. Drug lords dread these prisons more than death itself.Escobar waged a full-blown war against Colombia, bombing airliners out of the sky and targeting children of that South American country's political elites in 1990 in an attempt to stop extradition. He basically chose death over a U.S. prison cell.One of his top lieutenants, Carlos Lehder, remains in a supermax alongside al-Qaida terrorists, serial killers and traitors. If found guilty, Guzman belongs there too.The U.S. should press for his extradition to protect the entire hemisphere from a monster.

331,EL,"Of course, it's perfectly ridiculous to even contemplate Donald Trump as the eventual presidential nominee of the party of Abraham Lincoln.But let's just say that Trump's reality TV insanity infected enough delegates in Cleveland next July. And he became the 2016 GOP nominee. How would Trump do with Hispanics, the nation's fastest-growing group of voters?True, less than half of Hispanics vote vs about two-thirds of non-Hispanic whites and blacks.And at 53 million, the U.S. Hispanic population remains a minority compared to the 260 million non-Hispanics. Pero between 2000 and 2012, the Hispanic population grew 49%. Los otros 5.8%. Do the math, amigo, and those predominantly young voters present a golden opportunity for any political party. Much as Republicans enjoyed black support for generations post-Civil War.Republicans have not fared as poorly with Hispanics as generally believed. George W. Bush captured 40% of Latinos in his 2004 win, almost as much as he did as Texas governor. Mitt Romney's Hispanic votes slipped to 27% in 2012.Now, what about El Trumpo? Well, not so well. A new Gallup Poll finds that most Hispanics have yet to form an opinion about any of the Republican candidates, except for two -- Jeb Bush, who speaks Spanish, and Donald Trump, who speaks New York.Fourteen percent of the nearly 700 Hispanics polled so far view Trump favorably; 65% unfavorably. That's a net -51, by far the worst of any Republican.Jeb Bush, whose wife is Mexican-born, is favored 34% to 23% unfavorable among Hispanics for a net plus of 11, best of any GOP candidate. Another Spanish-speaker, Marco Rubio (+5) and Carly Fiorina (+3) are next best.It's a complete mystery why Trump would be seen so negatively. Unless it's somehow related to his blanket charges that a border wall is necessary to stop Mexico from exporting criminals, that all undocumented immigrants should be deported and their children born in the United States should not be American citizens.If estimates of 11 million illegal immigrants are correct, that means Trump is painting more than 40 million legal Hispanic residents with his broad stereotyping brush. That might work with some of the angry GOP base in primary season, but it's not exactly a formula for political success later.Trump's support among Republicans so far remains the largest of the field, but is stuck around 25-26%. Even Mike Huckabee did better than that when he won the 2008 Iowa caucus with 34%.So, how might Trump fare in a general election? In 1940, Republicans nominated another former Democrat, Wendell Willkie. A successful businessman and lawyer, Willkie was an early political supporter of and donor to Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932.He later split with FDR over the far-reaching government of his New Deal and its ineffectiveness in ending the Depression. Willkie also warned the U.S. must strengthen its national defenses for possible war.Roosevelt vowed during that 1940 campaign that if Americans liked their peacetime, they could keep their peacetime. Voters bought that Democrat promise too.On Nov. 5, businessman Willkie won only 10 states, mostly Midwestern, with 82 electoral votes of the 266 needed to win then. Roosevelt cruised to an historic third term with 38 states and 449 electoral votes. Thirteen months later Pearl Harbor revealed how unprepared the United States really was militarily.RELATED:History predicts the 2016 GOP ticketWhy does Obama want to keep PLO money from US terror victims?Despite her poll surge, CNN rules may keep Carly off main debate stageFrance gives American heroes its highest honor; Obama gives them a phone call

344,EL,"It hasn't gotten much attention, given the terrorism in San Bernardino, but darling-of-the-left Lori Berenson was allowed to leave Peru, after serving a 20-year prison sentence of 15 years behind bars and five years' parole for ""collaborating with terrorism"" in the 1990s.
"
345,EL,"Her foolish statements and the media's coddling of her put her on a parallel with what must be one of her heroes, Bill Ayers, who smugly defended his terrorist bombings in an interview with the New York Times that ran on 9/11.
"
346,EL,"See, way back in 1992, a starry-eyed young leftist MIT student, decided to quit school to get a job as a secretary for El Salvador's Cuba-sponsored communist guerrillas, who were at the time terrorizing the Salvadoran countryside with murder and mayhem. The Castro-sponsored terror campaign provoked a tremendous pushback that ended up as a civil war. She was a romantic ""Sandalista"" with a taste for violence and when that job got boring, she moved on to new leftist guerrillas, Peru's Tupac Amaru Liberation Movement, which engaged in its own campaign of murder, kidnappings and terror, in the name of imposing communism on an unwilling population. They murdered a Peruvian general but otherwise tended to kill poor foot soldiers, policemen and Indian peasants. When Berenson was caught, she was running an ammo dump that she still claims she knew nothing about and was using phony press credentials to help her guerrilla-fighter buddies scope out the country's legislature in order to take its members hostage.
"
347,EL,"Found guilty, she was sentenced to 20 years and went out in a hail of fist-waving sloganeering, which supposedly added years to her term. Tupac Amaru's brightest moment of fame came was when it took over the Japanese Embassy in 1997 and held nearly a hundred hostages for four months with the demand that Berenson and others be freed. Peru's counterterror cops managed to tunnel under a part of the compound where the terrorists were playing an impromptu soccer game, and blew them all up and shot some of the survivors. It was a horrific ordeal, and in Peru's Museum of Memory, there is a huge photo display and videos documenting the terror of the hostages in the atrocity.
"
348,EL,"But despite her willingness to use press credentials to enable acts of terrorism — something that endangers every journalist out there — Berenson has gotten fawning coverage from the mainstream media, which has written about how Berenson has mellowed in prison, had a child with a guerrilla fighter, worked as a prison baker, and only cared about ""social justice."" Never mind the blood on the streets of Lima in the background, here was one of the media's cossetted own, the daughter of East Coast university professors, their sort of people.
"
349,EL,"After 20 years, has she changed a bit? Not based on her media statements.

350,EL,"She still refuses to admit that the group she was with was terrorist at all.

That's fine and dandy, until you realize that 70,000 people died in that war — bringing Tupac Amaru's part of the grisly tally to 1,050 people. Terrorism? She conceded terrorist tactics but said: ""I don't think the label fits.""
"
351,EL,"But if you ask that of a Peruvian, you get a different answer. And it's little wonder that Peruvians still can't stand her. Does Berenson feel a twinge of regret? Not in the least.

She blamed the country's ruling elites for the local sentiment — when the reality is that Peru's guerrilla sympathizers have always been Peru's children of the elite, who attend left-wing universities, as the Museum of Memory shows in its photos.
"
352,EL,"The Museum also shows that the victims of terror were virtually all Indians and poor people — black and mixed-race people in shantytowns, people displaced from the countryside, people burned out of their homes and running from bombs with pitiful sacks of belongings while hanging onto their kids.

"
354,EL,"At the museum, there were people crying at various memorials — and when I spoke with an Indian bead seller in a Lima park about the war (he was part of the Ashaninka people, and wore its native dress), he began to weep.

390,EL,"Chicken-and-biscuits chain Bojangles flew past second-quarter forecasts late Thursday and ramped up plans to open more restaurants. The Southern-inspired eatery, which went public on May 8, also fattened up its 2015 outlook even as its company-owned same-store sales missed views.
"
391,EL,"Bojangles (BOJA) now sees 2015 revenue coming in at $483.5 million-$487.5 million, vs. a prior outlook for $480 million-$487 million. The midpoint of the company's new guidance exceeds current Street expectations for $484.5 million.It sees 2015 adjusted earnings of 75-78 cents a share, far above analyst views for 69 cents, and ""low to mid-single digit"" systemwide comp growth.The company also plans to open more restaurants this year than it had previously stated, guiding for 59-63 openings, up from a prior outlook for 50-57.Shares rallied 3.5% after hours.For Q2, Bojangles' adjusted earnings leapt 44% to 23 cents per share, soundly topping forecasts for 16 cents. Driven by same-store sales gains and new restaurant openings, revenue climbed 13.1% to $120.5 million, squeaking past views for $120.3 million.Systemwide same-restaurant sales grew 4.4%, with franchise location comps up 5.1%. Company-owned comps increased 3.3%, ""modestly below"" Street views for 4%, noted Stephens analyst Will Slabaugh.In its first report as a public company, Wingstop (WING) said that its total revenue grew 18% to $19.2 million, pulling ahead of consensus views for $18.4 million. Adjusted earnings rose 10% to 11 cents per share, while net income tumbled 80% to 2 cents a share, according to the company. Analysts had expected EPS of 9 cents.Systemwide domestic same-restaurant sales surged 9%.Wingstop guided 2015 revenue to $75.5 million-$76 million, above consensus views for $74.6 million, and full-year U.S. comp growth to 6.5%-7%.The restaurant chain, which went public on June 12 at an initial price of 19, hit a high of 35.96 Monday.

392,EL,"The oil and gas refining industry group has been climbing the ranks this year and is now at No. 51, up from 144 six months ago. Three stocks in the group earn 90 or better Composite Ratings, with four more above 85.
"
393,EL,"In this group, Valero Energy (VLO), Tesoro (TSO), HollyFrontier (HFC), Alon USA Energy (ALJ) and Northern Tier Energy (NTI) hit 52-week highs Thursday, although many reversed lower by the close.Investors by and large gave top refiners a thumbs up for second-quarter earnings results. According to a Barclays research note on Aug. 7, U.S. and global refining margins continued to march higher in Q2, significantly topping market expectations and building on an already impressive first quarter.Also noteworthy in the U.S. market, reported July margins were higher than even May, which is typically the strongest month.Valero Energy is the group leader by Composite Rating and the second-largest by market cap at $35 billion. The stock is extended, though, up 8% from a 64.59 flat-base breakout on July 1.Sales for the refining giant have dropped sharply over the past four quarters, but that hasn't stopped big gains in earnings per share. Lower oil prices have hit Valero's revenue hard, but helped margins expand.Tesoro fell hard Thursday despite a positive open, but is still extended from a flat-base breakout at 94.93 on July 10. The stock is up about 40% year to date and enjoys growing mutual fund sponsorship, including a position by the well-regarded Fidelity Contrafund .On Aug. 6, HollyFrontier topped a 51.41 buy point from a deep consolidation. The pattern had an awkward shape and ran 41% deep, which is a flaw. Aggressive investors may also have spotted an earlier handle entry at 43.81.The handle passes the midpoint test, which means it formed in the upper half of the overall pattern. To test, compare the mathematical midpoint of the base to the midpoint of the handle. The midpoint of the handle should be higher.Western Refining (WNR) is approaching a 51.41 buy point in a new cup pattern.Second-quarter earnings for the El Paso, Texas-based refiner rose 12%, down sharply from a triple-digit gain in the prior period. For the full year, analysts see per-share earnings climbing just 2%.Alon USA Energy reached as high as 35% past a 17.25 cup-with-handle buy point Thursday before reversing.Buyers from the latest breakout should consider taking profits on part or all of their position. Analysts see full-year profit climbing 144% for the Dallas-based refiner, but forecast a 31% slide in 2016.Northern Tier Energy, meanwhile, is a downstream energy limited partnership that debuted in July 2012. The stock has followed through sharply since breaking out past a 25.40 handle buy point on Aug. 10 in heavy volume.

We have the cast of “Game of Thrones.” I just went to say hi to them in the Green Room and they’re all dead.Meyers: The French language Scrabble championship was won this week by a New Zealand man who does not speak French. Of course, in French scrabble, you win by flipping over the board and going outside for a cigarette.Meyers: The U.S. won the International Math Olympiad. So if you don’t think Americans can compete with Asia in math, maybe you should talk to some of the members of the American team, like Shyam Narayanan, Yang Liu and Allen Liu and their coach Po-Shen Loh.Meyers: A student at the University of Alabama was arrested for having 10,000 Xanax pills stashed in his home. Not surprisingly, he’s taking the arrest really, really well.Fallon: Some tech news. Google is adding a new feature that will allow customers to shop directly through its most popular search results.

Apparently, authorities didn’t notice El Chapo was lacing up a pair of “Nike Tunnel Runners.”Meyers: July 15th was a rare day when no professional sporting events took place in the U.S. Causing millions of fathers everywhere to ask their daughters, “Why can’t your dance recital be today?”Conan: The Trump International Golf Course in Puerto Rico has filed for bankruptcy. This may be because of Trump’s rule, “No Puerto Ricans on my Puerto Rican golf course.”Conan: The Obama Administration announced a deal with Iran that will prevent the Iranians from making a nuclear weapon.

397,EL,"Natural gas futures rose for a second day as meteorologists predicted blistering heat that would spur demand from power plants. Temperatures may be above normal in the Northeast, Great Lakes region and South through Aug. 1, MDA Weather Services said. New York's high is forecast to reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday, 11 more than average, data from AccuWeather show.…
"
398,EL,"Confusion: While leaders meet in the Vatican for a climate conference, talk of record high global temperatures will fuel hysteria. But there's truly nothing to see here.Voices of the unreasonable screeched Tuesday across St. Peter's Square.California Gov. Jerry Brown was the most colorful. He took the opportunity to call anyone who doesn't believe in man-made global warming as he does a ""denier,"" which is also the pejorative used to describe those who say the Holocaust never happened. He also called those who don't conform to his way of thinking ""troglodytes.""New York Mayor Bill de Blasio joined the choir, suggesting that anyone who held a different view than his is insane, while the mayor of Kochi, India, said climate change is to blame for modern-day slavery.As the faithful held their revival, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration released a report that said that the global temperature for the first half of the year hit a record high.Apparently, NOAA is sure that land and sea surface temperatures through the end of June soared an entire 1.53 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average. That's the highest since record-keeping began in 1880, surpassing the previous high set in 2010, a year to remember.Time to panic? No. Chip Knappenberger at the Cato Institute says the NOAA temperatures remain produced by the global warming models.In contrast to the NOAA report is the work of Roy Spencer at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. He publishes a monthly global temperature report and his most recent — for June 2015 — shows that the global climate trend since Nov. 16, 1978, is a mere increase of 0.11 degrees Celsius per decade.Now, back to that year to remember.John Christy, Spencer's colleague at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, posted on July 1 that ""with the tropical atmosphere responding to the El Nino Pacific Ocean warming event during the past few months, temperatures in the tropics rose to their second warmest anomaly for any month since the El Nino of 2010.""And what was the Los Angeles Times' top headline on its front page Tuesday, the day after NOAA published its findings for the first half of 2015?""Hola, El Nino.""Just a coincidence? Spencer noted earlier in July a ""strong warming in the tropics over the last two months, consistent with the strengthening El Nino in the Pacific.""Further undermining the NOAA record is scientist and statistician William M. Briggs, who tells us ""these are not temperatures, but temperature reconstructions."" Satellite data, which Spencer uses, ""is to be preferred.""We could also bring up the relative irrelevance of the temperature ""record"" when none of the disasters predicted by those who have promoted the concept of man-made warming has occurred.We might wonder out loud, as well, if maybe some other variable out of the many in our climate is behind the NOAA increase, if it were indeed accurate.Quite clearly climate changes throughout Earth's history have been brought about by natural causes. If the temperature is rising, there's no reason to believe it's not natural.Well, there is for those gathered at the Vatican. They need a man-made disaster to give them the cover they need to enact their man-subjugating policies.

399,EL,"Let October 2015 go down in the annals of time as one of the best performing Octobers in history -  as the indexes proved resilient.  The S&P surged 8.3%, the DOW was up 9.6% and the Nasdaq Composite rallied 9.4%.  But - despite the strong October, stocks showed a lack of direction last week - churning, waiting, and churning.....and on Friday they eventually came under pressure as we moved into the close and many portfolio managers did some window  'undressing'.
"
400,EL,"The major indexes accelerated to the downside as we moved into the 4 O'clock hour - closing at their worst levels of the day. The Dow slid 92 points (-0.5%), Nasdaq fell 21 points (-0.4%)and the S&P dropped 10 points (-0.5%). The choppy trading seen last week continues to reflect trader/investor confusion about the near-term outlook for the mkt, the outlook for the FED, the outlook for the broader global economy - following one of the strongest October’s in history.
"
401,EL,"Does all of this great action suggest the worse is behind us?  That the August 'panic' is over?   In the bigger picture  you must consider that October was NOT a game changer.....I mean look - October was nothing more than a reasonable back test of broken support.
"
402,EL,"A quick look at the S&P over the last 4 yrs reveals a very clear, well formed ascending, narrowing triangle...otherwise known as a 'bearish wedge'  -  Now in August the support (2020) was broken -  and typically that means that a new correction cycle begins.  We saw prices break down quickly taking the mkt to 1875 ish.....only to rally and back test that broken support level - successfully piercing it as the mkt struggled to hold on.
"
403,EL,"Now there is clearly some central bank influencing going on  but from a purely technical picture,  my sense is that we have not seen the end of the coming correction just yet. True bear markets take time to play out - investors will test and re-test support and then back test broken support as they re-price this asset class based on either improving or worsening global macro data. Many will tell us that the August 'correction' was enough to clear the decks, but do not allow yourself to be lulled into a state of complacency......perpetual liquidity from nearly every central bank can and will support bull mkts  for an extended time...... - so now we must ask - how do we define that time period?  Has the FED, the ECB, the BoJ and the PBoC just pushed that out another 4 or 5 months?  Or will the FED surprise us and raise rates in December and cause more mkt turmoil in the final weeks of the year?   Are investors tiring of all the FED speak?  Do these clowns cause more angst and anxiety because they are so divided sending all kinds of mixed messages to the mkts - in fact causing the very turmoil that they profess to avoid?
"
404,EL,"Today begins a new month and new set of data points.....traders/investors will once again become obsessed with Friday's NFP report (Non Farm Payroll).   My sense is that they will discount the 'noise' (FED speeches)  and try to make sense of the data.  All of a sudden the bar has been LOWERED.....it seems that as long as the jobs data is at least +150k then the FED has permission to move on rates.....  Funny how that works isn't it?  The FED had been looking for more than 225K jobs consistently before they moved on rates...and now they are saying - OK....+150K is good enough... I'm just sayin.... Just for the record - the mkts are expecting the NFP report to show +180k jobs on Friday....This after we got just +142k jobs in September.....
"
405,EL,"Mark Zandi - Chief Economist at Moody's Analytics says it clearly..... ""Look, if those employment numbers are reasonably solid, that's a green light to raise rates.    As long as we get the next couple of jobs numbers, over 150,000, that will be enough to get them to move in December. That was a pretty clear message in the statement"".
"
406,EL,"Remember too - that this month the FED deleted any reference to the weakness in China.....which many analysts suggest is their way of 'tipping us off' that the game has changed....that they are now laser focused on US macro data.......in the last week alone - the odds of a FED increase have moved up from 30%  to 50% and this is exactly why the mkt is now churning.....as the uncertainty once again permeates investor psyche.
"
407,EL,"The whole song and dance about being data dependent is understandable, but then stop changing the tempo of that 'song and dance' with all the noise from the differing FED speakers.    In the end - the noise just caps the upside and causes the mkts to once again become cautious over the indecision.....and as long as the mkts think the FED is unclear then the path of least resistance will be lower.  What the mkt wants is for the FED to be decisive - and then the mkt will take care of the rest....asset prices will either succumb to selling pressure or they won't but the uncertainty is not helping.
"
408,EL,"And this morning US futures have been all over the place...in early morning pre-mkt trading they were down 10+ pts on the back of the weak China factory data...that came in at 48.3 - still in contraction territory - causing Asian mkts to come unglued....Japan - 2.1%, Hong Kong - 1.19%, China - 1.7% and ASX -1.4%....
"
409,EL,"But this morning in Europe - the world found out that Euro area manufacturing surprised us to the upside.........coming in at 52.3 vs. 52 in September...this report runs completely counter to the China data  - but does suggest that things in Europe may be moving ahead.  Strength coming from Germany  and Italy having a very positive impact on investors.....FTSE flat, CAC 40 +0.51%, DAX + 0.95%, EUROSTOXX + 0.54%, SPAIN +0.44% and ITALY +0.47%.
"
410,EL," And it was this good news that sent US futures higher - now +1.4 pts - an 11 pt swing from earlier this morning.  Again - I would look for 2100 to represent resistance as investors/traders/analysts watch for the clues that signal decisiveness. Eco data today includes Markit US Manf PMI - exp of 54 and ISM Manf of 50.  Earnings are due from AIG  (AIG), ALLSTATE (ALL), ESTEE LAUDER  (EL), FITBIT (FIT) as well as a half dozen others...but for the most part the real mkt movers have already reported and as I said 3 weeks ago - we got 76% of reports to BEAT the number.....

414,EL,"Saudi Arabia vowed Thursday to stabilize the oil market with both members and non-members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, just a week after saying it would keep production high and maintain its global market share.
"
415,EL,"""Saudi Arabia is a very reliable supplier. We cooperate with OPEC and non-OPEC countries to stabilize the market,"" said Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi at a conference in Manama, Bahrain, according to Bloomberg. ""We need billions of dollars to continue exploration and producing oil and to invest in spare capacity to stabilize the market.""
"
416,EL,"The seemingly softer stance comes after Khalid al-Falih, chairman of Saudi Aramco, told the Financial Times that the only thing to do was stand back and let the market do its job, and that there haven't been any discussions about production cuts.
"
417,EL,"The comments come less than a month before OPEC holds its next meeting, where the cartel's leaders will be closely watched for any signs of a change in their strategy of keeping oil prices low to force out higher-cost producers in the U.S., Russia and elsewhere.

474,EL,"Conrad Hilton was born to be a hotelier. He had the necessary attributes: a knack for innovation, an exacting attention to detail, impeccable timing and unfailing optimism.
"
475,EL,"He rode all those traits to launch a hotel chain that now, as Hilton Worldwide (HLT), boasts 4,500 properties in 97 countries and territories, with 2014 sales of $11 billion.
"
476,EL,"Yet it took Hilton a while to realize his calling. Long before he became a global business pioneer and hotel magnate, Connie, as he was known to those close to him, pursued several disparate careers.
"
477,EL,"After serving two years in the Army during World War I, Hilton won a seat in the lower house of the first New Mexico legislature, right after the state was formed. But he quickly grew tired of politics and quit to pursue other ventures.
"
478,EL,"He opened a bank that failed to attract customers and for a while dreamed of striking it rich in the oil industry. He even spent some time managing a musical group formed by his violinist sister.
"
479,EL,"None of those worked out, and by his early 30s Hilton was out of fresh ideas.
"
480,EL,"Looking Up
"
481,EL,"He tried to launch another bank, but when the deal fell through he made the call of his life.
"
482,EL,"He bought a hotel.
"
483,EL,"That decision put Hilton on the path to reaching the 20th century's pantheon of top business winners.
"
484,EL,"Hilton (1887-1979) was born to Norwegian immigrants in San Antonio, in that era's New Mexico territory, on Christmas Day. Connie and his seven siblings learned the art of entrepreneurialism by working in their father's general store.
"
485,EL,"As a youngster, Hilton read the autobiography of Helen Keller, the blind and deaf author and activist.
"
486,EL,"""Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement; nothing can be done without hope,"" Keller wrote.
"
487,EL,"Her faith-based enthusiasm resonated with Connie and would guide his work for decades.
"
488,EL,"Hilton's own buoyancy helped him see every setback as an opportunity. When his father lost a small fortune in the financial panic of 1907, Conrad suggested that the family open a small hotel, with every family member helping out. The hotel thrived.
"
489,EL,"It was a decade later that Conrad bought that first big hotel, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas. The establishment boomed from the start, allowing Hilton to acquire more hotels throughout Texas in the 1920s.
"
490,EL,"Soon he began construction on the first hotel that would bear his name: the Dallas Hilton.
"
491,EL,"But then the Great Depression struck. Hilton nearly went bankrupt, losing all but one of his hotels, the El Paso Hilton.
"
492,EL,"Though in debt for half a million dollars (worth $8 million today), Hilton persevered, cut costs where he could, stayed on as a manager of a combined hotel chain and regained control of eight hotels that he had owned.
"
493,EL,"How did Hilton endure in the 1930s when 80% of the country's hotels went bankrupt? Partly due to that optimism.
"
494,EL,"""He was the kind of man who always believed no bad situation to be permanent,"" his eldest son, Barron, told Randy Taraborrelli for his book ""The Hiltons: The True Story of an American Dynasty.""
"
495,EL,"Hilton emerged from the Depression in relatively good shape, in part because his creditors and investors knew they could count on him. That trust let him expand greatly over the next few decades — first to California, then to Illinois, New York and eventually across the globe.
"
496,EL,"Hilton went on to buy some of the largest and most prestigious hotels in the world, including Chicago's Stevens Hotel in 1945 and New York City's Waldorf Astoria in 1949.
"
497,EL,"Hilton regarded the latter purchase as so significant that, according to Taraborrelli, he said for the rest of his life that everything he did would be measured as having happened ""before the Waldorf"" or ""after the Waldorf.""
"
498,EL,"In 1946, Conrad formed Hilton Hotels Corp.
"
499,EL,"Around The World
"
500,EL,"Three years later came Hilton International Co. In all, Hilton would own 188 hotels in 38 American cities — plus 54 hotels abroad.
"
501,EL,"His hallmark was the lavish hotel opening, spending huge amounts of money and inviting celebrities to make sure it was a cultural event.
"
502,EL,"Wherever Hilton opened a hotel, it became a great boon to the local economy. As one Hilton friend told Life magazine in 1963, ""Next only to the Peace Corps, Connie Hilton's hotels around the world have done more for the U.S. than any other thing. And the State Department ought to be the first to say so.""
"
503,EL,"By 1963, Hilton Hotels Corp. had assets of nearly $300 million (about $2 billion today).
"
504,EL,"Aside from enthusiasm, Hilton had top timing.
"
505,EL,"The world economy was booming in the 1950s and '60s, as was air travel, tourism and thus the demand for hotels.
"
506,EL,"And he stayed ahead of the pack by creating a central hotel reservation office and, in 1955, putting air conditioning in every room.
"
507,EL,"He also knew where to build.
"
508,EL,"Robert Rauch, president of RAR Hospitality, a leading consulting firm, told IBD that Hilton's ""business model was location, location and location. He found timeless locations (such as the Waldorf, Chicago's Stevens and Palmer House, and the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.) and financed them conservatively so that he would not have to flip hotels before an economic downturn.""
"
509,EL,"Nice Atmosphere
"
510,EL,"Meanwhile, Hilton held his hotels to the highest of standards.
"
511,EL,"He ""wanted quality, he wanted guest service, he wanted a degree of class,"" said Peter Tomaras, a hospitality industry expert. ""I think Hilton knew that, above all, the hotel business is a people business — both guests and staff need to be seen in terms of their individual needs.""
"
512,EL,"In 2012, Hilton Worldwide was rated by CareerBliss.com as the happiest place to work in the country.
"
513,EL,"Conrad married three times. He had three sons with his first wife, Mary. He later married actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, with whom he had a daughter, then settled on a final match at age 88.
"
514,EL,"When Hilton died at age 91, much legal wrangling ensued over his fortune. He gave most of it to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which donates to big projects focusing on humanitarian relief and the Catholic Church, with the goal of alleviating human suffering. The foundation was worth some $2 billion at the time of his death.
"
515,EL,"Hilton's motto in business also applied to his philanthropy: ""Be Big: Think Big. Act Big. Dream Big.""
"
516,EL,"It continues to inspire today.
"
517,EL,"""It's a motto that inspires us daily in our work to improve the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people throughout the world,"" said Marc Moorghen, the foundation's communications director.
"
518,EL,"In 2007, Hilton Hotels Corp. was acquired by the private-equity firm Blackstone Group for about $20 billion. Blackstone appointed a new CEO, moved its headquarters from Beverly Hills, Calif., to northern Virginia and changed its name to Hilton Worldwide.
"
519,EL,"Tomaras lauds Conrad Hilton for building the nation's strongest and most revered hotel company: ""I believe Hilton is acknowledged as the godfather of the high-rise, high-end, urban-center hotel business.""
"
520,EL,"Rauch agrees, saying Hilton was one of ""the two true hoteliers (the other being J.W. Marriott) of the 20th century. He was a visionary.""Conrad Hilton was born to be a hotelier.

He even spent some time managing a musical group formed by his violinist sister.None of those worked out, and by his early 30s Hilton was out of fresh ideas.Looking UpHe tried to launch another bank, but when the deal fell through he made the call of his life.He bought a hotel.That decision put Hilton on the path to reaching the 20th century's pantheon of top business winners.Hilton (1887-1979) was born to Norwegian immigrants in San Antonio, in that era's New Mexico territory, on Christmas Day. Connie and his seven siblings learned the art of entrepreneurialism by working in their father's general store.As a youngster, Hilton read the autobiography of Helen Keller, the blind and deaf author and activist.""Optimism is the faith that leads to achievement; nothing can be done without hope,"" Keller wrote.Her faith-based enthusiasm resonated with Connie and would guide his work for decades.Hilton's own buoyancy helped him see every setback as an opportunity. When his father lost a small fortune in the financial panic of 1907, Conrad suggested that the family open a small hotel, with every family member helping out. The hotel thrived.It was a decade later that Conrad bought that first big hotel, the 40-room Mobley Hotel in Cisco, Texas. The establishment boomed from the start, allowing Hilton to acquire more hotels throughout Texas in the 1920s.Soon he began construction on the first hotel that would bear his name: the Dallas Hilton.But then the Great Depression struck. Hilton nearly went bankrupt, losing all but one of his hotels, the El Paso Hilton.Though in debt for half a million dollars (worth $8 million today), Hilton persevered, cut costs where he could, stayed on as a manager of a combined hotel chain and regained control of eight hotels that he had owned.How did Hilton endure in the 1930s when 80% of the country's hotels went bankrupt? Partly due to that optimism.""He was the kind of man who always believed no bad situation to be permanent,"" his eldest son, Barron, told Randy Taraborrelli for his book ""The Hiltons: The True Story of an American Dynasty.""Hilton emerged from the Depression in relatively good shape, in part because his creditors and investors knew they could count on him. That trust let him expand greatly over the next few decades — first to California, then to Illinois, New York and eventually across the globe.Hilton went on to buy some of the largest and most prestigious hotels in the world, including Chicago's Stevens Hotel in 1945 and New York City's Waldorf Astoria in 1949.Hilton regarded the latter purchase as so significant that, according to Taraborrelli, he said for the rest of his life that everything he did would be measured as having happened ""before the Waldorf"" or ""after the Waldorf.""In 1946, Conrad formed Hilton Hotels Corp.Around The WorldThree years later came Hilton International Co. In all, Hilton would own 188 hotels in 38 American cities — plus 54 hotels abroad.His hallmark was the lavish hotel opening, spending huge amounts of money and inviting celebrities to make sure it was a cultural event.Wherever Hilton opened a hotel, it became a great boon to the local economy. As one Hilton friend told Life magazine in 1963, ""Next only to the Peace Corps, Connie Hilton's hotels around the world have done more for the U.S. than any other thing. And the State Department ought to be the first to say so.""By 1963, Hilton Hotels Corp. had assets of nearly $300 million (about $2 billion today).Aside from enthusiasm, Hilton had top timing.The world economy was booming in the 1950s and '60s, as was air travel, tourism and thus the demand for hotels.And he stayed ahead of the pack by creating a central hotel reservation office and, in 1955, putting air conditioning in every room.He also knew where to build.Robert Rauch, president of RAR Hospitality, a leading consulting firm, told IBD that Hilton's ""business model was location, location and location. He found timeless locations (such as the Waldorf, Chicago's Stevens and Palmer House, and the Mayflower Hotel in Washington, D.C.) and financed them conservatively so that he would not have to flip hotels before an economic downturn.""Nice AtmosphereMeanwhile, Hilton held his hotels to the highest of standards.He ""wanted quality, he wanted guest service, he wanted a degree of class,"" said Peter Tomaras, a hospitality industry expert. ""I think Hilton knew that, above all, the hotel business is a people business — both guests and staff need to be seen in terms of their individual needs.""In 2012, Hilton Worldwide was rated by CareerBliss.com as the happiest place to work in the country.Conrad married three times. He had three sons with his first wife, Mary. He later married actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, with whom he had a daughter, then settled on a final match at age 88.When Hilton died at age 91, much legal wrangling ensued over his fortune. He gave most of it to the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, which donates to big projects focusing on humanitarian relief and the Catholic Church, with the goal of alleviating human suffering. The foundation was worth some $2 billion at the time of his death.Hilton's motto in business also applied to his philanthropy: ""Be Big: Think Big. Act Big. Dream Big.""It continues to inspire today.""It's a motto that inspires us daily in our work to improve the lives of vulnerable and disadvantaged people throughout the world,"" said Marc Moorghen, the foundation's communications director.In 2007, Hilton Hotels Corp. was acquired by the private-equity firm Blackstone Group for about $20 billion. Blackstone appointed a new CEO, moved its headquarters from Beverly Hills, Calif., to northern Virginia and changed its name to Hilton Worldwide.Tomaras lauds Conrad Hilton for building the nation's strongest and most revered hotel company: ""I believe Hilton is acknowledged as the godfather of the high-rise, high-end, urban-center hotel business.""Rauch agrees, saying Hilton was one of ""the two true hoteliers (the other being J.W. Marriott) of the 20th century. He was a visionary.""

521,EL,"Border: Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, pointed to a 2006 law requiring 700 miles of double-layer border fencing. Unfortunately, in 2007 another Texas Republican helped the Democrat Congress change that.Presidential candidate Ted Cruz told Fox's Sean Hannity, ""Existing federal law is quite robust"" on border security, and ""There should be 700 miles of double-layer fencing built along our southern border.""He added: ""The Obama administration has about 30 miles built. If I am elected president, we will build it. What is missing is the presidential will to get it done.""Americans like to think that when their elected representatives pass a law, it's a law. If only.It's true that in 2006, the Republican-controlled House and a large bipartisan majority in the Senate passed, and President Bush signed, the Secure Fence Act, requiring 700 additional miles of double chain-link and barbed-wire fences with lights and camera poles.But in 2007, the Homeland Security Department complained of being, er, fenced in, arguing that different types of terrain required different barriers.So Cruz's predecessor, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, authored an amendment that DHS would not be required ""to install fencing . .. if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.""The Democrat-controlled Congress passed it.In 2011, addressing supporters in El Paso, President Obama jeered that Republicans ""wanted a fence. Well, the fence is now basically complete."" Audience members, as the official WhiteHouse.gov transcript shows, shouted ""Tear it down!"" and ""They're racist!""""Maybe they'll need a moat,"" the president added. ""Maybe they want alligators in the moat. They'll never be satisfied.""What the president did in that speech was, put simply, to lie — claiming to have built the ""fence"" that Republicans enacted into law, without noting that he and his fellow Democrats in Congress changed it to require much less effective fencing.Most of the fencing that Obama claims ""is now basically complete"" consists of vehicle barriers that people can easily hop over, or single-layer fences.Cruz is absolutely right that what's missing is presidential will. Under the amended law, the next chief executive could make 700 miles of double-layer fencing a priority — and tell DHS to shut up and build it.

522,EL,"Frederick ""Fritz"" Payne, a retired Marine brigadier general, died this past August at age 104. He was the oldest surviving World War II ace. Aces are fighter pilots who shoot down at least five enemy aircraft. Just 1,462 have earned the title out of over 60,000 who have flown since World War I.Payne had five solo kills and helped down one other Japanese aircraft over Guadalcanal in his F4F Wildcat.""The speed of our planes and the Japanese bombers we called Bettys was about the same, and you'd try to get to a high altitude and then roll down and strafe the entire plane as you came from above,"" Payne said in a videotaped interview in 2010 at the Palm Springs Air Museum in California. ""The Zeros were faster, and if one got behind you, the best evasive action was to cut the throttle and they'd overshoot you.""The almost daily aerial combat, three major land battles and seven large naval clashes from August 1942 to February 1943 cost over 7,000 American lives and 31,000 Japanese, ending the empire's expansion.High Stakes""It could have gone either way, though,"" Michael Myers, author of ""The Pacific War and Contingent Victory: Why Japanese Defeat Was Not Inevitable,"" told IBD. ""The Japanese came very close to taking the vital airfield. They were more successful than the U.S. in surface naval actions at night and an even match in the carrier battles of the Eastern Solomons and Santa Cruz. But the Americans had the edge in the air war.""Payne was born in 1911 in Elmira, N.Y. His father was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and participated in the Spanish-American War's Battle of Manila Bay.Payne entered Annapolis in 1930 but left two years later as the Depression affected his family and he moved with them near San Diego.He became interested in flying while watching planes at Coronado's naval station. He was told that if he earned a degree while serving in the Reserve Officer Training Corps, he could qualify as a pilot, so he completed his studies in 1935 at the University of Arizona in Tucson.From there he entered the Marines' aviation program as a second lieutenant at a base in Pensacola, Fla., flying Boeing F4B biplanes.After training in maneuvers at Quantico, Va., he returned to Coronado, then shipped off to Hawaii.By July 1941, Payne was back in Coronado flying the Brewster Buffalo with Marine Fighting Squadron 221. It was scheduled to ship out to the base on Midway in the Pacific on Dec. 8 when the Japanese hit Pearl Harbor the day before.Payne and his fellow Marines were ordered to reinforce Wake Island but had to turn back when it fell to the Japanese on Dec. 23.Soon, Payne became executive officer of the newly organized VMF-212, in charge of training with Grumman Wildcats in the New Hebrides Islands, 500 miles southeast of Guadalcanal.In September 1942, with Payne now a major, the carrier Wasp brought the squadron within 300 miles of Guadalcanal.The team flew to Henderson Field, and shortly after takeoff, a submarine sank the Wasp.With the Marines at the airfield under constant incoming fire, Payne took to the sky to thwart enemy planes. At 25,000 feet, his guns froze; he returned to base and waited days for them to be fixed.By late in the month, Henderson had 71 aircraft vs. the 117 that the Japanese could fly from their base 600 miles away. Payne's new outfit, VMF-223, took to the air and encountered 25 bombers protected by 30 Zeros.""He picked out a bomber toward the tail of the formation and closed to effective range,"" wrote Max Brand in ""Fighter Squadron at Guadalcanal."" ""He watched it fall apart. ... Suddenly, another came in from the rear, so close they nearly collided, and he barely had time to squeeze the trigger and get in one burst at the second plane.""The sky is like that in war; now empty as a desert, now full of whale-shaped bombers, now alive with fighters as quick and savage as thin-sided barracuda.""Payne prepared for another go at the formation when he realized the rest of the Marine squadron had left. He was given shared credit for the first bomber, which another pilot had also hit, when he got back to the base.Later in the week Payne knocked down his first solo bomber kill. ""They were our priority because they were killing our troops on the ground,"" he said.Soon he came down with malaria with a torrid temperature, and it almost did what the enemy couldn't.At 27,000 feet, he vomited into his oxygen mask and blacked out.When he came to, the plane was at 8,000 feet and falling fast, but he managed to pull out. That was it for a while — he was shipped off to a hospital for a couple of weeks.InvasionThe next month, October 1942, the Japanese bombarded Henderson and landed 15,000 troops, bringing their total to 20,000 vs. 23,000 Allies. ""We would dig foxholes as deep as we could and then try to find a piece of iron to put on top to protect us from shrapnel,"" Payne said. ""We were really scared at night, when their ships would start shelling us.""In the Oct. 18-23 period, Payne was back with the 212. He downed two more bombers and was victorious in dogfights with two Zeros.""Fritz described these as free-for-alls, a type of combat in which numerous planes are zooming about, and he was making evasive moves and turning in an effort to get an enemy in his sites and squeeze off a few shots before losing him,"" said Bob Andrade, an aviation historian and longtime friend. ""Another time he pulled the trigger, but his guns failed. His plane often returned full of holes.""Meanwhile, Payne took over as the 212's commander when Lt. Col. Joe Bauer was killed on Oct. 16, and he served until February 1943.But Payne had to leave Guadalcanal on Oct. 27, 1942, to be treated for malaria, with quinine scarce.The squadron followed him to California, stationed at El Toro Marine Air Base, where Payne was promoted to lieutenant colonel.In early 1943, Payne and three other airmen met Brand to discuss writing a book about their experience. Brand was the pen name of Frederick Faust, the author of popular novels and movie screenplays.He worked on the book until his death while serving as a war correspondent in Italy in May 1944, when the manuscript disappeared.Wedding And FamilyIn 1949 — four years after war's end — Payne was stationed at the Presidio in San Francisco and married Dorothy, a Navy widow, and adopted her two children. They would have one child together.During the Korean War in 1952, Payne took charge of a forward radar control group and flew Corsairs and AD-6s seeking to destroy radar sites. He then was a liaison officer with the 5th Air Force in Seoul.The war ended in 1953, and two years later Payne took command of a helicopter squadron in Tustin, Calif. He finished his career as tactical air commander during atomic testing and retired from active duty as a brigadier general in 1958.In addition to being recognized as an ace, he was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions at Guadalcanal, the second highest honor for valor. He also received the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying Cross and a Silver Star.Payne worked for Southern California Edison for 24 years, managing its aircraft and helicopter field operations before retiring in 1976. He and Dorothy lived in Rancho Mirage until she died in 2011.Before he was killed, Brand had given a copy of his manuscript to a member of the 212, Capt. Mel Freeman, and it eventually reached Payne and Andrade. They contacted Brand's daughter, Jane Faust Easton, who discovered that she had another version, and she and her husband completed the final manuscript. ""Fighter Squadron at Guadalcanal"" was published by the Naval Institute Press in 1996.In the introduction, Payne wrote: ""This is about Americans engaged in a global struggle for survival. ... It is about a future that we enjoy now but which seemed very uncertain.""Said the Palm Springs Air Museum's director, Fred Bell: ""He was an extraordinary guy who was very humble, and we can only hope we can live up to his and others' examples and carry on in their footsteps, remembering what they did.""

525,EL,"Many cities have tried to build themselves into major technology hubs where entrepreneurs build startups that reach the big time. Northern California's Silicon Valley remains the leader, but other areas aspire for second place as a tech center.A rising aspirant is Los Angeles, home to the recently anointed ""Silicon Beach."" Like Silicon Valley, S.B. has no set boundaries, but it centers on coastal town Santa Monica and its neighbor, Venice, and includes Playa Vista and other parts of West L.A. The area is packed with tech startups and some publicly traded companies.""L.A.'s tech ecosystem is really taking off in terms of turning innovation into real companies,"" said Gil Elbaz, CEO of Factual, a data analytics platform for mobile devices that he founded during 2008 in Los Angeles.""The area has always been very innovative, but in the last five years we've seen this magical uptick in terms of everything coming together — the talent, ideas and investors,"" Elbaz said.In 1999, Elbaz co-founded a Santa Monica company that Google (GOOGL) bought in 2003 for $102 million. That company, Applied Semantics, became a key part of Google's multibillion-dollar AdSense advertising platform.That same year, Yahoo (YHOO) bought Pasadena-based ad-tech company Overture for $1.6 billion in its bid to challenge Google.It's a common Los Angeles story that some of its best home-grown technology gets acquired and shipped north to Silicon Valley. But this time might be different.Snapchat Not Snapped UpOne prime example is Venice-based Snapchat, the messaging platform with 100 million active users. Two years ago, Snapchat turned down a $3 billion offer from Silicon Valley's Facebook (FB). Snapchat is growing fast.The L.A. tech area includes El Segundo, home of DirecTV (DTV), and Culver City, which includes Apple's (AAPL) Beats Electronics. Other hotbeds for tech startups include Burbank and Pasadena. But the sun is shining brightest on Silicon Beach.Santa Monica, a city of eight square miles, has 1,827 tech businesses, according to the local Chamber of Commerce. It has another 572 businesses in arts and entertainment, a sector that often feeds into tech. Its largest business employer is video game giant Activision Blizzard (ATVI), with 899 employees in the city. Video game developer Riot Games has 712 employees there. China Internet giant Tencent Holdings (TCEHY) bought a majority stake in Riot Games, which operates the massively popular ""League of Legends"" PC-based game, for $400 million in 2011.Moreover, Google recently plopped down a reported $120 million to acquire 12 acres of vacant land in a large business park in Playa Vista. The acreage is next to Google's 40,000-square-foot YouTube production facility, where local artists can create content for the online video site. Google's main presence in Silicon Beach is in Venice, where it leases the 69,000-square-foot Binoculars Building. Google employs several thousand people in the two workspaces.Other big tech companies with a large presence in Playa Vista include Microsoft (MSFT), Yahoo and Belkin Electronics, a large producer of consumer technology, including the Linksys Wi-Fi system.The Silicon Beach-area tech companies are diverse. Many focus on entertainment and gaming, cloud-based e-commerce, online ad technology and social networking. The area also has a large number of business incubators and accelerators — 11 in Santa Monica alone — to help startups fly.""There will never be another Silicon Valley, but L.A. is creating a thriving ecosystem,"" said William Hsu, co-founder and managing partner of Mucker Capital, which operates business accelerator MuckerLab in Santa Monica. ""It's a lot different now than when I moved to L.A. in 2006.""One difference is that Los Angeles now has a cadre of battle-hardened serial entrepreneurs, people who have built several companies and attracted millions of dollars of venture capital. Some of those companies went bust, but that's part of the learning process. Serial entrepreneurs mentor new talent.Entrepreneurs Mentor TalentAmong the area's entrepreneurs is Scott Painter, CEO of TrueCar (TRUE), the Santa Monica-based provider of an online car buying service. TrueCar raised $70 million with its initial public offering in May 2014.Another is Frank Addante, CEO of Rubicon Project (RUBI), an ad technology company that raised $102 million with its IPO in April 2014. Rubicon is based in Playa Vista.Santa Monica is also home to Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), an online provider of human resource services that made its IPO in 2011. Nearby is Demand Media (DMD), which went public the same year.""L.A. is a great city to build a company,"" Elbaz said. ""It has incredibly talented individuals and a huge, diverse industry base.""It's been a work in progress for many years. Los Angeles and neighboring Orange County in the 1980s were home to pioneering computer, software and data storage leaders. After a dry spell, tech resurged in the late-1990s Internet bubble before it burst in 2000.The difference now is that Los Angeles has the four core ingredients that sparked Silicon Valley.The first is the solid base of serial entrepreneurs.Los Angeles Overcomes SprawlThe second is a center where entrepreneurs gather to exchange ideas, inspire each other and find talent. For Silicon Valley, it started with Palo Alto, Calif., home of Stanford University and the city where Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) was founded in 1939. ""Silicon Valley"" branched out from there to nurture the likes of Cupertino-based Apple, Santa Clara-based Intel (INTC), San Jose-based Cisco Systems (CSCO) and many, many others.Sprawl has plagued Los Angeles, with its tech hubs spread far apart. But Silicon Beach has emerged as a main hub.A third key ingredient is the support of local universities. Like Stanford in Silicon Valley, Silicon Beach gets much help from USC and UCLA graduates. Many say that the two universities had not been helpful in assisting budding entrepreneurs. But entrepreneurs say that the two esteemed universities are finally providing the inspiration and tools to foster startups.The fourth core ingredient is venture capital. Silicon Valley has Sand Hill Road, home to some of the largest venture capital firms. L.A. has no such address, but the Los Angeles/Orange County region received $1.65 billion in venture capital funding in Q1, according to the National Venture Capital Association. That's the most for any U.S. region after Silicon Valley's $6 billion.Big Deals Attract Venture Firms""While L.A. has a small number of local venture capital firms compared with Silicon Valley, a lot of (VC firms) come here on a regular basis,"" said Ben Kuo, founder of SoCalTech.com, which chronicles the area tech scene.Drawing in venture capital requires headline-grabbing transactions. Silicon Beach is starting to show more of them with the IPOs of TrueCar and Rubicon, and with Apple's $3 billion acquisition of Beats Electronics, maker of the popular Beats headphones and provider of a popular streaming music service. Another was last year's $500 million acquisition by Walt Disney (DIS) of Culver City-based Maker Studios, a leading supplier of YouTube videos.""I hear more and more that entrepreneurs who have started companies in other cities are considering relocating to L.A.,"" Elbaz said. ""L.A. has a fantastic talent pool and a great community of investors that offer a ton of support.""After 30 years in the making, the roots of L.A.'s tech community are firmly grounded, the center is crowded, the money is flowing and the beach is hot.""There are thousands of entrepreneurs in this town,"" Hsu said. ""L.A. has hit the tipping point.""

530,EL,"Recession-weary millennials haven't been as eager as previous generations to get saddled with possessions, a sentiment reflected in low home ownership rates and a thriving ""sharing economy."" But the newest generation of consumers likes having nice things. 
"
531,EL,"Generation Z — those 17 and younger — is the latest demographic in the cross hairs of brands and retailers who have thus far been in hot pursuit of millennials. But teens and kids are markedly different from their older counterparts in want and how they spend, say experts.
"
532,EL,"Their predecessors in the 18-to-34 set have a case of ""millennialism,"" a recession-induced mindset that translates to owning fewer things, said Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at digital marketing agency Deep Focus.
"
533,EL,"Millennials, who graduated college during a recession and witnessed their parents struggle with layoffs, aren't attached to possessions, says Gutfreund, and they see property like cars and homes weighing them down. The travel-happy renters would rather take an Uber than buy a sedan, or resell items they no longer use.
"
534,EL,"Have-Nots Vs. Aspiring Haves
"
535,EL,"""If you've ever spent time with someone who's lived through the Depression, they don't go back (to their old ways),"" Gutfreund told IBD. Millennials ""essentially started the sharing economy,"" valuing experiences over products.
"
536,EL,"Younger people, by comparison, dream of owning cars and homes. They're characterized as being entrepreneurial, well informed and socially conscious. If today's 20- and early-30-somethings are ""have-nots,"" Gen Z members definitely aspire to be ""haves.""
"
537,EL,"Six out of 10 Gen Z youth would rather have a cool product than a cool experience, while 77% of Gen Ys (millennials) would opt for a cool experience over a cool product, according to the latest edition of the Cassandra Report, a Deep Focus survey of young consumers.
"
538,EL,"Millennials, who were teenagers around the time the dot-com bubble burst, think that money doesn't make the man. When they were 14 to 18, only 28% of them viewed having lots of money as an indicator of success, said the report, vs. 51% of today's 14- to 18-year-olds.
"
539,EL,"""Gen Z will be the landlords and Gen Y the renters,"" said Gutfreund. ""Gen Zs view larger, more significant purchases as a solid anchor, a direct investment toward building their future, while Ys view them as an anchor holding them back from experiences (like) traveling the world, and locking them into a lifetime of debt.""
"
540,EL,"Ready To Drop Serious Dough
"
541,EL,"What does this distinction mean for retailers and makers of consumer products?
"
542,EL,"While both generations are budget buyers, today's teens look for ""investment value,"" not resale value, Gutfreund said. Young and still in school, they are nevertheless ""efficient and careful consumers"" who tend to do a lot of research online before making purchases, she added.
"
543,EL,"Teens and kids are therefore more willing than their older peers to drop some serious dough (or their parents' dough ) on a product that they like, even if it means having less stuff overall. When it comes to purchases, 54% of 13- to 17-year-olds value quality over quantity, according to the Cassandra Report.
"
544,EL,"""I do think they will spend more on individual purchases — buying less but better quality fits into their investment mentality,"" Gutfreund said.
"
545,EL,"For example, Estee Lauder's (EL) upscale makeup brand Mac became the No. 1 favorite for teen girls across all income brackets for the first time, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Never mind that Mac foundation can run up to $35 a pop, about three times the price of drugstore brands and more than the average teen's weekly allowance.
"
546,EL,"Dressing well is also a priority for Gen Z. But logo-heavy Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) — millennial favorites — won't cut it anymore.
"
547,EL,"""When millennials were in junior high, a lot of the retail (selection) was about these big, bold logos,"" said Leah Swartz, content specialist for millennial research firm FutureCast.
"
548,EL,"""Now we're seeing those logos take a back seat. (Gen Z wants) to define the brands they're wearing, rather than (let them) define who they are.""
"
549,EL,"Fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21, Zara and H&M, which have put pressure on traditional apparel brands, aren't safe either.
"
550,EL,"""Zs have already started to move away from fast fashion — they are highly aware of the labor practices and impact on the world,"" said Gutfreund.
"
551,EL,"Millennials are the last group to grow up with analog communication, straddling the line between home landlines and Facebook (FB) messages. Millennials tend to look at two to three screens at a time, said Swartz, but Gen Zs multitask across five screens, texting friends and playing tablet games as they watch TV and surf the Web. As attention spans shorten, ""show, don't tell"" seems to be the strategy.
"
552,EL,"That's why Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell announced a Cinco de Mayo giveaway of its new ""biscuit taco"" via Periscope, Twitter's (TWTR) new live video streaming service. Periscope is getting a lot of Gen Z love, said Swartz.
"
553,EL,"And in an age of skipping past ads and not-so-subtle product placement, being obvious about the intention to sell things might create a sheen of authenticity.
"
554,EL,"Gutfreund points to Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) as an example. The cruise line partnered with Google (GOOGL) YouTube channel AwesomenessTV (partly owned by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) to launch ""Royal Crush,"" a teen soap opera set entirely, unabashedly, on a Royal Caribbean ship. One of its latest episodes garnered over 614,000 views and 1,500 fan comments in less than three days.
"
555,EL,"With all the action online, do brick-and-mortar retailers stand a chance with the new generation of consumers?
"
556,EL,"Surprisingly, reports of the mall's demise may be greatly exaggerated. Both teens and 20-somethings still like shopping. Gen Z does 67% of its shopping in store, according to Deep Focus figures, vs. 58% of millennials. And over the last six months, 74% of Gen Zs have engaged in ""webrooming"": researching a product online but ultimately purchasing it in store.
"
557,EL,"""This is not doom and gloom for retailers,"" said Gutfreund. ""It's human nature that people still do love the shopping experience. But those shopping experiences are going to have to be much better.""Recession-weary millennials haven't been as eager as previous generations to get saddled with possessions, a sentiment reflected in low home ownership rates and a thriving ""sharing economy."" But the newest generation of consumers likes having nice things. Generation Z — those 17 and younger — is the latest demographic in the cross hairs of brands and retailers who have thus far been in hot pursuit of millennials. But teens and kids are markedly different from their older counterparts in want and how they spend, say experts.Their predecessors in the 18-to-34 set have a case of ""millennialism,"" a recession-induced mindset that translates to owning fewer things, said Jamie Gutfreund, chief marketing officer at digital marketing agency Deep Focus.Millennials, who graduated college during a recession and witnessed their parents struggle with layoffs, aren't attached to possessions, says Gutfreund, and they see property like cars and homes weighing them down. The travel-happy renters would rather take an Uber than buy a sedan, or resell items they no longer use.Have-Nots Vs. Aspiring Haves""If you've ever spent time with someone who's lived through the Depression, they don't go back (to their old ways),"" Gutfreund told IBD. Millennials ""essentially started the sharing economy,"" valuing experiences over products.Younger people, by comparison, dream of owning cars and homes. They're characterized as being entrepreneurial, well informed and socially conscious. If today's 20- and early-30-somethings are ""have-nots,"" Gen Z members definitely aspire to be ""haves.""Six out of 10 Gen Z youth would rather have a cool product than a cool experience, while 77% of Gen Ys (millennials) would opt for a cool experience over a cool product, according to the latest edition of the Cassandra Report, a Deep Focus survey of young consumers.Millennials, who were teenagers around the time the dot-com bubble burst, think that money doesn't make the man. When they were 14 to 18, only 28% of them viewed having lots of money as an indicator of success, said the report, vs. 51% of today's 14- to 18-year-olds.""Gen Z will be the landlords and Gen Y the renters,"" said Gutfreund. ""Gen Zs view larger, more significant purchases as a solid anchor, a direct investment toward building their future, while Ys view them as an anchor holding them back from experiences (like) traveling the world, and locking them into a lifetime of debt.""Ready To Drop Serious DoughWhat does this distinction mean for retailers and makers of consumer products?While both generations are budget buyers, today's teens look for ""investment value,"" not resale value, Gutfreund said. Young and still in school, they are nevertheless ""efficient and careful consumers"" who tend to do a lot of research online before making purchases, she added.Teens and kids are therefore more willing than their older peers to drop some serious dough (or their parents' dough ) on a product that they like, even if it means having less stuff overall. When it comes to purchases, 54% of 13- to 17-year-olds value quality over quantity, according to the Cassandra Report.""I do think they will spend more on individual purchases — buying less but better quality fits into their investment mentality,"" Gutfreund said.For example, Estee Lauder's (EL) upscale makeup brand Mac became the No. 1 favorite for teen girls across all income brackets for the first time, according to Piper Jaffray's latest Taking Stock With Teens survey. Never mind that Mac foundation can run up to $35 a pop, about three times the price of drugstore brands and more than the average teen's weekly allowance.Dressing well is also a priority for Gen Z. But logo-heavy Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) and American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) — millennial favorites — won't cut it anymore.""When millennials were in junior high, a lot of the retail (selection) was about these big, bold logos,"" said Leah Swartz, content specialist for millennial research firm FutureCast.""Now we're seeing those logos take a back seat. (Gen Z wants) to define the brands they're wearing, rather than (let them) define who they are.""Fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21, Zara and H&M, which have put pressure on traditional apparel brands, aren't safe either.""Zs have already started to move away from fast fashion — they are highly aware of the labor practices and impact on the world,"" said Gutfreund.Millennials are the last group to grow up with analog communication, straddling the line between home landlines and Facebook (FB) messages. Millennials tend to look at two to three screens at a time, said Swartz, but Gen Zs multitask across five screens, texting friends and playing tablet games as they watch TV and surf the Web. As attention spans shorten, ""show, don't tell"" seems to be the strategy.That's why Yum Brands' (YUM) Taco Bell announced a Cinco de Mayo giveaway of its new ""biscuit taco"" via Periscope, Twitter's (TWTR) new live video streaming service. Periscope is getting a lot of Gen Z love, said Swartz.And in an age of skipping past ads and not-so-subtle product placement, being obvious about the intention to sell things might create a sheen of authenticity.Gutfreund points to Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) as an example. The cruise line partnered with Google (GOOGL) YouTube channel AwesomenessTV (partly owned by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) to launch ""Royal Crush,"" a teen soap opera set entirely, unabashedly, on a Royal Caribbean ship. One of its latest episodes garnered over 614,000 views and 1,500 fan comments in less than three days.With all the action online, do brick-and-mortar retailers stand a chance with the new generation of consumers?Surprisingly, reports of the mall's demise may be greatly exaggerated. Both teens and 20-somethings still like shopping. Gen Z does 67% of its shopping in store, according to Deep Focus figures, vs. 58% of millennials. And over the last six months, 74% of Gen Zs have engaged in ""webrooming"": researching a product online but ultimately purchasing it in store.""This is not doom and gloom for retailers,"" said Gutfreund. ""It's human nature that people still do love the shopping experience. But those shopping experiences are going to have to be much better.""

583,EL,"Apple (AAPL) sought to reassert a leadership position in the music industry on Monday by announcing its wide-ranging Apple Music offering. But investors weren't too jazzed.Apple stock fell 0.7% on Monday and was flat, near 128, in afternoon trading on the stock market today. Apple stock had fallen as much as 1.7% earlier Tuesday.Apple dominated music sales for years with its one-two punch of iPod and iTunes. But as music listening shifted from songs purchased from iTunes to streaming music services like Spotify and Pandora (P), Apple's influence waned.Apple Music cobbles together various types of music offerings into one app. It combines downloaded music from iTunes, a rebranded subscription streaming music service (formerly Beats Music), a global 24-hour live Internet radio station and a social network for fans to connect with artists.Apple announced the new music service at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference in San Francisco.At its opening keynote presentation, Apple executives also announced iOS 9, Mac OS X El Capitan and WatchOS 2, the latest operating systems for its mobile devices (iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch), Mac computers and the Apple Watch, respectively.Here are five key takeaways from Apple's WWDC 2015:1. Apple Music 'not groundbreaking'Famed record producer Jimmy Iovine, who joined the company when Apple bought Beats Electronics last August, described the consumer music experience today as a ""fragmented mess."" He said Apple Music will unify streaming music, downloaded music, Internet radio and social media into a ""bigger and better ecosystem with the elegance and simplicity that only Apple can do.""Iovine drew parallels to 2003 when the music industry was a ""ball of confusion"" because of peer-to-peer song sharing through Napster and other services. Apple launched the iTunes Store in April 2003 to give consumers a better way to get digital music.Iovine said Apple Music is ""all the ways you love music all in one place.""Apple Music includes music channels curated by experts and a 24/7 radio station called Beats 1 that is dedicated to music and music culture.Apple Music will launch in more than 100 countries on June 30 and cost $9.99 a month.But some Wall Street analysts were skeptical that Apple Music could gain much market share.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Andy Hargreaves said in a research note that the features of Apple Music are ""not groundbreaking"" when compared with established streaming music services. Therefore it is not likely to draw new customers into the market and will have to try to draw users from rival services, he said.Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor concurred in a report.""The user experience looks no better than anything offered by Spotify, Pandora or Rdio,"" Windsor said. ""Furthermore, all of these companies have a huge head start on Apple, and Apple will have to convince users to switch rather than try music streaming for the first time. This is a much more difficult proposition to make.""Plus, unlike Spotify, Apple Music doesn't offer a free tier of service, which could make attracting users difficult, he said.2. Apple Pay expanding fastApple is working quickly to expand the reach of its mobile payments service, Apple Pay.Apple will make Apple Pay available to customers in the U.K. starting next month, its first international market after launching Apple Pay in the U.S. last October.Apple also is adding support for store-issued credit and debit cards as well as retail rewards programs. Plus, it will bring support for Discover credit cards this fall.""We have been hard at work on our goal of replacing the wallet,"" Jennifer Bailey, vice president of Apple Pay, said at the event. ""We will surpass 1 million locations accepting Apple Pay next month.""Apple Pay will launch in the U.K. with over 250,000 locations, she said. By comparison, it launched in the U.S. last fall with 200,000 locations.Apple Pay has been adding more merchants, with some of the latest including Trader Joe's, Baskin Robbins and JCPenney (JCP). Plus, Apple is looking to add more small businesses through a partnership with Square.A report last week by Reuters threw cold water on the growth of Apple Pay, saying many merchants remain skeptical about the payment system.3. News app makes headlinesApple hopes to turn the iPhone into the front page for digital news consumers with its News app.With the News app, iPhone and iPad users will be able to customize a news stream by publisher and topic. Apple already has signed up nearly 20 major publishers including Bloomberg, CNN, Conde Nast, ESPN, Hearst, the New York Times and Time. Plus, News keeps track of more than 1 million topics that users can follow.""We think this offers the best mobile reading experience ever,"" said Susan Prescott, Apple vice president of application product management, at WWDC.The News app will be included with iOS 9, due out this fall. It features the visually rich layout of a magazine, Prescott said. The app will roll out first in the U.S., U.K. and China.Apple is one of several companies competing to be the news service for millennials. Others include Facebook (FB), Flipboard, Google (GOOGL) and Twitter (TWTR).Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of software engineering, took a shot at rivals in digital news delivery.""Unlike just about any other news aggregation service we're aware of on the planet, News is designed from ground up with your privacy in mind,"" he said.Apple also hopes to differentiate its offering by the scope of content.""News isn't just for the media titans. Great content comes from all kinds of sources and we want them all in News,"" Federighi said at the event. ""So, whether it's a local newspaper or blog or special interest publication, they'll all be here.""4. Siri is getting betterApple's personal assistant software Siri is getting better at understanding its users.""Siri has quietly become incredibly popular,"" Federighi said. ""It serves over a billion requests per week. This is in part because Siri has gotten so great at understanding what we're saying. In just the last year, we've seen a 40% reduction in word error rate, down to 5%. That's an industry-leading number. And Siri is 40% faster than ever at responding to what we say.""Apple is bucking up Siri's capabilities in iOS 9, Federighi said. It will respond to more commands and become proactive. It will understand the context of where you are and what you're doing when you make requests or start activities, he said.Improvements to Siri are the most important feature of iOS 9, Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said in a report Tuesday.5. Developers are criticalSince the WWDC is a conference for software developers, Apple played to its audience.It showed a flattering video depicting how app developers for Apple's iPhone and iPad are changing the world.Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company's three operating systems: iOS, Mac OS X and WatchOS will provide amazing opportunities for developers.""There's really so many possibilities for you to use these platforms and these tools to create unbelievable apps that will impact business, health care and education and really everything in our lives. There's seemingly no limit to what you can do,"" he said.Apple's App Store is key for developers, Cook said. The App Store recently passed 100 billion apps downloaded. He called Apple's App Store ""an economic boon"" that has paid out $30 billion to developers.""The App Store continues to be the most profitable apps marketplace on the planet,"" Cook said.The biggest applause at the keynote came when Apple announced that it would make its Swift programming language open source for iOS, Mac OS X and Linux later this year.""We think Swift is the next big programming language, the one that we will all be doing application and systems programming on for 20 years to come,"" Federighi said. ""We think Swift should be everywhere and used by everyone. And so we're going to be doing something really big: Today we're announcing that Swift will be open source.""The crowd of programmers at the Moscone Center went wild with cheers, whistles and clapping.Apple's decision to make Swift open source could expand Apple's developer community to 8 million from the current 5 million, analyst Chowdhry said.

That may whittle away U.S. inventories, which remain about 100 million barrels above the five-year average.""The market just wasn't able to sustain the higher levels reached last week,"" said Tim Evans, an energy analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York. ""The surging demand story isn't fully backed up by the data so far. While its true that lower prices are a stimulus to demand, it's being offset in large part by a macroeconomic slowdown.""WTI crude for November delivery declined $2.53, or 5.1%, to settle at $47.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the biggest decline since Sept. 1 and the lowest close since Oct. 5.Futures climbed as much as 1% earlier.

703,EL,"Immigration: Donald Trump got a standing ovation from some 20,000 supporters Monday after vowing to kick illegal alien gangsters out of the country. An alarming new Texas study on the MS-13 threat shows why.Conducted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, the study reveals that the nation's most violent street gang — MS-13 — has been energized by the flood of illegal immigrant minors entering the U.S. through Mexico, after President Obama rolled out the welcome mat for them.El Salvador-based MS-13 has now emerged as a ""top-tier"" threat in Texas, responsible for a rash of gruesome machete murders in Houston and other Texas cities.""In 2014, Texas experienced a dramatic spike in illegal aliens crossing into the United States from Mexico and Central America,"" the study warned.""Among those who illegally cross the Texas-Mexico border are gang members and associates, including those associated with large transnational gangs such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13).""The influx of illegal alien gang members crossing the border into Texas, along with reports of extremely violent murders committed by its members in the Houston area, positions the gang as one of the most significant gang threats in the state for this upcoming year. MS-13 gang members are known for highly violent crimes, including brutal murders and dismemberments.""The 57-page report says that some of the illegal immigrant murderers are teens as young as 14. Many of these juveniles, who have killed U.S. citizens, illegally crossed into the U.S. last year when Obama loosened border restrictions. Little wonder, then, that Texans went bonkers for Trump's anti-immigrant gang message at the American Airlines Center in Dallas.The GOP front-runner decried ""anchor babies"" and gang members among the immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, drawing huge ovations from the crowd.""You look at crime in so many different places, and you see gangs. Many of these gang members are illegal immigrants. They're rough dudes. They will be out of here so freaking fast!"" Trump promised to wild cheering and clapping.""You people are suffering,"" Trump told the Texans. ""I'm in New York, but they're in New York, too. They're all over the place.""He's right. The threat from ruthless foreign gangs has become a national concern. Separate reports reveal that MS-13 is consolidating power in Los Angeles neighborhoods and even taking over high schools in the wealthy suburbs around Washington, D.C.With the spread of ""maras"" gang violence, it's not surprising that a just-released CNN poll shows illegal immigration as the defining issue of the presidential race.Almost 90% of Americans say that stopping immigrants from entering the U.S. illegally should be a top government priority, while 52% favor building a Trump-style wall on the Mexican border. That's up from 45% in 2006, CNN reported.Under Democrats, the U.S. has become a dumping ground for violent criminals from Mexico and Central America. Trump's popularity signals that voters are fed up with it.

704,EL,"Stock futures traded lower, but steady ahead of Monday's open as oil prices and the Federal Reserve tested investor confidence. Dow futures traded 40.2 points below fair market value. S&P 500 futures hung 5.5 points below the line. Nasdaq 100 futures were off a mild 7.6 points. Small caps were under disproportionate pressure, with Russell 2000 futures falling 8.2 points.The stock market today opens under a clear caution flag ahead of Wednesday's policy decision from the Federal Reserve. The Nasdaq dropped 4.1% last week, slicing below support at both its 200-day and 50-day moving averages. The S&P 500 crumpled 3.8%, also violating both levels of support.

DuPont dipped more than 1%.Apple trimmed its premarket loss to 1%, up from a 3% dive, after Morgan Stanley cut its price target to 143 from 162, citing pressure on international iPhone prices due to oversupply outside China. Apple ended Friday well off an August low, but struggling to retake its 10-week moving average within a five-month consolidation.Jarden (JAH) jumped 5%, Newell Rubbermaid (NWL) slipped more than 2% after Newell said it would pay $13.2 billion in a cash/stock deal to acquire the Boca Raton, Fla.-based maker of Sunbeam irons, Marmot outdoor gear and Crock-Pot cookware.Newell management said the combination is targeting $500 million in annualized cost savings, would be immediately positive for earnings, and should close in Q2 of 2016. Jarden rose 9% last week on merger speculation, moving the stock up the right side of a five-month consolidation.China-based maker of solar electrical components Trina Solar (TSL) spiked 9% on news reports that the company had received an offer to be taken private at $11.60 per share by Shanghai Xingsheng Equity Investment & Management. The offer was 321% above Friday's closing price.Edwards Lifesciences (EW) was confusing brokerage data collection systems in premarket trade, as it prepared to go live with its 2-for-1 stock split at today's open. It is the company's first stock split since May 2010.Overseas, Europe's stocks came off their lows near midday. London's FTSE 100 reversed early losses and wrestled into narrowly positive territory. Frankfurt's DAX was down 0.8%, up from a 1.2% loss. The Cac-40 in Paris eased to a 0.4% loss, from 0.6%.Asia's markets were widely mixed: Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index dipped 0.7%, the Shanghai Composite jumped 2.5% and the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo stumbled to a 1.8% loss.

706,EL,"Los Angeles to Seattle to Edmonton to Houston to Minneapolis to Seattle to Kansas City to Canton. Such was Warren Moon's international football journey. No matter where the strong-armed quarterback went — and Moon's trek blanketed North America — overthrowing obstacles remained a key to his core.Moon rose above the early death of his father and a notion among some football followers that blacks couldn't make it at quarterback.In turn, the Los Angeles native rode his arm to Canton, Ohio, where in 2006 he became the first black quarterback inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Nine years later, the nine-time National Football League Pro Bowler beams about that distinction.""It is one of the most proud things in my career,"" Moon, 58, told IBD. ""Myself, Doug Williams, Randall Cunningham and others. . .. We really opened up some doors and opened the eyes of people in professional football that African Americans can play the quarterback position at a high level. So many people blazed that trail before us, and we just took it and ran with it. I'm glad I was able to help make a difference.""Growing up in Los Angeles, Harold Warren Moon was met with challenges early.Among seven children, he led a California boyhood filled with sports and Cub Scout meetings.But the fun and soapbox derbies ground to a halt at age 7. That's when his dad, Harold, died at age 37. Warren had to grow up fast.""It shaped me quite a bit,"" said Moon of his father's death from liver disease related to alcoholism. ""I took on a lot of responsibility at a young age. I was known as the man of the house, my nickname in junior high was Pops and I carried a briefcase in high school. Everyone thought I was nerdy, but I was just very focused and determined in what I wanted to do.""Pat Moon Lit The WayAfter the loss of her husband, Warren's mother hit the books for her college degree, setting an example her son grasped to the hilt.""I was very confident and focused on what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be,"" said Warren. ""That came from my mom, who went back to school after my dad died. Her determination and focus rubbed off on me.""Warren learned to cook, sew and iron to help stabilize the house while Pat worked shifts as a nurse.Things were unsettled at times, but then came football.Introduced to the game by a Cub Scout friend, Moon started playing Pop Warner in the City of Angels at age 10. After four years in the organization, he was off to Hamilton High School to ply his wares.Moon's shine was stunted early, as he barely saw the field his first two years. A coach at the school did not buy him as a quarterback, but was soon proved wrong.The junior took over as the starter in 1973 and had his team, the Yankees, in the playoffs a year later.Good enough to be named All-City as a senior, Moon faced doubt by others. Arizona State, USC and others recruited the footballer, but at other positions where black players were typically moved — defensive back, wide receiver. Anything but quarterback.Moon had a good arm, decent size and success at the high school level, but was overlooked as a signal caller by college scouts.For the confident teen, the situation reeked of injustice. ""I was a pretty good judge of competition and I thought I was just as good as anyone else out there,"" he said. ""All I needed was the opportunity.""He found it close to home.Moon enrolled at West Los Angeles College and set school records his freshman season of 1974.That sparked interest from the Pacific Northwest. The University of Washington and its new coach, Don James, were the first to offer Moon the chance to play quarterback, and he obliged.James was keen on scrutinizing players, and Moon passed the test.""Don had real thorough evaluation forms when it came to recruiting,"" Bob Stull, Washington's wide receivers coach and James' head recruiter in 1975, told IBD. ""Coaches evaluated positional prospects by physical ratings and skills like footwork and arm strength. We were looking for quarterbacks at the time and felt like he was a good prospect. He had great arm strength, was physically strong and was a really good learner.""Moon turned into a Huskie Hero.After going 11-11 his first two seasons under center, Moon led Washington to a Rose Bowl victory in his Pac-8 Player of the Year-winning senior season of 1977.The Huskies upset heavily favored Michigan 27-20 in that January 1978 game, and Moon was named Most Valuable Player.That campaign was the first of 16 straight winning seasons under James that included three more Rose Bowl victories.Having turned heads in Seattle, Moon could not fully satisfy NFL scouts. They said: He was not athletic enough. His arm was not strong enough.Instead of waiting for disappointment in the NFL draft, Moon headed north — to the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos.Moon thrived in the CFL's wide-open game, winning five Grey Cups and tossing 144 touchdowns during six seasons in Edmonton.Playing outside America was a unique experience for the CFL Hall of Famer.""They gave me my chance to play professional football when they saw something in me that my own country didn't see,"" said Moon. ""I was homesick and cold, but winning masks all of that. The fans were unbelievable, and I never heard anything negative from them. I'll always be indebted to the Canadian people for it.""After his heroics with the Eskimos, the NFL came calling.Moon ended a seven-team bidding war in 1984 by signing a five-year deal with the Houston Oilers for $5.5 million. Suddenly he was the highest-paid player in the NFL.The 27-year-old rookie had Oiler fans gushing. He threw for 3,338 yards his first season and had Houston in the playoffs by 1987.Hot In HoustonMoon quarterbacked the Oilers to seven straight postseasons in the team's run-and-shoot offense.His best season came in 1990, when he threw for 4,689 yards and 33 touchdowns while being named the NFL's Associated Press Offensive Player of the Year.Houston lost in the wild-card round of the playoffs that season.Then in 1994, the Oilers traded Moon to Minnesota.He led the Vikings to two playoff berths in three seasons and wound up his career with the Seattle Seahawks and Kansas City Chiefs.When Moon retired after the 2000 season at age 44, he had thrown for nearly 50,000 yards in the NFL to go along with his 21,000-plus in Canada, leaving him as one of the most prolific quarterbacks in football history.Now he helps run the Crescent Moon Foundation, dedicated to children in need, which he started in 1989, the year he was the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year for his charity work .""My focus is education,"" said Moon, now a Seahawk radio broadcaster, ""because every kid can't be Michael Jordan or LeBron James. But if they have the education, it gives them a chance to be successful in something else.""Moon is helping others, just like he had a hand in changing pro football during his ground-breaking playing days.""There weren't a lot of black quarterbacks in his time,"" said Stull, now athletic director at the University of Texas, El Paso. ""Warren was a pure thrower, not an option guy. The fact that he wasn't drafted and became the highest-paid NFL player shows his determination and work ethic. He really was a trailblazer as far as breaking into the CFL and the NFL.""

No comment from him, however, about the reforms that Sweden has made over the last decade to rid itself of the state embrace that's choked economic life or the demographic losses endured as the young move out or lose interest in forming families.Also under the democratic socialist banner is Venezuela, where citizens have lost not only all their prosperity and access to goods but their civil freedoms as well.Every last government agency there has been politicized since the 1998 election of Hugo Chavez, ending civil society, while the separation of powers has been rubbed away in the name of ""the revolution.""As a result, political dissidents have been thrown in prisons without trial. Others have lost the right to leave the country. Still more have had their businesses expropriated. More still have been victims of political thuggery from government-sponsored private goons.Like Sweden, Venezuela is no country for young men. A study of professors at Gervasio Rubio Rural Pedagogic Institute reported last week in El Universal showed that large numbers of Venezuela's young would rather deal drugs than go to school.The Los Angeles Times over the weekend ran a long piece on the dilemma of Venezuela's two most prominent classical music stars — conductor Gustavo Dudamel and pianist Gabriela Montero — on coming to terms with the horror of Venezuela's regime.It explored the ideas of each as to how and whether music mattered and if it can bring change. But not once did the long, detailed piece mention the source of Venezuela's demise: socialism.Sanders' ideas come from places where they've been tried and failed horribly. And there's little doubt that what he's peddling would have the same result here.The disturbing thing is, none of this gets out. Instead, amid a nonstop drumbeat of the wonderful normalcy of socialism in the U.S. against the experiences elsewhere, polls of Americans show an increasingly favorable view of it.Gallup poll found in 2010 that 61% of liberals and 20% of conservatives viewed socialism positively. Let's hope the trend doesn't continue, and that socialism's real record gets out to spare us the mistakes that result every time and every place it's been tried.

775,EL,"Narcosocialism: U.S. prosecutors and DEA agents are closing in on Venezuelan leaders for running a narcostate. This is the nation Obama has repeatedly indulged in the name of getting along. Now we know who they are.Back in March, President Obama startled many by calling Venezuela ""the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States"" as he slapped sanctions on seven corrupt Venezuelan officials for involvement with drug trafficking and human rights abuses.A month after that, he made a U-turn, making nice with the dictatorship at April's Summit of the Americas. After tears and flapdoodle about the sanctions from Venezuela's Marxist dictatorship, Obama declared that Venezuela wasn't a threat after all.He was right the first time. A front page story in Tuesday's Wall Street Journal reports that U.S. prosecutors and Drug Enforcement Administration officials — acting independently of politics or diplomacy — have put together a stunning case against Venezuela as an emerging narcostate responsible for moving 131 tons of cocaine to the U.S. and Europe. The case is based on interviews with defecting officials, former soldiers and busted drug dealers eager to sing their way out of jail time.That's who these people are: leaders of the cocaine capital of the world with leaders involved from the top.This information is not new. Every name mentioned in the Journal report, from that of the leader of the legislature (a position equivalent to that of House Speaker John Boehner) Diosdado Cabello, to that of Interior Minister Tarek El Aissami, to that of intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal — has been mentioned in these pages before as involved in narcotrafficking.But what makes it different is the impartial investigation's irrefutable fact — power is starting to override the efforts of the Obama administration to look the other way.Because up until now, Obama has bent over backward to make nice to this corrupt regime.In November 2013, he made overtures to restore diplomatic ties with Venezuela after a spat with the U.S. And the following year he did nothing as Venezuela took a seat on the United Nations Security Council. The backtrack at the Summit was the final wimp-out.The reality remains that a monstrous threat is growing on the other side of the Caribbean. Instead of coddling this regime and propping it up with oil cash as past presidents, and especially Obama, have done, it's time to treat Venezuela for what it is: a narcostate.

792,EL,"Lunacy: The U.N. will honor — get this — Venezuela as ""the country that has fought hunger the most in the world."" Given the country's self-induced shortages, this is pure Orwell. And it's contradicted by the U.N.'s own data.If you thought the United Nations' scaremongering global warming shop was daft, a look at its Food and Agriculture Organization should assure you the rot goes all the way to the bottom.President Nicolas Maduro announced Thursday that he would be traveling to Italy to receive an award for Venezuela's ""food missions,"" according to El Universal.If correct, it would not be the first time the U.N. has held Venezuela up to global praise for its handouts.In June 2013, the FAO honored Venezuela for ""making big strides in reducing hunger.""Welfare can temporarily reduce hunger so long as the cash lasts, but it's come at a massive cost — in the creation of mass impoverishment across the country.Currency controls, expropriations and state corruption have left Venezuelans standing in multiple lines for much of the day just to get access to basic foodstuffs. The last official data, issued two years ago, show supplies of basic foodstuffs are 28% below 2004 levels.Fights are now commonplace in food lines. Medical shortages are so severe that the country has resorted to fingerprinting to catch thieves, and Maduro blames ""hoarders"" and ""CIA plots"" for the failures. With scapegoats aplenty, don't expect him to fix the problems soon.At last month's Summit of the Americas in Panama, there was open talk from Latin American leaders of sending food-aid caravans to ease the hunger.""We'll expropriate whatever needs to be expropriated,"" Maduro told his country last year, threatening to seize farms and food production companies.He's now in the midst of seizing Polar — Venezuela's largest and best-run food company — in a sign that this was no idle threat. Three years ago, 988 farms and businesses were seized (they've stopped reporting those data since), leaving a gutted food base and massive shortages that will only get worse.Which brings us to the U.N.'s own data. According to the FAO website, Venezuela's per person food output fell 6.3% from 2007 to 2012. Those data alone are an indictment of Venezuela's failed socialist food policies.It's a joke that the U.N. should honor Venezuela, the great creator of hunger in the Americas, with anything.

794,EL,"You can go further than you thought possible. Lessons from goal reachers: Take steps. ""You keep moving. Before you know it 40 days go by,"" said Mike Fernandez, chairman of investment firm MBF Healthcare Partners.That's how he completed a 508-mile walk along the El Camino, an ancient route from France's eastern border to Galicia, Spain. Start with one. Fernandez was inspired to undertake the 2013 trek while waiting out his toddler granddaughter's open-heart surgery.He'd long considered the spiritual hike, which culminates at the shrine of St. James the Great.Turning it into to a fundraiser — pledges resulted in $5 million for Miami Children's Hospital — gave the philanthropic businessman a chance to help the institution that brought his granddaughter back to health. ""It is the most important thing I do,"" he told IBD. Get grounded. Others along the trail greeted Fernandez the same way: ""Good morning, pilgrim.""""They don't know if you are a shoeshine guy or a titan of industry. You learn we're all pretty simple,"" said Fernandez, who wrote ""Humbled By the Journey,"" a book about the experience. Gain perspective. Walking 15 miles a day made Fernandez rue his bad back and knees, until he saw a trekker in a wheelchair pushing herself forward.""You start seeing people in worse shape than you are in. It brings the very best out in you,"" he said. Do it. Guidance Software interim CEO Barry Plaga wasn't much of a runner when he signed up for an Ironman competition. But after watching one on TV, he gave the biking, running and swimming event a try. The first one whipped and energized him.As he crossed the finish line, the announcer bellowed: ""You are now an Ironman.""""It's a great validation,"" Plaga said. ""I thought: I have to do this again. I can do so much better."" Use the solitude. Long training hours paid off in unexpected ways. ""You have a lot of time by yourself to think,"" Plaga said. ""I plan a lot of things in my head when I run."" Make it beneficial.  During one event, Plaga's team raised $800,000 for Smile Train, which pays for kids' cleft palate surgery.Plaga found that completing nine Ironman events, plus an even more grueling, three-day Ultraman triathlon, also strengthened his professional abilities. ""My stamina for long days at work has never been better,"" he said. ""No project or event is too daunting."" Aspire. ""Blind Ambition"" author Patricia Walsh is a brain tumor survivor, software engineer, entrepreneur and four-time national champion paratriathlete.Sightless since age 14, Walsh refused to resign herself to a lesser future. ""As an individual with a disability, you are handed excuses on a silver platter,"" she said. ""Today I am no longer motivated by a want to prove myself, but rather by the limitless potential."" Feed your dreams. Walsh divides her goals into three categories: fuel, fire, blaze.Fuel is the day-to-day stuff — like learning new skills — that keeps the fire going. Fire goals are incremental gains or milestones that move you forward. Blaze is the big stuff — your dream made real.""The key to a blaze goal is that it transcends external validation. All that matters is you feel strongly about it,"" she said.

795,EL,"Terrorism: No sooner had President Obama gutted border enforcement than the Islamic State built a Mexican training camp just a few miles from Texas. Did Obama doubt IS would take advantage of his immigration policies?If he did, he is dangerously naive. But we do not see how he could have been so clueless. There were plenty of warnings that IS was targeting the border, and they emerged even as he was putting the final touches on his executive amnesty scheme.Last fall, for example, a top Homeland Security official testified before Congress that U.S. intelligence picked up IS chatter about infiltrating the U.S. through its southern border with Mexico.""There have been exchanges among IS adherents across the globe speaking about that as a possibility,"" Francis Taylor, DHS undersecretary of intelligence and analysis, warned the Senate's homeland security panel.Well, guess what? According to an alarming new Judicial Watch report quoting several authorities on both sides of the border, IS has set up a base just eight miles south of El Paso and is conducting reconnaissance on U.S. airports and military bases. Colleges are also reportedly in the terrorist group's cross hairs.""During the course of a joint operation last week,"" the report reveals, ""Mexican Army and federal law enforcement officials discovered documents in Arabic and Urdu, as well as 'plans' of Fort Bliss,"" the sprawling military installation near El Paso that houses the U.S. Army's 1st Armored Division.Muslim prayer rugs were recovered with the documents during the operation. Reportedly, IS flags and graffiti have also been spotted in the area.Washington-based Judicial Watch reports that ISIS plans to exploit the railways and airport facilities in the area of Santa Teresa, N.M., a U.S. port of entry. It also says that ISIS has ""spotters"" located in the East Potrillo Mountains of New Mexico, which is largely managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, to aid in terrorist border crossings.""ISIS is conducting reconnaissance of regional universities; the White Sands Missile Range; government facilities in Alamogordo, N.M.; Ft. Bliss; and the electrical power facilities near Anapra and Chaparral, N.M.,"" the report warns.Imagine if the training camps that Osama bin Laden set up in Afghanistan before 9/11 were set up instead in our own backyard.Welcome to 2015 and the sorry state of homeland security under this president.This is the bind that Obama and his immigration policies have put us in. By gutting border security, he made the border more vulnerable to infiltration by our enemy.The policies could get Americans killed in a large-scale attack that originates from our porous and increasingly unsecured southern border.For several years, Breitbart News defense reporter Edwin Mora has been tracking the number of aliens from terrorism-linked countries who are apprehended trying to enter the U.S. illegally. But DHS has refused to disclose those numbers to him in the past two years.There's a reason for that. Republican members of Congress say that at least 10 IS fighters have been nabbed coming across the Mexican border in Texas, and DHS is loath to acknowledge this as it stands down border guards and agents to conform with Obama's new amnesty deal. It's hiding data to protect the president's policy, which apparently is now viewed as more important than protecting the country.It's become abundantly clear that this administration — or more precisely, this White House — is playing a dangerous game of politics with national security.As Obama's border and immigration policies increasingly make it easier for IS to attack the homeland, is it time to start asking if the president himself isn't a national security threat? And whether more ought to be done to rein him in and neutralize his policies before they further jeopardize public safety?
"
796,EL,"National Security: Credible reports have surfaced for the second time of an Islamic State training camp at the U.S. border near Texas. When will the Obama administration get serious about investigating the issue?Judicial Watch reports that two Mexican officials — a field grade military officer and a federal police officer — have anonymously told them that IS terrorists have set up a camp outside Juarez, in Mexico's Chihuahua state, in a region eight miles from the U.S. border known as ""Anapra.""Mexican officials deny it, U.S. law enforcement agencies more tentatively call it ""unsubstantiated."" But it underlines that our border is still unguarded even after last summer's human waves of illegal immigration from Central America, significant U.S. interests — from oil installations to the Fort Bliss military base — are vulnerable. Our enemies are still plotting against us.The Judicial Watch report came with relevant details — such as that recent terrorist Twitter chatter had specifically brought up the idea of infiltrating the U.S. from the south, and that Qurans in Arabic and Urdu and prayer rugs had been found in the area, and that Mexican police had recovered ""plans"" for Fort Bliss, suggesting potential for an attack.Combine that with last summer's demonstration by activist James O'Keefe that the western Texas border is so porous that even a guy with an Osama bin Laden mask could cross with impunity. We're open to attack.On the downside, there are still no photographs, satellite or otherwise, of any camp. Nor is there corroborative evidence of ties between Islamic State and the Juarez drug cartel, which controls Mexico's border areas. Anonymous accusers are par in the region, given the cartels' habit of murdering those it doesn't like.But it remains worth looking into, rather than downplaying it in the knee-jerk manner seen so far.The left has accused Judicial Watch of a political agenda for reporting the camps — even though it it seemed to be a follow-up to Homeland Security congressional testimony last September. Fact is, those who refuse even to admit there may be a problem are the real ones with a politicized agenda.As the mayor who didn't want swimmers cleared from the beach in the face of a prowling shark in ""Jaws"" understood, to his peril, there are economic interests at stake, both in Juarez and El Paso.From Washington and Mexico City, there remain many with a vested interest in exporting as many illegals to the U.S. as possible across an open border, in the quest for new Democratic Party voters.It's time Americans demand to know why vested interests in open borders by one party should take precedence over our security. If there are terrorists massing on our border and plotting evil, we need to know.

809,EL,"In his powerful and inspirational State of the Union address, President Obama devoted time to economic proposals that have no chance of being approved by the Republican-controlled Congress.Yet he discussed an issue of considerable interest to the American people in order to frame the national economic debate before the 2016 elections. And if he is lucky, he may well end up achieving a few other goals, too.In highlighting the significant accomplishments of the economy in 2014 — ""a breakthrough year for America"" — Obama correctly noted, ""The shadow of the crisis has passed."" Americans, he said, ""have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.""Yet too great a share of the gains has accrued to only a small portion of the population: the very wealthy. So the president was correct to stress that it is time to ""turn the page"" and ""commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising income and chances for everyone who makes the effort.""Now that America has recovered from the worst of a global financial crisis that almost tipped the global economy into a multiyear depression, Obama is urging Congress to help him execute a pivot: away from growth that is frustratingly sluggish and narrow, and toward long-term prosperity that is a lot more inclusive.To that end, the president called upon Congress to ""make child care more available and more affordable;"" ""to lower the cost of community college — to zero;"" and to advance an ""infrastructure plan.""To fund these proposals, he proposed increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans and closing tax loopholes that disproportionately benefit them, as well as measures to raise more revenue from big corporations.Obama is responding to growing concern about the significant worsening of what I call the inequality trifecta — of income, wealth and opportunity. This phenomenon has adverse consequences that extend well beyond its social, moral and ethical dimensions.By undermining both consumption and improvements in labor productivity, worsening inequality also creates headwinds to a lasting and broad-based economic expansion.Regardless of their merits, most of the economic proposals that the president made Tuesday evening face almost certain defeat in the Republican-controlled Congress. Indeed, it didn't take long for Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to take to Twitter to dismiss them: ""All POTUS offered is more taxes, more government.""Higher taxation is anathema to Republicans, as is greater government spending and involvement, both of which the president would like to see. Some will go further and assert that Obama is seeking to fuel ""class warfare."" At the same time, few Democrats or Republicans seem eager to cooperate with colleagues across the aisle for fear of making their own re-elections more challenging.None of this would come as a surprise to Obama. He would be the first to admit that most of his economic proposals are unlikely to be approved by Congress. Yet it still made sense to put them on the table.First, the proposals are likely to fuel and prolong a national discussion about inequality, the hollowing out of the middle class and the co-optation of parts of the political class by wealthy individuals and corporate lobbies.Democrats believe that this debate will work in their favor as they position themselves to retain the White House and reclaim at least one chamber of Congress.Second, by providing the Republicans with something they can visibly and successfully oppose — higher taxes — Obama could improve the chances of bipartisan agreement on some of the smaller issues that he mentioned and for which there already is some political common ground, including trade agreements, immigration and infrastructure.Third, Obama could end up putting the Republicans in a position that undermines their party's efforts to come across as more encompassing. The more vocal and visceral the Republican opposition to the proposals, the greater the probability of the party being portrayed as beholden to the ""one percent,"" possibly costing any chance of a Republican winning the White House next year.Meanwhile, Democrats can position themselves as the party that embraces the idea that ""this country does best when everyone gets a fair shot.""The unrealistic economic measures that Obama presented Tuesday evening weren't the political equivalent of a ""Hail Mary"" pass. Instead, he adopted a longer-term strategic approach aimed at improving the Democrats' chances of continuing the successes of his presidency. El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz.

""Just about any second-generation product can be successfully made in Mexico today.""To be sure, some investments in Mexico could have come here. Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi, for example, built a factory in Mexico to produce SUVs despite having an option to do so in Tennessee.But investment is flowing the other way, too. Volvo, which is owned by Chinese automaker Geely, said March 30 that it will build a $500-million manufacturing plant in the United States to bolster flagging U.S. sales by giving it a local presence and reducing the effect of the strong dollar. And last August, GM confirmed that it will shift Cadillac SRX SUV production from its Ramos Arizpe plant to its Spring Hill, Tenn., factory.On Thursday, Ford confirmed that it and Chongqing Changan Automobile, its joint venture partner, will buy and upgrade a factory in northeast China for $1.1 billion, various reports said, citing a company spokesperson. The new plant is expected to boost Ford's China output by 200,000 vehicle a year.Meeting Regional TastesGM, like other automakers, is building cars to suit regional buying patterns. Luxury vehicles such as Cadillacs have sold briskly in China and the U.S., but smaller cars are more popular elsewhere.""Auto products made in Mexico are primarily in two groups, small cars and compact cars,"" IHS Automotive analyst Stephanie Brinley said. ""Those are the two largest categories globally. ... It makes sense to build those products in Mexico.""Mexico has been invited to join the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation Asia-Pacific trade agreement that represents nearly 40% of global GDP and will be the world's largest trade agreement.And as a labor dispute at U.S. West Coast ports disrupts supply chains across industries, Mexico's direct links with the U.S. look more appealing.Spurred by the North American Free Trade Agreement, shipping via truck or by Kansas City Southern's (KSU) 6,000 miles of railroad tracks between the U.S. and Mexico is cheaper and faster than shipping from China.For most U.S. multinationals, ""the pendulum has swung back in favor of Mexico,"" UTEP's Fullerton said.

Homicides of innocent countrymen, allegedly by illegal aliens. ISIS barbarities and new victories. Doubtful nuclear agreements. Ineffective national leadership.Then three young Americans, childhood buddies on a European romp, dozing on a train racing toward Paris. They weren't even supposed to be on that train or in that car hurtling across the Netherlands, Belgium and France.Gunfire! They drop, like everyone else. They look. At the far end of the car stands a man with an AK-47. They don't even think. They rush him. Tackle him. One knocks the handgun away. Another seizes the automatic weapon, smashes the would-be terrorist's face several times, knocking him out.Bleeding profusely from a nearly-severed thumb, Airman Spencer Stone stanched blood gushing from another passenger's neck. Then, adrenaline still flowing, the trio thought to disable both firearms in case terrorist pals lurked nearby.French President Francois Hollande declined to call the incident mere ""travel-place violence.""""We narrowly avoided a tragedy, a massacre,"" he said Monday, awarding the Legion of Honor to the Air Force's Stone, Alek Skarlatos — fresh from Army duty in Afghanistan — and Anthony Sadler, a Sacramento college student.

939,EL,"Following a brief dip in October tied to the Ebola scare, airline stocks are trading at their highest point in years as the industry benefits from cheap oil prices and a growing U.S. economy.
"
940,EL,"One of the biggest gainers in recent weeks is Spirit Airlines (SAVE), the low-cost carrier that has made a name for itself by providing a bare-bones flying option for budget-conscious travelers.
"
941,EL,"Its shares have risen nearly 60% since Oct. 13, when IBD's Transportation-Airline group hit an eight-month low as investors worried that a spreading Ebola outbreak might curb air travel.
"
942,EL,"Spirit's stock gain compares favorably with the performance of other airlines highly rated by IBD, such asSouthwest Airlines (LUV), Alaska Air Group (ALK) and JetBlue Airways (JBLU).
"
943,EL,"Shares of Spirit got a lift on Oct. 28, rising 7% after the company beat third-quarter earnings views.
"
944,EL,"""We're very pleased with how the market is responding to our track record and growth story,"" Spirit CEO Ben Baldanza told IBD. ""People like our return on investment and growth profile.""
"
945,EL,"That track record includes years of solid profits despite the ups and downs of the air travel industry. More recently, the airline has run off seven straight quarters of at least double-digit sales and EPS growth.
"
946,EL,"Baldanza's Bonanza
"
947,EL,"Spirit has an all-Airbus (EADSY) fleet of 60 narrow-body planes and operates more than 280 daily flights going to more than 55 destinations in the U.S., Latin America and the Caribbean.
"
948,EL,"The recipe for success is pretty simple, Baldanza says. Spirit offers cut-rate fares — about 40% lower than other airlines on average, according to Department of Transportation data — to travelers who value cost savings over all else.
"
949,EL,"Those travelers represent the majority of the airline market, according to evaluations Spirit conducted.
"
950,EL,"""Our evaluations found that when you ask customers how they pick an airline, more than half say they just want the lowest price,"" Baldanza said. ""That's more important than other features such as more leg room or in-flight entertainment.""
"
951,EL,"To reach those customers, Spirit offers a basic ""bare fare"" option that includes a seat and one piece of carry-on luggage. If you want anything else — even a beverage — it costs extra.
"
952,EL,"The company caters to passengers who order and pay for their own tickets, which basically means leisure and small-business travelers. Business-class travelers who work for corporations with large travel budgets are not the target demographic.
"
953,EL,"Baldanza notes that what you'll find on a Spirit flight reflects the low fare.
"
954,EL,"""If you are paying for the ticket yourself, you tend to be more realistic,"" he said. ""Our planes don't have as much leg room as other airlines, our seats don't recline, we tend to only make one or two flights a day from many markets.""
"
955,EL,"That's a compromise, he concedes. ""But what you get is the absolute lowest total price. That's why our planes are very full and why we continue to grow very profitably.""
"
956,EL,"Spirit keeps its fares low by keeping its own costs low, Baldanza says. ""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""
"
957,EL,"In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.
"
958,EL,"Most Profitable Airline?
"
959,EL,"In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.
"
960,EL,"Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.
"
961,EL,"Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.
"
962,EL,"""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.
"
963,EL,"Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.
"
964,EL,"Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.
"
965,EL,"Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.
"
966,EL,"Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""
"
967,EL,"CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry. ""When somebody creates a better mousetrap, people copy it,"" he said.
"
968,EL,"Baldanza points to Europe, where about 20% of travelers fly on carriers similar to Spirit, including Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). In contrast, Spirit carries just under 2% of the total U.S. air passenger traffic.
"
969,EL,"""We don't see anybody doing what we are doing yet, though over time we expect they will,"" Baldanza said.
"
970,EL,"Meanwhile, Spirit continues to expand its operations.
"
971,EL,"On Nov. 17, it announced plans for nonstop flights to 10 new destinations, including Tampa, Fla.; Baltimore/Washington, D.C.; and Oakland/San Francisco Bay, as well as seven locations in Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. The new flights will begin in the spring.

""We don't have wide-body planes, which add weight. We don't have a sales force. We don't have the kinds of things you need to have to win corporate accounts.""In addition, he says, Spirit puts more seats on its planes than competitors, which means that it has more potential customers for each flight, albeit those customers are squeezed in tighter.Most Profitable Airline?In a recent research note, Morgan Stanley analyst John Godyn said that during the second quarter, Spirit ranked the second most profitable airline in the world based on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (or restructuring) costs, or EBITDAR.Airline Weekly also cited Spirit as the second most profitable airline in the world for the 12 months ended June 30, based on operating profit as a percentage of operating revenue. The Panamanian Copa Holdings (CPA) was No. 1, while Las Vegas-based low-fare carrier Allegiant Travel (ALGT) ranked No. 3.Godyn reckons that Spirit can move to the front of the line based on his metric.""Following a strong 3Q result, we forecast SAVE generating about 36% EBITDAR margins in 2015 — a level likely to make it the most profitable airline in the world,"" he said.Spirit posted third-quarter earnings of $1.01 a share, up 28% from a year earlier and 3 cents above what analysts expected.Revenue for the quarter climbed 14% year over year to $519.8 million, slightly below estimates. Revenue per available seat mile declined 0.8% to 12.45 cents as the company's load factor fell to 87.6% from 89.1% a year earlier.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect full-year earnings to rise 34% in 2014 and another 38% in 2015. Spirit shares moved to a record high above 84 on Friday, amid optimism about the effect of low oil prices on airline profits.Citigroup analyst Stephen Trent recently noted that he is ""optimistic"" about Spirit's ability to continue growing profits. He cited several factors, including the company's steady base of target customers as well as ""strong capacity growth and lower oil prices.""CEO Baldanza says that he expects Spirit's business model to become more prevalent in the airline industry. ""When somebody creates a better mousetrap, people copy it,"" he said.Baldanza points to Europe, where about 20% of travelers fly on carriers similar to Spirit, including Ireland's Ryanair Holdings (RYAAY). In contrast, Spirit carries just under 2% of the total U.S. air passenger traffic.""We don't see anybody doing what we are doing yet, though over time we expect they will,"" Baldanza said.Meanwhile, Spirit continues to expand its operations.On Nov. 17, it announced plans for nonstop flights to 10 new destinations, including Tampa, Fla.; Baltimore/Washington, D.C.; and Oakland/San Francisco Bay, as well as seven locations in Mexico, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. The new flights will begin in the spring.Spirit also recently boosted nonstop routes, saying it will soon have a total of ten from Denver and nine from Los Angeles, in addition to its other nonstop and connecting-flight routes.The company plans to add five more planes to its fleet by the end of the year and 15 more in 2015.

Skin, hair care, makeup and fragrance segments sales all advanced, year over year.The company's full-year sales rose 7.7% to $10.97 billion, topping views for $10.9 billion.Some retailers' sales orders were accelerated as part of a planned company strategic initiative. The cosmetics company also declared a quarterly dividend of 20 cents a share.""Our top-line growth was nearly double that of prestige beauty and was broad-based across regions, product categories and channels, despite slower industry growth in some key countries,"" said CEO Fabrizio Freda. ""Our emerging markets, makeup and luxury brands, and our online, freestanding store and travel retail channels led our growth.""Estee Lauder expects that new product launches and growth in other countries will boost sales in the upcoming fiscal year.

992,EL,"Illegal Immigration: Rep. Michele Bachmann warned that the immigrants about to be amnestied have high illiteracy rates and may vote. The left howled, but the reality is she understated it. The hard data tell the story.Commenting on President Obama's amnesty of 5 million illegals, the Minnesota Republican told reporters at the Capitol, ""The social cost will be profound on the U.S. taxpayer — millions of unskilled, illiterate, foreign nationals coming to the United States who can't speak the English language.""She added that many will vote illegally, too.An outraged, politically correct reporter from the Washington Post then asked Bachmann just what she meant by ""illiterate,"" according to a report in Politico.Bachmann cited the firsthand information she had gathered from U.S. citizens on the front lines of the immigration surge and those inside Latin American countries she's visited, in what was a heck of a lot more homework than the reporters would ever do.She was on hard factual ground: According to the CIA World Factbook, illiteracy in Guatemala, a top supplier of illegals, stands at 24.1%. In El Salvador it's 15.5%, in Honduras it's 14.9% and in Mexico 6.5%.As a corollary indicator, note that these countries' governments spend very little on their nationals' education as a percent of their GDP. In Guatemala it's 3%, El Salvador 3.4%, and Mexico 5.1%.Don't imagine those are the only ills that plague these amnesty beneficiary nations.Latin America is also tops globally in teen pregnancy, with some 30% of teenagers age 15 to 19 pregnant, the majority ""underprivileged"" and without husbands, ""which fosters the reproduction of poverty,"" according to a study by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) released just last week.And speaking of poverty, ECLAC points out that 45.3% of El Salvadorans live in poverty, as do 37.1% of Mexicans (see chart).As for the ability to speak English, Bachmann is particularly accurate: Central Americans, despite the long exposure of their illegals to the U.S., have the lowest English proficiency in the entire hemisphere.According to the Swiss think tank EF's 2013 English Proficiency Index of 63 countries, which it sees as a measure of global competitiveness, Guatemala and El Salvador ranked in the lowest quartile at 51 and 53 respectively (with no other Latin country ranking lower than El Salvador). Mexico came in at a still-substandard 39.When it comes to competitiveness, cultural attitudes matter. The countries of the nationals to be amnestied have the greatest hostility anywhere on earth toward free markets, according to a new Pew Survey.Sixty-nine percent of Salvadorans told Pew that they opposed free markets, along with 44% of Mexicans (compared with 43% who supported them). Guatemala and Honduras were not ranked.All of this isn't to say that Latin America's poor cannot assimilate, learn English, get educated or rise above their negative attitudes once they get here — some can. But it's a long learning curve, costly for U.S. taxpayers.What's more, compared to bringing in more skilled people from wherever who have a good chance of assimilating into the U.S. with no help, it's a bad policy.But Obama insists on legalizing those who are poorest, least educated and least able to assimilate — not because it's good for America but to win Latino votes.It's a great, if cynical, political deal for him in his bid to seem still relevant — and an atrocious policy for the U.S.

1004,EL,"Terror: Two Palestinians with axes massacred four rabbis Tuesday as they prayed at a Jerusalem synagogue, and fellow Palestinians threw candy and danced with glee. Don't tell us that it has nothing to do with Islam.Violating the sacred space of one of the world's founding religions, the two cousins used guns, meat cleavers and axes in a barbaric rampage that left a floor full of bloody torahs, religious clothing, and dead bodies. The victims included a prominent and beloved rabbi along with three others, all dual U.S. or British Israeli citizens. A policeman was also murdered, and eight others were wounded.""This is roughly comparable to terrorists invading a cathedral and killing a Cardinal among other clergy,"" wrote David P. Goldman, known as Spengler, on his Facebook page in a note to Christian friends. ""Of course, we do not have a hierarchy in the Catholic sense, but Rabbi Moshe Twersky H'yd, a grandson of Rav Joseph Dov Soloveitchik, was one of our sages. Our grief and outrage are past description.""It was clearly the sort of attack that shocks the conscience, comparable to the 1170 murder of Archbishop Thomas Becket in Canterbury Cathedral or maybe the 1980 killing of El Salvador Archbishop Oscar Romero.The response from the White House, however, was pure boilerplate, attributing the savagery to ""tensions"" between Israelis and Palestinians and equating it to every act of force instead of acknowledging it for the new low in terrorism it really was.""I strongly condemn today's terrorist attack at a synagogue in Jerusalem, which killed four innocent people, including U.S. citizens Aryeh Kupinsky, Cary William Levine and Mosheh Twersky, and injured several more,"" President Obama said in a statement.""At this sensitive moment in Jerusalem, it is all the more important for Israeli and Palestinian leaders and ordinary citizens to work cooperatively together to lower tensions, reject violence, and seek a path forward towards peace.""It was almost as if he was blaming the bloodied in the temple, peacefully worshipping their God, for the lack of any civilized activity by the terrorists.What's more, it comes on the heels of the White House's refusal to admit that any terrorist attacks in this day and age have a common denominator in radical Islam.An American Muslim convert, Abdul-Rahman Kassig, was beheaded in Syria last weekend, and Obama insisted the barbaric act had nothing to do with Islam.""ISIL's actions represented no faith, least of all the Muslim faith, which Abdul-Rahman adopted as his own,"" the White House statement read.It's a failure to recognize the blood on the ground in Jerusalem, spilled by extremists murdering in a religion's name. The place attacked, after all, was a synagogue, a religious institution. Its attackers bellowed ""Allahu Akbar"" during their unprovoked attack.After Israeli cops shot the attackers dead, Palestinians erupted in celebration, dancing in the streets and flinging candy among themselves, smiling, laughing and singing — proud of their ""martyrs,"" who, in their minds, had made it to heaven.If that has nothing to do with religion, what does?The viciousness of the attack leaves no people of faith safe and calls for renewed thinking about a harder response to stop this barbarism. It will only succeed once the Islamic nature of the problem is confronted.

1006,EL,"When nobody gave him a chance, Nolan Richardson grabbed one.First, there was Western Texas College — a junior college in tiny Snyder, Texas.When Richardson helmed the men's basketball team there in 1978, he was the lone black head coach amid 50 junior colleges in the Lone Star State.Two years later, his Westerners shot to a 37-0 record and the national junior college title.In 1980, Richardson bounced to the University of Tulsa, a school coming off a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference.The Golden Hurricane promptly stormed to 26 wins, with Richardson becoming the first black coach to win the National Invitation Tournament championship.More ground-breaking came in 1985, when Arkansas made Richardson the first black head coach at a major university in the South.It all culminated in 1994 with an NCAA title for the Razorbacks.""One of the great feelings,"" Richardson, 72, told IBD. ""It was amazing. All my work paid off my way, and that was the reward.""Texas StartStarting from the bottom and hitting the top was Richardson's forte, but there wasn't much to celebrate while growing up in the grim El Segundo Barrio section of segregated El Paso, Texas, in the 1940s.""There was a black side of town, but I lived in the Mexican side of town,"" said Richardson. ""We were the only black family in the neighborhood.""Richardson coexisted well — the kids in his neighborhood even taught him Spanish, in which he is fluent today — but other influences made for a rough start.Richardson's mother died when he was 3. With his alcoholic father in and out of his life, Grandma Rose stepped in to lend a hand — taking in Nolan and his two sisters.Richardson was a budding athlete in the 1950s, and Rose scored with lessons of another sporting pioneer of the era to keep her grandson on the straight and narrow.""She called it mother wits,"" said Richardson, ""teaching me about attitude, and that a bad attitude results in bad things happening. She was a big Jackie Robinson fan, and she would talk about him breaking down barriers because of his attitude. She made me believe that I could fit into that mold.""Richardson put the beliefs into play to stand out.As a baseball star — and the first black student — at Bowie High School, Richardson was prohibited from staying at the team hotel during an away tournament in Abilene because of his skin color.While he wanted to brood, Rose's principles forced Nolan to play. He wound up dominating as the best player on the field.Richardson loved the diamond, but basketball was his rock.And he learned from a gem.Richardson stayed local to play ball for Texas Western College — now the University of Texas at El Paso — and spent his last two years balling under future Hall of Fame coach Don Haskins.The forward left his collegiate career without any hardware, but armed with knowledge from his coach that would come in handy.""He taught me that hard work and discipline pay off,"" said Richardson. ""He gave me the attitude that you played for one another and that you bring that attitude to practice every day.""While Haskins' daily grind dictated a slow and arduous style of play, his pupil flipped the script and took a new approach to the game as a coach.""I took what was taught to me and expanded it,"" said Richardson. ""I wanted to change the game to give me the advantage.""The benefit showed in the results. Richardson's method involved his offense pushing the ball up the floor while his defense trapped, pressed and generally harassed the opponent all game.A nickname — 40 Minutes of Hell — for this frenetic, full-court attacking style was born during his years at Arkansas, but he rode the system to titles at every level.Richardson leapt obstacles, according to Rus Bradburd, who wrote ""Forty Minutes of Hell: The Extraordinary Life of Nolan Richardson.""""Getting 12 teenagers on the same page was tough, a real challenge,"" the author said. ""Nolan realized that X's and O's would only get you so far, but getting a team to play together and be loyal was the key to leadership.""In his 22 seasons coaching NCAA Division I basketball, Richardson guided those teams to the postseason in 20 of them.On TopThe peak came 20 years ago this past April. Duke — which had already won two titles in the '90s — was the opponent, and Arkansas willed its way to a win in vintage Richardson style.Trailing by 10 points early in the second half, the Razorbacks caused turnovers and nailed key shots to shave the gap and break a tie on a three-pointer by guard Scotty Thurman with 50 seconds left.It wrapped with a 76-72 victory for Arkansas' first national basketball championship.In addition to the 1994 title, Richardson's Razorbacks made the Final Four in 1990 and 1995.When he left Fayetteville after the 2002 season, Richardson did so with a record of 509-207, good for a .711 winning percentage.Toward the end, he stood his ground against what he saw to be a corrupt athletic administration at the University of Arkansas. The protest led to the buying out of his contract, and his lawsuit against the university two years later was dismissed, but he went out standing up for what he believed in.""There's got to be some of us that are going to fight,"" said Richardson, who went on to coach internationally and with the Women's National Basketball Association's Tulsa Shock. ""If you aren't going to stand up and fight, then what is the purpose of living? My grandmother said, 'You're gonna have to take some of those arrow shots to allow others an opportunity moving forward.'

I was happy to have that pressure.""Since he left Arkansas, the Razorbacks have reached the NCAA tournament just three times in 12 years.No NolanCollege basketball has been saddled with the loss of a titan, said Bradburd, who teaches English at New Mexico State University: ""If you want to understand Nolan Richardson's impact in college basketball, just look at college football. We're still waiting for a Nolan Richardson there — someone who will win big and stand up for people of color in leadership positions.""Richardson towers for charitable causes. Since his daughter, Yvonne, died of leukemia at age 15, the former coach has helped usher over a million dollars toward organizations in her memory.Richardson also lost a son, Nolan III, in 2012, and a golf tournament is held each year in El Paso to raise money in his children's memories.Richardson's wife, Rosario, has been by Nolan's side through the ups and downs — going back to the days coaching at Western Texas.""Every weekend, she would cook for and feed the 17 kids on the team in the cafeteria — that's how dedicated she was,"" Richardson said of his wife of 39 years. ""She didn't have to do that, but that's the way she's always been. No matter what I did, she was right there beside me.""Now Richardson will stand beside the greats of his sport forever. In August, he entered the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, which he called ""a personal award, something my family will enjoy forever. It's the ultimate goal of any coach or athlete — as high as you can go. I've been very fortunate, and there's no bigger award.""Bradburd went a step further with Richardson — who was elected to the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 — when describing the coach's feats.""He is along the same lines as Jackie Robinson, Billie Jean King and Muhammad Ali — an outspoken leader who would tell the truth regardless of the consequences,"" said Bradburd. ""That puts him in the category of a historical figure, not only a sports figure. Nolan Richardson had a huge impact because of his fearlessness.""

1008,EL,"Border: President Obama argues his immigration enforcement policy focuses on felons, not families. Now that a San Francisco woman has been killed by a five-time deported illegal, that hardly seems believable.The coverage of the brazen, daylight shooting of 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle as she strolled with her father on San Francisco's touristy Pier 14 near the Bay Bridge last Friday started strangely, with TV reporters getting robbed of their cameras.The story got stranger. Steinle's killer was not ""a Texas man"" as first reported, but a politically inconvenient illegal alien with seven felonies on his record and five deportations to Mexico. Not two. Not three. Five.Immigration and Customs Enforcement had asked to deport him a sixth time after his release from jail last April through an immigration detainer, something done only for the very worst under federal policy.But San Francisco's 1989 ""sanctuary city"" law thwarted that. The sheriff's office later said it would have nabbed him if ICE had issued a warrant. Really?Fact is, many city, state and federal officials' hands are stained with blood. An unguarded border that lets in any felon, terrorist or killer — multiple times, as Sanchez showed — is a crisis, with law-abiding citizens such as Steinle paying the price.Problem one is the White House, which won't enforce immigration laws. As tens of thousands of Central Americans, including children, cross our border to join illegals that number at least 11 million, the administration refuses to deport them.Bowing to the open border lobby and vote-hungry Democrats, the White House pretends to focus on ""felons, not families."" The Steinle murder by illegal alien Francisco Sanchez puts the lie to that.Nobody worries about deportation these days. The Obama administration favors illegals, using executive orders to protect them. In 2014, Obama ordered the Department of Homeland Security to release 30,558 illegals with criminal records onto U.S. streets, after releasing 36,007 illegals in 2013.And in the past three years, these same illegals murdered 131 Americans, not counting Steinle or the El Paso woman murdered by an illegal with a hammer last weekend. How big a problem is the illegal crime wave? A 2011 Government Accountability Office report says some 300,000 inmates of federal prisons are illegals.At the state level, California Gov. Jerry Brown is complicit, too. Besides telling illegals ""you're all welcome here"" — a quarter of the nation's illegals now call California home — Brown signed off on the 2013 ""Trust Act,"" which makes it almost impossible for federal lawmen to deport illegals after they've served time for crimes.There's the city of San Francisco. Sanchez admitted to a TV reporter Monday that its 1989 sanctuary law is why he committed his crime there. He knew that whatever he did, he'd face no deportation threat.Why are American officials doing this?At the federal and state levels, it's a hunt for Democratic votes. At the city level, it's a hunt for federal funds to finance activist groups and nongovernment organizations that ""serve"" illegals and convicts. In San Francisco, for instance, glossy social service offices sit near prime tourist areas, such as where Steinle was killed.All these government actors have blood on their hands for coddling criminal illegals. Yet debate about illegals is silenced, and any talk about their breaking of more laws than other citizens, as author Ann Coulter has pointed out, is a good way to become a pariah. Just ask Donald Trump — who just happens to be rising in the polls for saying things other candidates won't.Killings such as Steinle's point to a refusal to enforce the law in order to appease left-wing special interests. Now the Obama administration blames Republicans for not passing ""comprehensive immigration reform,"" as if giving Sanchez amnesty would have prevented Steinle's murder.The administration is also trying to make it a gun-control issue, rather than an open-border issue. Will the White House ever make good on its promise to enforce the law on criminal illegals, something it demanded in exchange for ignoring noncriminal illegals? Not likely.

1023,EL,"Leadership: California has a major water crisis the way 1990s New York once had an urban blight crisis. But don't look for a Rudy Giuliani to the rescue. The state's governor, Jerry Brown, has morphed into a full-blown space cadet.In most parts of the world, when a leader starts talking wildly as a crisis builds — think Ecuador during the presidency of Abdala ""El Loco"" Bucaram or Russia during the heyday of ex-communist parliamentarian Vladimir Zhirinovsky — attention focuses on the lunacy coming from the top.Not so in California, where the increasingly silly statements of Gov. Brown amid a major man-made water crisis are thought of as nothing more than ""fascinating,"" as the Los Angeles Times puts it, even if a little ""maddening"" at the same time.The freakish reality is that as California sinks into crisis, it's being led by a space cadet, Governor Moonbeam himself, as if a mask of respectability had suddenly been ripped from the face of a dormant political hack to reveal the New Age looney he's been all along.Instead of displaying sharp-minded leadership, Brown waxed soulfully about the philosophical implications of water when asked about the crisis at a University of Southern California conference on Tuesday.""You said water is a commodity,"" he said. ""Some people call water a right, some people call water the essence of life. Water is more than H2O. Water is baptism. Water is a poetry. Water has an iconic role in human history and the human condition, so how we play with water — it's not like a widget.""We're not making this up. He really said that in a conversation with the publisher of the Times.Rather than blame the water crisis on his own failures to construct water-storage facilities to ensure that water from wet years is saved for dry years, or present new technological possibilities for long-term solutions, Brown said the crisis was all about global warming.""This goes to the very foundation of what it means to be human in a world of living things ,"" he said. ""The heat-trapping gases that our society generates are creating alterations in the fundamentals of our whole atmosphere. We may have already passed a tipping point.""The governor obviously doesn't see the water shortage as a problem he was hired to fix. It's really a matter of ""overpopulation,"" he said, ignoring how he invited illegal immigrants to call his state home. ""You're all welcome here,"" he told them last year.He also reverted to the ""small is beautiful"" philosophy last preached during his wretched first term as governor in the 1970s. Californians will have to find a ""more elegant"" way of using and reusing water, he told the USC crowd, not mentioning that the last idea that came from his office was recycling urine.""The metaphor is spaceship Earth,"" he explained. ""In a spaceship you reuse everything.""With Brown and others of his ilk, it's always the people who are at fault, not the incompetence and irresponsibility of their leaders. Which explains why his only significant ideas for solving the crisis are punitive rather than systemic: fining water-wasters, monitoring shower times and urging neighbors to squeal on neighbors.""If the crisis continues and gets bad, more drastic things will be done,"" Brown warned. What a shame for a once-dynamic state that deserves so much better.

1037,EL,"Politics: Is winning new Democratic voters worth the sickening and even death of children? A new report provides evidence that illegals are spreading enterovirus as a result of Obama's open-borders policy.If so, it's one of the worst derelictions of duty yet by a White House that's permitted lives to be sacrificed — from Benghazi to the Fast and Furious scandal — for political ends.Late Friday, the Daily Caller assembled a long report showing genetic and statistical evidence that links a sudden upsurge in the deadly Enterovirus D68 with its polio-like symptoms to the flood of tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors through our unguarded southern border this year.Enterovirus-D68 has hit thousands of American children across the country, hospitalizing dozens and killing at least five, in the sharpest upsurge of the virus in years.The Daily Caller found it was mostly due to a single strain, called a ""clave,"" that quickly spread across a wide area. It suggests an abrupt mixing of populations, rather than a disease spreading from a single source.And the one place that has seen an upsurge in diseases this year is Central America, where yellow fever, dengue fever and tuberculosis are tens to hundreds of times more rampant than they are in the U.S. Enterovirus is another disease well known there.Journalist Sharyl Attkisson, citing a study from Virology, noted that researchers ""found EV-D68 among some of the 3,375 young, ill people tested in eight Latin American countries, including the Central American nations of El Salvador and Nicaragua, in 2013."" The article noted that even people who aren't ill may be carriers.There's also the timing of the disease in August, coinciding with a surge of illegals — including 88,000 minors, accompanied and unaccompanied, who were sent around the country, supposedly to relatives, often against the wishes of the local communities.Attkisson said the disease first appeared in Chicago and Kansas City, both known to have been destinations for unaccompanied minors and illegals traveling in family units.Meanwhile, in the White House, former La Raza operative Celia Munoz sets Obama's domestic policy, while down in San Salvador former La Raza operative Mari Carmen Aponte leads the U.S. Embassy in El Salvador.Given the known beliefs of these key policymakers, can there be any doubt the White House is in thrall to the open-borders policy of a group that effectively has promised thousands of new Latino votes for Democrats in exchange for open migration from the south?With that in mind, it's no surprise that thousands of illegals have been allowed into the U.S., supposedly to await immigration hearings, with no health care screening. That it's been allowed to happen isn't only only dereliction of duty, it's a failure to protect the people our president is sworn to protect — Americans.It's time to ask the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to find out where this new, potentially deadly disease is coming from — and let the rest of us know just how much this White House believes the ends justify the means.

Can you see Alexis Tsipras pulling off a karaoke version as he sings about Angie? ""She's into superstitions, Black Cats and Voodoo Dolls....I feel a premonition, That girl's going to make me fall, She's into new sensation.....she'll make 'me' take my clothes off and go dancing in the rain....She'll make 'me' live her crazy life, But she'll take away 'my' pain - Like a bullet to 'my' brain"".....And that is about what Angie has done- or at least that is what global investors 'think' she has done....Global markets exploded to the upside yesterday (I mean after eight straight down days - percentages alone called for a change in direction, never mind that technicals were screaming 'oversold').....Tech and financials taking the lead....after word has it that Angie had 'successfully' dragged Lexy to the table.....Every sector shot higher - some was clearly short covering as those betting against any kind of settlement were taken by surprise - forcing them to reverse their negative bet and run for cover.....add in the bargain hunters who like sharks - 'smelled blood in water'.... and the rest was history.....All this on top of the continued global rout in bond markets - action that suggests that investors have had a change of heart.....Suddenly - they all think that economies around the world are set to take off and slightly higher rates are not the devil that they have been made out to be......The WSJ leads with this headline:""Brighter Economy Speeds Flight from Bonds - Selloff sends yields in U.S., Germany & Japan to 2015 highs as investors move away from the safety of debt""The article goes onto say that - ""Among the biggest drivers of the move in bonds has been a reassessment of the perceived health of the broader economy. In recent weeks, data from the U.S. and Europe have indicated the economies there are stronger than previously thought......In addition, investors see the Fed as increasingly likely to raise interest rates this year, perhaps as early as September - another signal for traders to sell"" (Sell bonds that is.....)But wait - higher rates have always caused traders to throw a temper tantrum sending equity markets lower - why was it different yesterday? Why are potentially higher rates not causing investors to sell stocks? First - as I have been saying - we are nowhere NEAR higher rates at all......(Higher rates defined as +6%) - traders and investors are warming to the idea that 'normalization' is not only necessary, but good for the psyche (normalization would take rates back to the 4% - 5% range - and we have a long time to go BEFORE we get anywhere near the normalization range) ..... the angst that the markets have been under has really been the broader geo-political uncertainty that has surrounded the investment thesis....Uncertainty breeds skittishness and more conservative allocations....lift the veil of uncertainty and BOOM! The market has been screaming for some kind of clarity....and as discussed - once it gets it (or thinks it gets it) - then it can refocus on the fundamentals...allowing investors and traders to re-price the risk.Look - this Greek tragedy is FAR from over....As noted the other day - Greece debt is 180% of GDP - unless there is some massive forgiveness of debt or the Greek economy all of a sudden is the MVP of Europe - it is hard to see how they could ever repay the debt - so in the end a 'Grexit' may be the only option - but Angie and Frankie are not ready to pull the trigger on that option.....Watching Lexy 'dance in the rain' is a bit entertaining.....This morning we are seeing global markets all surging higher.....Asian markets were the first to react to the US surge.....Japan + 1.68%, Hong Kong + 0.83%, China +0.30% and ASX +1.42%.....

"
1092,EL,"Border: Recent busts of murderous MS-13 gangsters put the lie to President Obama's sympathetic amnesty narrative of illegal immigrants as ""workers who mow our lawns, make our beds (and) clean out bedpans.""Authorities Wednesday rounded up 37 MS-13 gang members in Charlotte, N.C., on racketeering conspiracy charges, along with charges of murder, attempted murder and firearms violations. All of them are illegal aliens from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Several are round-trippers — illegals who broke in once, committed crimes, got deported and broke back into the U.S. — proving that our border is porous and unsecured.Charlotte police discovered the rat's nest of foreign gangsters after some of them started shooting up local nightclubs and bars.Reading the indictment, much of the money these immigrant hoods raise from illegal gang activity is wired back to El Salvador to arrange for even more gangsters to come across the border.The funds are wired back to Central America through remittances that Obama has made cheaper and easier for illegals to send through new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau rules on banks.""The alleged MS-13 gang members have committed numerous violent crimes, including armed robberies, assaults, and murders, for the benefit of the criminal enterprise,"" prosecutors said in a statement.The catalog of their alleged crimes runs 17 pages in the indictment. Several pages list suspected gang members charged with ""illegal re-entry by an aggravated felon,"" or entering the U.S. illegally after they had already been deported.It's not immediately clear if any of the suspects had been given amnesty under Obama's DACA executive order for younger illegal immigrants.But the busts come on the heels of the deferred deportation the Obama administration granted to vicious Charlotte gangster Emmanuel Jesus Rangel-Hernandez.Rangel-Hernandez, 19, was placed in the removal process in March 2012, following drug charges, but was shielded from removal by the administration even though it knew of his gang membership. He is now charged with the murders of four Charlotte residents, including former ""America's Next Top Model"" contestant Mirjana Puhar.Meanwhile, authorities busted a reputed MS-13 gang member wanted for execution-style murders in New York. Police in Atlanta on Tuesday arrested 22-year-old Arnolvin Umanzor Velasquez, charging him and two co-defendants — Edwin Acosta-Martinez and Sergio Cerna — with three murders, four attempted murders and multiple racketeering offenses.All three suspects were members of MS-13.These same illegal immigrant thugs are terrorizing Los Angeles, Chicago and even the nation's capital. Hundreds have been arrested in Los Angeles within the last two years. MS-13 originated in Los Angeles and has spread to states across the country.There are more than 6,000 already in the U.S. illegally, and dozens more are coming across the border daily. And though they routinely commit crimes, immigration officers don't kick them out of the country. That's because our president has told ICE to stand down.Arrests of immigrant gang members under Obama peaked in 2012, then dropped by more than 25% in 2013 and continued to decline in 2014, according to arrest records released by ICE in response to a Center for Immigration Studies FOIA request.Clearly, even violent gang members are not a high priority for enforcement. These are the beneficiaries of Obama's executive amnesty program.Obama makes it seem as if all illegals in the U.S. are hard-working and honest laborers seeking a better life, when in fact many of them are murderous thugs who are building a criminal network spanning both coasts.His rationale for granting them amnesty is a terrible falsehood and a threat to homeland security.

1093,EL,"Elections: The National Council of La Raza is promoting no-identification voting states to its followers. Might that have something to do with its advocacy of illegal immigration and the Democrats' flagging electoral fortunes?La Raza, as it's known, is no ordinary nongovernmental organization in the ""anti-poverty"" racket. A group of lawyers and activists, it has long functioned as the illegal alien lobby in the U.S., advocating aggressively for the cause of open borders.For its latest stunt, it has published on its website and social media a list of voting stations that don't require IDs. Interesting, given a recent Harvard study showing that illegal immigrants have almost certainly swung close elections in recent years by canceling out U.S. citizens' votes to ensure Democrat victories.With Democrats trailing in the polls, it's reasonable to conclude they're seeking to swing another through the illegal alien vote on Tuesday.And don't think they wouldn't try.La Raza's tentacles already reach deep into the White House. President Obama's key domestic policy adviser, Celia Munoz, as well as Mari Carmen Aponte, ambassador to El Salvador, a springboard of the recent border surge, are former La Raza leaders.More to the point, La Raza has unusual power from its role as a key conduit for federal ""anti-poverty"" funding.In Los Angeles alone, black groups complained bitterly to the Los Angeles Times last spring about how $30 million in federal ""anti-poverty"" cash is being directed through a La Raza-linked group called the Youth Policy Institute to ""promise zones"" in neighborhoods dominated by illegals. The group's director is a major Obama bundler.So with Democratic fortunes fading on the eve of this year's midterms, it's more than a little unnerving to see La Raza pushing no-ID stations to its constituents.The La Raza people say it's because Republicans would suppress their votes. But the real risk is of illegals swinging elections. There's nothing legal about effectively disenfranchising citizens in their own country by encouraging illegals to cancel out their votes.

1106,EL,"Online Retailer Wayfair Leads List Of 6 IPOs Thursday.The top-performing IPO in the third quarter was a dark horse, but with powerful legs.The ReWalk Robotics (RWLK) IPO seemed like it would be an underachiever, but one with a good story. The company makes exoskeletons that enable paraplegics to walk. It priced at 12, below its estimated range of 14 to 16, and opened at 12, suggesting modest enthusiasm.But ReWalk bolted 113% on its first trading day, the quarter's only IPO to double on day one. From its Sept. 12 IPO through Sept. 30 ReWalk rose 184%. And ReWalk stock was up 1% in early trading in the stock market today, near 32.The No. 2 performer was El Pollo Loco (LOCO), a Tex-Mex fast food chain with 401 locations mostly in California. It priced its July 25 IPO at 15, the high end of its range and rose 60% on day one. It closed the quarter at 35.91, up 139% from its IPO price. Its second-place rating came even though the company got a raft of mostly negative ratings in mid-August, after its quiet period expired. El Pollo Loco stock is edging higher early Friday, just above 35.Third place went to Mobileye (MBLY), the maker of advanced automobile driver assistance technology. Mobileye priced at 25, above the high end of its upwardly revised range of 21 to 23, and rose 48% in its debut. The company raised $890 million, making it the largest pure-tech IPO this year. Mobileye ended the quarter at 53.59, up 114%, and was trading near 58 early Friday, up 5%.Mobileye names Tesla Motors (TSLA) as a customer, though no announcement has been made about Tesla using Mobileye technology. Tesla CEO Elon Musk this week said auto-assisted driving technology would be coming on Tesla models next year. Musk hinted in a Thursday tweet of a big Tesla announcement on Oct. 9, which some people speculated could be driver-assisted related.The No. 4 IPO in Q3 was Avalanche Biotechnologies (AAVL), a clinical stage developer of therapies for eye-threatening disorders.Avalanche priced at 17, the high end of its upwardly revised 16 to 17 range, and jumped 65% on its July 31 IPO.

1118,EL,"Chipotle Mexican Grill's stock is near all-time highs, but Wall Street still underestimates — and underappreciates — the company when it comes to margin potential and boosting traffic, says Oppenheimer analyst Brian Bitter.Bitter raised his price target on Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) to 775 from 700 and reiterated an outperform rating in a research report published Wednesday.Shares dipped 0.3% on the stock market today.The fast-casual powerhouse should be able to hit margins of 30% or higher, according to Bitter, as the full effect of price hikes takes hold.Chipotle rapidly responded to escalating commodity pressure by raising prices in April by an average of 5%-6%, with beef getting hit by the most aggressive increases. Despite the hikes, customer traffic remained strong.But the Wall Street consensus assumes that Chipotle's margins will stay under 29% ""in perpetuity"" with per-store traffic decelerating in the first half of 2015 due to tough prior-year comps, Bitter notes.""We believe this underappreciates current business momentum, secular shifts within CMG's base, future traffic levers and management's ability to execute during a time when demand is surging,"" he said in the note.Bitter raised his '14 EPS expectation by 11 cents to $13.98 on better margins, while Wall Street sees $13.66. His '15 EPS projection was raised by $1.40-$18.80 vs. the consensus expectation for $17.35.Chipotle has an IBD Composite Rating of 98 out of 99, which means that its shares outperform the vast majority of the market as measured by both technical and fundamental factors.The Mexican food chain also holds the top spot within the Retail-Restaurants group, which is ranked No. 93 out of the 197 industries that IBD tracks.Competitor El Pollo Loco (LOCO), a recent IPO, has an IBD Composite Rating of 79 and is ranked No. 13 in the group.El Pollo Loco reported quarterly earnings in line with views and beat revenue expectations last week.

1128,EL,"Immigration: The IDB reports a record-high $65 billion in remittances to Latin America in 2014. It's a lagging indicator of the border surge. But it's a leading indicator for how Latin states fail to make their nations livable.Based on the chirpy tone of the Inter-American Development Bank's latest report, you'd think that the record-high $65.4 billion in remittances received in Latin America and the Caribbean this year, the bulk of which went to Mexico and Central America, were a good thing. Words like ""recovery,"" ""significant growth"" and ""improved"" were prominent.The word to describe what these cash-sendings from immigrants really mean was left out: misery. People leave for a foreign land because the socialist conditions are so intolerable back home.The facts tell the story: Remittances to Mexico rose 8% from a year earlier and 7.4% to Central America. Mexico hauled in $24 billion in 2014, a third of the total for all of Latin America. Guatemala took in $5.5 billion, up 8.6%; El Salvador gained $4.2 billion, up 6.7%; and Honduras received $3.35 billion, an 8.8% spike. IDB forecasts further gains this year.It may well be a result of last year's border surge, which the Obama administration encouraged and which led to tens of thousands of Central American illegals flooding into the U.S. IDB estimates that as of December 2014, 21.8 million Latin American migrants were in the U.S., a 6.3% rise over 2013.IDB data suggest that those coming are overwhelmingly illegals. Just 45.1% of Mexican migrants never completed high school, and only 25% had high-school diplomas. Among Central Americans, the figures are 57.9% and 24.3%, respectively. Large majorities of both groups came from single-parent families — the Central Americans in particular.That's a picture of the U.S. importing both the poverty and dependency that come with illegal immigration.Of course, the Obama administration wants to beef up its Democratic voter base. But the Latin American states that economically benefit from these remittances get their cynical prize, too — a way of defusing potentially explosive social pressures.It lets local Latin American leaders devalue their local currencies and ignore inflation. As long as the remittances flow, they won't need to make badly needed free-market reforms.This is the deep cynicism of those who pretend to care about illegal immigrants but benefit from their misery.

1171,EL,"Politics: President Obama has declared 4,000 illegal immigrant minors ""refugees"" and given them the right to stay in the U.S. Why just 4,000 and not all of them? Well, it might just be that the lucky 4,000 are tied to people who can vote.As some 66,000 illegal minors, along with 240,000 larger family groups, stream across our border confident the White House won't send them back, President Obama abruptly announced a de facto amnesty for 4,000 Central American children.He is allowing them to apply for refugee status in their home countries of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala without the cost of the illegal journey north.This smacks of special-interest politics, a little perk for the Latino immigration lobby, considering that the refugee status will be offered only to those whose parents are already in the country legally.In other words, the benefit will be only for those most likely to vote, not those most likely in need of relief — a fundamental abuse of a system that should be reserved for real refugees.Why just children? Why not whole families, who are also coming across, or adults, or old people, all of whom could be in precisely the same straits as the children in Central America's crime-ridden democracies?Part of the reason is that the president has been hampered by legal quotas, with just 4,000 of the 70,000 refugee slots available allowed for the entire hemisphere. But the fact that he's apparently offering all 4,000 to Central Americans suggests that genuine refugees — and they are around, in Venezuela, Ecuador and Argentina — won't get them.The U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act defines a refugee as someone unable or unwilling to return to his or her country or seek its protection, based on a well-founded fear of persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. It also specifically excludes those who do the persecuting.Not one of these criteria fits the 4,000 Central Americans suddenly getting a free ride to the U.S., plus education funding, loans, job training, English lessons and cash assistance — perhaps all the way to the age of 18.The fact of the matter is that these ""refugees"" come from OAS-certified democracies where repression of dissent is nothing compared to the brutalities found in communist hellholes such as Venezuela and Cuba. The fact they are crime-ridden is a function of their own bad taste in leaders.El Salvador's democratically elected government of former communist guerrillas is known to have ties with Colombian FARC terrorists who are ground zero for drug crime in the hemisphere. And their leftist agenda ensures a low-growth economy that also breeds crime. Refugee is hardly the word for them.The U.S. seems to have pretty warm relations with these countries . Just 10 days ago, President Obama handed El Salvador $270 million in development aid, apparently waiving the requirements that the country take stronger measures against the money-laundering that had been holding up the funds.That's not the kind of cash one hands out to nations that produce real refugees.As for the no-persecutors clause, which presumably includes criminal gangs, it's worth noting that 80% of the Central American illegal minors coming across are young men of prime gang recruiting age. Now they'll get refugee status. Lucky us.How can this move by Obama be anything other than a sop to an open-borders lobby. It is seething at the president's inability to grant amnesty due to massive public opposition to a tide of illegal immigrants threatening to cost his party in the mid-term election.A new Rasmussen poll shows 68% of likely voters say illegals should not have the same rights as U.S. citizens and that 71% oppose benefits for them. With his hands tied, all Obama can do is hand out a new kind of political pork that subverts the meaning of the refugee law.

1174,EL,"Border Surge: Secretary of State John Kerry warns of a new surge of illegals, just as Central America is being hit by a new wave of epidemics. No doubt about it: President Obama's open-borders policy is exposing us to disease, too.In a background press briefing at the U.N. last Tuesday, a senior State Department official said Secretary of State John Kerry told his counterparts from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico that the pause in minors coming across our southern border was temporary, and that ""we have to use this time to put in place more efforts, greater efforts to get at the root cause of this, because we know that those numbers may rise again.""The next wave may be worse than the first, however, because monsoon conditions, a harsh drought and the globalization of transport are ensuring that the 50,000 or so unscreened new entrants will be bringing a raft of new diseases with them.Though little reported, the Caribbean is on high alert for the spread of chikungunya, known as ""the virus of pain."" Its Tanzanian-origin Bantu name means ""to contort,"" describing the agony it leaves in joints for years.Some 183,000 cases were detected in the region this year as it spreads from the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue and yellow fever. Central America, according to a report in El Pais, is the epicenter. Puerto Rico has reported 2,000 cases and three deaths.But the disease has worked its way up to the U.S.; Texas and Florida reported victims who have already contracted it without traveling to the affected regions.As IBD reported last week, there's also a monster dengue fever epidemic raging through Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala right now, with 120,000 cases, 60 deaths and public health emergencies declared in those countries, also a result of the rainy season.Don't forget older diseases, either. There's tuberculosis, which has infection rates in Central America roughly 10 times that of the U.S. According to the World Health Organization's 2013 annual report, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras reported 8,509 cases in the three countries, which have a combined population of about 29.2 million. The U.S., by contrast, reported 9,945 cases from a population of 318 million.WHO reports the prevalence of TB at 34 cases per 100,000 in El Salvador, 110 cases per 100,000 in Guatemala and 82 cases per 100,000 in Honduras. The U.S. has 4.7 cases per 100,000.Then there's the mysterious hemorrhagic fever hitting Venezuela's Aragua state that has yet to be given a proper name and has killed at least nine people there. Venezuela is right on the same disease vector as the Caribbean and its health care system is in collapse.There is also a new virus known as Enterovirus D68 that is spreading among children across the U.S. It, too, has been known to afflict Central America in the past.All of this raises the possibility that in throwing open our border for political purposes, the U.S. is exposing itself to a host of nasty diseases and epidemics.Dr. Jane Orient, Executive Director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told radio host Laura Ingraham last week the Obama administration has been ""real tight-lipped"" about EV-D68's origins.""We don't know where it's coming from ... are there immigrants from Central America, where this disease has allegedly been prevalent before? Should we be (studying) the virus to see whether it's like what's been found in some of these countries that are just sending waves of children across our border and they haven't been quarantined long enough to make sure they're not sick?"" she asked.It's plain what's bringing up this great wave of diseases: immigration politics.President Obama is so obsessed with winning Latino votes for Democrats by neglecting border laws that he's unwittingly opened the U.S. up to a variety of third-world diseases. He's released tens of thousands of medically unscreened illegal immigrants into the U.S., supposedly to prepare for their immigration hearings, which 70% never show up for.The epidemics are small now, but the risk is rising. And with a new wave of illegals in the pipeline, where's the will to stop this?

1238,EL,"Virginia Kennon is the rock who has lifted up her family's spirits in difficult times.Until this month, she worked 54-hour weeks caring for her sister with cerebral palsy and her ailing 85-year-old mother.For Kennon, this $8-an-hour job has been a labor of love, as it would be for no one else, and in that sense she is irreplaceable. But lately she's feared that she might have to be replaced.Kennon's employer in Deming, N.M., recently began notifying caregivers that it's capping their hours at 29 per week, just below the 30-hour threshold at which ObamaCare requires companies to make affordable coverage available to most full-time workers or else pay a fine.ObamaCare Vs. Home CareGovernment data suggest that home care workers have been hit especially hard amid new regulations. The average workweek clocked by nonsupervisors has sunk from 28 hours per week to a record-low 26.7 hours since the start of 2013.It's no coincidence that IBD's list of 450 employers who have systematically cut work hours to avoid ObamaCare employer mandate liability includes more than a few companies engaged in caring for the elderly and disabled.These are just examples that have been documented, but the real list is likely far, far longer: A group of assisted living centers in North Carolina; a Home Instead senior care franchise in Michigan; the Friendship Community group home, Firstaff Nursing Services and Lori's Angels home care, all in Pennsylvania; the Area Agency on Aging of Western Arkansas, which cut hours for 500 home health aides and drivers to 28 per week; and the Visiting Nurse Association (VNA) of El Paso.El Paso's ex-Democratic Mayor Joe Wardy told IBD last year that as CEO of financially troubled VNA, he was compelled to cut hours for 330 caregivers working 30 or more hours a week ""because there is no margin in the reimbursement (from Medicaid) for any type of benefits.""The consequences, he said, were ""disastrous"" for employees, patients and the nonprofit itself, which has since closed.New Pay Rules Kick InOne contributing factor: Some families wanting a dedicated caregiver moved their business to small providers who weren't subject to the employer mandate.ObamaCare's employer mandate isn't the only new cost challenging the ability of the home care industry to make ends meet or turn a profit. Effective January, home health care workers will have to be paid overtime wages for hours beyond 40.Facing this combination of new costs, along with local minimum wage hikes in Santa Fe, Albuquerque and Las Cruces, Kennon's employer has made an abrupt shift after previously covering the bulk of her comprehensive health insurance premiums.Perhaps management overreacted. Maybe they're overestimating the size of the ObamaCare penalties they would face. Or maybe they are correct in assuming all of these new costs would keep their business from turning a profit. IBD reached out for explanation, to no avail.'No Spring Chicken'But whether or not the business decision to cap hours was sound, the move threw the Kennon family and others for a loop.""I am considering moving away to find a good job,"" Kennon, 57, wrote in an email to IBD.""I am no spring chicken and the longer I wait, the harder it will be to find employment where I can make enough to survive. My mother and sister will have to make do with the caregivers they send. It just sucks. This was not broken until now.""Subsequently, with Kennon's hours capped and no one sent in her place, her mother had no paid caregiver to look after her.But Kennon isn't one to give up easily. ""I can't walk away,"" she decided. ""We don't want to put my sister in a nursing home because the care she needs will not be what we expect.""Her solution, for now, may be to work for one home care agency providing care for her sister and another one as caregiver for her mother.

1244,EL,"In a way, a good chunk of Social Security's problems can be summed up in one question: Why didn't you have more children 40 years ago? While that might sound like a lame joke, the punch line carries wallop. Five years after Social Security was launched in 1935, there were 159 workers paying into the fund for every retiree getting a check, according to the Social Security Administration. Today the ratio is roughly 3 to 1.
"
1245,EL,"Free market advocates say one way to solve the problem is to go to a 1 to 1 ratio: Personal retirement accounts that the worker owns and builds up over his or her career.
"
1246,EL,"According to Michael Tanner of the libertarian Cato Institute, 32 countries have turned to partial or full privatization of their Social Security-like systems. The U.S. isn't one of them.
"
1247,EL,"After his re-election in 2004, President Bush pushed for changes that would've let workers put part of their Social Security taxes into a personal retirement account. However, the effort stalled out. Polls showed the public did not favor the ownership plan.
"
1248,EL,"Other nations have proven more open to change. Here's a look at several countries and their systems:
"
1249,EL," Chile: Capitalists point to Chile as perhaps the best model for change. In 1924, Chile became the first country in the Western Hemisphere to introduce a retirement program, but the government program began to have funding problems in the late 1970s.

"
1258,EL,"""This was a problem with the old system too,"" Tanner said.
"
1259,EL,"Another problem is that the system inadvertently favors men over women. Divorce wasn't legal in Chile until the late 1980s. The accounts belonged to the wage earner, which usually was a man. Some divorced women were left with nothing.

1278,EL,"Leadership: Dick Cheney isn't careless with words. So when the former vice president tells an interviewer, ""I look at Barack Obama and I see the worst president of my lifetime, without question,"" it merits attention.Cheney has served in four presidential administrations and has closely observed four others, so his experience means something.To place President Obama below, say, Jimmy Carter tells you something about how much damage the incumbent has done. We're happy to see someone of Cheney's stature speak truths that the media dare not. Indeed, Obama is turning into one of the worst presidents ever.""The U.S. has to play a leadership role,"" Cheney told Playboy magazine. ""And it's going to take a lot to rebuild the damage that has been done over the past few years, because (this president has) actively conveyed to the world the notion ... that we no longer believe that.""Think that's hyperbole? Just look at the most recent news overseas, where we're witnessing the unraveling of the so-called Pax Americana that was carefully put in place after World War II by presidents of both parties.Cheney's right. Through his naive and clueless diplomacy, Obama is damaging U.S. prestige and standing in the world in a way no one would have thought possible.Consider these recent alarming signs that the rest of the world no longer needs our leadership — or wants it: Arab nations, led by Egyptian President el-Sissi, are creating a joint military force to fight the Islamic State and Iran. As they do, President Obama is actively undercutting these efforts through his feckless response to IS and ongoing concessions to Iran's mullahs in their quest for a nuclear weapon to dominate the Islamic world. The European Union, disgusted with Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's ""Reset Button"" Russian diplomacy, is rethinking whether it should go along with U.S. sanctions on Russia's economy, especially with Vladimir Putin on the rampage. On the financial front, France, Germany, Italy and even Britain now seem ready to join a global development bank led by China, despite U.S. opposition. Obama's failure to counter China's growing clout in East Asia is being noticed.We're glad to see Cheney and others finally stepping up to say what's become obvious: This president's tenure has been a disaster for the United States, with consequences that will take years to correct.

1280,EL,"Politics: Amid applause, President Obama has made fighting Ebola in Africa a military priority, to protect U.S. health. So why is he doing nothing about the raft of new diseases that may be rolling in from our unguarded border?'We can't dawdle on this one,"" the president intoned this week, announcing that he would be putting 3,000 boots on the ground in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, in a $600 million rescue effort for three nations badly hit by the dreaded Ebola epidemic.""We have to move with force and make sure that we are catching this as best we can, given that it has already broken out in ways that we have not seen before.""And to make sure the whole effort seemed more about protecting the U.S. than the charity effort in a distant corner of the globe it is, he turned up the verbal panic knobs: ""It's spiraling out of control. If the outbreak is not stopped now, we could be looking at hundreds of thousands of people infected with profound political and economic and security implications for all of us.""It might be believable if he showed the same concern and priority for the strange new diseases now spreading and infecting Americans here, which at least one prominent U.S. doctor says may be spread by illegal aliens now in our country with zero health care screening as part of Obama's open borders policy.Dr. Jane Orient, Executive Director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, told radio host Laura Ingraham Thursday that the Obama administration has been ""real tight lipped"" about a new respiratory illness known as enterovirus D68 that has affected 153 children in 19 states in the U.S., the latest four in San Diego and Ventura counties in California.""We don't know where it's coming from ... are there immigrants from Central America, where this disease has allegedly been prevalent before? Should we be (studying) the virus to see whether it's like what's been found in some of these countries that are just sending waves of children across our border and they haven't been quarantined long enough to make sure they're not sick?"" she asked, according to a Breitbart TV report.As a matter of fact there have been a terrifying rash of new diseases in the region. In Venezuela, a man-made health crisis is engulfing the country as doctor flight (including even its Cuban doctors) and an absence of medicine, bandages, sanitation supplies and all the other signature shortages of socialism have left its once excellent health care system in a state of collapse.Venezuela has confirmed 398 cases of chikungunya fever, 55,970 cases of malaria and 45,745 cases of dengue fever — all diseases that were either unknown or else had had been eradicated from the country two decades ago. There's also 9 deaths from a strange new, unnamed hemorrhagic fever in Aragua state.Meanwhile, in Honduras, El Salvador and Costa Rica, a monster dengue epidemic is raging through the region right now, with 120,000 cases, and 60 deaths, and public health emergencies declared in those countries.Funds earmarked for the Red Cross to combat it amount to a meager $169,000, according to a report in the British Guardian. Yet El Salvador and Honduras remain major shippers of illegals to the U.S.To assume dengue is the only problem coming out of those countries, with many viruses known to travel along the same vectors as dengue, and with a heavy rainy season along with hurricanes is naivete.The reality is, an unguarded border, a welcome-mat approach to illegals, well developed smuggling networks, and zero medical screening are virtually a guarantee of the spread of new diseases — and demand the political will to investigate it.But the president's focus is on Africa right now, and on the frightening disease that has caught the media's attention and which may get his poll numbers up.Yet the millions of malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS cases far more rampant in those African countries are getting no attention. Nor are the illnesses that could easily come up here from the south.It points to crass politics — a wag-the-dog bid to divert public attention from the president's other political problems, and a pander for the Latino vote.This is no way to deal with epidemics.

1283,EL,"Leadership: Egypt is quietly forging ahead with a grand plan to expand its Suez Canal, open itself to investment and modernize its economy. In light of its credible actions to destroy radical Islam, it's a praiseworthy path.From his powerful speech declaring a ""religious revolution"" and reclaiming Islam for civilization at Cairo's famed al-Azhar University last January, to his efforts to protect Egypt's battered Christians, and now his shutdown of 27,000 unregulated radical mosques, President Abdel-Fatteh al-Sisi has already secured a place in history just for his leadership in attempting to right the axis of the Islamic world.But he's also running a parallel operation to pull his country up on its economic feet and make it a First World country, quite possibly comparable to the two-track effort that transformed Chile in the mid-1970s.Instead of telling Egyptians to just be content with stability, al-Sisi has launched into a breakneck modernization of the Suez Canal, ordering military engineers to double its capacity to 97 ships a day by August, two years ahead of schedule.He's also hosing out the regulatory morass and simplifying laws to attract foreign capital. Egypt's investment minister, Ashraf Salman, wrote in last week's Wall Street Journal that the country is attracting high interest from multinationals, with as many as 2,000 companies expected to visit the country's investment conference next week in the tourist resort city of Sharm El Sheikh.Cairo also is looking to connect with Israel's high-tech powerhouse economy, leveraging its educational prowess, its tech genius, its agricultural expertise and its investment capital into helping Egypt develop, too.And as IBD reported this week, the great Peruvian guru of property rights, Hernando de Soto, said he has been asked by Egypt to help its poor turn their informal system of land rights into the invisible architecture of title deeds and thus create wealth from that capital.Al-Sisi's ambition is not without risk — the Associated Press has reported that Egypt will have a tough time expanding the canal if Europe's economy remains in the dumps, and some of al-Sisi's reforms have been praised by the International Monetary Fund for all the wrong reasons — tax hikes being one.But nothing is riskless, and these moves are desperate tradeoffs. What we are seeing is an admirable effort to pull Egypt away from the dead end of Islamic radicalism and replace that siren song with the best of global civilization to give Egypt the chance it deserves. We want this to succeed.

1288,EL,"Diplomacy: As Paris Hilton whooped it up with Havana's princelings to applaud U.S.-Cuba ties, Colombia detained a Chinese ship full of illegal weapons bound for Cuba in what may be a new violation of U.N. sanctions. Castro is playing us for fools.Even though tourism remains illegal for Americans in Cuba, it doesn't stop B-List celebrities from going to Havana, partying hearty, snapping and posting selfies, popping flashbulbs, swigging mojitos and buying cigars by the cartload, as Hilton's Instagram pictures showed.Communism-ravaged Cuba is about as poor as Ethiopia or Zimbabwe. So it wasn't the locals partying down, but the communist elites — such as Fidel's son, Fidel Castro Diaz-Balart, with whom Hilton and model Naomi Campbell posed for selfies.This is a preview of who will benefit from the opening to Cuba — its wealthy Communist Party elites, not ordinary folks.But in this grotesque fantasyland of vulgar Third World dictators and equally vulgar Hollywood reality stars, an even uglier reality was emerging 600 miles to the south on the very same Sunday.Colombia port officials near Cartagena discovered a huge cache of weapons buried in the hull of the Dan Dan Xia, a Chinese ship stopping on the way to Cuba, which was supposedly shipping grain.In reality, it was transporting 100 tons of black gunpowder, 2.6 million primers, 99 projectile cores, and 3,000 caps for the rifles, according to Colombia's El Tiempo. Colombian authorities held the captain and the vessel until an investigation is done.The question we want to know is what the Cuban elites wanted with such weapons. With Obama granting them no-strings-attached diplomatic relations and looking the other way as Castro's goons beat and arrest dissidents, they are threatened by no one.So why are they still smuggling weapons?Doing so is a violation of United Nations sanctions, which forbid Cuban weapons smuggling based on its history as a state sponsor of terror. Cuba continues doing it, fully confident that nothing will be done.That's what happened the last time they got caught violating the embargo — when Panama Canal officials caught a North Korean ship smuggling heavy weapons from Cuba, not sugar as the ship's manifest said.Then there's Cuba's role as a broker in the ongoing — and questionable — ""peace talks"" between Colombia and FARC narco-terrorists. Colombian officials said they initially believed the arms were meant for FARC, but now say they aren't entirely sure.If anyone looks foolish here it's the U.S. The Obama administration has let lefty celebrities abuse the law to use Cuba as a kind of communist playground. And it has given Cuba's nasty regime the diplomatic relations and recognition it's long sought.How has Cuba repaid them? By arming up to create trouble in our hemisphere. The Chinese-Cuban weapons ship shows the Obama administration is a ship of fools.

1289,EL,"Solar-generated electricity is becoming cheaper than the grid in more cities, prompting residential solar installers to look for growth in more markets.Electricity from rooftop solar systems is now cheaper than local utility rates in 42 of the 50 U.S. largest cities, according to ""Going Solar in America,"" a report that North Carolina State University's College of Engineering released in January.Yet most folks still view solar as a ""technological luxury,"" says the report, by Jim Kennerly and Autumn Proudlove of the college's North Carolina Clean Energy Center.""In 46 of America's 50 largest cities, a fully financed, typically sized solar PV (photovoltaic) system is a better investment than the stock market, and in 42 of these cities, the same system already costs less than energy from a residential customer's local utility,"" said the report. ""Of the single-family homeowners in America's 50 largest cities, we estimate that 9.1 million already live in a city where solar costs less than their current utility rates if they bought a PV system outright — and nearly 21 million (93% of all estimated single-family homeowners in those cities) do if low-cost financing is available.""Neighbors Are Best 'Sellers'Solar companies are racing to get out that message. A separate report out this fall by researchers at the University of Connecticut and Yale University says that the No. 1 factor driving solar installations is whether neighbors are going solar.The growth potential is big.To date, a mere 0.3% of U.S. homes incorporate solar, says Andrew Pontti, a spokesman for San Francisco-based residential solar installer Sunrun.In January, SolarCity (SCTY) expanded into El Paso, Texas, where solar-powered electricity costs have fallen below local utility rates. SolarCity offers solar panel installation with no upfront costs and with monthly payments as low as $35, including design, installation, financing, insurance, monitoring and a performance guarantee.""We typically will expand into a new market when we can offer solar at a discount to utility rates at scale, not for just a few homes in perfect circumstances but to homeowners broadly,"" said SolarCity spokesman Jonathan Bass. ""Many people don't realize that costs have come down and financing options have expanded such that it's possible for millions of customers to pay less for solar electricity than they pay for power from utilities — from day one.""SolarCity expanded into western Massachusetts in December and is adding 20 new operations centers in seven states. It has partnered with more than 110 homebuilders to install solar in a dozen states.The past year, SolarCity has hired as many as 350 people per month across its 65 operations centers, Bass said.Vivint Solar (VSLR) expanded into Arizona this summer and hired about 100 employees for its two offices in Phoenix. The Utah-based residential installer has operations in seven states and Washington D.C. In Q3, it installed solar panels with more than twice the megawatts of panels installed in the previous three years combined.Vivint Solar plans to add 20 sales and operations offices in 2015.The NRG Home Solar unit of NRG Energy (NRG) says that within three years, solar will become competitive with utility rates in 17 states where NRG operates, vs. 10 states now.In July NRG Home Solar launched operations in Connecticut and four months later expanded operations in California with new offices in Merced and San Diego, adding about 175 employees. NRG Home Solar expects to install 250 megawatts of home solar systems this year, 875 MW in 2017 and 2,400 MW in 2022.Nationwide, solar industry employment soared 86% over the past five years, reaching 173,807 workers as of November, says the Solar Foundation industry group, which says that one of every 78 new U.S. jobs created over the past 12 months was in the solar industry.SunPower (SPWR) deployed 92 MW of residential solar in Q3, including 38 MW in North America, 42 MW in the Asia-Pacific region and 11 MW in Europe, company CFO Charles Boynton told IBD.A major factor spurring residential solar growth is how rapidly the costs have declined for rooftop photovoltaic solar systems, says North Carolina's Kennerly.Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory says the median cost of residential solar plummeted to $4.70 per watt in 2013 from $12 in 1998, thanks mostly to declines in manufacturing and PV hardware costs.In the U.S., solar companies installed 1,354 megawatts of solar systems in homes and business in Q3, in more than 49,000 installations, up 41% over Q3 2013, GTM Research and the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reported in December. The installations brought the cumulative solar PV capacity to 16.1 gigawatts, with nearly 600,000 U.S. homes and businesses having solar systems.For the first three quarters of 2014, solar represented 36% of the new electricity capacity that came online, up from 29% in 2013 and 9.6% in 2012, GTM Research and the SEIA report.One factor boosting U.S. projects, though, is a tax credit deadline. A 30% federal investment tax credit falls to 10% for commercial installations and to zero for residential at the end of 2016. The trade group Solar Energy Industries Association says the tax credit has been instrumental in boosting solar installation growth by a compound annual growth rate of 76% since it was implemented in 2006.The tax credit deadline isn't helping solar stocks, which await firmer footing and more profits before heating up. IBD's 20-company Energy-Solar industry group ranks just No. 167 out of 197 groups.Vivint stock debuted at 16 on Oct. 1, rose above 18 its first day and closed Wednesday at 8.53. But it could rise Thursday after posting its Q4 earning late Wednesday. SolarCity was a hot IPO in December 2012, peaked a year ago at 88 and closed Wednesday at 50.05.Deutsche Bank analyst Vishal Shah says that solar stocks have tumbled along with plummeting oil prices, but not because of souring prospects for residential solar companies. He's bullish, telling IBD, ""increasing parity will occur, and solar penetration rates are set to ramp up worldwide.""Less than 1% of the electricity generated in the U.S. and China relies on oil nowadays, he says, and less than 5% worldwide. So oil prices don't have a fundamental impact on solar demand, Shah says.More Options AvailableHe expects solar power system costs to fall 5% to 15% annually over the next three years, resulting in grid parity in roughly half of global target markets.Solar companies are spurring growth by providing homeowners with more options, including allowing those who don't want to own the system to lease the equipment, Raymond James analyst Carlos Newall told IBD. Others who want to own and are comfortable with a loan can get one, too.""This compares to the option of either using an auto loan to purchase a car or leasing it,"" Newall said.Solar companies also have been able to get more financing options of their own, thereby reducing the cost of capital and enabling them to cut operating costs and pass savings on to homeowners.With financing from several big financial institutions, SolarCity has amassed funds to finance more than $5 billion in solar projects, Bass said.SolarCity plans to cut its costs even further, following its acquisition last year of solar module maker Silevo. In September, it broke ground on a new 1 GW fabrication plant near Buffalo, N.Y.

1299,EL,"Politics: Chuck Todd made Barack Obama squirm on ""Meet the Press"" Sunday, asking the president what he'd say to illegal aliens facing deportation as a result of his decision to delay amnesty. How about ""Hasta la vista""?The president tried hard to convince the new host of NBC's Sunday morning talk show that amnesty was merely a matter of making sure ""all the t's are crossed.""Sounds good, but then he finally admitted that public polls signal a disaster for Senate Democrats in November if he issues an executive order granting amnesty for up to half the 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S.That political reality didn't stop howls from the open-borders lobby, which hollered that 60,000 illegals would be shipped back home in the next two months.""Tens of thousands of human beings are likely to be separated from their families between now and the election,"" thundered Janet Murguia, president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza.""Their suffering ... should weigh on the consciences of each and every person responsible for this delay,"" she railed. ""I guarantee that the dreams they have shattered today will haunt them far into the future.""Weigh on the consciences? Haunt? To hear her talk, it sounds as though the president is sending the illegals to the gates of Hell.In reality, they are going back to El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, the homelands of 77% of illegal immigrants now here in the U.S.These are what the World Bank calls upper- and lower-middle-income countries, complete with roads, electricity, running water, schools, highly coveted free trade pacts with the U.S. and actual democracies.And in Mexico's case, at $7,000 per capita annual income, one of the highest living standards in the hemisphere. That's hardly the gates of Hell.Nor are they all that impoverished. Take a look at the designer logos on the shirts and purses of the incoming illegals in news photos — if you can't look up stats showing that it's the middle-income tiers of these societies heading for El Norte, the only people with the resources to pay $7,000 smuggling fees for illegal entry.That's about the same as the cost of immigrating legally, the way that 1 million immigrants choose to come to the U.S. each year. Any of the illegals can avail themselves of this process to become legal — with an added kick for Central Americans, who qualify for 5,000 extra ""diversity"" visas, a comical designation given the huge numbers of those immigrants already in the U.S.But the president didn't make those arguments to NBC's Todd. This is pathetic, given that he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer. When it comes to amnesty, it seems that politics trumps reality.

1302,EL,"ObamaCare's impact on jobs is hotly debated by politicians and economists. Critics say the Affordable Care Act gives businesses an incentive to cut workers' hours below the 30-hour-per-week threshold at which the employer mandate to provide health insurance kicks in. White House economists dismiss such evidence as anecdotal, but BLS data show that the workweek in low-wage sectors sank to a record low in July — just before the Obama administration delayed enforcement of the employer mandate until 2015.In the interest of an informed debate, we've compiled a list of job actions with strong proof that ObamaCare's employer mandate is behind cuts to work hours or staffing levels. As of September 5th, our ObamaCare scorecard included 450 employers with more than 100 school districts among them. Recently, IBD explained that a big minimum wage hike alongside the employer mandate would add to pressure on employers to cut workers to part-time, complicating the goal of reducing inequality.Click on the employer names in the list below for links to supporting records, mostly news accounts or official documents.We'll continue to update the list, which we encourage you to share and download into a spreadsheet to sort and analyze.

1317,EL,"Socialism: As Venezuelans prepare to be fingerprinted to buy bread, it bears noting that their country's transformation came with the late Hugo Chavez's promise of ""a sea of happiness."" Some happiness.Fact is, socialism has made Venezuela the most miserable place on earth. But don't take our word for it. That's the result of objective research by Johns Hopkins University economist Steve Hanke.He has created a ""Global Misery Index"" based on the original inflation-unemployment misery index of the late economist Arthur Okun and the interest rate and GDP per capita additions of Harvard economist Robert Barro. Put them all together and Venezuela tops the globe in misery with a figure of 79.9.The misery in this case, as in so many others, is the product of socialism implemented in another purported but misguided effort to help the poor.The fingerprints-for-bread requirement stems from 25% food shortages due to price and currency controls that lead to smuggling — with rationing instead of free markets the socialist answer. By year-end, Venezuelans must stand in line to be fingerprinted before buying 23 basic items including bread, sugar, toilet paper and other necessities in a system President Nicolas Maduro bills as ""perfect.""""The whole thing is absurd,"" writes banker Miguel Octavio at his blog, The Devil's Excrement. ""How much does this system cost? Who will run it? Who sells it? Who maintains it? Who profits from it? How do you implement it?"" he writes. ""Today it is fingerprint scanners, tomorrow it will be some different imaginary battle. But it will always be about attacking the consequences, not the causes.""But socialist failure extends beyond economics. On Monday, Gallup came out with a global perception survey showing Venezuela to be the most dangerous, crime-ridden hellhole on the face of the earth. It even topped all those Central American countries shipping illegal immigrants to the U.S. amid exaggerated tales of gang violence.One of every 10 of Venezuela's 28 million people, according to a report in El Universal last week, has taken steps (not just contemplated, but taken actual steps) to emigrate. As this goes on, the U.S. embassy in Caracas warns that flights out of the country are severely curtailed, making Venezuela ever more like a prison.Venezuela's Stefania Fernandez, a former Miss Universe, took her final catwalk from the pageant in 2010 waving a seven-starred Venezuelan flag in a veiled protest against crime. But she's a lot less subtle now, posing for a series of photos this week with a dirty bloody face, wearing her Miss Venezuela tiara.She's one of the lucky ones. As their 5-year-old daughter watched, fellow Miss Venezuela Monica Spear was gunned down with her husband in January by Venezuelan highway brigands intent on stealing her purse — setting the stage for massive protests that engulfed the country but have since died down.And that points to another star on Venezuela's misery flag — an impossible-to-change political system. As with the grocery system, Venezuela's political entrenchment began with fingerprinting and electronic voting.Despite naive endorsements from ex-President Jimmy Carter, who observed the country's first experiment with electronic voting in 2004, the biometric system can be easily manipulated by political operatives, leading to fraudulent results.Protests don't work any better than elections. Venezuela has had more than 15,000 street protests in the last three years, and the Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict counted 6,369 in the first six months of 2014.According to El Universal, ""The number averages out to about 35 protests per day making it the most unrestful period in 10 years. This amounts to an increase of 278% over the same period last year, when 1,687 protests were recorded.""Not one has changed the entrenched socialist structure, or forced the government to back down on anything. All that remains is yet another reminder of what can be expected when countries answer the siren call of socialism.

1318,EL,"Leaders of dozens of Third World and post-communist countries have called on Hernando de Soto for help in freeing their economies and improving the lot of their poor.He was praised by nearly every president of the late 20th century, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, who called him ""the world's greatest living economist.""Time magazine named de Soto one of the world's 100 most influential people in 2004.Maybe the greatest praise for him came from the communist Shining Path guerrilla fighters of his native Peru. They viewed his work as such a serious threat to their Maoist revolution, they tried to assassinate him on July 20, 1992.Not only did de Soto survive their car-bomb attack on his offices (three people were killed), but also he went on to prove them right.His economic improvement, embraced by Peru's government, helped lift millions of fellow citizens out of economic limbo. This in turn undermined the guerrillas' popular support and led to the collapse of their terrorist movement, which had killed tens of thousands.Getting The Word OutFor all of this progress, de Soto admits to one enduring frustration — explaining himself to Americans.""I consider myself a total failure,"" de Soto, 73, told IBD, ""at trying to explain to the wealthiest and most powerful people in the world what informality is all about.""Informality is a central concept in de Soto's work on poverty.It describes the realm to which the Third World's poorest are relegated — banished from their nations' official economies to what he has called ""the grubby basement of the precapitalist world.""He argues that their exclusion — the product of a lack of enforceable property rights — holds back them and the entire world economy.It's why capitalism, despite its triumph over communism and its wealth generation in America and Western Europe, has failed elsewhere.Nicholas Eberstadt, an American Enterprise Institute expert on economic development, lauds de Soto for demonstrating how property rights — often disparaged by left-leaning intellectuals as an instrument of the privileged — help the poor: ""He has helped explain to convincible readers how radically egalitarian the rule of law and property rights are. Plutocrats, strongmen — they have their muscle. They can take what they choose in lawless situations. But the poor and weak are protected by the rule of law and property rights.""Americans struggle to understand the plight of the Third World's poor, de Soto says, because they take for granted the robust U.S. legal system that makes their prosperity possible.The anarchic Wild West America of squatters and gold rushers gave way long ago to a nation where: Ownership is uniformly documented and insured. Trustworthy records of transactions are easily accessible. People have fixed addresses and recorded credit histories. Property titles are sacrosanct. Convenient legal instruments exist to limit business liability.Any American can be easily found and held accountable for his bills, meaning credit can be extended and commerce conducted with great confidence.For those enjoying this rich, complex legal system and its intangible protections, it is hard to imagine a universe without it. But that is the macrocosm in which much of the world lives. In his 2000 book, ""The Mystery of Capital,"" de Soto tries to explain this universe. Utility companies in Third World countries, he notes, must skimp on investing in service or accept having 30% to 50% of their service stolen.Many neighborhoods and entire regions in poor nations lack street addresses. There are no legal records of many residents' birth or existence, let alone reliable documentation of anyone's financial or credit history. There is no legally recognized claim to ownership of many of the homes they live in.In such a low-information environment, where a utility company cannot expect its bills to be honored, investments such as small-business loans are hard to imagine.This is, after all, an atmosphere where cash is stuffed into mattresses and whose inhabitants live like illegal aliens in their own countries.De Soto was born in Arequipa, in southern Peru, in 1941. But he spent much of his youth and received his education in Europe, where his father fled after Peru's 1948 military coup.Upon his return to the South American country in 1979, de Soto found that his study of economics and his experience in both sides of the universe helped him understand how they were different.""When you step out of the door of the Nile Hilton,"" he wrote, ""what you are leaving behind is not the high-technology world of fax machines and ice makers, television and antibiotics. The people of Cairo have access to all those things. What you are really leaving behind is the world of legally enforceable transactions on property rights.""How They RiseDuring the 1990s, de Soto and a large team of assistants hit the streets of five major Third World cities to study how poor people in diverse locations cope with exclusion from the formal economy. Nowhere did the poor resemble Karl Marx's proletariat. ""In the Third World,"" de Soto says, ""the proles are actually entrepreneurs.""A large share survived through small-scale entrepreneurship — cottage industries such as the production of native art and trinkets.They exhibited all the ingenuity one would expect of entrepreneurs in dealing with informality. Everywhere he went, de Soto found that people developed their own extralegal, informal customs for establishing ownership, for imposing personal integrity in transactions.Even so, this coping mechanism is a poor substitute for a formal legal system. Local conventions are not only informal, but they also vary, making commerce with outsiders risky. This limits the scale on which even the most successful small businesses can operate.Governments are of little help to these excluded entrepreneurs, offering them cold indifference.As an experiment, de Soto tried to start a business legally in Lima — a garment shop employing one person. It took him and his team $1,200 (at that time 31 times the monthly minimum wage) and 289 six-hour days filling out forms and waiting in lines at government offices.The red tape can be even thicker when it comes to real property.In some Third World countries — the Philippines, Egypt, Haiti — de Soto found that it can take more than a decade and hundreds of visits to government offices just to establish legal title to one's home.Not So BadDe Soto wrote that these Third World entrepreneurs ""do not so much break the law as the law breaks them, and they opt out of the system,"" remaining in the shadows of the informal economy.That's the bad news. The good news, as de Soto also found in his research, is that the poor already possess the entrepreneurial spirit and the capital they need to thrive.At the turn of the century, based on his survey of five countries, de Soto estimated that all of the world's poor hold informal possession of $9.3 trillion in real estate alone — a sum that dwarfs all of the foreign aid ever granted by all the world's governments combined.With its current informal status, however, this capital is nearly useless to its possessors. It cannot be sold or traded or borrowed against. The homes informally held by the world's poor are good for keeping out the rain, and little else.That can change, but de Soto acknowledges no quick fix exists.Bringing this dead capital to life is an arduous project, one in which de Soto often participates.He recently provided economic reform plans for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and is involved in a campaign to protect small miners' claims from being wiped out by Peru's regulations.Even so, de Soto has frequently argued that this process is not just something the economically excluded deserve — it is also something Third World governments cannot afford to withhold.He says that the recent Arab Spring was not the result of Islamists toiling and killing people for years in a fruitless effort to topple authoritarian governments. Rather, it began when a frustrated Tunisian merchant, operating in the informal economy, set himself on fire to protest the expropriation of his goods by corrupt officials.Over 60 other Middle Eastern entrepreneurs followed his example, with most surviving their burns.""The ones that died, and that made everyone else flock to the streets, they were entrepreneurs,"" de Soto said. ""They all complained that they had been expropriated of their capital.""Soon governments fell, and the 23-year reign of Tunisia's president was over by January 2011.

1368,EL,"Only by understanding the reasons for the recent flood of unescorted children at our southern borders can we come to grips with the limited solutions available to us. Making their heart-wrenching circumstances our problem is not one of those solutions.There are ways of helping them, but holding out the carrot of a life in America, albeit a life of relative poverty, is not fair to them or the American people. Politicians' daily statements about immigration policies, amnesty and the like are front-page news in Central America and rocket fuel for the recent surge at our borders.The concept of illegal immigrants from Central America, Mexico and elsewhere ""walking"" into America over our porous southern border is certainly nothing new.In the 19th century, migrant workers streamed into the U.S. largely unimpeded, searching for work and a better life. Easily finding jobs building the railroads, working the fields and mining, they were welcome but their pay and circumstances were meager.Their long journeys from Mexico and Central America were dangerous, difficult, mostly seat-of-the-pants and self-guided. But by today's standards, their total numbers were modest.Since the 1960s, the numbers have rapidly increased, with more and more people fleeing the political unrest, long civil wars and poverty of the Northern Triangle countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Our history books are filled with chronicles from the '70s, '80s and '90s of the political instability and violence of this region and the CIA's occasional involvement.The resulting social and economic decline in these countries has devastated their citizens for decades. Most of the 35 million people who populate these countries have endured severe unemployment, poverty, crime and even regional, ethnic and gender genocide.Over the past three decades, gang- and drug-related violence has accelerated to where, today, Honduras and El Salvador rank first and fourth on a U.N. list of the highest murder rates in the world, with Guatemala in the No. 5 spot. Throughout Central America, the homicide rate has almost doubled in 15 years.While these statistics are shocking, the reality of the hopelessness of everyday life for the vast majority of these people is incomprehensible to most Americans.A child born in the smallest and most densely populated Central American country of San Salvador has little chance of not being recruited into a violent gang.Enter the ""coyote"" promising easy passage to America and reinforcing the widespread belief that it is far better to be poor in America than anywhere else.The coyote, or human trafficker, has flourished in recent years amid the desperation of these people, who are willing to sell all their earthly possessions to come up with the ""fare"" (rumored to be $5,000 to $8,000) to transport their children through Mexico and over the border to America.The coyotes evidently operate in networks, with each successive trafficker having expertise in a certain area to be crossed. Each knows the terrain, the local authorities (often bribed) and tricks to avoid detection.Some go over land in buses, trains and trucks, while others also use boats to make the trip around the Yucatan to northern Gulf Coast of Mexico, then travel overland to enter the U.S. through Texas, New Mexico or Arizona. Supposedly, some coyotes even allow a parent to make the trip as far as the U.S. border, where they bid their children farewell.Further, the reality is that not all of the children being deposited across our border are innocent toddlers. Some are older teenagers or young adults who have already joined a gang and account for some of the immigrant crime being experienced by border towns in the U.S.Whatever the ages of these children, it is safe to assume that many have already witnessed first-hand a life surrounded by crime, violence and murder.Even the most hardened among us recognize the pain these children and their parents endure, but transferring a humanitarian crisis from Central America to our country is not the answer.We can't easily correct the vast problems that brought them here or instantly ramp up our deportation process.But we can secure our borders and remove the incentive for enriching the coyotes. Only thereafter can we truly address our long-term immigration policies. It's long past time to bring the cake in from the rain. Porpora, a member of the New York Stock Exchange for 31 years, now contributes regularly to this page.

1400,EL,"Border Surge: The open-border lobby's argument that the illegals pouring in are just refugees from violence is crumbling. A CBP paper shows border crossers are rolling in from 75 nations. Economics, not gangs, is driving them.Justifying the Central American surge on our unguarded border as a flight from intolerable homeland violence, the political left has attempted to paint this year's 240,000-person influx of illegal aliens into the U.S. as a matter of refugees — and anyone who opposes the human flood tide as heartless. Their pictures of women and toddlers tug on the heartstrings.It's rubbish. The border surge is mainly a rational response to a U.S. government that refuses to enforce its own border, offering a variety of incentives to lawbreakers — and a huge business opportunity for Central American smuggling gangs, which are drumming up new markets well beyond the traditional Mexican one.A leaked Customs and Border Protection (CBP) report obtained by Breitbart Texas shows that it's not just Central Americans surging in from supposed violence.In fact, nationals from 75 nations are rushing to enter the U.S. illegally in hopes of amnesty and work authorization. Most of these countries are economic basket cases, not war zones.This is consistent with what the illegals themselves have told lawmen. In a study by the El Paso Intelligence Center, also leaked to Breitbart News, 219 of 230 apprehended migrants surveyed stated that they were coming to the U.S. in the belief that they would be permitted to stay rather than out of a credible fear of violence.In short, refugees they are not.It's also what Julio Ligoria, Guatemala's ambassador to the U.S., told Spanish-language television when the crisis broke, noting that border surgers from his country were largely from Guatemala's impoverished north, where gang violence is unknown.It's also consistent with what congressional fact-finders on missions to Central America, such as Rep. Steve Pearce, a New Mexico Republican, found this month — more economic motivation than flight from violence.What is unique to Central America in this surge is that the smuggling gangs, such as the Mara Salvatrucha-13 and Barrio 18, are all Central American due to their close ties to the U.S. That explains the concentration of Central Americans and the fact that illegals from other countries are coming in through Central America.But genuine refugees — such as the persecuted Christians of Iraq — run as far as they can from their persecutors, unlike economic migrants.The Central Americans and others have a symbiotic relationship with their gangs, paying them huge smuggling fees and then moving to gang-infested neighborhoods in the U.S. where safety is rare, but economic opportunity exists.And again: They aren't refugees.But gullibility is abundant here, and amnesty advocates, with visions of 'D' voters in their eyes, are pretty much cynical enough to use the refugee argument to browbeat Americans into accepting them as refugees, regardless of whether they are and whether it's in the U.S. interest to take them. As the hidden documents leak out, the facts prove these refugee claims false.

1432,EL,"Amnesty: With word out about U.S. coddling of Central American illegal immigrants, Haitians and people from much farther abroad are flooding our shores to get their slice. This is what comes when politics trumps law.Some of the strongest voices speaking in favor of amnesty for the latest flood of illegal immigrants from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, such as columnist George Will, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and the Catholic bishops, have used the hardship and mercy argument to scrap the law and permit the illegals to stay.""The idea that we can't assimilate these 8-year-old 'criminals' with their teddy bears is preposterous,"" Will told Fox News on Sunday.Pelosi likened illegals to ""baby Jesus"" and said she wanted to take some home (sounding as if she thought they were pets) while the Catholic bishops said America should accept them regardless of cost.Mercy, in other words, is the argument, as if there's something unique about Central America, a group of countries that are all democracies with citizens who are empowered to vote to change their economic conditions if they want to.The insistence on special treatment for Central Americans over those who follow the law and wait in line to immigrate is a preoccupation of many of our elites. These are the very same people, as the late New York Timesman Scotty Reston put it, who will do anything for Latin America except read about it.The hard reality is, if the law is suddenly rendered null based on the treacly photos of cherubic toddlers and their moms, it's not going to be just Central Americans at our door.As CBS News reports, we're now seeing a surge in illegal immigrants from Haiti, with the number soaring in the past two years from 12 in 2011 to 1,760 in fiscal 2013.The Colombian navy has been plucking illegals out of coastal waters from as far away as Bangladesh and Afghanistan. They're making their way to Central America and its vast human smuggling networks.Just last weekend, the National Border Patrol Council said a large group of nationals from Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka were caught in the Rio Grande Valley, coming to get what Central Americans were getting.These migrant waves parallel the migrant waves from Africa flooding the shores of Italy, Greece and Spain and are above all a commentary on the global development of powerful smuggling networks and mafias empowered by technology. They're able to do today what couldn't be done just 10 years ago.Ineffective border policing, combined with massive incentives — such as Europe's welfare programs, or President Obama's end-runs around the law to nullify current immigration law, such as his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an executive order that effectively enacts the Dream Act rejected by Congress — create powerful incentives to emigrate.The 2013 Family Interest Directive enables illegals to use their children to shield them from deportation. So does a 2008 directive signed by George W. Bush that gives non-Mexican illegals a long legal process and appeals before any can be deported.All of these are incentives to break U.S. law.When the law is rendered meaningless and heart-rending, teddy-bear toddler pictures justify ignoring it, it doesn't take long for word to get out.That's why nullifying American law for Central Americans is a sure incentive to get illegals from other countries knocking at our door.Already the Haitians are doing it, while the Middle Easterners and South Asians are just getting started.The only thing that will stop a massive wave of illegals from around the world hitting our shores is for U.S. law to regain its primacy.How far do things have to go before anyone in the Obama administration recognizes this?

This is why we now have 90,000 unaccompanied illegal immigrant children from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador at our Texas border for this year, with estimates for next year at 160,000.To be fair, the amnesty idea didn't start with Obama. Central Americans have been recipients of amnesties for decades after various wars and natural disasters, no fewer than six since 1986. This has made amnesty expectations a way of life for the past generation.And it's why one-third of the population of El Salvador already lives in the U.S., and the government is structurally dependent on immigrant remittances for roughly one-sixth of the nation's GDP.But there's zero doubt that Obama has turbocharged the amnesty promises as Democratic party operatives have talked up amnesty as a surefire winner for votes since at least the 2008 Democratic Convention.The results are in, and there's a litany of amnesties that's led to expectations of more amnesty. To wit: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals began in 2012. It's an end-run around Congress, which had rejected Obama's DREAM Act, and provides the same benefits to 800,000 illegals brought here as children that the rejected law would have provided. The 2013 Family Interest Directive, first brought to light by Tara Servatius in the American Thinker. The little-known policy directive prohibits the Immigration and Customs Enforcement from deporting, arresting or even detaining any illegal immigrant who is the caretaker of a child, related or not. Any question as to why there are women and children at the border? A new executive order in the works to legalize about half of the 11 million current illegal immigrants in the U.S. before the midterm elections, as reported in the National Journal. Amnesty, anyone? And whether Obama says he has anything to do with it or not, federal judges are now granting asylum to roughly two-thirds of illegals seeking it.That's amnesty once more. Give credit to Ted Cruz.

""Additionally, we believe that consumers will continue to move away from the added time commitment and cost of traditional casual dining.""Shake Shack's announcement follows the recent IPOs of other restaurants, such as El Pollo Loco (LOCO), which debuted in July, and Habit Restaurants (HABT), which came public in November.Such fast-casual chains, which emphasize better ingredients and greater customization when ordering meals, have become more popular at the expense of traditional fast-food giants like McDonald's (MCD). McDonald's, in turn, has vowed to adapt to shifting consumer sentiment.Shares of El Pollo Loco were down 2% on the stock market today. Habit, which runs the Habit Burger chain, ticked up 0.6%. McDonald's was down 0.7%. Fast-casual darling Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) dipped 0.4%.Shares of Habit and El Pollo Loco went on a tear after their debuts but have settled since. Despite its popularity, analysts have been concerned that Loco's stock price was overvalued. But some analysts in recent weeks have said that the stock's valuation has become more appealing.

1500,EL,"Illegal Immigration: ""I have the legal authority,"" President Obama said last weekend, to grant mass amnesty to illegals. Not so fast. A nonpartisan Hill study shows that he may have overstepped his bounds.Speaking at a rally of his supporters in Las Vegas, Obama scolded ""members of Congress"" who ""question my authority.""""I talked about what I could do based on talking to all the legal experts, talking to the (White House) Office of Legal Counsel; and not everything that we want to do we can do, but they told me what we could do and I wasn't going to sit idly by and not do at least what I was authorized to do,"" Obama assured his Alinskyite agitators.But a new report by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the Hill's nonpartisan think tank, cites limit after limit on the discretion that he can exercise in enforcing the Immigration and Nationality Act.Yes, the INA authorizes the president to grant amnesty to certain illegal aliens. But such action is normally reserved for refugees of wars or victims of natural disasters and other ""extraordinary and temporary conditions"" that prevent their safe return to their home country, the 24-page study says.The vast majority of the almost 5 million illegals getting a pass from Obama cannot claim such status.And a president's case-by-case discretion in granting ""temporary protected status"" (TPS) is just that — temporary. Only, Obama's plan gives illegals work permits, Social Security numbers, driver's licenses and other documentation that in effect make them legal permanent residents.""While TPS is 'temporary' in practice,"" Congress' research arm warns, ""aliens from designated countries are often able to legally remain and work in the United States for years.""Also, by granting ""employment authorization documents"" to almost half the illegal immigrant population in America, Obama is violating a core congressional intent in passing the INA.""An argument could be made that doing so would be inconsistent with the provisions that Congress made in the INA for the protection of domestic labor,"" the CRS report says. ""Congress is unlikely to have defined 'unauthorized alien' and prohibited the knowing hiring or employment of such aliens if it contemplated the executive branch granting work authorization"" to so many aliens.What's more, the Supreme Court in its 1985 Heckler v. Cheney decision struck down policies that abdicate statutory duties.""The Heckler Court expressly recognized the possibility of an executive agency 'consciously and expressly adopt(ing) a general policy (of not enforcing the law) that is so extreme as to amount to an abdication of its statutory responsibilities.'""There is little doubt that ordering Homeland Security not to remove almost half the U.S. illegal population is an ""extreme"" policy. It's also unprecedented.Contrary to White House spin that previous presidents exercised similar discretion, Presidents Reagan and Bush in the 1980s adopted cleanup measures for the implementation of a ""once in history"" amnesty law already enacted by Congress.Obama's action, in contrast, is in direct defiance of Congress' decision not to pass a bill.This president has, to use the Heckler case language, ""consciously decided to abdicate"" its enforcement responsibilities under the law, which explicitly mandates that illegal aliens ""shall be detained for removal proceedings.""Obama's legal team will no doubt invoke the so-called Chevron defense, another high court case giving the president wide latitude to interpret laws and prioritize enforcement. Even that defense is not broad enough to cover interpretations that mark ""a significant change in policy that Congress arguably did not directly contemplate,"" the CRS noted.If ever there were a major policy exception to the Chevron defense, Obama's mass amnesty is it. If left unchallenged, it will have enormous political as well as economic impact. He is clearly abusing the discretion that Congress grants him, not to mention violating the separation of powers doctrine imbedded in the Constitution.Beltway pundits are pooh-poohing lawsuits. We suspect that's wishful thinking.

1552,EL,"Immigration: The White House and open-borders lobby have stepped up pressure for amnesty by painting the migrant tsunami as a flood of toddlers. But a Pew study, citing Border Patrol data, shows that more than half the entrants are teenage males.Nobody pours it on about ""the children"" as an argument for negating border laws like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who wears her Catholicism on her sleeve.""I reference the (U.S. Catholic) conference of bishops' statement in which they say baby Jesus was a refugee from violence,"" Pelosi told MSNBC Wednesday. ""Let us not turn away these children and send them back into a burning building. That's the bishops, so we have to do this in a way that honors our values but also protects our border and does so in a way that the American people understand more clearly.""Given Pelosi's hard-core pro-abortion stance and indifference to the crimes of mass abortionist Kenneth Gosnell, that's pure hypocrisy. And it has little to do with the issue of whether anyone should be permitted to cross into the U.S. without a visa.But it does serve her party's aim, which is amnesty for more than 11 million largely poor potential voters from Central America who will be receptive to the Democrats' limitless spending.Democrats are aware that amnesty is the electric third rail of U.S. politics, capable of casting out even powerful Republicans such as Eric Cantor. So they've swaddled their calls for amnesty in the faces of babes.That's why there's such an effort to paint illegal immigrants of the border surge as cherubic toddlers who somehow have made their way on a 1,000-mile trek to the U.S. border — and those who oppose open borders as heartless child haters.Yes, small children are among the thousands of Central Americans making the journey from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, and it's their faces the media show.But a Pew study, citing Customs and Border Protection data, notes that of the nearly 40,000 border apprehensions of minors, 35,314, or 10 times as many, were between the ages of 13 and 18, with about 80% of them teenage males.This, by the way, is the prime recruiting pool for the gangs that have driven the violence in their homelands — as well as the violence on U.S. streets where Central American immigrants have located.Some claim to be escaping recruitment into gangs, but that argument holds little water, given that it's the same gangs who are smuggling them to El Norte. Refugees run from those persecuting them, they don't turn to them for help in breaking U.S. law.The more realistic scenario is that there's a sense of now-or-never, given that young people are the prime beneficiaries of White House policies to eventually legalize illegals — from DACA to the Family Interest Directive, which encourage child migration.It all points to the deep cynicism of those who would use children both to demonize those who oppose open immigration and as a wedge to further neuter immigration law altogether. There's a word for it: despicable.

He found refuge with relatives in Miami, but his father, who was separated from his mother, remained in Cuba, later contesting custody and claiming that Elian had been taken without his consent.
"
1558,EL,"As Fox News Latino reported, Gonzalez's Miami relatives had refused to surrender him to authorities, leading to the infamous raid on April 22, 2000, on President Bill Clinton's watch, by armed federal agents who seized Elian at gunpoint from a closet where he was hiding at his uncle's home in Little Havana.

1560,EL,"Humberto Fontova writes in FrontPageMag.com of how Mauricio Vicent, a reporter for Madrid newspaper El Pais, during that first week visited Elian's home town of Cardenas and talked with Elian's father, Juan Miguel, as well as others. What he found destroyed the arguments of the ""Elian belongs with his father"" crowd.
"
1561,EL,"Vicent reported that Juan Miguel always wanted Elian to go to the U.S. and even applied for a U.S. visa after his son was found off Florida. Then Castro apparently made Juan Miguel an offer he couldn't refuse — the safety of those still stuck in the worker's paradise.
"
1562,EL,"It was then-Deputy Attorney General Holder who invented the ""legal"" cover for federal agents to forcibly enter the home of Elian Gonzalez's legal custodians, American citizens all, so he could be returned to the warm embrace of Castro in communist Cuba.
"
1563,EL,"The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled that once the INS chose a guardian, the guardianship could not be changed. On Dec, 1, 1999, the INS asserted that Miami-based uncle Lazaro Gonzalez was now Elian's legal custodian. Holder then decided on his own that the court ruling and the INS determination were both invalid and that Elian would be returned to his father in Cuba.
"
1564,EL,"In an interview with Fox News judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano, Holder, incredibly, insisted that that he ""didn't need a court order"" to seize Gonzalez — after all, he had a pen and a phone — and that the boy ""was not taken at the point of a gun.""

1651,EL,"In a refreshingly powerful and direct statement, Venezuela's bishops Monday blamed ""Marxist socialism"" and ""communism"" by name for the horrors and chaos gripping their country, according to a story in El Universal.The bishops said the long lines of people trying to buy food and other basic necessities and the constant rise in prices are the result of the government's decision to ""impose a political-economic system of socialist, Marxist or communist,"" which is ""totalitarian and centralist"" and ""undermines the freedom and rights of individuals and associations.""The Venezuelan bishops specifically stated that the private sector was critical for the well being of the country. The document, read by Monsignor Diego Padron in Spanish, said the country needs ""a new entrepreneurial spirit with audacity and creativity.""So not only did these bishops diagnose the cause of the misery correctly; they also warned that communism harms the poor most of all.They sounded positively like readers of Investor's Business Daily, matching the content of this editorial here.More interestingly, the timing comes just as a certain former colleague of theirs from another part of South America continues to denounce free-market economiesThe Venezuelan archbishops make the useful observation that if capitalist economies have problems, socialist alternatives are far worse for the poor and needy. Could it be the pope's Latin American colleagues on the ground in the cesspool of communism are the ones who can get through to the holy father on economics? Stay tuned.

1661,EL,"President Obama is leaning on Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto to push Cuba to improve its democracy and human rights record. Seems that with Obama's normalization of ties with Cuba, being leader of the free world has now become just another job Americans won't do.See, in the past, the U.S. was always the nation on the outside, the one that held up the torch of democracy and freedom while Latin America went on as if nothing had ever happened to Cuba's democracy in 1959.Incredibly enough, that's despite the Cuban regime's efforts to subvert those democracies over the years.In the 1960s, Cuban agents invaded and attempted to take over both Venezuela and Colombia, in the latter case starting and financing in 1964 a war — which has yet to end — with the two Marxist narcoterrorist groups, FARC and ELN.In the 1970s, Cuba tried to subvert most of South America through bankrolling local urban terrorists and guerrillas, triggering the terrible Dirty War across the continent. Chile in particular was a target that Fidel Castro attempted to take over completely in 1970. After that, he invaded Africa and then Nicaragua and El Salvador, the damage from which has yet to heal. For his final act, he finally took control of Venezuela in 1998.Yet all these nations have relations with Cuba as if nothing ever happened, while Mexico historically has had a gentlemen's agreement with Castro to provide safe haven to Cuban agents for their operations in the hemisphere in exchange for not fomenting unrest there.That's where we are, and now President Obama has asked the highly co-opted Mexico to act as its point man on human rights for Cuba now that the U.S. is normalizing ties with the island.It's the oddest thing, given that the whole point of normalization was that the U.S. would supposedly be able to talk to Cuba about its barbaric tyranny — its dungeons, its dissident beatings, its arbitrary arrests, its all-pervasive police state.Turns out it's not about that at all. It's about being the good cop, extending travel and remittance cash and trade credits to Castro's Cuba while outsourcing the role of bad cop, the beacon of democracy, to Mexico.It's pathetic.

1682,EL,"Richard Weiss is a key cog in the machinery that outlines how American Century's asset allocation mutual funds play the market in 2015.
"
1683,EL,"He is on the team overseeing the investment strategies for that group of mutual funds.
"
1684,EL,"And he co-manages the firm's nine One Choice target-date funds, its six One Choice target-risk funds, its three Strategic Allocation funds, its Global Allocation Fund and its Multi-Asset Income Fund.
"
1685,EL,"That's $19.6 billion in assets, in addition to his asset-allocation strategy work.
"
1686,EL,"Just before the New Year, IBD asked the 54-year-old El Segundo, Calif.-based Weiss for his thoughts on the best stock investing opportunities in 2015.
"
1687,EL,"IBD: Let's clarify how your fund groups differ from each other, Rich. The One Choice funds whose names include a year, such as $1.5 billion One Choice 2020 Portfolio , are target-date funds, whose mix of stocks and bonds changes as the target date gets near, right?
"
1688,EL,"Weiss: Yes.
"
1689,EL,"IBD: And the One Choice mutual funds whose name includes a description of its investment style are target-risk funds, which some people call lifestyle funds, whose asset mix generally stays the same over time, right?
"
1690,EL,"Weiss: Also correct, with one slight modification. In the target-risk funds, we do make tactical re-allocations from time to time, depending on the intermediate-term outlook.
"
1691,EL,"IBD: And how do the target date and target risk groups differ from the Strategic Allocation funds?
"
1692,EL,"Weiss: The One Choice portfolios are funds of funds. The Strategic Allocation funds invest in individual securities.
"
1693,EL,"IBD: Characterize how all of those portfolios are deployed now, please.
"
1694,EL,"Weiss: In the One Choice and Strategic Allocation portfolios, we have been and remain overweight in equities. At least (in all of 2014).
"
1695,EL,"IBD: How would you describe the stock market's performance in 2014?
"
1696,EL,"Weiss: Without appearing too glib, you can sum up all of 2014 in two letters: U and S. The U.S. dominated, economically and marketwise.
"
1697,EL,"The U.S. showed some of the strongest, if not the strongest, economic growth in 2014 and likely will in 2015 vs. most developed markets and emerging markets.
"
1698,EL,"IBD: What does that tell investors about 2015?
"
1699,EL,"Weiss: We're seeing the bull market get long in the tooth. If you look at sector rotation, the market was led by a handful that are notoriously late-cycle economic sectors. They tend to thrive toward the end of an economic cycle.
"
1700,EL,"IBD: Such as?
"
1701,EL,"Weiss: Utilities, health care, consumer staples. Tech also was strong, but it's a growth sector.
"
1702,EL,"So three of the top four sectors are late-cycle, defensive sectors. Typically, they only lead the market shortly before it turns down.
"
1703,EL,"IBD: Sounds like everyone should dive into the nearest foxhole.
"
1704,EL,"Weiss: We're late (in the) cycle. But the cycle is not over yet.
"
1705,EL,"We remain overweight in equities and in late-cycle growth stocks. We are beginning to diversify and move into more international securities.
"
1706,EL,"U.S. equities outperformed foreign developed markets by about 60 percentage points over the last five years. As a result, U.S. valuations relative to major foreign economies have gotten to historically high levels.
"
1707,EL,"IBD: And what should investors do with that knowledge?
"
1708,EL,"Weiss: I see this as an opportunity to take profits in U.S. equities and diversify into developed foreign markets.
"
1709,EL,"IBD: So which foreign markets appeal to you most?
"
1710,EL,"Weiss: Predominantly in Europe, despite their problems. Even because of their problems.
"
1711,EL,"The valuations metrics are discounting some severe issues in developed markets in the eurozone.
"
1712,EL,"IBD: And which sectors do you prefer?
"
1713,EL,"Weiss: We'd lean to late-cycle growth and utilities. We continue to favor types that did well this year: tech, health care.
"
1714,EL,"Consumer staples are No. 1. We like companies that sell items that consumers need regardless of whether we're headed into a recession or a recovery.
"
1715,EL,"IBD: Do you like some parts of the eurozone better than others?
"
1716,EL,"Weiss: We're staying away from the periphery, where the risks are greatest. We're staying in larger economies — predominantly Germany and France. We also find the U.K. attractive, although it's not formally part of the eurozone.
"
1717,EL,"IBD: Do you like any emerging markets, perhaps some that don't depend on commodity exports?
"
1718,EL,"Weiss: We do have positions in emerging markets in virtually all of our portfolios, but we're not looking to increase those in the near future.
"
1719,EL,"IBD: What about emerging markets that are not big oil exporters?
"
1720,EL,"Weiss: Our stock selection is bottom-up rather than top-down. But we are currently overweight in three countries in our emerging markets funds: China, Peru and Turkey.
"
1721,EL,"IBD: Why is that?
"
1722,EL,"Weiss: We are finding companies in China that benefit from the growth and increasing penetration of modern retail, specifically online retailing.
"
1723,EL,"China also benefits from a loosening of government fiscal policies regarding such things as lending and housing purchases and infrastructure investment.
"
1724,EL,"From an e-tailing perspective, logistics-transportation becomes important too.
"
1725,EL,"We own Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and Vipshop (VIPS) to name a few that benefit from the above themes.
"
1726,EL,"IBD: What about Peru, please?
"
1727,EL,"WEISS: It's overweight due to one stock: Credicorp (BAP), which is a high-quality, well-managed bank.
"
1728,EL,"It benefits from increasing banking penetration in Peru, as well as a resetting of government policies.
"
1729,EL,"IBD: What do you like in Turkey?
"
1730,EL,"Weiss: We favor Ulker Biskuvi, a chocolate and cookies company; and two transportation stocks — TVA Holdings, an airports' operator, and Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.
"
1731,EL,"Those stocks benefit from increasing penetration of modern retail and increasing penetration of air travel.
"
1732,EL,"IBD: What are your sector overweights, and why?
"
1733,EL,"Weiss: Our team selects the most attractive stocks around the world. Country and sector weights are a result of that.
"
1734,EL,"In consumer discretionary, (we like) high, visible space growth opportunities like Pandora, the jewelry company, and Inditex (the Spanish fashion retailer, which owns Zara stores).
"
1735,EL,"Airline, hotel and travel companies benefit directly or indirectly from tightening supply-demand, which is helping to drive pricing improvement. (We also like) beneficiaries from lower energy costs — stocks like Whitbread, the U.K. three-star hotel operator; International Airlines Group, which operates British Airways and Iberia airlines; and Carnival (CCL) cruise line.
"
1736,EL,"IBD: Is your team overweight in tech?
"
1737,EL,"Weiss: Yes. In technology (we like) new product cycles such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6/6+, and the rise of new, lower-cost smartphone original equipment makers focused on growth in emerging markets, like (privately owned handset maker) Xiaomi in China, and chip manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) (TSM), the Taiwan-based foundry company.

1743,EL,"Weiss: In health care, more efficient spending on R&D, combined with benefits of mapping the human genome, is resulting in accelerating new product launches, driving improved revenue growth for the pharmaceuticals industry. (One beneficiary is) Roche (RHHBY), a cancer drug leader and beneficiary of immunotherapy drug development.Richard Weiss is a key cog in the machinery that outlines how American Century's asset allocation mutual funds play the market in 2015.He is on the team overseeing the investment strategies for that group of mutual funds.And he co-manages the firm's nine One Choice target-date funds, its six One Choice target-risk funds, its three Strategic Allocation funds, its Global Allocation Fund and its Multi-Asset Income Fund.That's $19.6 billion in assets, in addition to his asset-allocation strategy work.Just before the New Year, IBD asked the 54-year-old El Segundo, Calif.-based Weiss for his thoughts on the best stock investing opportunities in 2015.IBD: Let's clarify how your fund groups differ from each other, Rich. The One Choice funds whose names include a year, such as $1.5 billion One Choice 2020 Portfolio , are target-date funds, whose mix of stocks and bonds changes as the target date gets near, right?Weiss: Yes.IBD: And the One Choice mutual funds whose name includes a description of its investment style are target-risk funds, which some people call lifestyle funds, whose asset mix generally stays the same over time, right?Weiss: Also correct, with one slight modification. In the target-risk funds, we do make tactical re-allocations from time to time, depending on the intermediate-term outlook.IBD: And how do the target date and target risk groups differ from the Strategic Allocation funds?Weiss: The One Choice portfolios are funds of funds. The Strategic Allocation funds invest in individual securities.IBD: Characterize how all of those portfolios are deployed now, please.Weiss: In the One Choice and Strategic Allocation portfolios, we have been and remain overweight in equities. At least (in all of 2014).IBD: How would you describe the stock market's performance in 2014?Weiss: Without appearing too glib, you can sum up all of 2014 in two letters: U and S. The U.S. dominated, economically and marketwise.The U.S. showed some of the strongest, if not the strongest, economic growth in 2014 and likely will in 2015 vs. most developed markets and emerging markets.IBD: What does that tell investors about 2015?Weiss: We're seeing the bull market get long in the tooth. If you look at sector rotation, the market was led by a handful that are notoriously late-cycle economic sectors. They tend to thrive toward the end of an economic cycle.IBD: Such as?Weiss: Utilities, health care, consumer staples. Tech also was strong, but it's a growth sector.So three of the top four sectors are late-cycle, defensive sectors. Typically, they only lead the market shortly before it turns down.IBD: Sounds like everyone should dive into the nearest foxhole.Weiss: We're late (in the) cycle. But the cycle is not over yet.We remain overweight in equities and in late-cycle growth stocks. We are beginning to diversify and move into more international securities.U.S. equities outperformed foreign developed markets by about 60 percentage points over the last five years. As a result, U.S. valuations relative to major foreign economies have gotten to historically high levels.IBD: And what should investors do with that knowledge?Weiss: I see this as an opportunity to take profits in U.S. equities and diversify into developed foreign markets.IBD: So which foreign markets appeal to you most?Weiss: Predominantly in Europe, despite their problems. Even because of their problems.The valuations metrics are discounting some severe issues in developed markets in the eurozone.IBD: And which sectors do you prefer?Weiss: We'd lean to late-cycle growth and utilities. We continue to favor types that did well this year: tech, health care.Consumer staples are No. 1. We like companies that sell items that consumers need regardless of whether we're headed into a recession or a recovery.IBD: Do you like some parts of the eurozone better than others?Weiss: We're staying away from the periphery, where the risks are greatest. We're staying in larger economies — predominantly Germany and France. We also find the U.K. attractive, although it's not formally part of the eurozone.IBD: Do you like any emerging markets, perhaps some that don't depend on commodity exports?Weiss: We do have positions in emerging markets in virtually all of our portfolios, but we're not looking to increase those in the near future.IBD: What about emerging markets that are not big oil exporters?Weiss: Our stock selection is bottom-up rather than top-down. But we are currently overweight in three countries in our emerging markets funds: China, Peru and Turkey.IBD: Why is that?Weiss: We are finding companies in China that benefit from the growth and increasing penetration of modern retail, specifically online retailing.China also benefits from a loosening of government fiscal policies regarding such things as lending and housing purchases and infrastructure investment.From an e-tailing perspective, logistics-transportation becomes important too.We own Alibaba (BABA), Tencent (TCEHY) and Vipshop (VIPS) to name a few that benefit from the above themes.IBD: What about Peru, please?WEISS: It's overweight due to one stock: Credicorp (BAP), which is a high-quality, well-managed bank.It benefits from increasing banking penetration in Peru, as well as a resetting of government policies.IBD: What do you like in Turkey?Weiss: We favor Ulker Biskuvi, a chocolate and cookies company; and two transportation stocks — TVA Holdings, an airports' operator, and Pegasus Airlines, a low-cost carrier.Those stocks benefit from increasing penetration of modern retail and increasing penetration of air travel.IBD: What are your sector overweights, and why?Weiss: Our team selects the most attractive stocks around the world. Country and sector weights are a result of that.In consumer discretionary, (we like) high, visible space growth opportunities like Pandora, the jewelry company, and Inditex (the Spanish fashion retailer, which owns Zara stores).Airline, hotel and travel companies benefit directly or indirectly from tightening supply-demand, which is helping to drive pricing improvement. (We also like) beneficiaries from lower energy costs — stocks like Whitbread, the U.K. three-star hotel operator; International Airlines Group, which operates British Airways and Iberia airlines; and Carnival (CCL) cruise line.IBD: Is your team overweight in tech?Weiss: Yes. In technology (we like) new product cycles such as Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6/6+, and the rise of new, lower-cost smartphone original equipment makers focused on growth in emerging markets, like (privately owned handset maker) Xiaomi in China, and chip manufacturers like TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing) (TSM), the Taiwan-based foundry company.The intensifying competition among smartphone and other electronics OEMs is resulting in increasing demand for leading edge semiconductor content.

1745,EL,"Immigration: Thousands of illegals are pouring into Texas in a new border surge, following President Obama's executive mass amnesty and refusal to deport. It was as predictable as the sunrise — and raises new questions.Back in late September, Secretary of State John Kerry, speaking with his counterparts from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, warned that the pause in the border surge of families and unaccompanied minors, then some 50,000 or so in each category for the year, was temporary. ""We have to use this time to put in place more efforts, greater efforts to get at the root cause of this, because we know that those numbers may rise again,"" Kerry said.He was speaking of disease prevention efforts rather than an actual halt to the illegal flow of immigrants.And he was right — with the searing heat of summer over, the human surge has resumed, with no apparent U.S. plans or efforts to stop it. This means that in effect, the border surge is likely to become an ordinary feature of life so long as Barack Obama is president.Apprehensions are up about 9% in fiscal 2014, and could go higher in the coming year if current trends continue. A new Department of Homeland Security report (released late last Friday to avoid publicity) showed 486,000 total apprehensions in fiscal 2014 versus about 421,000 in fiscal 2013. That means a lot more people are crossing the border. And there was no word on the 90% or so of arrivals who come in and don't get caught.From the data on those caught, there was a particularly sharp 500% rise in family units — usually single moms with kids in tow. Some 52,000 were apprehended over fiscal 2013. And to top it off, there was a nearly 9% drop in deportations in the same period.Those last numbers in particular point to the reason for the surge: Obama's two-year executive amnesty, announced last month, for about 5 million illegals already in the U.S. who are parents of minors here.Obama handed them work permits that will let them take jobs here, plus a reprieve from deportation — at least so long as he is president.It doesn't take a rocket scientist to recognize that a policy like this for illegals with families is an enormous incentive for more to come here from their homelands illegally, instead of waiting in line as the law-abiding do.And yet the policy still gets little attention, not just because the story was reported last summer during the first surge but also because permitting repeated violations of the law seems to be our president's idea: make law-breaking the norm.

1746,EL,"Emigration: Central American leaders have taken to lecturing the U.S. on the care and feeding of the tens of thousands of their emigrants who have suddenly flooded our southern border. Have they no shame?Apparently they don't, though the Spanish language has a very strong word — sinverguenza — for such gall.Start with Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez. After 37,049 of his countrymen were repatriated by the U.S. after fleeing in 2013, he told Fusion: ""I've asked the United States government to treat this matter with the utmost care from a humanitarian perspective. They are kids in search of their parents, and they have the complete right to be with their parents.""And where has he been the last eight days? Not in Honduras, where the crisis starts, but attending the World Cup in Brazil, in an eight-day extended vacation, missing a critical meeting last week with Vice President Joe Biden, who arrived with $254.6 million in free (for him) U.S. taxpayer cash for the region.Ambassador Jorge Milla Reyes went his boss one better by declaring that the U.S. had probably violated ""international treaties"" in its handling of tens of thousands of his fleeing countrymen, something that perturbed him in a way the conditions in his own country did not.""We have serious doubts about the possibility of a violation of some norms reflected in international treaties,"" he told Reuters, without specifying which treaties the U.S. may have violated.Then there was the Salvadoran ambassador to the U.S., Ruben Zamora. After 21,602 of his countrymen were deported from the states in 2013, he declared that the U.S. must respect ""the universal rights"" of the tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors — who have fled the horrors of his country.Less offensive was the Guatemalan ambassador, Julio Ligorria. He admitted to Univision over the weekend that ""it's essentially lack of opportunities"" in his own country that is driving his people north.And that gets to the nub of it — the absence of working economies in these purported popular (and leftist) democracies.On the Heritage Foundation's 2013 Index of Economic Freedom, Honduras ranked a miserable No. 96 out of 177 countries, below the world average. Labor freedom in particular was low, meaning job creation is all but nil.El Salvador ranked No. 53, with high corruption and a downtrend since the election of a leftist government hostile to capitalism, while Guatemala ranked No. 85. What's more, these three nations are absolutely dependent on remittances as lifelines to their low-growth economies.In El Salvador, remittances comprise 16.5% of GDP, in Honduras, 15.7% and in Guatemala, 10% — far higher percentages than other Latin countries, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Trends Project.With facts on the ground like these, the only appropriate retort to such shameless leaders and envoys is what now-retired Spanish King Juan Carlos famously told Hugo Chavez: ""Porque no te callas?"" — why don't you shut up?
"
1747,EL,"Immigration: A federal employment ad posted in January showing that 65,000 unaccompanied minors will enter the U.S. illegally shows that the administration expected this cross-border child abuse and encouraged it.Concrete evidence has shown up proving our earlier assertion: The breach of our border by waves of unaccompanied alien children was orchestrated by the administration based on a strategy straight out of the playbook President Obama studied as a community organizer. His goal is to get his way on immigration reform by overwhelming the U.S. Border Patrol and collapsing an already weakened system.The evidence comes in the form a government contract solicited in January by the Department of Homeland Security. The listing asked for ""Escort Services for Unaccompanied Alien Children"" in expectation of the arrival of 65,000 minors on our southern border without their parents or guardians.The operative language in the listing is the statement by DHS/Immigration and Customs Enforcement that they expect there ""will be approximately 65,000"" alien minors requiring assistance. This is a significant increase from the 5,000 minors who are detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement annually. It also strongly suggests not only advance knowledge of the human catastrophe about to unfold but a lack of any effort to stop it.Not only have the numbers vastly increased, but the points of origin have changed. No longer are we talking about just poor Mexican families seeking a better life from an ""act of love,"" as one possible 2016 presidential candidate put it. Hondurans, Salvadorans and Guatemalans now make up about 75% of illegals caught in South Texas.The number of children traveling without parents has overwhelmed Border Patrol detention centers along the Texas border, prompting officials to ship them to converted warehouses and military bases as far away as California. The situation is so bad that there is fear we would have no place to put American citizen refugees if another Hurricane Katrina occurs. Some have even called this alien-children invasion Obama's Katrina.This is no act of love, as children are transported by cartels and other human traffickers from Central America and then through 1,800 miles of difficult Mexican roads. They are subjected to the worst abuse along the way, then dumped across the border, where they huddle on warehouse floors in conditions ideal for the spread of infectious diseases.Such a journey is made on the expectation that these children will not be turned away. At a House Homeland Security Committee hearing this week, committee Republicans noted three causes for this influx: Obama executive actions such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program; lax enforcement policies; and talk on both sides of the aisle of comprehensive immigration reform indistinguishable from amnesty.As committee Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul noted in his opening statement:""Newspapers in El Salvador and Honduras seem to be encouraging youth to head to the United States based on these policies. And recent internal DHS surveys of these children reveal that more than 70% believe they are going to stay in the country.""This is a human tragedy of the administration's making. ICE union boss Chris Crane testified last year at a House Judiciary Committee hearing, lodging complaints about the lawlessness behind the ""nation's broken immigration system.""""ICE has essentially prohibited its agents from enforcing"" immigration law, Crane said. ""What message do ICE practices send to the world? The message is: 'We don't enforce our laws, come on over, and if you do get caught, just lie to us. Lie about the day and year you entered, lie about going to high school, you won't be required to prove anything.'""This is a humanitarian disaster as well a political outrage, and the Obama White House wanted it to happen.

1761,EL,"Politics: Hillary Clinton displayed in her Fox interview a chilling combination of cluelessness and obfuscation. Just standing by Susan Rice's Benghazi lies calls into question her qualifications for the presidency.In live sit-down interviews Tuesday on Fox News' ""Special Report"" and ""On the Record,"" the former secretary of state and White House wannabe reached into her bag of clichés and blamed the lie that the Benghazi terrorist attack was caused by that inflammatory video on the ""fog of war.""This, despite the fact that nobody in a position to know that night or now says there was a smidgen of evidence linking the attack to a video.The interviews came ironically — or is it conveniently? — as the administration announced the capture of one of the Benghazi attackers, Ahmed Abu Khattala. As far as we know, he never went to film school. But he was a leader of Ansar al-Sharia, the group that took credit for the Sept. 11 attack.We note that it took two years to grab Khattala, the gentleman the New York Times on Oct. 18, 2012, reported ""spent two leisurely hours on (a) Thursday evening at a crowded luxury hotel, sipping a strawberry frappe on a patio."" During those two years Khattala gave at least five major media interviews.We have the testimony of Gregory Hicks, deputy chief of mission in Libya and a foreign service officer for 22 years. He was demoted to desk officer for telling the truth that those in Libya knew it was a terrorist attack from the ""get-go,"" that there was no ""protest"" or mention of one from anyone on the ground, and that the infamous YouTube video was ""a non-event"" in Libya.Eric Stahl, a recently retired major from the U.S. Air Force, was the commander and pilot who flew the survivors and corpses of the four killed at the Benghazi mission to Germany. Stahl, who — like Clinton — was for some strange reason never interviewed by the State Department's Accountability Review Board, says that none of the survivors knew anything about a spontaneous protest or a video that was repeatedly put forth by her and President Obama as the cause.Then there's the statement of Libyan President Mohamed Yousef El-Magariaf. He told CBS News' ""Face The Nation"" on Sept. 16 that Benghazi was a terrorist attack after then-U.N. Ambassador and now National Security Adviser Susan Rice appeared on five talk shows that Sunday after the attack saying the video was to blame.""It was planned, definitely; it was planned by foreigners, by people who entered the country a few months ago, and they were planning this criminal act since their arrival,"" El-Magariaf said.Recently declassified transcripts of congressional testimony show that Gen. Carter Ham, who at the time headed Africom, the Defense Department combat command with jurisdiction over Libya, testified ""the command very quickly got to the point that this was not a demonstration but a terrorist attack.""And that, Ham said, was the ""nature of the conversation"" he had with then-Defense Secretary Panetta and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey moments before their 30-minute meeting with Obama the night of the attack.There was no ""fog of war,"" only the stench of a cover-up as Obama's claims that al-Qaida was on the run and the war on terror was over were burning in the Libya desert. As we have documented, Clinton may not have just repeated the video lie, as she did to the parents of the dead before their sons' caskets, but is arguably the author of it.As we and others have shown, the language in an email from Obama aide Ben Rhodes used to prep Rice is virtually identical to one issued under Clinton's name 36 hours before — the first public official to mention the video.That Clinton would lie to re-elect a president whose second term was a necessary springboard for her own White House run disqualifies her for any office, let alone the presidency.

1762,EL,"Immigration: As an unprecedented wave of undocumented children from Central America spills over our Texas border, a veteran lawmen's organization has declared it an ""orchestrated"" event. If so, who benefits?To date, there hasn't been a word from the White House or its agencies urging families in Honduras, Guatemala or El Salvador not to send their children alone through Mexico's merciless badlands infested with cartel criminals to reach the U.S. There's some Twitter activity and little else.But the newspapers and television stations throughout Central America are falsely reporting that amnesty will be theirs if they can just make it through the Mexican obstacle course — and that the time to do it is now.It doesn't matter that these children are likely to succumb to desert heat, be snatched by vicious human traffickers, forced into prostitution, slavery or the drug trade, or simply murdered as has already happened to thousands, as the white crosses at the border can attest.Not since the radio broadcasts that triggered Rwanda's Tutsi massacres in 1994 has such false information been spread unchecked by authorities who might be able with just their words to make a difference.U.S. embassy websites still have no warnings to Central Americans about not sending children north, and until recently the U.S. embassy in Guatemala's website prominently featured links to President Obama's campaign website with his speech declaring to Guatemalans that ""our immigration system is broken.""So no wonder the National Association of Former Border Patrol Officers, after 50,000 apprehensions of border crossers in south Texas, declared this week that ""certainly we are not gullible enough to believe that thousands of unaccompanied minor Central American children came to America without the encouragement, aid and assistance of the United States government.""Besides the valuable observations of veteran lawmen who know the patterns of the border and can spot anomalies, the evidence that the flood of illegals is an orchestrated event, and not spontaneous, is piling up.Not long ago, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a foe of illegal immigration, stated that based on evidence he'd seen and conversations he had with lawmen, there appeared to be an ongoing political campaign to destroy law enforcement at the border — something the former border agents called an effort to create ""a failed state"" on the border. If so, it's a page straight out of the Cloward-Piven theory President Obama was so influenced by as a community organizer and at Columbia.Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden, who frequently lets the truth slip out beyond the spin, stated this week that America needs a ""constant"" inflow of immigrants, supporting the argument that the White House is seeking a vast pool of illegal immigrants to ensure a long-term stream of Democrat voters.The strategy is to create chaos — not just to punish political opponents such as Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, whose state is becoming a dumping ground for Obama's catch-and-release policy.The idea of inflicting chaos for political purposes has been White House border policy for some time, based on its Fast and Furious scandal, in which thousands of U.S. weapons were allowed to reach Mexico's cartels. It was done to create chaos in Mexico and the U.S. and, as a result, to whip up public support for gun control.Such a strategy requires political loyalists, not lawmen dedicated to the law first. In 2009, President Obama so badly wanted La Raza board director Mari Aponte as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador that he installed her in the job in a recess appointment.That conflict of interest between U.S. immigration law and La Raza — a group that strongly opposes U.S. immigration law— didn't concern Obama. Indeed, it seemed that was why Aponte appealed to him. And he appointed her despite her anti-American past, including a relationship with an agent of Cuba's secret intelligence service, the DGI. That scuppered her nomination as ambassador to the Dominican Republic in 1998.There will be many who dismiss concerns about an orchestrated campaign. But the signs are everywhere. And there's just one beneficiary to this misery on the border — the Obama White House.

1776,EL,"The State Department's report on human trafficking warns of official complicity, making the problem worse in El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. Well, the same could be said of Team Obama and its policies.Immigration: A report warns that 120,000 illegals will flood our southern border in 2014. That's a crisis. So what's the president doing? Encouraging it with amnesty calls on U.S. embassy websites and La Raza-linked envoys.An ""unprecedented"" wave of illegal-immigrant children is expected to pour over our border from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador this year, the Washington Examiner said, citing Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service sources. That's three times the 24,000 that were arrested last year.The development comes just as the Associated Press reports an accelerating wave of illegals on the southern Texas border, resulting in 148,000 apprehensions from Oct. 1 through May 17, or 1,100 arrests a day.""What these numbers look like is a near-constant flow of people across the Rio Grande,"" the AP said, adding that the figures represent only those who get caught.There are plenty of reasons for this migration wave — from the violence of the drug war in Central America to the leftist governments of the region, notably in El Salvador, that ensure low economic growth.But there's a magnet effect coming from White House policymaking that's also pulling them north.President Obama has talked up the DREAM Act of amnesty for young illegals and browbeaten Congress to pass it, using executive orders when it didn't. He's also let it be known he's not enforcing U.S. deportation laws.Now we have a full-blown refugee crisis. They're convinced that amnesty is theirs if they just reach U.S. soil.Nobody needs to remind them that this is potentially disastrous — 14-year-old children shouldn't be traveling alone, let alone through Mexican cartel territory by themselves. They risk robbery, murder and human slavery, if they aren't forced into the drug trade.So are the U.S. embassies in those countries warning locals about those dangers? Not in the least.On the U.S. embassy website in Guatemala, the front page has a link to Obama's campaign website, which opens to a page reading ""our immigration system is broken,"" in quite an enticing message to would-be illegals.Over in El Salvador, the U.S. ambassador, Mari Carmen Aponte, is a former board member of La Raza, known for its advocacy of illegals as well as pushing immigrants to become Democrat voters.Any sign she's trying to discourage anyone?

The Obama administration justifies the whole farce as a result of overcrowding. But overcrowding is actually the strategy — the more overcrowded, the more excuses for release. Don't look for overcrowding to end — the president benefits too much from this dinner triangle for illegals.
"
1786,EL," Payback for political enemies. Obama benefits not just by pressuring Republicans in Congress to pass amnesty and by creating future Democratic voters, but by using immigration to stick it to political enemies on the right in a way that makes the Chris Christie's traffic antics look amateur.

1837,EL,"Estee Lauder could not stop touching up strangers' faces with her cosmetics in public.She had flawless skin, the result of intensive work on herself, and was a perfectionist about the formulas for her products.""Good was not good enough,"" she wrote in her 1985 autobiography, ""Estee: A Success Story."" ""I know now that obsession is the word for my zeal. I was obsessed with clear glowing skin, shining eyes, beautiful mouths.""The long-term result of her passion is that today Estee Lauder Cos. (EL) has annual revenue of over $10 billion, with 38,000 employees serving 500 million customers, and a stock on a 600% run since 2009.Brooklyn BeginningLauder (1908-2004) was born Josephine Esther Mentzer in Brooklyn, N.Y. Although her immigrant Jewish parents were hardly poor, Lauder would change her name and disguise her origins to create an image that appealed to her upper-crust customers.""Esther's mother, Rose, had been abandoned by her first husband, and she then married a man 10 years younger,"" Joshua Kendall, author of  ""America's Obsessives: The Compulsive Energy That Built a Nation,"" told IBD. ""Anxious to hold on to him, Rose engaged in an elaborate beauty ritual as soon as he left in the morning. Esther became her mother's assistant, and a lifelong addiction to making up women was already under way.""At 16, Esther began peddling the skin creams of her uncle, John Scholtz, a struggling chemist, in New York and while visiting relatives in Milwaukee and Chicago.""She was devastatingly sincere and insistent about the products, knowing that if people tried them they would glow,"" wrote Harold Evans, Gail Buckland and David Lefer in ""They Made America."" ""In chance encounters in elevators, on trains, in hotels and stores, trapped under a hair dryer, no woman was safe.""Lauder wrote that in 1930 she asked a woman at a salon where she got her fine blouse.The woman replied: ""What difference could it possibly make? You could never afford it.""Recalled Lauder: ""I walked away, heart pounding, face burning.""Humiliated, she vowed to become rich.She found one way to get there was marrying businessman Joseph Lauter that year, changing her name in 1937. His calm influence and business management skills would be important ingredients in her move up. One son, Leonard, would become CEO of the company; another, Ronald, led a division and served as chairman.PerseveringBy 1935, she had concessions in beauty salons and was training others, depending on word-of-mouth to grow. But family and friends constantly told her she was wasting her time trying to compete with giant cosmetic companies like Revlon (REV) and Elizabeth Arden (RDEN).Frustrated, she divorced Joseph in 1939 and headed to Miami to start over. But three years later, she realized how much she loved and needed him and returned to New York to remarry.Lauder's lesson is to never be afraid to admit you are wrong and change direction completely.In 1946 she launched Estee Lauder Cosmetics Co. in a former restaurant in Manhattan, cooking up and packaging her formulas. The firm distributed them through salons and high-end department stores such as Bonwit Teller and Lord & Taylor. Unlike most beauty companies, her firm refused to sell to drugstores, which would dilute the luxurious aura of her products.Out Front With SamplesWith no budget to advertise, they relied on sample giveaways. ""She was confident customers would snap up her products once they tried them,"" said Kendall. ""Her competitors thought she was nuts, saying she'd give away the whole business and never get ahead.""Lauder would pioneer other marketing techniques:• Celebrity endorsements.• Getting a gift with a purchase.• A purchase of one product earning a discount on another.• Enclosing promotions with bills sent to users of department store credit cards.• Instant makeovers, now standard at retail beauty counters.The turning point came in 1948. Saks Fifth Avenue's buyer, Bob Fiske, told Lee Israel, author of  ""Estee Lauder: Beyond the Magic,"" that she was pestering him to get her products into the store. When he said he saw no demand, she pledged to prove otherwise.""She spoke at a charity lunch at the Waldorf Astoria and gave away lipsticks in metallic sheathes at a time when plastic was commonly used,"" wrote Evans, Buckland and Lefer. ""Saks was across the street, and at the end of the lunch a long line of women formed up to get into Saks and ask for the Estee lipstick. Fiske gave her an order for $800, and it sold out two days later.""Lauder's lesson is that creative persistence can pay off.As her products spread to other prestige stores, such as Neiman Marcus in Dallas and I. Magnin in San Francisco, she took long train rides to spend a week at the new outlet launch. Eventually she overcame her phobia of flying. ""I have never worked a day in my life without selling,"" she said in a TV documentary, ""Estee Lauder: The Sweet Smell of Success."" ""If I believe in something, I sell it, and I sell it hard.""Lauder's first major hit product came in 1953 with Youth Dew, a strongly scented bath oil. Perfume filled just 1% of the beauty product market, and Youth Dew was a way to motivate women to use more fragrances. To push it, she mailed or gave out blotters soaked in Youth Dew, and demand for the smell made it a best-selling perfume.In 1957, Lauder brought out her next major innovation, a moisturizing cream called Re-Nutriv, charging $115 — worth nearly $1,000 now — for a 16-ounce bottle.By comparison, beauty maven Helena Rubinstein's upscale cream sold at $30 for 8 ounces.Boasting rare turtle oil and royal jelly, as well as ""20 secret ingredients,"" Lauder's sensation earned priceless media coverage, notes Kendall. In 1960 she landed her first overseas outlet, Harrods in London. Company sales rocketed from $1 million that year to $15 million in 1965.New LookThree years later, Lauder's sales came to $40 million, worth $264 million today. Also in 1968, she rolled out Clinique, a line of skin care products that were fragrance-free and allergy-tested and had the blessing of medical doctors affiliated with the company.Clinique was even more exclusive than her other brands, selling in just 287 stores in America. When consumers finally embraced it a decade later, sales hit $80 million, 30% of the company's total.""Only a private company could have tolerated such prudent adventurism,"" wrote Israel.By 1978, Aramis, a men's line of personal care products introduced in 1964 that was also slow to click, was collecting $40 million in sales.Her tradition of innovation continues, with Forbes ranking Estee Lauder Cos. at No. 15 on the 2013 list of world's best at pushing the boundaries of the new.In 1973, Leonard, a Columbia business school graduate who joined the company as a marketer in 1958, was named president on the way to becoming CEO. His mother had handed over day-to-day management to focus on product development and promotion.By the time she retired in 1995, sales had reached $3 billion.Today, Estee Lauder Cos. has two dozen top-selling brands, including MAC, Origins and Aveda, as well as perfumes for fashion icons such as Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan and Tom Ford.Lauder was the only woman on Time magazine's 1998 list of the 20th century's ""most influential business geniuses.""She died six years later at 95. By then, sales had passed $5 billion.

The stock corrected in subdued volume and is now testing its 50-day moving average.If the market were to shift to a confirmed uptrend, Estee Lauder might be in position to recross the 62.08 buy point or bounce off the 50-day line. In both cases, strong volume is needed.Earnings increased 42% in fiscal Q4, ended in June, as sales rose 9%.At the August earnings call, CEO Fabrizio Freda said the sales increase ""was about twice the rate of global prestige beauty, which means we gained share and further strengthened our position as industry leader.""In a weak economy such as the current one, the prestige beauty category often proves resilient even as consumers tighten spending. The prices of lipstick and other beauty products are sufficiently modest to allow women to satisfy the urge to splurge without spending much.Trends also favor Estee Lauder.Freda said China is ""the fastest-growing beauty market."" Estee Lauder's sales in China jumped 28% in local currency in fiscal Q4.The company's footprint in China grew from 38 to 58 cities on a year-ago basis.

""She's very highly energized.""Ulta ended the second quarter with 609 stores in 46 states. It expects to have 675 stores by year-end. The company's long-term guidance is to grow its square footage by 15% to 20% a year.Chen says that long-term goal translates to ""extremely attractive"" square footage growth. He says the sector average in the companies he follows is between 3% and 5%.Wu expects Ulta's sales to rise at around a 20% compound annual growth rate over the next five years as it benefits from mid-single-digit comp growth and ""robust"" store expansion. He says it has the ability to double its store base to about 1,200 locations over time.Chen expects Ulta to keep its momentum as it benefits from strong traffic and pricing growth and new product innovations. It has the opportunity to keep gaining share from department stores, he adds.Ulta is the third-largest company in IBD's Retail-Specialty industry group, after eyewear maker Luxottica Group (LUX) and PetSmart (PETM), and just ahead of GNC Holdings (GNC) and beauty products seller Sally Beauty Holdings (SBH).

2002,EL,"The picture so far this earnings reporting cycle has been quite rosy. Per the latest Earnings Preview, 267 S&P 500 members have reported quarterly results. So far, 76.8% of these companies have delivered positive earnings surprises, while 73.8% beat top-line expectations. Earnings of these companies have increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues have risen 10%.Further, earnings and revenues are well on track to mark the highest growth in seven years. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues rose 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.A Look at Consumer StaplesThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 15 are expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth this season. The Consumer Staples sector being one of them is expected to record earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue increase of 3.1%.The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6% (15 of 16) of all Zacks sectors, thanks to several bottlenecks. The sector has long been grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition. This, in turn, has created significant pricing pressure, compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. Owing to such deterrents, the sector has lost 5.9% in a year, while the S&P 500 market gained 11.7%.Amid such challenges, companies operating in the segment have been trying to keep afloat through innovation, strategic buyouts and restructuring efforts in sync with a changing consumer landscape. Additionally, the recent tax cuts are expected to favor Consumer Staples companies.Considering the diverse factors, let’s see what’s in store for the following stocks when they release their quarterly results on May 2.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP FilterHow Are TAP, KHC, CLX and EL PlacedMolson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is expected to witness year-over decline in revenues in first-quarter 2018, owing to soft sales volumes in the United States. For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, input cost inflation is a concern as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. To top it, Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21%, which dim the possibility of an earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Nevertheless, the company is focused on strengthening its above premium category along with expanding its portfolio through innovation. It has also been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and boost profits. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms, Zacks analysts expect earnings in the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days. (Read More: Will Soft U.S. Volumes Dent Molson Coors Q1 Earnings?)The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) has been experiencing top-line weaknesses for a while, thanks to unfavorable demand conditions in the United States and Canada. Further, the company’s performance in first-quarter 2018 is expected to be dented by increased retail competition in developed markets, Ore-Ida supply deficits as well as the impact of some pricing actions. (Read More: Will Weak Sales Hurt Kraft Heinz's Earnings in Q1?)Owing to such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect only nominal growth in Kraft Heinz’s first-quarter sales. Further, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been striving to boost its performance through savings initiatives, innovations and strategic investments to enhance brand performance. However, such efforts are less likely to reflect in the results this season. Further, owing to its Earnings ESP of -0.20%, a bottom-line beat seems unlikely this time around.The Clorox Company’s (CLX  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance is likely to benefit from dedicated brand management, cost savings and productivity initiatives. Also, it undertakes strategic partnerships to expand capabilities across its online and brick-and-mortar platforms. Recently, management agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. Additionally, it is progressing with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In the light of such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of $1,511 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.However, Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue. Margin was strained by escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of the transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost-saving initiatives, which might continue to drive expenses and hurt profits. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year. Further, Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.33% and a Zacks Rank #4 indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat this earnings season. (Read More: Will Clorox Retain Positive Earnings Trend in Q3?)The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to reflect well-chalked buyouts, innovation, saving efforts, extensive market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network. This cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions, such as BECCA and Too Faced, to enhance its portfolio. It also boasts a strong online business and expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the years to come. Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged as a major sales driver. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by continued investments in emerging markets, particularly Asia, along with double-digit increase in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network.Buoyed by such factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.02-$1.04 for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the prior projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07. Moreover, the company’s Earnings ESP of +0.67% combined with a Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season.  Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management forecasts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter.However, management anticipates lower sales from North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Also, the company has been grappling with gross margin declines for over four quarters now.

2003,EL,"Herbalife Ltd. (HLF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This provider of nutrition and weight management solutions has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 28.6% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store this time.Factors Impacting the QuarterHerbalife remains dedicated toward implementing new technologies and making advancements in the digital space. This is evident from its recently inked deal with Salesforce, which is likely to bring various CRM capacities to Herbalife’s distributors and customers. Moreover, the company remains focused on undertaking innovations in order to align with the changing needs of customers. Incidentally, it launched more than 70 products globally during the fourth quarter. We believe that such efforts are likely to bear a positive impact the company’s performance in the first quarter of 2018.Well, such endeavors to enhance performance, combined with an impressive earnings history have buoyed investor optimism on the stock. Evidently, the stock rallied 67.5% over the past year, in comparison with the industry’s decline of 17.8%. However, Herbalife has been battling soft volumes due to stringent FTC regulations in the United States, which has been marring sales in the North American region. Further, volumes have been weak in the Mexico region, stemming from the impact of earthquakes in 2017. Owing to such headwinds, sales volumes in the North American and Mexico regions tumbled 7.3% and 8.4% respectively, during fourth-quarter 2017. As a result, overall, volume points slid 1.8% to 1.3 billion in the last reported quarter. Such adverse conditions are likely to persist in the aforementioned markets and consequently drag overall performance.That said, lets now take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model as well as expectations for the upcoming quarterly announcement.Which Way are Estimates Moving?The company expects adjusted earnings per share to range from 90 cents to $1.10. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.07, which shows a 13.7% decline from $1.24 recorded in the year-ago period. This estimate has remained stable in the last 30 days.Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Herbalife LTD. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Herbalife LTD. QuoteHowever, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues to climb 1.6% year over year to $1,120 million.

2004,EL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This provider of branded food products delivered a negative earnings surprise in the last reported quarter, though it has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 2.8% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Pinnacle Foods this time around.Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods Inc. Quote Can Revenue-Driving Initiatives Offset Hurdles?Pinnacle Foods should continue gaining from its focus on acquisitions, innovations and robust brand portfolio. Well, the company has a solid customer reach, as its products can be found in over 85% U.S. households. Pinnacle Foods has been undertaking constant innovations to maintain market share. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits, Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles. The company also revealed plans to roll out new products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expand its Hungry-Man Handful line in 2018, which may benefit the quarter to be reported. These factors, along with improved pricing and contributions from its Duncan Hines Grocery and Birds Eye Frozen businesses fueled its top line in the last reported quarter, wherein the company delivered a solid in-market performance. Moreover, the quarter marked Pinnacle Foods’ 15th straight quarter of market share growth.However, sales were somewhat by exit of certain low-margin Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) products, shut down of Boulder UK operations and soft underlying sales. Weakness in underlying sales resulted from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume/mix. Well, AJ exit and underlying sales decline was a major drag for the Specialty Foods segment in particular, as sales here tumbled almost 10% in the fourth quarter of 2017. Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume/mix stemming from the company’s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business. Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Specialty Foods to fall 9.1% to $80 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Birds Eye Frozen (or Frozen) and Duncan Hines Grocery (or Grocery) segments are pegged at $319 million and $260 million, respectively, in comparison with $321 million and $259 million. The consensus mark for sales at Boulder Brands, which is likely to be hurt by shut down of Boulder UK operations, stands at $103 million.Though net sales in the first quarter of 2018 is expected to gain from early Easter, overall top line looks somewhat pressurized from the aforementioned hurdles. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales currently stands at $763 million, reflecting a decline from $766 million reported in the year-ago period.Cost-Savings Efforts vs. Input Cost InflationPinnacle Foods has been battling elevated costs owing to increased packaging and logistics costs. This, along with unfavorable impacts of product mix, increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from the AJ exit remained a drag on gross margin in the last reported quarter. Also, management had earlier projected input cost inflation for 2018 in the range of 3.8-4.2%, with greater inflationary pressure in the first half of the year. This raises concerns over Pinnacle Foods’ upcoming earnings. Nevertheless, we commend the company’s solid productivity initiatives aimed at generating savings and improving gross margin. To this end, the company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. On account of such efforts combined with acquisition synergies and benefits from the network optimization program, the company expects productivity for 2018 in the range of 4-4.5% of cost of products sold. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost gross margin, including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending and realizing synergies from acquisitions. It looks like these dedicated endeavors will help the company tide over all aforementioned hurdles and deliver bottom-line growth.The consensus estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at 56 cents, which marks an improvement of 12% from 50 cents recorded in the year-ago period. However, this estimate has dropped by a notch over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsFurther, our proven model doesn’t show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

2005,EL,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Estee Lauder is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for EL in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for EL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.67% heading into earnings season. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

2006,EL,"Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this leading beauty and cosmetics retailer will be able to deliver earnings beat in the quarter to be reported.Though the company reported positive earnings surprise in the last quarter, it exhibited a dismal earnings trend in the preceding five quarters. Consequently, it has a negative earnings surprise of 35.7% in the trailing four quarters. Further, the company lagged sales estimates in five of the last six quarters. Let’s find out how things are shaping up for this announcement. Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteWhich Way are Estimates Treading?In order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company prior to the earnings release, let’s have a look at the earnings estimate revisions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at a loss of 2 cents per share and has witnessed negative revisions in the last 30 days. However, this compares favorably with a loss of 7 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.4 billion, up 2.4% from the prior-year quarter.Factors at PlayAvon’s troubles are not new though. Dismal earnings and sales trends and fall in Active Representatives are major concerns for Avon for quite some time. We note that Active Representatives were consistently recording a decline in the preceding quarters. Apparently, the company’s top line in the fourth quarter of 2017 was mainly hurt by a decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across all segments, except EMEA. Active Representatives declined higher-than-anticipated, mainly owing to fall in Brazil, which also hurt volumes significantly.Moving ahead, Avon’s top line is likely to remain under pressure due to a tough macro and competitive environment, mainly in its largest markets.However, Avon is on track with its Transformation Plan, which delivered above its cost-saving plan for 2017. Notably, the company surpassed the cost-saving target of $230 million in 2017, realizing cost savings of more than $250 million. Further, it is on track to reach three-year cost savings target of $350 million.Going forward, management is likely to focus on business foundations and improve overall performance to attain the savings target. Furthermore, the company anticipates achieving the long-term target of delivering mid-single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin. Management expects 2018 to be a year of executing significant operational improvements, despite continued competitive pressures.Despite all odds, the company’s shares have improved 6.9% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 4.2%. This indicates that there still remains hope for revival.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Avon is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Avon currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of -66.67%.

2007,EL,"Recently, Katrina Lake, the CEO of Stich Fix (SFIX  -  Free Report), joined the board of growing beauty products company Glossier as their first independent director. This new addition to the team is a big one for the company, seeing as Lake’s success is valued by many.In November 2017, Stich Fix went public, raising $120 million to help with future growth. Stitch Fix is an online subscription and personal shopping service and the reason why it was so important that it went public was because it was the first female led tech IPO. Lake has built an impressive company with more than $1 billion in revenue on $42 million in venture capital. Her company is valued at more than $2.7 billion.According to Fortune, venture capitalists have referred to the Stitch Fix IPO as a “step forward” for many women entrepreneurs.Glossier and Stitch Fix Join Forces With Lake joining Glossier’s team, we can only see potential for success here. Glossier is a company that has been growing throughout the years. In February 2018, Glossier received $52 million in Series C funding, bringing its total funding to $86 million. Glossier has received more than a million views on its Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) page since it was first launched, as well as experiencing 600% year-over-year growth from 2015-2016. Since the launch of the company in 2014, Weiss has introduced 26 products, with the amount still growing.Glossier and Stitch Fix were listed as some of the most disruptive companies as part of LinkedIn’s (MSFT  -  Free Report) Top Companies list. Weiss is excited to have Lake on their team, seeing as she has always been inspired and impressed by her and the way she operates her company.Although still two separate companies, the addition of Lake to the team and her expertise could lead Glossier to become even more successful and allow for further growth. Currently, SFIX is a #2 (Buy) on the Zacks Rank, with a VGM score of ‘C’. The stock closed up 3% to $28.46 per share today.Since Glossier is so popular amongst younger generations, it’s a company investors should want to keep their out for a potential IPO. With Lake on the team, investors will be more aware of Glossier, seeing as both Lake and Weiss have been successful in their respective industries.The Future of GlossierEven though Glossier’s revenues aren’t in the billions like other beauty companies such as L’Oréal (LRLCY  -  Free Report) or Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report), it still has made a name for itself in the market. Weiss does a commendable job creating products that are what her consumers want and looking to purchase. With these two CEOs on the board of directors, we can only expect good things from this company and eventually look towards an IPO in the future.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

2008,EL,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been mainly riding on buyouts, solid online growth and strong travel retail network. These factors, which have been fueling the company’s stellar earnings surprise record, are likely to continue driving its ongoing performance.Though the company has been battling sluggish retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores, it looks like the aforementioned upsides will help the cosmetics biggie sustain the robust momentum. Markedly, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has rallied a whopping 62.3% in a year, easily crushing the industry’s 31.5% upside.Acquisitions Boost Top LineThe acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened Estee Lauder’s fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018. The company’s previous moves in this regard include the buyout of sophisticated Paris-based brand, By Kilian, and the takeover of key prestige skin care brands, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW.Apart from skin care, Estee Lauder has acquired high-end fragrance and lifestyle brand, Le Labo (The Lab), and high-end fragrance brand, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle.

Estee Lauder remains focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Travel Retail to Drive Sales FurtherEstee Lauder has been strongly focused on enhancing its travel retail business.

2009,EL,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) has been climbing up the charts after it reported impressive results in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Results were driven by the company’s solid strategic efforts along with excellent marketing and store-growth initiatives, impressive e-commerce improvement and continued progress on salon operations. Also, it raised fiscal 2018 GAAP earnings view.As a result, the company’s shares were up nearly 2.5% since May 31, when it released the quarterly results. In the past three months, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has advanced 21.9%, outperforming the industry’s 10.2% upside.Additionally, analysts are growing bullish on the stock as apparent from the solid uptrend in earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.92 for fiscal 2018 and $12.76 for fiscal 2019 moved north 16 cents and 2 cents, respectively, in the last 30 days. Also, Ulta Beauty has an impressive long-term earnings growth rate of 18.6% and a VGM Score of A. Let’s delve deep.Solid Q1 Results & Surprise TrendUlta Beauty has an impressive surprise history on both earnings and revenue fronts. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company reverted to its more than three-year long positive earnings trend, after a miss in the preceding quarter. Also, it reported sales beat in 16 of the last 18 quarters. Both the top and bottom line also improved year over year. Results were fueled by enhanced market share gains, strength in loyalty program, solid e-commerce business and other growth initiatives. Additionally, favorable traffic drove comparable store sales (comps) growth in the quarter.Ulta Beauty is also known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. Notably, the company registered e-commerce sales growth of 48% in first-quarter fiscal 2018, which reflects about 340 basis points (bps) of the total comps growth. This upside was driven by traffic growth of 38% and mobile traffic surge of 52%. For fiscal 2018, management anticipates e-commerce sales to grow in the 40% range.Based on the above-mentioned tailwinds, management raised its GAAP earnings per share view. The metric is projected to grow in the low 20% range versus the earlier guidance of roughly 20% range.Growth InitiativesUlta Beauty’s loyalty program is significantly contributing to the company’s results, thus boosting the top line and profitability. In fact, it was one of the major sales drivers in first-quarter fiscal 2018. The company also increased its Ultamate Rewards membership by 17%, courtesy of its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors as well as in-store conversions. Meanwhile, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained solid in the quarter.Furthermore, the company remains committed to its store-expansion endeavors and enhancement of its supply chain capabilities apart from strengthening its e-commerce business. Evidently, it is on track to open 100 stores in fiscal 2018.Ulta Beauty has also created a niche market backed by the sold mix of beauty products it offers. Currently, the company’s stores are a one stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, featuring prestige and discount beauty brands, and offering salon products and services, all under one roof. Additionally, it remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings besides improving store traffic with superior services. Notably, Ulta Beauty rolled out The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand in fiscal 2017. We believe all these afore-mentioned initiatives to increase the company’s market share and boost profitability.Wrapping Up While all the above factors speak well about Ulta Beauty, we note that the company has been grappling with soft margins due to higher SG&A and pre-opening expenses. Although operating margin is expected to contract in the band of 50-70 bps in fiscal 2018, we believe Ulta Beauty’s robust strategies to offset margins decline going ahead.Want Top-Ranked Retail Stocks, Count on TheseBig 5 Sporting Goods Corporation (BGFV  -  Free Report) pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 10.5% in the last four quarters.

2010,EL,"Demand for everyday-use products created by operators in the Consumer Staples space doesn’t tend to fluctuate a lot, but it is nevertheless exposed to macroeconomic forces at the margins. As such, the outlook for this space perks up as the outlook for the U.S. and global economy improves.The outlook for the U.S. economy has been favorable for the last several years, with the recent tax legislation expected to add to the longevity of the current U.S. expansion cycle. In addition to the indirect benefits to Consumer Staples companies from the tax cuts, these companies also stand to benefit directly from the legislation, as reflected in the improving earnings outlook for many companies. That said, Consumer Staples operators tend to be global in their operations and as such don’t benefit to the same extent from U.S. tax law changes as the more domestic companies. With growth hard to come by for companies in this mature space, Consumer Staples players have to remain focused on squeezing more out of their operations and coming out with revenue-boosting initiatives, which mainly include efforts to keep pace with the changing consumer patterns.On that note, let’s delve deeper in some of the major growth-driving strategies of the space.Strengthening Product Portfolio via Strategic Alliances, Buyouts Consumer staples companies are regularly undertaking both domestic and international acquisitions to expand their product lines and gain access to new markets. Some of these are also forming partnerships, mostly with larger and better-known companies, to strengthen their distribution networks, diversify portfolios, expand their reach and enhance market positioning. Notably, leveraging each other’s efficiencies creates significant synergies for companies that go for M&A activities.Mergers of Tyson Foods (TSN  -  Free Report) with packaged meat producer The Hillshire Brands (in August 2014); tobacco giants Reynolds American and Lorillard (in June 2015); food giants Kraft Foods Group, Inc. KHC and H.J. Heinz Company (in July 2015) and consumer goods companies Newell Brands (NWL  -  Free Report) and Jarden (in 2016) were the most talked about deals. Belgium-based brewer Anheuser Busch InBev’s BUD buyout of SABMiller in October 2016 also created a buzz in the beverage industry. Apart from this, Molson Coors (TAP  -  Free Report) acquired SABMiller plc’s 58% stake in MillerCoors, which made the former the third-largest brewer in the world, after Anheuser-Busch InBev and Heineken.Cost Cutting and Restructuring InitiativesMost consumer staples companies are implementing cost-reduction initiatives to boost profits. In the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reducing overheads and fuelling bottom-line performance. Colgate CL has also been benefiting from its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, which focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share worldwide.Additionally, Sysco’s (SYY  -  Free Report) core strategies for 2020 include plans to optimize business and achieving operational efficacy. We also commend Kimberly Clark’s KMB 2018 Global Restructuring & Focus on Reducing Costs Everywhere (FORCE) programs, which are expected to generate cost savings of more than $2 billion over the next four years. Companies like McCormick MKC, Coca-Cola KO, Molson Coors, Mondelez International MDLZ, Smucker (SJM  -  Free Report), Kellogg K and many others have also been benefiting from significant cost savings and restructuring initiatives to boost earnings.Focus on InnovationInnovation remains the guiding principle of consumer staples companies as it enables them to enhance brand appeal through product differentiation and capture market share across all regions and categories. Thus, companies put a lot of thrust on innovation to upgrade their brands and create differentiated value propositions. Notably, constant innovations supported by efficient marketing are essential for consumer staples companies to stay ahead of competition.As evidence, novelty has been a driving force for consumer product giants like The Procter & Gamble Co. (PG  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive, and cosmetic majors like Estee Lauder EL. These companies constantly come up with new products that suit changing consumer trends, to tap demand and boost revenues. Also, major food companies like Smucker and Campbell Soup CPB, alcohol stocks like Brown-Forman BF.B and Constellation Brands (STZ  -  Free Report), and even tobacco players like Altria (MO  -  Free Report) and Phillip Morris (PM  -  Free Report) have been adding new products to gain competitive edge and augment market share.Exiting Underperforming Units to Enhance OperationsApart from growing their businesses through buyouts, companies also remain focused on improving their product portfolios through divestitures. Offloading underperforming operations enables the companies to concentrate on the core and profitable areas.For example, as part of its strategic business review following its merger with Jarden, Newell Brands announced plans to sell nearly 10% of its current portfolio, including a major chunk of its Tools segment. This highlights the company’s focus on simplifying its operating structure, alongside highlighting its commitment toward making prudent investments in areas with higher growth potential. Similarly, Unilever (UL  -  Free Report) announced plans to sell its shrinking Spreads business to KKR (in December 2017) to shift concentration on fast-growing products.Adopting E-Commerce Mantra: The Need of the HourWith technology having advanced by leaps and bounds, online shopping has become the order of the day. Thanks to various mobile apps and dot.com business lines, shopping for anything is literally on consumers’ finger-tips. Consumers’ rapid shift to e-marketplace has compelled companies to adopt the e-commerce mantra. Companies like United Naturals (UNFI  -  Free Report), SUPERVALU (SVU  -  Free Report), Campbell Soup and Estee Lauder among others, are striving to enhance e-commerce space, through investments in technology and infrastructure.Driven by these efforts, United Natural Foods’ e-commerce sales jumped almost 28.9% in the second quarter. As for SUPERVALU, the company’s contract with Instacart, along with endeavors to upgrade website and mobile applications underscore its knack to enhance consumer shopping experiences.Transition to Health and Wellness ProductsAs consumer preference is the life blood of Consumer Staples, companies have to adapt to evolving trends to stay strong in the industry. A key trend over the last few years has been the desire for natural and organic products, prompting many players in the space to come out with health and wellness offerings. This is the case with almost all industries in the sector.Apart from this, tobacco companies like Altria and Reynolds American are also adapting to the evolving needs of consumers and have resorted to less harmful alternatives like electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). To cater to changing consumer preference, Philip Morris launched the much talked about IQOS, a smokeless cigarette in November 2014, aiming to lead the tobacco industry’s push into reduced-risk products. IQOS is anticipated to boost market share and offset declining volumes in traditional cigarette business over the long term.Additionally, rising consumer awareness regarding the harmful impact of toxic chemicals has been driving the market share for organic personal care products too. Consequently, players like Unilever are making solid progress in the natural and organic products category. This is evident from its deal to buy Schmidt’s Naturals that specializes in personal care products such as deodorants, toothpaste and bar soaps. Clearly, these robust efforts are expected to boost the companies’ top line in the future.Clearly, the consumer staples space offers plenty of reasons to be optimistic about it over the long term.

2011,EL,"TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (THS  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for TreeHouse Foods this time around. TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise   TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | TreeHouse Foods, Inc. Quote Headwinds Looming Over TreeHouse FoodsTreeHouse Foods’ last reported results marked its third consecutive quarter of year-over-year decline in earnings and sales. The company has been bearing the brunt of pricing pressure stemming from stiff competition in the grocery industry. This, along with commodity cost inflation and rising freight costs has been marring TreeHouse Foods’ DOI margin for a while now.These factors were reflected in the fourth quarter, wherein earnings bore the brunt of soft sales and margins, whereas revenues were marred by divestiture of SIF (Canned Soup and Infant Feeding) business. Divestiture of SIF business led to reduced sales at Baked Goods and Meals segments. Further, intense industry competition pressurized pricing in most segments, while volume/mix also remained challenged in the Meals segment. Apart from this, higher freight and commodity costs weighed upon the company’s direct operating income (DOI) margin, which marked its second consecutive quarter of year-over-year contraction.Can Strategy for 2020 Provide Respite?The company remains on track with its TreeHouse 2020 strategic plan that was announced in second-quarter 2017. The plan was designed to restructure and realign the business as a whole. Alongside of cost savings, the initiative is expected to manage the company’s portfolio and optimize production and supply chain.  TreeHouse 2020 aims to improve the company’s operating margin by 300 bps by the end of 2020, by undertaking complete business integration and expense reduction.However, it looks like these efforts will take time to offset the hurdles completely. Unfortunately, management expects input cost inflation to remain a headwind in 2018, wherein freight costs are also expected to be a major deterrent. These hiccups also weighed on management’s guidance for the first quarter. Earnings for the first quarter are expected in the range of 10-20 cents per share, which shows a year-over-year decline due to soft volumes, operational inefficiencies, and the unfavorable timing of elevated commodity and freight costs with respect to pricing.The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to slump 77.1% year over year to 14 cents. This estimate has remained stable over the past 30 days. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $1,427 million, down from $1,536 million recorded in the year-ago period.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that TreeHouse Foods is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Even though TreeHouse Foods has an Earnings ESP of +1.03%, the company’s Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) makes surprise prediction difficult. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 going into earnings announcements.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

2012,EL,"Molson Coors Brewing Company (TAP  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 2. This global brewer has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see what’s in store for Molson Coors this time around. Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise   Molson Coors Brewing Company Price and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company Quote Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterWe expect Molson Coors to continue gaining from its solid focus on cost savings, which have been driving year-over-year growth at its bottom line for nearly a year now. Notably, the company has been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce overhead costs and boost profitability. These initiatives include closure of underperforming breweries, improving efficiencies in finance, administration and human resources and reducing labor and general overhead costs. Also, the company has been focusing on improving supply chain network and building on efficiencies across the business to generate additional resources to invest in brand building and innovation. These endeavors helped Molson Coors generate cost savings of more than $255 million in 2017 that surpassed its target by more than $80 million. Encouraged by this, management raised its three-year savings goal (up to 2019) to $600 million, which is likely to help the company expand its EBITDA margins. These dedicated efforts give out positive signals for the quarter to be reported as well.However, input cost inflation remains a concern, as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. Incidentally, for 2018, the company expects cost of goods sold per hectoliter to increase in low-single-digits across all segments, except International. These factors may act as hurdles in the company’s upcoming release.Can Molson Coors Cheer Investors? Molson Coors’ top line has been gaining from focus on strengthening brand portfolio. Armed with a robust portfolio of well-established brands, the company has been steadily progressing with growth of its above-premium segment. Impressively, the company has also been gaining share in the premium light segment in the United States through Coors Light and Miller Lite brands. We believe the company’s shift of focus on expanding the above premium category along with solid innovation program is likely to positively impact the upcoming quarter.However, we remain cautious about the company’s U.S. volumes, which remained soft and ended up hurting Molson Coors’ overall worldwide brand volume as well as its financial volumes in the last reported quarter. In fact, Molson Coors has been posting weak beer volumes in the United States for quite some time owing to tough industry conditions. Consumers’ changing preferences, aging population and strong competition from other alcohol beverages have been the main contributors to the decline.A Look Back & Expectations for Q1Molson Coors ended 2017 on a superb note as in the fourth quarter, both the top and bottom line improved year over year and the latter also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were backed by sales growth in most regions (except United States), favorable global pricing, net pension benefits, greater royalty volumes, cost-saving benefits, MG&A efficiencies and cycling of indirect tax provision. However, the U.S. region continued with its dull volumes, as it witnessed a decline in both sales-to-retailers (STRs) volume and sales-to-wholesalers’ volume, which fell 3% and 1.5%, respectively. These factors pose concerns over the company’s top line for the quarter to be reported.For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales in Central Europe to dip 1.8% year over year to $375 million. The consensus marks for net sales in Canada and International is pegged at $288 million and $66 million, compared to $291 million and $62 million reported in the year-ago period respectively. Also, the consensus estimate for U.S. sales stands at $1,734 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for overall revenues is $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million recorded in the year-ago period.Nevertheless, management remained impressed with its performance amid the tough market conditions. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms and focus on First Choice, we remain optimistic about Molson Coors prospects. Well, underlying tax rate for the year is likely to range 18-22%, which is considerably low and also makes us hopeful about first-quarter earnings. The Zacks analysts expect earnings for the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that Molson Coors is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Molson Coors Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21% makes us less confident about earnings beat. In fact, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Strong Sell) going into earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat:Church & Dwight (CHD  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +0.52%.

2013,EL,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter 2018 results on May 3. This consumer goods behemoth has surpassed earnings estimates for five consecutive quarters now, courtesy of its robust international presence, solid organic sales trend and focus on buyouts. However, the company is plagued by escalated expenses, which remain a threat to margins. So, let’s see if Church & Dwight can keep its splendid surprise streak alive this time around as well. Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Co., Inc. Quote International Business: A Major StrengthWe expect Church & Dwight to continue gaining from its international business, which has been a growth driver over the past few years. In fourth-quarter 2017, organic sales in the international segment jumped 5.8%, courtesy of higher volumes. Further, overall international sales surged 33.3%, receiving considerable impetus from STERIMAR and OXICLEAN in the export business; STERIMAR, ARM & HAMMER toothpaste and OXICLEAN in Mexico; and ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Well, ARM & HAMMER remains the company’s biggest international brand, which is well placed to grow further in emerging markets. Well, international sales have also been contributing strongly to the company’s organic sales growth. Thus, the company continues to invest in the international consumer business to sustain its strong sales growth, as evident from its considerable investments in Southeast Asia and China. Also, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business and expects its international operations to remain strong,Markedly, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales from Consumer International to surge 20.3% to $172 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of Consumer Domestic and Specialty Products segments are pegged at $728 million and $78 million, respectively, in comparison with $660 million and $74 million reported in the year-ago period.Other DriversChurch & Dwight is also likely to continue witnessing organic sales growth, which has long been backed by the company’s solid focus on product innovations. Evidently, organic sales jumped 2.3%, 1.8%, 3.2% and 3.4% in the first, second, third and fourth-quarter 2017, respectively. In the fourth quarter, organic sales growth was driven by higher volumes and better-than-expected sales at all the three segments. In 2018, management expects organic sales to grow 3%, which also gives out positive signals for the quarter to be reported. In fact, for first-quarter 2018, the company expects organic sales growth of 2%.Apart from these factors, Church & Dwight has been benefiting from its focus on acquisitions. The company started with only one brand, i.e. ARM & HAMMER and since then has acquired a number of brands which are generally number-one or number-two brands with high margin. These businesses are likely to have boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004, to reach $4 billion in 2018. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter and is on track with its integration.Considering all aforementioned factors, management projects first-quarter reported sales growth to be 11% year over year. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is $979 million, up 11.6% from $877 million recorded in the year-ago period.Will Cost Woes be Offset?However, Church & Dwight continues to battle increased commodity and transportation costs. Management expects these headwinds to weigh on gross margin in 2018. Further, the company plans to increase marketing expenditure, while it also expects SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales) to increase, owing to intangible amortization expenses, integration costs and higher levels of SG&A from recent acquisitions. This may impact the operating margin.Nevertheless, it looks like the company expects strength of its international business and revenue-driving initiatives to compensate for these obstacles, as it envisions adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents for the first quarter, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.3% (on an adjusted basis). This also falls in line with the Zacks consensus estimate that has remained stable over the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsTo top it, our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Church & Dwight carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with its Earnings ESP of +0.52%, makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Other Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Under Armour (UAA  -  Free Report) a Zacks #3 Ranked stock, has an Earnings ESP of +11.31%.

2014,EL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is slated to report first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 27, before the market opens. Last quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Colgate has been popular with investors for its meet or beat earnings track record. Notably, it delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. Moreover, the company delivered an average positive surprise of 0.38% in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether or not this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.

Further, it is progressing well with its Global Growth and Efficiency Program, along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. It remains confident of the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives, which are likely to boost results in 2018.Consequently, the company expects net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth in low- to mid-single digit this year. The company anticipates strong volumes and pricing growth in 2018. Further, it projects gross margin to expand, driven by robust pricing and productivity gains from the funding-the-growth initiatives. These factors, along with benefits from the tax reform, are expected to boost GAAP earnings in double-digits, while adjusted earnings are anticipated to increase nearly 10%.However, Colgate has been witnessing strained margins, of late, due to higher raw material and packaging costs, as well as advertising expenses. Though the company expects improved adjusted gross margin in 2018, it anticipates advertising costs to remain high, which might hurt the operating margin. Moreover, it expects the backdrop to remain challenging in 2018.Given the mixed sentiment, the company’s shares have declined 10.5%, year to date. However, this compares favorably to the industry’s decline of 12.4%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.

However, the company recorded an average positive surprise of 3.1% in the last four quarters.What to Expect?The question lingering on investors’ minds is whether V.F. Corp. will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 65 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 18.2%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $2.9 billion, up 12.8% from the year-ago quarter.V.F.

Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has outperformed the industry in the past year, where its shares have increased 52.6% while the industry grew 34.7%.Factors at PlayV.F. Corp. is gaining from its progress on the 2021 growth strategy, which focuses on responding to the changing marketplace while targeting shareholder returns. The company’s focus on this plan is evident from the growth in direct-to-consumer and digital businesses as well as the international segment, which are among the key aspects of the 2021 plan.Additionally, the company is gaining from strength in the international and direct-to-customer platforms, Outdoor & Action Sports coalition and workwear businesses. Moreover, contributions from the recently-concluded Williamson-Dickie buyout are aiding results. The company’s shareholder-friendly moves also bode well.V.F. Corp. provided an encouraging view for the transition period. It expects revenues of nearly $2.9 billion, an increase of 16%. This includes a $200-million contribution from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Excluding the acquisition, revenues are likely to increase at a high-single-digit rate. The company envisions adjusted earnings per share for the transitional period to be around 65 cents, marking 27% growth, including a contribution of 2 cents from the aforementioned acquisition. Excluding effects of this acquisition, adjusted earnings per share are estimated to increase more than 20%.However, currency woes, which impacted gross and operating margins in the fourth quarter of 2017, continued to be a hurdle. Further, the company is being troubled by a difficult global economic environment for over a year now.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that V.F.

2019,EL,"Helen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) is slated to release first-quarter fiscal 2019 results on Jul 9. This consumer products player has delivered positive earnings surprise for eleven straight quarters now. Let’s see what’s in store for the company this time around.Helen of Troy Limited Price and EPS Surprise  Helen of Troy Limited Price and EPS Surprise | Helen of Troy Limited QuoteFactors Driving Helen of TroyHelen of Troy is likely to continue gaining from its Transformation Plan, which concentrates on making investments in core areas, undertaking customer-centric innovations, undertaking prudent mergers and acquisitions, building superior shared services, making upgrades to workforce and systems, and reducing wastage to improve quality and curtail costs. These factors drove Helen of Troy in the last reported quarter, wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results were driven by solid performance by Leadership Brands along with growth in online sales. Markedly, Helen of Troy has been focused on making solid investments in its Leadership Brands, which are considered most productive as they have been delivering robust results.To this end, the company is on track with its investments in product launches, marketing efforts and e-commerce strategies for these brands, which are the highest margin, greatest volume generating and most efficient businesses for the company. Further, the company is likely to keep gaining from its consistent online sales and digital marketing efforts, on the back of which online sales increased in all three segments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Talking of segments, the company’s Health & Home unit delivered one of its best quarters in a long time.Will the Hurdles Be Offset?However, the company’s Beauty segment sales did not witness even a single quarter of year-over-year growth, throughout fiscal 2018. The Beauty segment has been suffering from softness in personal care category, mainly due to tough competition. In the fourth quarter, Beauty segment sales fell 2.1% on account of weakness across brick and mortar channels. Further, Beauty sales are projected to dip in low to mid-single digits in fiscal 2019, which remains a concern for the top line in the quarter under review as well.Also, on the cost front, the company witnessed contraction in gross and operating margin in the fourth quarter. Gross margin fell 30 basis points, due to increased promotions and adverse channel mix. Further, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales escalated 60 basis points on account of increased incentive compensation, and higher advertising and new product development costs, among others.Well, overall rise in commodity and transportation costs creates a competitive pricing environment, which keeps margins under pressure. Moreover, management expects fiscal 2019 bottom-line growth to be hit by a rise in investments to fuel the company’s Leadership Brands.  Nonetheless, the aforementioned growth drivers as well as Helen of Troy’s Project Refuel should help the company overcome these hurdles. The Project Refuel restructuring plan was initiated to improve the performance of the company’s Beauty and Nutritional Supplements units. After the sale of Nutritional Supplements, management continues to target generating annualized profit growth of nearly $8.0 million over the tenure of this strategic plan.Q1 Estimates in NumbersAnalysts polled by Zacks expect total revenues of $333 million, down 7.5% from the year-ago period. The current consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.33, which shows a 3.9% jump from the year-ago period. Notably, the earnings estimates witnessed a 6.7% uptrend in the past 30 days.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t show that Helen of Troyis likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.  For this to happen, the stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

2020,EL,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 1.87%.This consumer goods company delivered a positive earnings surprise in each of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.72%.Factors to ConsiderProcter & Gamble has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries. Overall, the soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes.That said, this conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales.Although the company did not provide any sales guidance for the fiscal second quarter, Procter & Gamble remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018. Its innovation-led products like premium Olay and SK-II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Procter & Gamble anticipates 3% growth in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected in the range of 2-3% (read more: Will New Products Lift Procter & Gamble's Q2 Sales?).Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17.34 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 4.1%. Revenues of the company are likely to increase 2.9% year-over-year.Despite muted sales growth, the company has exceeded analysts’ expectations for the 10th consecutive quarter. Procter & Gamble has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost-saving plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last two reported quarters, as productivity savings were more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Then again, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending has helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. The trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter as well.Overall, for the to-be-reported quarter, the company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs that have heightened further by the recent hurricanes. The company expects higher commodity costs, including pulp, kerosene, ethylene, and propylene, to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category is likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings and share repurchases will partly offset these woes (read more: How Procter & Gamble's Margins Will Shape Up in Q2).For the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.15, reflecting a growth of 6.5% year over year.Here is what our quantitative model predicts.Procter & Gamble has the right combination of ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Procter & Gamble is +0.87%.

The company’s shares have surged 3.1%, compared with industry’s growth of 1%.Factors Driving this QuarterColgate is encouraged by the progress on the Global Growth and Efficiency Program along with additional savings anticipated from the recent expansion of the program. The company’s board on Oct 26 approved an expansion and extension of the program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million, compared with $425-$475 million estimated earlier. The projected savings target a three to four year average cash payback, with an after-tax rate of return above 30%.Moreover, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles for Colgate’s growth strategy over the years, enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. The company is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. It has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets. For example, the brand will be interpreted differently in India and China. Moreover, the company anticipates growing market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.However, the company’s margins continue to be strained due to increased raw material and packaging costs, as well as higher advertising expenses. Further, it anticipates these costs to persist and impact margins in 2017. Additionally, management has perked up costs guidance related to charges arising from the expansion and extension of the Global Growth and Efficiency Program.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.

2022,EL,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell. The bottom-line results of this leading distributor of spices, seasonings and other specialty food products outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimates in three out of the preceding four quarters, with an average beat of 4%.Considering this, let’s delve into how things are shaping up for the upcoming announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 has been stable over the past 30 days at $1.52 and $4.22, respectively. Expected earnings for the quarter under review and the fiscal 2017 depict a growth of 19.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figure. Notably, management expects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.20-$4.24 per share.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,475 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.2% from sales recorded in the year-ago quarter. Also, the consensus mark for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at $4.82 billion, reflecting a rise of 9.3% from fiscal 2016 sales.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteFactors at PlayAcquisitions have long been favoring McCormick’s performance, aiding the company to develop a robust product portfolio. To this end, McCormick’s buyout of the food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, in August 2017, deserves special mention. Apart from adding iconic brands to McCormick’s portfolio, the deal led to sales growth in the industrial and consumer business segments of the company during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. In fact, the acquisitions of Reckitt Benckiser and Enrico Giotti SpA contributed to sales growth in the third quarter. Further, the company continues to expect positive synergies from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group.Driven by such factors, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales growth for the fourth quarter related to consumer and industrial business segments are currently pegged at 0.18% and 0.25%, respectively.Moreover, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017 to reflect the positive impacts from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group and lower currency. The company expects sales to grow approximately 9-10% in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous range of 4-6%. Excluding currency, McCormick expects sales to grow approximately 10-11% in fiscal 2017, compared with the previous band of 5-7%.McCormick’s cost-saving and productivity-enhancing initiatives through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program have also been positively impacting performance. Owing to the cost-savings efforts, the company delivered double-digit adjusted operating income growth in the third quarter and expanded adjusted operating income margin by 140 basis points. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of margin expansion. McCormick expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017, up from the previous expectation at least $100 million expected previously.Although the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s margins of late. Prices of majority of the raw materials including cinnamon, oregano and rice along with packaging costs have been rising for a while. Further, in fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. McCormick’s increased spending on brand marketing also poses adequate threats of lowering profits. However, we expect the company to offset the impact of such hurdles through efficient pricing strategies.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show that McCormick is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although McCormick carries a Zacks Rank #3, its Earnings ESP of -0.49% makes surprise prediction difficult.

We note that this cosmetics giant has delivered positive earnings and sales surprise for 14 and four consecutive quarters, respectively. This exceptional performance can be attributed to the company’s well-chalked buyouts, innovations, savings efforts, strong market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network.On the flip side, the company has been facing receding traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Moreover, the company’s gross margins have been strained for a while now, thanks to a mix of factors.On that note, let’s see if Estee Lauder’s growth can counter the aforementioned hurdles and aid it in maintaining its spectacular surprise streak alive this time.Acquisitions to Boost ResultsThis cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have been strengthening its fastest-growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Estee Lauder’s investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is likely to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods. The company’s previous moves in this regard include the buyout of By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW. Apart from skin care, Estee Lauder has also acquired high-end fragrance and lifestyle brands such as Le Labo (The Lab) and Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

Quote E-commerce & Travel Retail to Drive GrowthEstee Lauder has a strong online business and the company expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years. The company has been constantly implementing digital experiences such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. Further, Estee Lauder is focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged a major sales driver for the company. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by the company’s continued investments in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, along with double-digit increases in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network. Well, the company is committed toward undertaking greater strategic efforts to enhance travel retail business.Forecasts Look BrightBuoyed by the aforementioned factors, the company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $1.02-$1.04 per share for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the previous projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings for the said period is currently pegged higher at $1.07.Further analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management predicts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter. Foreign currency is expected to positively impact sales by 3%. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 9-10%.  Can Efforts Offset Hurdles?Persisting concerns surrounding lower sales in North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores has been a concern for Estee Lauder for quite some time. Also, the company is cautious about social, economic and political issues that could affect consumer spending in few countries. Further, the company has been struggling with gross margin declines for more than four quarters now.Nevertheless, we expect the company to overcome the impacts of such hurdles with the help of the aforementioned growth drivers. Moreover, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. All these upsides, along with expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keep management encouraged about continuing with its sturdy performance in the second half and fiscal 2018.

As part of this multi-year program, the company will reduce global workforce outside the United States by 15%. The program is intended to improve overall operating margin through supply chain optimization, a streamlined operating model and reduced administrative expenses. Savings from the Margin for Growth program are estimated in the range of $55-$65 million in 2018.Also, under its continuous improvement and productivity (CIP) program, management has optimized its North American manufacturing footprint, added manufacturing capabilities in international markets, increased supply chain productivity and improved the sales mix significantly. The productivity and cost savings from these efforts are being invested in brand building as well as to support growth and gain marketplace insights, which in turn are boosting the company’s margins.Let us delve into other factors that are likely to impact the company’s first-quarter 2018 earnings.Product Innovation to Support Top-Line GrowthThe company’s revenues are expected to rise 3.3% in the to-be-reported quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, as against a decline of 1.6% in the prior quarter.

The trend is likely to continue in the to-be-reported quarter. The launch of Hershey's Gold in an instant consumable pack type is expected to contribute to revenue growth in the first quarter.Meanwhile, the implementation of Margin for Growth program in China is driving majority of the improvement. However, China SKU analysis and optimization efforts have dented gross sales volume in 2017 and will persist in 2018.Packaging, Freight & Logistics Costs to Hurt MarginsThe introduction of innovative products is not enough to offset sluggish sales performance. Packaging and marketing initiatives are also required to ensure strong customer outreach. The company is transitioning from lay-down bags to stand-up pouches on core chocolate candy products. These ensure that products get on the shelf quicker with less in-store labor and improve shopping experience. These packaging initiatives along with higher freight and logistics cost hurt margins adversely and affect gross margin.Nevertheless, Hershey’s productivity and cost-saving initiatives is likely to offset higher costs. Overall, Hershey’s bottom line is likely to increase 7.6% to $1.06 in the first quarter of 2018.Here is what our quantitative model predicts:Hershey has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — which is required for an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: The Earnings ESP for Hershey is +0.65%.

2028,EL,"SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) is witnessing no relief from adverse industry conditions, which are plaguing its retail segment’s performance. This, in combination with the company’s dismal gross margin trend, has been a hurdle for long.  The implication of such factors is quite apparent from the recent downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate and investors’ receding optimism in the stock, following its third-quarter fiscal 2018 outcome.Evidently, shares of this leading grocery company declined almost 16.8% over the last three trading sessions, post the company’s quarterly results on Jan 10, 2018.  In fact, SUPERVALU’s shares have been struggling for a while.  The company’s shares plunged almost 45% in a year, much wider than the industry’s dip of 3.8%.Soft Retail Business & Gross Margins: A Consistent WorryWhile earnings for third-quarter fiscal 2018 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales missed the same, on account of underlying weakness in the retail segment. Well, the issues pertaining to the retail segment runs deep and has been pulling down the company’s overall results for a while. Price competition, competitive store openings and intense promotional environment are major deterrents. Markedly, the company has been witnessing identical store sales decline in the retail segment for the past 11 quarters. In third-quarter fiscal 2018, identical store sales dropped 3.5%, which along with store closures caused net sales at the retail unit to tumble 4.1% to $1,017 million. Moreover, the segment incurred adjusted operating loss of $3 million, while retail gross margin also contracted due to soft sales and high promotions. Unfortunately, management expects the retail segment to continue bearing the brunt of these headwinds in fiscal 2018.In addition to the worries pertaining to the retail segment, SUPERVALU has been suffering year-over-year declines in gross margin, since three consecutive quarters. Notably, unfavorable business mix and lower margins from Unified Grocers dented gross margin during the third quarter.  Estimates Trending DownFor fiscal 2018, management projects net earnings from continuing operations in the range of a loss of $20 million to earnings of $2 million. Management also expects adjusted EBITDA in a range of $475-$485 million, compared with the previous expectation of $475-$495 million. The narrowed view reflects the impact of greater-than-expected trucking and logistic expenses incurred in the Wholesale segment during the third quarter.Owing to such factors as well as the aforementioned hurdles pertaining to the retail segment, consensus estimate for the fourth quarter have declined 8 cents to reach 73 cents, since earnings announcement.Growth CatalystsNevertheless, SUPERVALU’s booming Wholesale business segment offers considerable strength to combat the aforementioned hurdles and keep the company afloat in the industry. Notably, sales from this segment improved 52% year over year to $2,888 million in third-quarter fiscal 2018, representing roughly 73% of the company’s total revenues. Thus, the company is on track to develop wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. Incidentally, the company concluded the buyout of Associated Grocers of Florida in the beginning of the fourth quarter, which along with efficient integration of Unified Grocers (acquired in June 2017) underscores the company’s focus on solidifying Wholesale business.Further, SUPERVALU has been trying to improve performance and business effectiveness by focusing more on prospective areas, such as organic food products. The company has been evaluating the growth prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category. Apart from this, SUPERVALU also strives toward improving its omni-channel capabilities to resonate with the evolving consumer trends. In this respect, the company recently agreed on a multiyear contract with Instacart to provide integrated store coupons and loyalty rewards at its e-commerce sites.Bottom LineWhile SUPERVALU’s retail business continues to be pressurized, management is optimistic about the underlying growth of its Wholesale business and the strategies it is undertaking to fuel the same. Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been working hard to achieve a turnaround in retail segment, through e-commerce innovations, new divisions and increased focus on private brands. We expect such dedicated efforts to boost the company’s performance in the forthcoming periods and thereby uplift investor’s confidence in the stock.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

2029,EL,"Growing consumer preference for organic and natural food products has directed investor’s attention on companies such as United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report). Notably, the company has been riding on robust consumer demand across its sales channels along with sturdy growth initiatives. Courtesy of these factors, shares of this leading distributor of specialty food products have surged close to 27.9% in the past six months, comfortably outperforming the industry’’s rally of 4.6%.So, let’s delve deeper into United Natural Foods’ strategic endeavors and see if there’s more room for growth for this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock.Expanding E-commerce CapabilitiesUnited Natural has been actively responding to consumers’ rising preference for online shopping. To this end, the company strives to strengthen e-commerce space by investing in technology and infrastructure. Owing to such efforts, e-commerce sales jumped more than 30% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein the food service e-commerce sales recorded highest quarter of year-over-year growth. Further, United Natural’s efforts to expand online operations have encouraged management to project robust opportunities in this space in fiscal 2018. Efforts to Widen Network and PortfolioUnited Natural has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to enhance brand portfolio, distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In this regard, buyouts of Haddon House and Gourmet Guru in 2016 have proved to be lucrative, as they have been driving top-line growth. The Gourmet Guru deal helped the company in finding and cultivating emerging fresh and organic brands. It also expanded United Natural’s presence in key urban markets. The acquisition of Haddon House provided greater operating scale and resources to augment product and service offerings.Other notable buyouts include Nor-Cal Produce, Inc (in 2016), Tony’s Fine Foods (in 2014) and Trudeau Distributing Company (in 2013). Further, we believe that United Natural will continue boosting portfolio and business reach through such strategic acquisitions.Focus on Organic food productsUnited Natural commands a strong line-up of organic and specialty food products in the United States and Canada. In the face of rising demand in the specialty foods market, the company has accelerated distribution of specialty food items including ethnic, kosher and gourmet products and have expanded into a number of high-growth business markets. This has not only allowed the company to capture market share but also provided an opportunity to conduct business with a number of conventional supermarkets.Robust OutlookDriven by the aforementioned strategic efforts, United Natural delivered a stellar start to fiscal 2018, wherein top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. During the first-quarter conference call, management stated that it continued to witness record sales and shipping unit volumes in the second quarter. For fiscal 2018, management continues to be committed toward achieving core strategic objectives, including plans to enhance customer base, improve gross margin and broaden distribution channel by adding new products and businesses.Encouraged by these factors, management also raised its previously issued sales and earnings view for fiscal 2018. United Natural expects net sales for fiscal 2018 to grow in the range of 6.2-7.8%, while earnings are expected to increase in the range of 6.3-9.4%.All said, the company is likely to continue with its sturdy performance and be in investors’ good books.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Interest You?

2030,EL,"The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) keeps the glow on, courtesy of its splendid past record, which has been backed by its various strategic initiatives. Notably, these factors have helped shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company surge 53.3% in a year, outdoing the industry’s growth of 25.3%. Though the cosmetics behemoth continues to battle soft U.S. traffic, let’s see if its robust strategies can help it maintain the stellar show.Travel Retail to Drive Sales FurtherEstee Lauder has been strongly focused on enhancing its travel retail business, which remains a major sales driver for the company. This is quite evident from its past record, as exceptional growth in this category largely fueled third-quarter fiscal 2018 sales. Travel retail sales growth in the quarter was mainly backed by Asia, along with double-digit increases in eight of its biggest brands in the travel retail network. Management stated that results were fueled by the company’s continued investments in key local markets, with fragrances category being the main driver. Well, the company remains committed toward undertaking more efforts to enhance conversions through strategic initiatives. Management expects continued growth in the travel retail channel, especially in China.Focus on Buyouts – Solid Growth Mantra Estee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio. Investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is also likely to aid beauty sales. The company’s previous moves in this regard include the buyout of sophisticated Paris-based brand — By Kilian and the takeover of key prestige skin care brands — RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW. Apart from skin care, Estee Lauder has acquired high-end fragrance and lifestyle brand, Le Labo (The Lab) and high-end fragrance brand Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle. Such acquisitions help the company expand its portfolio apart from helping it attain the respective loyal customer base.Q3 Retains Superb RecordBacked by these initiatives, along with a strong online business, Estee Lauder marked its 15th consecutive quarter of earnings beat, while sales kept its positive surprise trend alive for the fifth straight time in third-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, both top and bottom lines advanced year over year. While earnings gained from robust sales and strategies like Leading Beauty Forward initiatives, revenues were fueled by strength across most geographic regions (especially Asia Pacific) and product categories (with skin care standing out). Further, exceptional growth in travel retail and online channels drove Estee Lauder’s performance.Will Soft U.S. Retail Traffic Impede Growth?Unfortunately, Estee Lauder has been facing headwinds in North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores. Management remains cautious about a difficult brick-and-mortar retail environment in UK and North America. Also, Bon-Ton’s liquidation could impact Estee Lauder’s performance to an extent. Apart from this social, economic and political issues that could affect consumer spending in few countries remain concerns. The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price and Consensus  The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price and Consensus | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Quote Nevertheless, management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is now anticipated to grow 6-7% in fiscal 2018, up from 5% projected earlier. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation and improved market reach are expected to boost sales during the year. Moreover, the company expects to continue reaping benefits from its digital-first approach as well as its emphasis on high growth potency markets and brands. All these growth drivers, along with expected gains from tax reforms keeps management encouraged about continuing with its above-industry improvement in the fiscal.

2031,EL,"The Zacks Cosmetics industry has been glowing on consumer’ increased spending on beauty products, which has helped it rally 49% in a year, comfortably beating the S&P 500’s gain of 15.5%. Well, the industry (ranked among the top 48% out of more than 250 Zacks industries) has been riding on solid performances by renowned players like The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

Closing trade at $151.48 and $75.05 eventually, the respective stocks have surged 79.5% and 38.7% over the past year.  That said, let’s have a deeper insight into the growth story of these stocks individually. Can Estee Lauder Surge Higher?This cosmetics giant has been reporting strong results across most geographic regions and product categories, banking on strategic acquisitions, strong online business and effective management policies. Incidentally, Estee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The past acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced have been strengthening its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed nearly 2 percentage points to sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, the company has been constantly undertaking digital initiatives such as online booking for each store appointment, omni-channel loyalty programs and advanced mobile services. These initiatives have been boosting the company’s online sales for a while, which is expected to be a major growth catalyst in the upcoming years.Courtesy of these factors, along with solid cost savings and considerable strength in travel retail business, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company marked its 14th consecutive quarter of earnings beat, while sales kept its positive surprise trend alive for the fourth straight time in the second quarter. Management expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. All these growth drivers, along with expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keeps management encouraged about continuing with its above-industry improvement in the second half and fiscal 2018. This was well reflected in the raised sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, and the favorable third-quarter view. These factors were enough for analysts to turn more constructive about the stock, as evident from the solid upward estimate revisions for the third quarter and fiscal 2018.How’s Nu Skin Placed?Nu Skin has been benefiting from its three-key growth strategy: platform, products and programs, with each component delivering solid growth. To this end, the company has been focused on leveraging social selling networks, which helped its customer base improve 8% year over year in the last reported quarter. Further, the company remains committed toward innovation and product launches to suit consumer needs and thereby expand market share. This is evident from its plans to roll out LumiSpa in several markets during the first half of 2018, given the successful preview of the former last year. Additionally, the company remains encouraged about its Velocity program, which is a rewards plan aimed to motivate sales leaders to enhance their performance. Clearly, Nu Skin’s three-key strategy revolves around solidifying consumer base and augmenting top line.  Notably, the Zacks Rank #3 company remains encouraged about the prospects of this strategy across all regions such as the Americas, South Asia Pacific and EMEA, while it remains particularly impressed with the progress in China. Based on this strength, the company projects revenues to grow about 7-9% in 2018, including favorable currency impacts.

In 2017, the company reported earnings of $2.36 per share, while earnings adjusted for tax reforms came in at $3.23 per share. We believe these factors and Nu Skin’s shareholder-friendly moves should continue boosting investors’ sentiment. Incidentally, the company recently raised its dividend from 36 cents to 36.5 cents per share, which marked its 17th straight year of dividend hike.All said, we expect these cosmetic players to continue adding new leaves to their growth stories – a sentiment which gets rekindled by their long-term growth rates.

2035,EL,"Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 7, before the opening bell. Rising demand for protein-rich products has been favoring Tyson Foods’ performance. Positive synergies from buyouts and cost-saving efforts have also been fueling the company’s growth.However, we note that Tyson Foods has a mixed record of earnings surprises over the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the upcoming quarterly release.Factors Impacting Q2Rising demand for protein and meat products has been an aspect of cheer for Tyson Foods for a while. This is evident from the fact that sales volumes across the Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Further, management expects demand for protein to continue to rise and is well placed to exploit opportunities in the space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to rise roughly 3% year over year.Such a positive market scenario has driven Tyson Foods to make several investments and cater to consumers’ demand efficiently. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples. It has also been bolstering its poultry production capacity in Tennessee and other regions. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, courtesy of consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without added hormones or antibiotics.Buyouts Add Strength to PortfolioTyson Foods’ prepared food segment is expected to benefit from the positive synergies of the AdvancePierre buyout. Through this acquisition, management has been trying to expand fresh food offerings along with bolstering protein brands portfolio. The acquisition led to a 2.4% and 9.5% rise in sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. In first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales volume jumped 11.6%. Further, the company expects incremental sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre in fiscal 2018. Also, the company is on track to integrate Original Philly Holdings (acquired in November 2017) within its Prepared Foods segment.Driven by such positives, analysts polled by Zacks expect sales across Beef, Chicken, Pork and Prepared Foods segments to rise 6%, 6.1%, 2% and 17.3%, respectively, in the yet-to-be-reported quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales for the impeding quarter is expected at $9,954 million, depicting a rise of almost 9.6% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Tyson Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Tyson Foods, Inc. QuoteEnhancing Operational EfficiencyToward the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, which is expected to enhance operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel the bottom line in the forthcoming periods. These efforts are expected to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018, which bode well for the upcoming quarterly release. Notably, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter, which boosted the bottom line.We expect that the aforementioned factors will significantly aid the company’s bottom-line performance during the second quarter. Evidently, the consensus mark for earnings for the to-be-reported quarter is currently pegged at $1.37, depicting a surge of 35.6% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. However, the projection has gone down by four cents over the last 30 days, perhaps due to the the apprehensions stemming from the recently raised tariff rates on pork by China. Escalating labor and freight expenses are also a hurdle for the company, which may impede the bottom line.Wrapping it up, lets take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model for the impending quarter.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Tyson Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter.

In fact, the company’s impressive past performance has also helped its shares gain 13.2% over the last six months, surpassing the industry’s 3.1% growth.Rising Demand for Protein-Rich Products Propels GrowthEscalated demand for protein products have been one of the primary growth drivers for Tyson Foods for a while. Notably, sales volumes across the company’s Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods segments increased 4.5%, 7.3% and 11.6%, respectively, during the first quarter of fiscal 2018.In addition to higher demand, the Chicken and Prepared foods categories have been gaining from higher volumes, courtesy of the AdvancePierre buyout. Also, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports boosted the Beef segment’s growth.  Encouraged by the increasing consumer preference for meat and chicken products, Tyson Foods has long been undertaking measures to expand protein-packed brands and sustain the growth momentum in these segments. The company’s investments in Memphis Meats and Beyond Meat are the latest examples in this connection.In fact, Tyson Foods’ investment in Beyond Meat indicates the company’s efforts to venture into the meat substitutes market. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, owing to consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat without any added hormones or antibiotics. The company also invested $84 million (in August 2017) and $300 million (in November 2017) to expand poultry production capacity in Tennessee. Such efforts, combined with the acquisition of AdvancePierre and Original Philly, indicate the company’s dedicated focus on augmenting protein-packed food products. Further, it is set to make significant investments to improve the supply network within the food-service channel.Robust Cost-Saving EffortsIn the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, with the objectives of enhancing operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel bottom line performance. Incidentally, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter.The company aims to generate savings from this program, through synergies from AdvancePierre’s integration along with incremental cost optimization. These efforts are estimated to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018 and around $600 million by 2020.Wrapping UpAlthough there are persisting concerns surrounding higher wage and freight expenses, Tyson Foods is expected to easily overcome such hurdles, given the company’s strong segmental performance and savings initiatives.

2037,EL,"Despite stiff competition and aggressive promotional activities toughening the food industry conditions, Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has been steadily gaining from acquisitions and business expansion efforts. Notably, shares of this renowned marketer and distributor of food products have gained 9% in the past year, compared with the industry’s decline of 4.3%.Lets now look into the factors impacting Pinnacle Foods performance and see how it is placed for the forthcoming periods.Growth Driving EffortsPinnacle Foods strives to expand market share and strengthen business through strategic buyouts. The acquisition of Boulder Brands (in January 2016) provided Pinnacle Foods a growth platform for refrigerated foods. The benefits from this acquisition are expected to enhance procurement, manufacturing and logistics operations. Further, the company expects to achieve synergies worth more than $15 million in 2017, and projects incremental synergies of $4-6 million in 2018 from Boulder Brands. Other acquisitions which have driven Pinnacle Foods’ business in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone.Further, the company plans to expand brands line-up through innovations. In this regard, the company launched Hungry-Man handfuls during the third quarter of 2017, which is a four-line item of hand-held pocket meals. Other noteworthy launches include the introductions of Perfect Size for One, Vlasic purely pickles and Birds Eye product lines.Apart from such initiatives, Pinnacle Foods has been on track with efforts to induce operational efficiency. In fact, productivity savings along with modest net realized pricing and acquisition synergies helped the company offset the impact of input cost inflation during the third quarter. Owing to such efforts, the company expects gross margin to improve 300-400 basis points by 2019. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost profits including low-margin SKU rationalization and increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending.Can Efforts Offset Hurdles  Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing sluggish net sales for Specialty segment since five consecutive quarters now. In third-quarter 2017, sales at the segment tumbled 17.2% to $77 million due to reduced volume/mix, impacts from the Aunt Jemima (AJ) exit and lower net price realization. Also, the exit of the gardein private label business and soft food service sales hampered underlying sales, alongside weighing upon the segment margin.Additionally, Pinnacle Foods expects the impact of adverse weather conditions experienced during 2017 to linger in the forthcoming periods as well and lead to increased freight rates. In fact, the company expects input cost inflation of approximately 3% on account of greater-than-anticipated transport costs.Nevertheless, we note that Pinnacle Foods has been steadily expanding its market share. In fact, the third quarter of 2017 marked Pinnacle Foods’ 14th straight quarter of market share growth. Moreover, by deriving strength from business expansion efforts, we expect the company to offset the aforementioned hurdles with ease and continue being in investors’ good books.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2038,EL,"The tariff war between the United States and China have caused worries for several agricultural and meat exporting companies, including Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report). Recently, China hiked duties on several U.S. export items, including a 25% tariff on pork, in retaliation to the latter’s tariff stance. Incidentally, this caused the company’s shares to drop almost 6.2% on Apr 2.Per sources, China is one of the largest markets for U.S. pork exports both in terms of value and volume. Analysts pointed that the raised tariff rate is expected to cause significant loss of market in China for several meat exporters, marring revenues for Tyson Foods and other prominent players in the meat industry such as Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report).While China’s tariff rates have caused dark clouds to hover on the meat industry, Tyson Foods has many reasons to stay optimistic, courtesy of its rich portfolio of protein-packed brands, well yielding acquisitions and steadily surging demand for protein products in several markets. That said, let’s take a closer look at some of the factors aiding the company’s performance.  Rising Demand Bodes WellTyson Foods has been steadily gaining from enhanced sales across its Beef, Chicken and Prepared Foods owing to rising demand for protein-packed products. Management projects consistent rise in demand for such products and has plans to exploit opportunities in this space. For fiscal 2018, USDA expects overall domestic protein production to rise roughly 3% year over year. Such positive market scenario has driven Tyson Foods to make several investments, especially in expanding poultry production. Apart from this, the company has been steadily expanding fresh prepared foods offering, courtesy of consumers’ rising demand for natural fresh meat offerings without added hormones or antibiotics.Acquisitions Aid GrowthAdditionally, Tyson Foods has been focusing on acquisitions to expand its portfolio. In fact, the AdvancePierre buyout has been favoring the Prepared Foods segment. The acquisition led to a 2.4% and 9.5% rise in sales volume during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, while in first-quarter fiscal 2018 sales volume jumped 11.6%. Further, the company expects additional sales of approximately $1.1 billion from AdvancePierre during fiscal 2018.  Financial Fitness ProgramToward the latter half of 2017, Tyson Foods announced a Financial Fitness Program, directed toward enhancing operating efficiency, reduce overheads and fuel bottom-line growth. Incidentally, the company generated savings of nearly $37 million from this program in the first quarter. Further, the company aims to generate savings from this program, through synergies from AdvancePierre’s integration along with incremental cost optimization. These efforts are anticipated to generate total savings of roughly $200 million in fiscal 2018 and roughly $600 million by 2020.Final ThoughtsWell, it is yet to be seen whether China’s raised tariff rates on pork will have negative impacts on Tyson Foods’ performance. Moreover, the company’s robust portfolio, strong geographic reach in approximately 117 countries along with its strategic buyouts and investments to meet the rising demand for protein-packed products are expected to counter the challenges stemming from the China market. In fact, such well-planned initiatives have aided this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong buy) company’s shares gain as much as 10.6% in a year, almost in-line with the industry’s rally of 10.7%. On that note, we are confident that Tyson Foods will be able to maintain its position as one of the prominent players in the food industry and counter challenges strategically.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

EL hit a new 52-week high of $150.40 in the previous session. Estee Lauder  has gained 17.7% since the start of the year compared to the -5.1% move for the Consumer Staples sector and the 10.5% year-to-date return for its peer group.What's Driving the Outperformance?The stock has a great record of positive earnings surprises, having beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 2, 2018, Estee Lauder Companies reported EPS of $1.52 versus.the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 while it beat the consensus revenue estimate by 1.93%.For the current fiscal year, Estee Lauder Companies is expected to post earnings of $4.36 per share on $13.43 billion in revenues. This represents a 25.65% change in EPS on a 13.58% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $4.95 per share on $14.45 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 13.43% and 7.6%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile EL has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Estee Lauder Companies has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and A, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 34.3X current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 30.8X versus its peer group's average of 15.6X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.65. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price and Consensus  The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. Price and Consensus | The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Estee Lauder Companies currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Estee Lauder meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though EL shares could still be poised for more gains ahead.

2040,EL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) recently came out with fourth quarter and full-year 2017 results, wherein both top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However, sales and earnings improved year over year. Further, the company has provided a promising outlook for 2018.Let’s now take a closer look at the company’s fourth-quarter and 2017 performance as well as management plans for 2018.  Q4 HighlightsAdjusted earnings came in at 94 cents per share and include benefits of 5 cents from the 53rd week. The bottom-line figure fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny for the first time after beating the same in the preceding three quarters.  Nevertheless, adjusted earnings rose 19% from the year-ago period. Also GAAP earnings came in at $3.71 compared with 74 cents in the prior-year period.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteAlthough net sales of $883.5 million for the quarter missed the consensus mark of $909 million, the same depicted growth of 2.9% from the prior-year period. Top-line results during the period mainly gained from a 7.2% benefit stemming from the 53rd week combined with a 0.6% recovery from the negative impacts of hurricanes that had adversely impacted third-quarter results. Management further stated that the company’s in-market performance continued to remain quite strong in the fourth quarter.Nevertheless, these upsides were partially offset by negative impacts of 2.4% stemming from the Aunt Jemima (“AJ”) exit, 0.1% from the Boulder SKU rationalization and a decline of 2.4% in underlying sales. We note that underlying sales during the quarter suffered from lower retail inventory levels and lower volume/mix. These were partially countered by 0.8% higher net price realization and impacts of 0.1% stemming from favorable currency translation. Further, inflationary trends leading to higher packaging and logistics costs have also been weighing on the company’s margins.Owing to such factors, shares of the company have lost 9% in the past six months compared with the industry’s fall of 1.9%.Moving on, adjusted gross profit for the quarter in review was $274.3 million, advancing 2.5% from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted gross margin, however, slipped 10 basis points (bps) to 31.1% on account of the AJ exit and higher manufacturing investments. Moreover, gross margin also suffered from unfavorable volume mix and higher inflation.On a GAAP basis, gross profit increased 2.2%, gaining predominantly from improved sales, strong productivity and reductions in performance-based compensation program. These were somewhat offset by higher input cost inflation arising from increased packaging and logistics costs. Further, gross profit also encountered unfavorable impacts of product mix, increased manufacturing investments and discrete costs arising from the AJ exit.Further, adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) went up 11.9% to $204.2 million in the quarter, gaining from growth in gross profit as well as dedicated cost management efforts mainly in discretionary spending.Segment ResultsFrozen: Sales increased 2.7% in the quarter to $381 million on account of benefits arising from the 53rd week as well as recovery from the hurricane related impacts witnessed in the preceding quarter. These were partially offset by unfavorable impacts from the AJ exit and underlying decline in sales. Adjusted EBIT for the segment gained 1% to $89 million.Grocery: Sales rose 3.8% to $309.6 million backed by the benefits from the 53rd week, partially offset by a decline in underlying net sales.  Adjusted EBIT for the segment grew 7.1% to $84.8 million.Boulder: Pinnacle Foods completed the acquisition of Boulder Brands on Jan 15, 2016. Consequently, it became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. In fourth-quarter 2017, sales at the Boulder segment jumped 13.4% to $110.5 million, fueled by robust underlying sales growth and benefits stemming from the 53rd week. These upsides were somewhat mitigated by the SKU rationalization program and shutdown of the Boulder U.K. operations. Adjusted EBIT for the segment totaled $24.5 million, a remarkable surge from the prior-year quarter figure of $12.7 million.Specialty Foods: Sales tumbled 9.9% to $82.5 million due to negative impacts of the AJ exit and underlying sales decline. Underlying sales were majorly hurt by the lower volume/mix stemming from the company’s previously announced exit from its gardein private label business. These declines were partially countered by improved net price realization and benefits arising from the 53rd week. The segment’s adjusted EBIT came in at $11.3 million, gaining 13.5% from the prior-year quarter.Full-Year ResultsIncluding a benefit of 5 cents from the 53rd week, adjusted earnings per share for 2017 came in at $2.55, reflecting 18.6% growth from a year ago, mainly benefiting from stringent cost control measures.Net sales increased 0.5% from the prior year to $3.14 billion, courtesy of underlying net sales growth from favorable volume/mix and net price realization. Top-line performance also gained from the 53rd week and the additional three weeks of Boulder Brands acquisition. These upsides were partially offset by lower retail inventories, the AJ exit and the combined negative impacts of U.K. business closures and Boulder SKU rationalization.  Adjusted gross profit during the year went down 0.9% to $913.2 million, while adjusted gross margin slumped 40 bps to 29%. Further, adjusted EBIT gained 5.7% from the prior-year to $569.3 million.We also note that during 2017, the company’s market share grew 0.5%, while its composite retail consumption jumped 2.4% from 2016. This also marked Pinnacle Foods’ 15th straight quarter and sixth consecutive year of market share growth mainly fueled by the Duncan Hines and Birds Eye businesses.Other Financial AspectsPinnacle Foods ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $249.8 million, long-term debt of $2,925.6 million and total equity of $2,380.2 million.During 2017, Pinnacle Foods net cash flow from operating activities was $416 million. The company had incurred capital expenditure of $94.2 million during the year. Management expects to incur capital expenditures of $155-$165 million in 2018.2018 GuidanceManagement remains quite impressed with this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s overall market share growth as well as stringent cost containing efforts. That said, the company expects adjusted earnings per share for 2018 to be in the range of $2.85-$2.95. Considering the guidance at mid-point, earnings represent growth of 16% from 2017’s 52-week adjusted earnings per share of $2.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.80 for 2018, which is currently below the company’s forecasted range.The company also expects net sales in the first quarter of 2018 to gain from early Easter, while the same will be offset in the second quarter. Management also expects input cost inflation for 2018 to be in the range of 3.8-4.2%, with greater inflationary pressure in the first half of the year.Going forward, the company expects results to be stronger and anticipates gross margin improvement of 300-400 bps by 2020. Also, Pinnacle Foods is on track with its savings objectives and network optimization plans. On account of such efforts combined with acquisition synergies, the company expects productivity for 2018 to lie in the range of 4-4.5% of cost of products sold..Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

2041,EL,"With brand innovations and strong prospects from acquired businesses rolled up in its sleeve, The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is well positioned to greet 2018. Lately, this global marketer and distributor of food and beverage items has been riding on strong brand performance, fueling growth across most business segments. However, higher freight costs and tight market conditions for green coffee may pose significant hurdles for the company.Nevertheless, investors are enthusiastic about the stock, as evident from the company’s gain of 19% in the past three months, comparing favorably with the industry’s 6.1% rally.Strong Brands Act as Valuable Growth DriverSmucker's reasonably-priced high-quality products make the brand a popular pick.  In this regard, the Jif, Smucker's, Nature's Recipe and Uncrustable brands have been performing well over the past few quarters. In fact, the company has been constructing a frozen sandwich plant in Colorado to enhance the capacity of Uncrustable brand.Owing to the sturdy growth portrayed by the company’s brands, Smucker was able to deliver a year-over-year top-line increase of 0.5% in second-quarter fiscal 2018. Increased net pricing for peanut butter and the Smucker’s brand were the key growth catalysts. Notably, this marked a turning point from the dismal top-line results witnessed in the preceding five quarters.Further, Smucker regularly undertakes innovation to continue adding products to its already rich brand line-up. Recent launches include Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee and Natural Balance high-protein dog food offerings. These launches contributed significantly toward sales growth during the second quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Acquisitions Yielding Positively  Acquisitions have been a preferred strategy for many food and grocery firms to augment market reach and offerings. Smucker’s has also been treading on this path. Notably, the company’s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (KGM) and Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc, to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products, has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. The company has been consistently extending partnership with KGM to augment K-Cup business opportunities.Other instances include the acquisitions of Big Heart Pet Brand, Sahale Snacks, Enray Inc. and Rowland Coffee amongst many others. These acquisitions have added iconic brands to the company’s portfolio and strengthened its presence in the industry.Freights Costs & Green Coffee Price Pose Worries   The negative impacts from adverse weather conditions and new systems required to be implemented are expected to tighten the freight market conditions in the upcoming periods. As a result, management expects a rise in costs for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and has, thereby, lowered the high end of its fiscal earnings guidance. It now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings in the range of $7.75-$7.90 per share, compared with the previous range of $7.75-$7.95.Further, green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time, affecting profits from the coffee segments. During second-quarter 2018, profits from the U.S. Retail Coffee segment declined 18.2% primarily due to higher costs of green coffee and unfavorable volume/mix impacts.Efforts to Offset HurdlesWe expect Smucker to easily tide over the aforementioned hurdles, backed by dedicated savings strategies. During the second quarter, the company generated cost savings of approximately $200 million from its pet food synergy program. Per the company’s ongoing cost management program, Smucker plans to achieve $450 million of total annual synergies and cost reductions by fiscal 2020. Additionally, the company plans to achieve $100 million of its $250 million cost-management program by the end of fiscal 2018.   All said, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to march with full steam in 2018, on the back of strong core brands as well as other business expansion and efficiency enhancing efforts.Looking for More Stocks in Consumer Staples?

2042,EL,"The Driehaus strategy focuses on investing in momentum stocks using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. Investors with high-risk appetite can think of buying momentum stocks using this particular investment approach. The strategy is considered as one of the most successful investment approachs. Following its success, Driehaus earned a place in Barron’s All-Century Team.Portfolios such as that of The American Association of Individual Investors (“AAII”) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five and 10- year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns for the S&P 500. Thus, investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy.A Look at Driehaus StrategyAfter a detailed study of the Driehaus’ strategy, AAII concluded that it mainly focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive prospects to pick potential outperformers. While this strategy was made to provide better returns over the longer haul, companies with a strong history of beating estimates were also given importance.“I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around,” Driehaus had said in an interview.Screening ParametersThe percentage 50-day moving average is one of the key criteria in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend. It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have only considered those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as well as a momentum score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through.

2043,EL,"McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been bearing the brunt of higher raw material costs and elevated marketing spends. Unfortunately, these hurdles have caused this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company to underperform the industry in the past three months. Incidentally, shares of McCormick dipped 0.5% against the industry’s rally of 6.2%.McCormick Battles Higher Input Costs & Market SpendMcCormick’s operations are vulnerable to raw material price fluctuations. Higher raw material costs, particularly vanilla and garlic, have been hurting McCormick’s margins. Prices of raw materials including cinnamon, oregano and rice as well as packaging costs have also been increasing since fiscal 2012. Moreover, for 2017, the company expects material cost inflation to be in mid-single digits.Fluctuations in input materials are mainly attributable to changes in weather and market demand conditions. Additionally, pricing actions undertaken by the government affects the cost of raw materials.McCormick has been resorting to higher promotional and marketing expenditures to boost its top line. Though the company’s higher spending on marketing will drive brands’ growth, it will also raise the company’s expense structure.  Further, the company expects brand marketing to increase at a high single-digit rate in 2017 compared with the previously estimated mid to high single-digit rate.While such expense related headwinds were more than offset by higher sales and strong brand performances during the third quarter of 2017, their negative impacts are expected to linger in the forthcoming periods and dent results.Actions to Mitigate HeadwindsMcCormick strives to offset price hike through strategic raw material purchases. Further, well-planned pricing actions are expected to aid the company mitigate the negative impacts stemming from increased marketing and raw material costs. Moreover, the company’s constant endeavors to expand business trough acquisitions are expected to continue boosting the top line and offset the aforementioned hurdles.Nervous About McCormick?

2044,EL,"Coty Inc.’s (COTY  -  Free Report) has been steadily gaining from well-planned acquisitions and a strong foothold in the cosmetics industry, supported by leading brands. These factors have been fueling the top line of this cosmetics giant. The company’s shares have rallied 23.5% in the past three months, outpacing its industry’s gain of 17.3%.However, the company is struggling with soft organic sales in Consumer Beauty segment, which dented overall performance.So, let’s see if Coty’s growth drivers can help offset these obstacles and sustain the impressive momentum.Efforts Driving Business GrowthImproved consumer confidence has not only been favoring higher spending on food and beverage items, but has also increased spending on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and have also encouraged the company to engage in business expansion, primarily through buyouts. In fact, Coty has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its rich line-up of brands. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s top line improved more than 100% year over year, mainly driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout and positive synergies from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Other evidences in this regard include the buyout of 60% stake in LLC (which forms part of the Consumer Beauty segment). Further, Coty is boosting end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce in its divisions and regions. The company has been making great strides, which has helped it witness healthy e-commerce sales growth in Consumer Beauty and Luxury segments in the first quarter.Additionally, Coty is committed toward enhancing cost structure. This is well reflected from the fact that the company has been witnessing year-over-year growth in gross margin for four straight quarters now.Consumer Beauty Segment: A Major Concern Unlike the flourishing Luxury and Professional business segments, Coty’s Consumer Beauty category has been sluggish. The segment has been struggling against underlying challenges in North America, thanks to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Soft market trends in major categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in the United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for Consumer Beauty segment. Evidently, organic sales at this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter, following declines of 6% and 10% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Bottom LineNevertheless, we expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company to gain from strategic acquisitions and other business strengthening efforts. In fact, such efforts are likely to improve the performance of Coty’s Consumer Beauty segment and thereby aid the company’s growth trajectory.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2045,EL,"The Cosmetics industry has been performing favorably, driven by consumers’ increased spending on personal care and beauty products. Evidently, shares of the industry gained 24.3% on a year-to-date basis, compared with the S&P 500 index’s rally of 22.8%.The Estee Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) has emerged as one of the preferred picks for investors with its 69.3% surge this year, crushing the industry’s performance. Notably, other cosmetic industry firms such as Avon products (AVP  -  Free Report) declined 53.4%. However, Helen of Troy (HELE  -  Free Report) and Coty (COTY  -  Free Report) gained 11.4% and 9.3%, respectively.Let’s look into the factors that have backed Estee Lauder’s bull-run and help the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company sustain the solid trend in 2018 as well. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Acquisitions: Vital Growth DriverEstee Lauder has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened its rapidly growing prestige portfolio and contributed to the reported sales growth in first-quarter fiscal 2018. Also, management expects these brands to contribute roughly 2 percentage points to the company’s overall sales growth in fiscal 2018. The investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company is likely to drive beauty sales in the forthcoming quarters.Progress in e-commerceEstee Lauder is focused on widening global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions. Evidently, the company launched more than 100 sites in first-quarter of 2018. Online sales during the said period improved 33%, driven by increased traffic, order size and conversions. Owing to technological advancement and the growing popularity of social media, mobile sales constituted about 70% of the company’s online traffic. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointment and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line in the forthcoming periods.Sturdy Growth in Emerging MarketsThe company derives a significant amount of revenues from the emerging markets. Brazil is one of Estee Lauder’s fastest-growing markets, driven largely by M-A-C, DKNY and Tommy Hilfiger brands. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets also offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Notably, the company has bright prospects in China, wherein sales soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. The company’s Chinese operations have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management envisions persistent strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region.The aforementioned factors also enabled Estee Lauder to retain solid surprise history in first-quarter fiscal 2018. This marked the company’s 13th consecutive quarter of earnings beat, while sales kept its positive surprise trend alive for the third straight time.Positive on the Road AheadEstee Lauder projects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is anticipated to grow 4-5% during the year. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation and improved market reach are likely to bolster sales during the year.Driven by such upsides, management expects net sales to grow in the range of 10-11% in fiscal 2018, compared with the previous expectation of 8-9%. The company also expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.04-$4.12 per share for fiscal 2018, compared with the previous view of $3.87-$3.94.Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 has risen from $4.14 to $4.16, respectively, over the past 30 days.Clearly, the strong fundamentals combined with the company’s encouraging outlook makes this cosmetics giant a favorable pick for investors in 2018.Zacks’ Best Private Investment IdeasWhile we are happy to share many articles like this on the website, our best recommendations and most in-depth research are not available to the public.Starting today, for the next month, you can follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time.

2046,EL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Mar 1, before the opening bell. Notably, the company outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 3.1%. Let’s delve deeper into how things are shaping up for this announcement and see if this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products can maintain its positive earnings surprise streak.What to Expect?In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 has moved up by a penny to 95 cents and $2.56, respectively. Expected earnings for the quarter under review and 2017 depict a year-over-year rise of 20.3% and 19.1%, respectively. Notably, management expects 2017 adjusted earnings in the range of $2.55-$2.60 per share.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $909.4 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting an improvement of 5.9% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the consensus mark for 2017 sales is pegged at $3.17 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 1.2%.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteFactors Driving the QuarterPinnacle Foods’ retail segments have been depicting strong in-market performance. Notably, third-quarter 2017 marked Pinnacle Foods’ 14th straight period of market share growth. Moreover, the company’s brand expansion initiatives combined with regular innovation are expected to further strengthen market share. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits and Birds Eye product lines.Acquisitions have been another vital growth driver for Pinnacle Foods. The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. In this regard, the acquisition of Boulder Brands deserves special mention as it has aided the company achieve significant growth in refrigerated foods. Moreover, the company expects to achieve Boulder Brands synergies of more than $15 million in 2017, which will benefit gross margin and SG&A. Further, additional synergies of $4-$6 million are expected in 2018.The company also expects results to be stronger and projects gross margin for 2017 to be in line with 2016. Also, Pinnacle Foods is on track with its network optimization plan and is committed toward achieving its long-term margin goal for 2019 and onward. The company also has an operational excellence program to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. Productivity for 2017 is estimated to be little more than 4% of the cost of products sold.Escalated Costs & Weak Specialty Unit Are ConcernsAlthough Pinnacle Foods’ well-chalked growth endeavors look impressive, escalated marketing and freight costs remain potent threats. Incidentally, the company witnessed increased marketing costs in the third quarter, which along with expenses related to discrete items and hurricanes dented the EBIT margin. Additionally, management expects higher freight rates associated with the hurricanes to linger throughout 2017. The company expects input cost inflation to be 3% on account of greater-than-anticipated transport costs.Apart from this, sluggishness in the Specialty segment has been a concern for Pinnacle Foods. Reduced volume/mix, impacts from the Aunt Jemima (AJ) exit and lower net price realizations have been plaguing the segment’s performance as well. Moreover, the exit of the gardein private label business and soft food service sales hampered underlying sales and weighed upon the margin last quarter.Final Thoughts & the Zacks ModelNevertheless, we expect Pinnacle Foods to tide over such hurdles on the back of its efficient brand growth strategies, gains from acquisitions and carefully planned savings, and productivity enhancing initiatives.To top it, our proven model shows that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.

2047,EL,"Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter fiscal 2018 results (ended February 2018) on Mar 22, before the market opens.The company pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 6.16% over the preceding four quarters. In second-quarter fiscal 2018, its adjusted earnings of 55 cents per share handily outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.8%.Our proven model shows that Conagra’s earnings will likely beat estimates in the to-be-reported quarter.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Conagra has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks Rank & ESP: Conagra’s favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with an Earnings ESP of +6.06%, predicts a likely earnings beat.Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Conagra Brands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Conagra Brands Inc. Quote  You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Conagra had planned to make investments in its U.S. retail business, and increase the scale of merchandizing, distribution and consumer trail-related activities for the company’s existing brands during the fiscal third quarter. These moves will likely help bolster the company’s revenues in the quarter. Notably, sturdier sales of major brands like Healthy Choice, Marie Callender, Slim Jim, Duke's, Bigs and Frontera is expected to boost top-line going forward.The Zacks Consensus Estimates for revenues of the Refrigerated & Frozen and Grocery & Snacks segments are currently pegged at $677 million and $873 million, respectively, for the fiscal third quarter, higher than the corresponding tallies of $666 million and $850 million generated in the prior-year quarter.Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues of the company’s International segment is pegged at $205 million for the quarter to be reported, in line with the sales recorded in the year-ago period.Moreover, the acquisitions of Angie's Artisan Treats, LLC (Oct 23, 2017) and Sandwich Bros. (Feb 5, 2018) are expected to strengthen the company’s financial fundamentals in the quarters ahead.Apart from a robust top-line performance, Conagra expects that lower corporate tax rates (resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enactment) will also aid in enhancing its near-term profitability.Furthermore, we anticipate that lower interest expenses, greater operational efficacy, favorable mix and higher pricing will help boost Conagra’s earnings in the fiscal third quarter. Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks in the Zacks Consumer Staples sector that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +3.31%.

2048,EL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has been gaining on the recent progress of its savings program. Moreover, the company remains well poised with innovation, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. However, strained margins remain a threat.Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Robust Savings Plan: A Key ToolColgate remains optimistic about its Global Growth and Efficiency Program as well as Funding the Growth undertakings, which are delivering impressive results. Also, the company has extended its Global Growth and Efficiency Program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million compared with $425-$475 million projected earlier.In fact, Colgate’s four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program will help the company to improve gross and operating profit and enhance its market share position worldwide. By funding the growth initiative, the company intends to open new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, besides reducing fuel and transportation costs. The aforementioned endeavors are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Innovation Aids GrowthColgate has been undertaking innovation and in-store implementation, as a key component of its growth strategies, over many years. This has enabled the company to capture the market share across all regions and categories. On the innovation front, it is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. Colgate has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets as well.Decent Earnings Trend & Bullish OutlookColgate has delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, this marked the company’s fifth in-line earnings in the last six quarters. Results can be attributed to solid sales and significant market share gains. Going forward, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives.Following the results, Colgate provided a bullish outlook for 2018. The company now anticipates net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth of low to mid-single digit. Also, including benefits from the tax reform, GAAP earnings are envisioned to improve in the double-digits range while adjusted earnings are anticipated to be up nearly 10%.Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Colgate, it is currently plagued with strained margins for the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company faced increased raw material and packaging costs as well as higher advertising expenses, thus creating pressure on margins.Looking ahead, the company expects adjusted gross margin to expand 50-70 bps in 2018. However, it also expects to incur higher advertising expenses, which is likely to weigh upon operating margins. In addition, Colgate anticipates the challenging backdrop to persist due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide.Consequently, shares of Colgate have lost 2.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Nevertheless, Colgate’s robust savings program, innovations, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth.Looking for More Promising Bets?

Nevertheless, the company remains on track with its Transformation Plan, delivering above its cost-saving plan for 2017.Shares of Avon improved 9.2% in the pre-market trading session, following the fourth-quarter earnings. Overall, the company’s shares have surged 19.5% in the last three months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.9%.Avon posted adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 12 cents per share in the fourth quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents. Additionally, it reflected a significant improvement from the earnings of 1 cent per share in the prior-year quarter. Bottom line gained from considerable margin gains from lower bad-debt expenses and benefits from cost reduction initiatives, alongside tax gains from the recently enacted tax reform.Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteOn a reported basis, the company posted earnings per share of 17 cents against the loss per share of 3 cents in the year-ago quarter.Deeper InsightTotal revenues remained flat year over year at $1,568.8 million but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,592 million. On a constant currency basis, total revenues declined 2%, mainly due to the declination of Active Representatives, particularly in Brazil.While Active Representatives declined 2% compared with the prior-year quarter, Ending Representatives remained flat. Moreover, average orders came in flat, with both total units sold and price/mix dropping 1% each.Adjusted gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.1%, mainly on the back of a positive impact from price/mix.Adjusted operating margin expanded 250 bps to 9.8%. The year-over-year increase was due to lower bad-debt expenses, particularly in Brazil; as well as lower fixed–costs, primarily related to the gains from cost reductions under the Transformation Plan. These factors were partly negated by higher Representative, sales leader and field expense to drive Representative activity.Segment PerformanceAvon’s revenues of $641.6 million in Europe, Middle East & Africa rose 3% year over year. On a currency-neutral basis, revenues dipped 2%, mainly owing to 3% drop in average orders, offset by 1% increase in Active Representatives. The decline also stemmed from the fall in constant-dollar revenues in Russia and the U.K., offset by gains in Turkey with mixed results in rest of the segment. While price/mix in the region dipped 2%, units sold remained flat. Ending Representatives rose 3%.Revenues in South Latin America decreased 2% year over year to $575.4 million and were down 1% in constant-dollars, mainly owing to 4% decline in Active Representatives, offset by 3% growth in average orders. Revenue was also impacted by the fall in Brazil, partly negated by growth in Argentina. Price/mix dipped 1% and Ending Representatives fell 3%, while units sold were flat.North Latin America’s revenues were flat at $204.8 million and declined 2% in constant-dollars, attributable to 3% fall in Active Representatives including the impact of the September 2017 earthquake in Mexico, offset by 1% increase in average orders. While price/mix grew 2%, units-sold fell 4%. Moreover, Ending Representatives declined 2%.The Asia-Pacific division’s revenues declined 3% to $139.3 million and down 2% in constant dollars, mainly owing to 1% decline in both Active Representatives and average orders. Additionally, price/mix, units sold and Ending Representatives dropped 1% each. During the quarter, constant-dollar revenue growth in the Philippines was offset by declines in most other markets in the segment.Financial DetailsAvon ended 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $881.5 million, long-term debt of $1,872.2 million and total shareholders’ deficit of $714.7 million (excluding non-controlling interests).Transformation Plan UpdateAvon has completed the second year of its three-year Transformation Plan that was announced in January 2016.  The plan mainly focuses on investing for growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility. The company has witnessed significant progress, compared with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.In 2017, the company surpassed the cost-saving target of $230 million for the year, realizing cost savings of more than $250 million. Cost savings for the year include both run-rate savings from 2016 and in-year savings from current year initiatives. These savings were mostly offset by the impact of inflation.Going forward, management is likely to focus on the business foundations and improve overall performance to attain its savings target. Though Avon is facing challenges, it is expected to focus on investment in modernizing systems, delivering unique and competitive Representative experience. Further, it aims to provide deeper insights and analytics into Representative’s behavior and requirements to boost experience.In fact, the company also remains encouraged to minimize service disruption along with pilot programs that cover service from end to end.The company expects to achieve the long-term target of delivering the mid-single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin. However, the company believes that this will take time. Going forward, the company expects 2018 to be a year of executing significant operational improvements, despite continued competitive pressures.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderAvon carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2050,EL,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) being a beneficiary of the recent tax reform, is looking forward to share the benefits with its shareholders. As a result, it accelerated the declaration of dividend increase, which usually occurs in May. The company also remains keen on using the benefits from the tax reform to support long-term business growth as well as enhance shareholder returns.Notably, Clorox raised its quarterly dividend by nearly 14% to 96 cents per share from 84 cents. On May 8, 2017, the company had raised its dividend by 5% to 84 cents per share from 80 cents.The new dividend is payable on May 11, 2018, to shareholders on record as of April 25. Thereby, bringing the company’s annualized dividend rate to $3.84 per share, yielding 2.98% based on the current stock price.In fact, Clorox has been enhancing shareholder return from time to time. This is evident from its track record of consistently raising dividends since 1977. Notably, the company’s total shareholder returns for the last three fiscal years sums to 58% compared with 37% for its peer group and 31% for the S&P 500.We believe that Clorox’s consistent dividend payments and increments reflect growth potential of the company’s earnings as well as its cash flow generation capabilities.Per second-quarter fiscal 2018 release, the company anticipates the new tax reform to boost its earnings and cash flows. This was well reflected in the previous guidance raise for fiscal 2018 earnings. Clorox also raised its long-term free cash flow target, under the 2020 Strategy.  It now expects to generate free cash flow, as a percentage of sales, in the range of 11-13% (on a yearly basis) compared with 10-12% projected earlier.Clearly, the company’s disciplined approach to cash allocation facilitates returning excess cash to shareholders. Clorox currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The news did not have a major impact on the company’s share price movement. However, the stock has lost 5.7% in the last six months, outperforming industry’s decline of 8.7%.We believe that dividend hikes not only enhance shareholder return but raise the market value of the stock as well. Through dividend increases, companies persuade investors to either buy or hold the scrip instead of selling them. Looking ahead, Clorox remains confident of its long-term growth potential, suggesting enhanced value for shareholders via dividend payout.Looking for More Promising Bets?

2051,EL,"Hillenbrand, Inc. (HI  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on May 3. The company has been delivering positive earnings surprises for seven straight quarters now, buoyed by a flourishing Process Equipment business. However, headwinds in the Batesville unit have been a worry.With these factors in mind, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the quarterly announcement.Factors Likely to Impact Q2Hillenbrand has been witnessing year-over-year growth in the top and the bottom line for more than a year. Well, the company has been gaining from strength in the Process Equipment segment. The segment has been delivering impressive results on the back of higher demand for screening and separating equipment as well as plastics projects. Incidentally, during first-quarter fiscal 2018, revenues in this segment jumped 19% year over year to reach $264 millionFurther, the company has been focusing on capitalizing the opportunities provided by the process equipment market by investing in enhanced expertise and engineering solutions, to cater to consumer more effectively. Indeed, such upsides have been fueling investors’ optimism in the stock, which surged 27% in the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 5.7%.   We expect that strength in the Process Equipment segment will continue to drive Hillenbrand’s performance in the impeding quarter. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for the second quarter is pegged at 60 cents, depicting an increase of 13.2% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. This estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $417 million, reflecting a rise of almost 5.5% from the year-ago quarter’s figure.On the flip side, Hillenbrand has long been struggling with its Batesville business segment, thanks to lower burial volumes, as consumers depict a radical shift toward cremation. Evidently, in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, segment revenues fell 1% to $133 million. Moreover, performance in this segment remains challenged with higher commodity and fuel costs. Management expects these hurdles to linger and hurt revenues as well as margins in second-quarter fiscal 2018, which is a concern. Nevertheless, we expect the Process Equipment unit to sufficiently cushion Hillenbrand in countering the headwinds in the Batesville segment. Hillenbrand Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Hillenbrand Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Hillenbrand Inc Quote All said, let take a look at the picture unveiled by the Zacks Model for the upcoming quarterly release.Zacks ModelOur proven model does not show that Hillenbrand is likely to beat bottom-line estimates this quarter.

2053,EL,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.8%.In fact, Whirlpool has missed estimates in the last four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 4.8%. Notably, third-quarter 2017 marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of negative earnings surprise and second consecutive quarter of sales lag. The primary concern for the company in recent quarters has been raw material cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $4.01, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.8 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has declined 13.6% in the last six months. However, this compares better than the industry’s 26.1% downside.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s aforementioned dismal surprise trend has been a concern for investors. The company is clearly grappling with adverse product price/mix and raw material cost inflation has been denting the  operating margin for the last few quarters. Moreover, the company anticipates higher raw material prices to persist through 2018. This has resulted in a lowered earnings view for 2017.The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect the company’s operating performance. Additionally, Whirlpool derives a significant portion of revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks in global market. Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high which is likely to hurt the margins.However, Whirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver long-term goals. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year through 2020. Further, it anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix, which encouraged management to target EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020.Moreover, Whirlpool has been riding on innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Further, the company is striving to improve margins through a series of measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on enriching business efficiency.That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can turnaround the aforementioned near-term challenges.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of +2.99% as the Most Accurate estimate of $4.13 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.01 per share.

2054,EL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is successfully expanding its retail market share, courtesy of its well-chalked acquisitions and business expansion endeavors. Also, the company is gaining from its operational efficiency initiatives which have been boosting savings. While these aspects have been benefiting the in-market performance of this renowned manufacturer and distributor of branded food products, underlying weaknesses in the Specialty segment and escalated costs stemming from logistics and packaging have been causing some worries lately. Let’s get a deeper insight regarding these aspects, impacting the company’s performance.Expansion Efforts Boost Retail Market PerformancePinnacle Foods in-market performance has continued to be impressive for a while, fueling its overall business performance. In fact, with fourth-quarter 2017 results, the company marked 15th straight quarter and sixth consecutive year of market share growth. Notably, during 2017, the company’s market share grew 0.5% while its composite retail consumption jumped 2.4% from 2016.Acquisitions have been one of the prime catalysts behind the company’s sturdy market share growth. In fact, during 2017, the company gained synergies of $16 million from the Boulder Brands acquisition. Further, management expects to benefit from the residual synergies associated with this acquisition in the forthcoming periods. Other than this, Pinnacle Foods’ acquisitions of Duncan Hines manufacturing business and Garden Protein have also yielded favorably. Incidentally, the Duncan Hines business gave quite a boost to Pinnacle Foods market share during the fourth quarter.In addition to strategic buyouts, Pinnacle Foods innovation efforts also added a number of iconic brands to its rich products line-up. Some noteworthy innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits, Birds Eye product lines and Vlasic purely pickles. In fact, the company’s Birds Eye product lines have been gaining traction lately, impacting the company’s fourth-quarter performance positively.For 2018, Management plans to roll out new products under the Birds Eye brand and will also be expanding its Hungry-Man Handful line. Moreover, encouraged by the popularity of Perfect Size for 1, the company will launch a variety of products and strengthen the Duncan Hines product line. Management is also planning exciting innovations for its gardein and Evol brands.Productivity Initiatives Bode WellThe company has an operational excellence program in place, designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. On account of such efforts, combined with acquisition synergies and benefits from the network optimization program, the company expects productivity for 2018 to be 4-4.5% of costs of products sold. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost gross margin, including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending and realizing synergies from acquisitions. Based on these efforts, the company expects results to be stronger and anticipates gross margin improvement of 300-400 bps by 2020.  Final ThoughtsWe note that Pinnacle Foods has been struggling with underlying weaknesses in the Specialty segment and also escalating logistics and packaging expenses. In fact, lately, such headwinds have been denting the company’s share price performance, which has witnessed decline of 5.6% in the past three months, faring slightly better than the industry’s 7.9% fall.Nevertheless, Pinnacle Foods’ sustained efforts to boost market share and enhance efficiency are quite praiseworthy. We expect that such efforts will aid this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company to add new leaves to its growth story and also uplift investor’s confidence in the stock.Hungry for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

2055,EL,"Avon Products, Inc.’s (AVP  -  Free Report) Transformation Plan has shown persistent progress, having outpaced the cost-saving expectations last year. Also, it has helped the company to deliver earnings beat in fourth-quarter 2017 after five straight quarters of negative surprises. However, revenues returned to negative surprise trend after a beat in the preceding quarter.Nonetheless, shares of this cosmetics leader have gained 23.8% in the past three months owing to its robust initiatives, comfortably outperforming the Cosmetics industry’s 9.4% rally. The industry ranks in the top 23% of all Zacks classified industries. The stock also boasts a VGM Score of A, with a long-term earnings growth of 12.5%.Given this backdrop, let’s delve deeper to find out the factors that are likely to have a bearing on this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance.Transformation Plan Shows Continued MomentumAvon has been smoothly progressing with its three-year Transformation Plan that was announced in January 2016. Notably, it has realized cost savings of more than $250 million in 2017, surpassing the targeted $230 million. Further, the company has successfully completed the second year of the plan and is on track to reach its overall cost savings target of $350 million. The plan mainly focuses on investing in growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility. In this regard, Avon has witnessed significant progress compared with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.Moving ahead, management is likely to focus on the business foundations and improve overall performance to attain its savings target. Furthermore, it intends to achieve the long-term target of delivering the mid-single-digit constant-dollar revenue growth and low double-digit operating margin. In fact, the company expects 2018 to be a year of executing significant operational improvements, despite continued competitive pressures.Focused on Improving Active RepresentativesManagement remains focused on boosting Global Active Representatives growth and is on track to deliver 1-2% growth in the long term. Additionally, the company is expected to focus on investment in modernizing systems, delivering unique and competitive Representative experience, amid a challenging scenario. It intends to provide deeper insights and analytics into Representative’s behavior and requirements to boost experience. Avon also remains encouraged to minimize service disruption along with pilot programs that cover service from end to end. This inspires optimism about the growth of Active Representatives, which form a key factor for the success of any direct-selling business operator.Q4 Earnings Beat & Margins Underscore StrengthBacked by its robust Transformation Plan, Avon pulled off a positive earnings surprise for the first time in six straight quarters. The company’s adjusted earnings per share came in at 12 cents in the fourth quarter of 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 6 cents and delivering a positive surprise of 100%. Additionally, the bottom line reflected a significant increase from earnings of 1 cent per share in the prior-year quarter. Bottom line gained from considerable operating margin expansion due to lower bad-debt expenses and benefits from cost reduction initiatives, alongside tax gains from the recently enacted tax reform. Gross margin also improved 80 basis points (bps) owing to better price/mix. Moreover, operating margin expanded 250 bps on lower bad-debt expenses, particularly in Brazil and lower fixed costs.Soft Sales – A WoeAlthough the company reported better-than-expected earnings in fourth-quarter 2017, Avon is not doing well on the revenue front. Apparently, it has missed sales estimates in five of the six trailing quarters, including the recently-reported quarter. The top line in the fourth quarter was mainly hurt by decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across all segments, except EMEA. Active Representatives declined higher-than-anticipated, mainly owing to fall in Brazil, which also hurt volumes significantly. Moving ahead, Avon’s top line is likely to remain under pressure due to a tough macro and competitive environment, mainly in its largest markets.As mentioned above, Avon has been working on delivering growth across its Global Active Representatives, which might require time.Want Top-Ranked Stocks in the Same Space, Check TheseHelen of Troy Limited (HELE  -  Free Report) has pulled off an average positive earnings surprise of 17% in the past four quarters.

2056,EL,"Wall Street should be rejoicing right now, with investors getting the much-wished-for corporate and income tax cuts. Moreover, the economy has been growing at a healthy annual pace of 3% for three straight quarters now. On the contrary, there is widespread panic in Wall Street, with all the major indices officially entering the correction territory that has extinguished the nearly nine-year bull run.Rising treasury yields has diminished the appeal of stocks, especially with valuations hovering at historically high levels. Bond yields moved north on expectations of an interest rate hike, courtesy of a possible uptick in inflation on stronger wage growth.Investors also pointed that stocks suffered a bloodbath from the unwinding of trades linked to bets on volatility staying low. Add to this the political worries emanating from issues related to a second government shutdown, and stocks are likely to continue their free fall.Given the turbulence, investing in low beta defensive companies seems prudent. Such stocks provide risk-adjusted returns, consistent dividend and steady earnings regardless of the state of the equity market.Bears Rip Stocks As the Market Enters CorrectionBears dominated the market on Feb 8, as it showed more signs of institutional selling. The broader S&P 500 slumped 100.66 points, or 3.8%, to 2,581, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,032.89 points, or 4.2%, to close at 23,860.46, its second worst point decline in history. Both the indices are now officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.In fact, the equity market is witnessing its first genuine bout of gyration in years, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge registering its largest percentage jump in history. VIX rose 14.4% to close the day at 31.72. Any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market, but a reading of greater than 30 shows a high level of investor fear.Here’s What Usually Happens After a CorrectionThe equity market was on a confirmed uptrend until this week. Stocks were in such a free fall that on Feb 5, major indices undercut important support areas. All of them fell through their 50-day moving averages, including many leading stocks, Apple APPL for instance, undercutting its 200-day line.The key indices are now “officially” into correction territory, with things getting worse. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS  -  Free Report), if this is a bull market correction then volatility is expected to persist for another four months. But, if the loss deepens into a bear market, or a drop of 20% from the recent all-time high, it could be 22 months of pain for investors.Why Did the Stock Market Crash?Continuous rise in bond yields rattled the equity market, resulting in a downturn. Investors pulled money out of stocks as an uptick in bond yields made equities less attractive by increasing their opportunity cost.Record rise in wage growth sparked fears of inflation and led investors to believe that the Fed will hike rates more times than anticipated. Wages grew at the fastest pace in January in more than eight-and-a-half years. Average hourly wages increased 9 cents, or 0.3%, to $26.74. This helped the average year-on-year hourly earnings to rise to 2.9%, the highest since June 2009.Wages grew at the fastest pace since the end of the last decade on a tighter labor market, tax cut policy and a rise in the minimum wage threshold in several states. Minimum wage has been raised in 18 states in January, which had a positive impact on 4.5 million workers, per the Economic Policy Institute.How to Prepare for the PullbackAs the markets seem to be plagued with widespread uncertainty, including stretched valuations, defensive stocks seem to be the safest investment option. Such stocks are generally non-cyclical, or companies whose business performance and sales are not highly correlated with the activities in the larger market. Their products are in constant demand irrespective of market volatility and such names include companies from the utilities and consumer staples sectors.Utilities are deemed defensive stocks as electricity, gas and water are essentials. Food, beverage and tobacco companies are true defensive plays as demand for such staple stocks remains unaltered during market gyrations.5 Solid ChoicesWe have, thus, selected five solid stocks from the aforementioned defensive sectors that boast a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This represents changes of 13.34% and 7.35%, respectively.Valuation MetricsWhile EL has moved to its 52-week high in the recent past, investors need to be asking, what is next for the company? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as these give investors a variety of ways to comb through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM score as well. The idea behind the style scores is to help investors pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Estee Lauder has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are A and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.In terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 33.28x current fiscal year EPS estimates. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 29.81x versus its peer group's average of 15.3x. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 2.56. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price and Consensus | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteZacks RankWe also need to look at the Zacks Rank for the stock, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Estee Lauder currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to favorable earnings estimate revisions from covering analysts.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Estee Lauder meets the list of requirements.

This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 47.6% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 1.7%.United Natural has been riding on effective growth policies. Moreover, a favorable outlook for fiscal 2018 bolsters investor’s optimism on the stock.

Driven by such efforts, e-commerce sales jumped more than 30% in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, wherein the food service e-commerce sales recorded highest quarter of year-over-year growth. United Natural’s efforts to expand online operations encouraged management to project robust opportunities in this space, backed by impressive distribution network and solid brands portfolio. Acquisitions: An important Growth DriverThe company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to enhance brand portfolio, distribution network, customer base and boost long-term growth. United Natural acquired Haddon House in May 2016 and Gourmet Guru in Aug 2016, which have been contributing to sales. The Gourmet Guru deal helped the company in finding and cultivating emerging fresh and organic brands. It also expanded United Natural’s presence in key urban markets. United Natural’s acquisition of Haddon House Food Products provided greater operating scale and resources to develop product and service offering.Other strides in this regard include United Natural’s buyout of Nor-Cal Produce, Inc (in 2016), Tony’s Fine Foods (in 2014) and Trudeau Distributing Company (in 2013) among many others.Initiatives to Improve Operating EfficienciesUnited Natural has been striving to improve operational efficiencies and has made solid progress in this regard. The company is on track with restructuring plan to curtail expenses to achieve greater efficiency in a highly promotional environment. Moreover, in order to allocate resources diligently, the company has been exiting from less profitable businesses.Solid Q1, Positive on the Road AheadThe aforementioned growth initiatives helped United Naturals to retain its impressive earnings record in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  Both top and bottom lines improved year over year and surpassed estimates. While earnings marked its third straight beat, revenues crushed its 11-quarter long trend of reporting negative surprises.

The company also envisions earnings in the range of $2.72-$2.80 per share, which reflects an improvement of about 6.3-9.4% from the fiscal 2017 figure.All said, United Natural is expected to continue with sturdy performance on the back of dedicated efforts to tap growth opportunities.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2060,EL,"oty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) has long been struggling with soft organic sales at its Consumer Beauty segment. Despite the prevalence of this headwind in the second quarter of fiscal 2018, the segment improved on a sequential basis. Also, management has been taking several efforts to revive the Consumer Beauty unit, which forms vital part of Coty’s overall revenues.These endeavors helped this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock rally about 20% in the past six months, while it underperformed the industry’s 24.7% increase. So, let’s delve deeper into all aforementioned aspects and see what’s in store for the Consumer Beauty segment. What’s Hurting Consumer Beauty?Coty’s consumer beauty segment has been grappling with underlying challenges in North America, mainly due to consumers changing preferences and a highly competitive environment. Notably, Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report), a cosmetics player also bearing the brunt of dismal sales in North America, was compelled to exit the region.Coming back to Coty, the company’s Consumer Beauty unit remained troubled in North America during the second quarter on account of distribution losses from the previous year, along with inventory wind downs ahead of the company’s planned relaunches. Moreover, the global mass beauty market remained sluggish in the quartet.Consequently, organic sales at this segment dipped 1.3% year over year. Nevertheless, this marked a significant improvement from an 8% drop recorded in the first quarter. Prior to that, organic sales declined 6% and 10% in the third and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, respectively.Strategic Efforts Bearing Fruit: A Revival in the Cards?Well, the improved trends at Consumer Beauty depict that the company’s strategic efforts including its focus on enhancing market execution, undertaking brand initiatives and having consumer-focused communications is yeilding results. Incidentally, results improved in Europe, courtesy of a stabilized business. Also, management remains impressed with Consumer Beauty’s performance in the ALMEA region, especially Brazil that has been depicting robust results for a while now.Well, management has long been focused on reviving the performance of this unit, which accounted for nearly 43% of Coty’s top line in the second quarter. Evidently, the company has been taking steps to make innovations, and enhance product development and communication processes to address the evolving consumer demands and provide on-trend products.Progressing on these lines, Coty announced the relaunch of COVERGIRL brand last year and has solid plans for various other brands like Max Factor and Clairol among others for the second half of fiscal 2018. Management plans to relaunch the Clairol brand in the second half of fiscal 2018.These efforts are aimed at reconnecting these brands with the consumers, building on their existing strong brand equity.Apart from this, Coty is making considerable efforts to speed up end-to-end digital transformation and boost e-commerce development.

However, skincare sales were partly hindered by soft Aveda sales.Makeup revenues were up 16% (up 13% on a constant currency basis) to $1,515 million on the back of incremental sales stemming from the acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced. Tom Ford, Estée Lauder sand MAC brands also generated robust sales.Fragrance category reported revenue growth of 14% (up 10% on a constant currency basis) to reach $565 million driven by increased sales of luxury brands and Estée Lauder fragrances.Hair Care sales amounted $144 million that advanced 5% (4% on a constant currency basis), driven by higher sales of Bumble and bumble and Aveda brands. While Aveda gained from solid online performance, Bumble and bumble sales were backed by its launch in Ulta Beauty (ULTA). These were somewhat countered by lower salon sales.Regional ResultsSales in the Americas increased 5% (on a constant currency basis as well) to $1,308 million, with North American sales benefiting from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA and improvements in many other brands. This in turn was backed by higher holiday season demand. The company’s online and specialty-multi channels also registered strong growth in the region. Sales in Latin America and Canada also witnessed noteworthy improvements. All these upsides were partially offset by soft retail traffic in few U.S. brick-and-mortar stores.Sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa region improved 20% (up 15% on a constant currency basis) to $1,562 million owing to double-digit sales growth in retail travel sales and in regions like Italy, Benelux and India. Moreover, emerging markets like Russia and Turkey contributed to sales growth. Foreign currency changes also favorably impacted the region’s results, with UK and Italy being the main contributors. However, the Middle East region registered lower sales owing to macroeconomic challenges.In the Asia/Pacific region sales soared 33% (up 30% on a constant currency basis) to $874 million. The upside was driven by spectacular performance in Hong Kong, Thailand and China, while Taiwan and Japan also posted handsome gains.Other Financial UpdatesThe company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $ 2,105 million, long-term debt of $3,374 million and total equity of $4,589 million.Net cash flows from operating activities for the first half of fiscal 2018 came in at $1,450 million, while the company incurred capital expenditures of $263 million.Estée Lauder also announced a quarterly dividend of 38 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 15, to shareholders of record as of Feb 28.Fiscal 2018 GuidanceEstée Lauder expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, which is expected to grow 5% in fiscal 2018. Additionally, acquisitions, better-quality products, innovation and improved market reach are expected to positively impact sales during the year. However, economic challenges, social and political issues affecting consumer behavior in certain countries keeps management somewhat cautious. The company also remains watchful regarding soft store traffic in the United States.    Nevertheless, the growth drivers, a solid first half and expected gains from the recently enacted tax reforms keeps management encouraged about continuing with its above-industry improvement —  in the second half and fiscal 2018.  That said, management raised its sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2018, alongside providing a favorable view for the third quarter.For fiscal 2018, Estée Lauder now expects net sales to grow 12.5-13.5%, from the previous expectation of 10-11%.

2067,EL,"The J. M. Smucker Company’s (SJM  -  Free Report) top line has been gaining from improved performance of its brands. In fact, growth in several key brands boosted the company’s top-line performance during second-quarter fiscal 2018. Further, the company is on track with product innovation efforts. It has also been augmenting offerings through acquisitions and partnerships.Driven by such factors, shares of the company have gained 8.7% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 2.5%. However, the company has been struggling with the performance of its coffee segment, due to price volatility. Let’s analyze all aspects and see if Smucker’s strategic efforts can help offset the hurdles and drive growth.Smucker’s Brand Strengthening Efforts Bode WellSmucker boasts a strong brand portfolio, which include high-quality products that are moderately priced. We note that the Jif, Smucker's, Nature's Recipe and Uncrustable brands have been performing favorably over the past few quarters. Incidentally, the company has been constructing a frozen sandwich plant in Colorado to enhance the capacity of Uncrustable brand. The growing popularity of certain brands has encouraged the company to undertake innovations. Recent launches include Natural Balance high-protein dog food offerings and Dunkin' Donuts Cold Brew Coffee. Notably, these launches contributed significantly toward sales growth during the second quarter. Additionally, the company plans to introduce Milk-Bone Puffs dog treats and Dunkin' Donuts coffee canisters by the end of fiscal 2018.Additionally, Smucker’s rich brands line-up gains from key partnerships and acquisitions. The company’s agreement with Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc. to manufacture and sell the K-Cup category of products has been yielding positive results since fiscal 2016. Further, the company’s focus on achieving expansion via acquisitions is evident from its planned buyout of Wesson oil brand from Conagra Brands. The deal is currently subject to regulatory approval.Barriers in Smucker’s WaySmucker has been struggling with volatility in the prices of green coffee. Coffee prices are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, pest infestation, political decisions as well as worldwide supply and demand conditions. Notably, green coffee prices have been rising steadily for some time, thereby denting profits in the coffee segment.Further, management expects a rise in freight costs, stemming from industry-wide headwinds to hurt performance in the forthcoming periods. Accordingly, the company lowered the high end of its fiscal 2018 earnings guidance in the last reported quarter.Final ThoughtsWe expect this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s concentration on strengthening core brands to drive the top line and offset the aforementioned hurdles. We are also encouraged with the company’s savings-boosting initiatives, which are likely to fuel investments and enhance performance in the long term. Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2068,EL,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) recently concluded the acquisition of Associated Grocers, for approximately $193 million. This Florida-based company is likely to be a profitable inclusion to SUPERVALU’s wholesale business, given its strong customer and retailer base as well as presence in key international regions.Notably, shares of SUPERVALU rose 3.6% following the announcement, during the after market trading session on Dec 8. So let’s see how Associated Grocers is expected to help SUPERVALU’s business and other factors impacting the company’s performance.  Expanding Wholesale Business SpectrumSUPERVALU derives a major portion of revenues from the wholesale business and has been consistently expanding operations, primarily through acquisitions. In fact, the company’s takeover of Unified Grocers in June drove wholesale segment sales by 58% year over year in second quarter fiscal 2018.Management believes that the wholesale segment offers significant growth prospects owing to rapidly changing consumer needs. The inclusion of Associated Grocers is expected to further enable the company reap benefits from the opportunities offered by this segment.Further, the acquisition of Associated Grocers and Unified Grocers are expected to augment the company’s offering in the specialty and organic food categories. Notably, organic food products are becoming popular owing to rising health consciousness amongst consumers. Thus, the company has been evaluating prospects in the organic foods arena and has partnered with wholesale merchants to explore opportunities in this category.Competition & Cost Inflation Weighs On StockAlthough SUPERVALU has been progressing steadily with the wholesale segment, the company’s retail category is challenged with price competition, competitive store openings and tough market conditions. As a result, the company has resorted to several store closures in the retail segment.Further, the company has been facing stiff competition from grocery rivals in terms of innovative food offerings and related services. On account of these headwinds, shares of the company have lost 31.7% over the past three months, compared with the industry’s decline of 5.2%.Can Growth Efforts Boost Performance?Nevertheless, we expect SUPERVALU’s wholesale segment growth strategies such as the acquisition of Associated Grocers to offset softness in the retail arena. Also, to revive the retail segment’s performance, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is rebranding most of its banners, launching new brands and expanding offerings in the Wild Harvest line.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2069,EL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc (PF  -  Free Report) has been steadily expanding its portfolio through acquisitions and innovations. Also, the company has been gaining from its operational efficiency initiatives that have been boosting savings. However, underlying weaknesses in the Specialty segment and changing consumer preferences have been denting the company’s top line.Let’s delve deeper into these factors and see if Pinnacle Foods’ growth drivers can help offset the hurdles.Portfolio Expansion & Savings Aid GrowthAcquisitions have been an important growth driver for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company. Along with portfolio expansion, acquisitions have been driving Pinnacle Foods’ distribution network, customer base and long-term growth. We note that the Boulder Brands buyout in 2016, provided the company new prospects in refrigerated foods business. The benefits from this acquisition are expected to enhance procurement, manufacturing and logistics operations. Further, the company expects to achieve synergies worth more than $15 million in 2017 and projects incremental synergies of $4-6 million in 2018 from Boulder Brands.  Other acquisitions which have driven Pinnacle Foods’ business in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone. Further, the company plans to expand its brands line-up through innovations. In this regard, the company launched Hungry-Man handfuls during the third quarter of 2017, which is a four-line item of hand-held pocket meals. Other noteworthy launches include the introductions of Perfect Size for One, Vlasic purely pickles and Birds Eye product lines.Moving ahead, Pinnacle Foods remains on track with operational excellence program, aimed at generating productivity savings in supply chain. Owing to such efforts, the company expects gross margin to improve 300-400 basis points by 2019. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives to boost profits including low-margin SKU rationalization and increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending. Courtesy of dedicated business expansions and efficiency boosting initiatives, Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing year-over-year growth in earnings since 2014. This also helped the company’s shares gain 13.4% in the past year, as against the industry’s decline of 2.3%.Headwinds Impacting PerformancePinnacle Foods’ Specialty segment has been reporting sluggish performance since the past five quarters. The segment’s performance was hurt by the exit of low-margin Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products and lower net price realization in the third quarter. Also, the exit of the gardein private label business and soft food service sales hampered underlying sales, alongside weighing upon the segment margin.On account of these obstacles, along with consumer’s shift toward healthy and natural food products, the company’s sales have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimates in five out of the trailing seven quarters.Final ThoughtsNevertheless, management expects earnings to improve 19% in 2017, on the back of steady growth in market share stemming from well- performing brands. Further, management remains committed toward network optimization and operational excellence programs and continues to expect benefits from acquisitions. We expect such upsides to offset the weakness in the Specialty segment and sustain growth.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2070,EL,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) performance has been impressive of late, owing to stringent cost-saving and restructuring initiatives. Additionally, this professional and personal care products company has been steadily expanding its portfolio through innovations. However, adverse North American market conditions and stiff competition in the diaper segment are headwinds.Nevertheless, Kimberly-Clark’s growth efforts have helped shares gain 2.3% in the past three months against the industry’’s decline of 6.6%.Let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s performance.Cost-Savings & Restructuring Initiatives Bode WellKimberly-Clark has been cutting costs through Focus on Reducing Costs (FORCE) program. During third-quarter 2017, the company managed to deliver cost savings of $125 million that favorably impacted the bottom-line performance. Further, it expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425-$450 million during 2017.Additionally, the company has been able to attain greater operating efficiencies and profitability on the back of restructuring efforts. Such initiatives mainly include exiting lower-margin businesses, streamlining manufacturing activities and enhancing focus on growth-oriented arenas.  Product Innovation & Focus on Emerging MarketsInnovations have enabled Kimberly-Clark maintain market share. In the near term, the company has a number of innovations lined for launch in North America, including upgrades on Huggies diapers, Depend brands and Good Nights youth pants.Additionally, Kimberly-Clark is well positioned overseas and has been expanding in developing and emerging markets. During the third quarter, organic sales in emerging markets increased 3% following an increase of 2% in the preceding quarter. Also, volume increased 4% in the developing and emerging markets in the last quarter.Headwinds Impacting PerformanceKimberly-Clark’s business in the North American consumer products category has been dismal, thanks to tough industry conditions. Also, the company has been struggling with increased competitive activity in diaper segment. The diaper category faces challenges due to lower birth rates in South Korea and in the United States. These factors have dented the company’s top-line growth for a while.Final ThoughtsWe expect Kimberly-Clark’s innovation and restructuring efforts to revive performance in the diaper segment and in North America. Further, we commend the company’s steady cost-saving efforts, which aided management to reiterate earnings and sales view for 2017.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

(The) Price and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Quote Factors at PlayEstee Lauder has been witnessing year-over year top-line growth for more than two years now, while its bottom line depicted growth in the past three quarters. The cosmetics big-wig’s splendid past record and investors’ confidence in its prospects is well reflected by the 69.1% surge in its shares over a year.

Estee Lauder remains focused on widening its global online presence by adding new sites and expanding retailer distributions.Prospects from China Bode WellWhile Estee Lauder has a solid presence in emerging markets, solid prospects from China appear bright, as sales in this region soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. This was driven by double-digit growth in all brands, with MAC, Tom Ford and Lab Series businesses nearly doubling year over year. Also, management stated that its makeup business doubled for the second straight quarter, whereas performance of its skin care and luxury fragrance business also remained favorable in the quarter. The company’s operations in China have been gaining from rising demand from millennials. Management thus envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from Asia/Pacific region is pegged at $763 million, depicting year-over-year growth of 15.8%.Skin Care & Makeup Categories Remain Major DriversAll these factors, along with growth in travel retail have been spurring growth at Estee Lauder and are most likely to sustain this trend in the quarter to be reported. Among all categories, Estee Lauder’s skin care and makeup categories have been performing particularly well for nearly a year. In the last quarter, skin care and makeup sales advanced 16% and 18% year over year, respectively. We expect these categories to remain major drivers in the second quarter as well.Turning to estimates for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for skincare and makeup sales is currently pegged at $1,434 million and $1,515 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 15% and 16%, respectively.

2075,EL,"Premium meat products company Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 (ended October, 2017) results on Nov 21, before the market opens.Over the last four quarters, the company recorded an average negative earnings surprise of 4.28%. Dismal performance of the Jennie-O Turkey Store business segment has been hurting the company’s revenues and profitability for the past several quarters.However, our proven model shows that Hormel Foods’ earnings will likely beat estimates in the quarter under review. Notably, on a month-to-date basis, Hormel Foods’ shares have yielded a return of 5.7%, outperforming 5.2% growth recorded by the industry. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Hormel Foods has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Hormel Foods has an Earnings ESP of +2.52%, as the Most Accurate estimate of 41 cents comes above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 40 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Hormel Foods’ favorable Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), when combined with a positive ESP, predicts a likely earnings beat. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Ranks #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.What’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Hormel Foods anticipates that elevated demand for its popular branded products, including Hormel Gatherings, Hormel Pepperoni, Hormel Natural Choice, Justin's, Wholly Guacamole, Herdez, Spam and Skippy, will bolster the company’s aggregate revenues, going forward.The company also believes the strategic acquisition of the Fontanini brand from Capitol Wholesale Meats, Inc (August 2017) and the Ceratti brand from Cidade do Sol (August 2017) will likely drive its top- and bottom-line results in the quarter to be reported.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the Hormel’s Grocery Products, Refrigerated Foods, Jennie-O Turkey Store and Specialty Foods segments are currently pegged at $478 million, $1,102 million, $472 million and $199 million respectively for the fiscal fourth quarter, higher than the corresponding tallies of $422 million, $1,087 million, $369 million and $197 million generated in the preceding quarter.Nevertheless, Hormel Foods fears that continued inflation in the prices of major inputs such as pork and beef trim or challenges in the Jennie-O Turkey Store business might dent its bottom-line performance. Notably, the company has lowered its fiscal 2017 earnings guidance to $1.54-$1.58 per share from the prior projection of $1.65-$1.71 per share.However, we believe that the above-mentioned headwinds will likely be offset by robust top-line performance expected in the quarter to be reported.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some stocks within the industry that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.23%.MGP Ingredients, Inc. (MGPI  -  Free Report) holds a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of +16.00%.United Natural Foods, Inc. (UNFI  -  Free Report) also carries a Zacks Rank of 2 and has an Earnings ESP of +6.33%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.      Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

2076,EL,"Avon Products, Inc (AVP  -  Free Report) has been out of investors' favor for quite some time now. The company’s persistent dismal performance can be attributed to weak Active Representatives. Reflecting the struggles of this beauty products retailer, recent records reveal that it has missed earnings and sales estimates for four consecutive quarters now.Evidently, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have plunged 62.8% in the past year, significantly wider than the industry’s decline of 7.7%. On the contrary, the broader Consumer Staples sector which is placed at the top 31% (5 out of 16) of the Zacks classified industries, gained 2.8%.What’s Troubling the Stock?Avon has been struggling with waning Active Representatives. In the last reported quarter, Active Representatives and Ending Representatives declined across all segments, barring Ending Representatives growth in North Latin America. Active Representatives declined 3% on a year-over-year basis, while Ending Representatives dipped 2% in second-quarter 2017. In fact, results in the quarter were also impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter.Further, operating margins were hampered by constant-dollar revenue decline resulting in deleveraged fixed expenses; higher bad debt expense, particularly in Brazil; increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses; elevated transportation costs, mainly in Russia and investments in advertising for product launches. Consequently, management anticipates constant-dollar revenue growth for 2017 to be at the low end of its previous guidance of low-single digits growth.Meanwhile, Avon is facing macroeconomic headwinds like intense competition from various products and product lines, in both domestic and international markets. All these factors are likely to weigh upon Avon’s performance and dent overall profitability.Can Avon’s Transformation Plan Revive Its Performance?The company’s progress on Transformation Plan, which is on track to deliver cost savings goals of $230 million for 2017, is noteworthy.Avon is now in the second year of its three-year Transformation Plan that was announced in January 2016. The plan mainly focuses on growth investment, cost structure enhancement and improvement of financial flexibility. Crossing the half-way mark of the plan period, the company has witnessed significant progress with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.These savings have considerably aided in countering inflation. Additionally, the company anticipates this plan to help it attain long-term goal of delivering low-double digit operating margin and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.Bottom LineWe believe that Avon’s Transformation Plan will spark a turnaround in the company’s performance, but this might take time. Hence, we suggest that investors should stay away from the stock until the strategies bear favorable results.Meanwhile, you can opt for some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples sector such as The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report), Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. (OLLI  -  Free Report) and Tupperware Brands Corp. (TUP  -  Free Report).Estee Lauder, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 12% has delivered average positive earnings surprise of 13.7% in the trailing four quarters.

2077,EL,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation’s (KMB  -  Free Report) shares have been dismal for a while. The company’s shares have plunged 12.5% in the past six months, compared with the industry’s decline of 9.1%. Its performance has primarily been affected by weak organic sales trend in the North American region. During the first and second quarters of 2017, organic sales from the region declined owing to high competition, reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing.Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets, its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters. Further, consumer dynamics have also shifted negatively toward Kimberly-Clark’s diaper offerings. Rising input costs are also hurting the company’s margins. Owing to such challenges, Kimberly-Clark issued soft earnings guidance for the full year, when it reported second-quarter 2017 results. The company now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Following the company’s discouraging performance and dull outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days. In the said period, estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach $6.22. Also estimated earnings of $1.55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents.  Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been striving hard to spark a turnaround. Let’s look into some of the initiatives undertaken by the company to improve performance.Product Innovations Kimberly-Clark dedicatedly focuses on innovations and product launches to improve market share. Recently, the company launched its new Kleenex Reveal Countertop System under the Kimberly-Clark Professional segment, to offer improved and exceptional hygiene products. The company has been providing greater importance toward the improvement of its personal care products portfolio, especially feminine hygiene and diaper products. Innovations related to the Huggies brand has been initiated in several regions such as in Russia and China.

2078,EL,"Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN  -  Free Report) hogged into limelight after it increased fiscal 2017 earnings guidance on Sep 28 and announced restructuring initiatives to strengthen its business to drive profits. The producer of chicken and poultry-based food products now expects fiscal 2017 bottom line to be in the range of $5.20-$5.30 per share, higher than its prior guidance of $4.95-$5.05.Meanwhile, management expects favorable market conditions to continue to boost its financials in fiscal 2018 and projects earnings in the range of $5.70-$5.85, reflecting year-over-year growth of 8-13%. We believe continued focus on protein-rich brands and cost savings are driving the company’s profitability.Evidently, shares of the company have been on a growth trajectory over the past three months. In the said time frame, the company’s shares have increased 18.9% compared with the industry’s rise of 14.2%. In fact, Tyson Foods’ shares have increased more than 8% since it raised earnings guidance. Tyson Foods also flaunts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option.Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what’s taking this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company higher.Focus on High Protein BrandsTyson Foods has been witnessing earnings growth courtesy of its improved sales performance. Notably, the company delivered higher sales volumes driven by increased demand for high protein foods. The acquisition of AdvancePierre acquisition, which was carried out in June, will enable the company to expand its fastest-growing portfolio of protein-packed brands and fresh prepared foods offerings.While Tyson Foods is restructuring its portfolio to focus more on protein-rich brands, it’s exiting its non-core businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) to focus on protein-packed brands and drive sales.Improved performance of the company’s Beef segment, backed by enhanced domestic demand, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports, is also fueling sales. The company is also witnessing higher demand for chicken and pork, which is expected to drive Tyson Foods’ top line.In fact, management expects sales growth across all of its business segments buoyed by rising consumption, easy availability of livestock and higher pricing.Cost SavingsMeanwhile, cost savings is further boosting earnings momentum. Tyson Foods expects to generate cost savings of $200 million, $400 million, and $600 million in fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, through the AdvancePierre acquisition.Also, the company is seeking to reinventing its supply-chain and procurement process and lowering overhead costs to boost savings. These cost savings are expected to improve the performance of Tyson Foods’ Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. Meanwhile, to streamline its management, the company would slash 450 jobs from corporate offices in Chicago, Springdale, and Cincinnati.We expect that the company’s dedicated efforts toward inducing operational efficiency and reducing costs to improve margins and thereby profits in the forthcoming months.Innovation Aids Portfolio GrowthTyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up. As an increasing number of health-conscious U.S. consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts, Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category. Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas, Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers.Valuation MultiplesIf we look into the company’s P/E, EV/EBITDA and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Tyson Foods has a trailing P/E multiple of 14.8 and EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.0. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the industry at large, as the P/E multiple and EV/EBITDA multiple for the industry is pegged at 16.0 and 11.2, respectively. These are also trading below S&P 500 levels of 20.6 and 11.4, respectively. This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to the industry and S&P 500.Currently, Tyson Foods has a P/S ratio of 0.7. This is also lower than the industry average of 1.1 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 3.2. Valuation MultipleTyson FoodsIndustryS&P 500P/E ratio (ttm)14.816.020.6P/S ratio0.71.13.2EV/EBITDA10.011.211.4Looking for More?

2079,EL,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) has been gaining momentum of late driven by its efforts to boost its portfolio. Though rising material costs, sluggish sales in the U.K. and higher brand marketing expenses have raised concerns for sustaining the company’s performance, its acquisitions and innovation initiatives bode well for the company. Moreover, its cost-saving initiatives has significantly aided profitability.The company also posted upbeat third-quarter fiscal 2017 results recently and raised its fiscal year outlook. Let’s delve deeper into the earnings performance as well as other factors which are providing an impetus to the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company to scale higher.Robust Third-Quarter ResultsMcCormick outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for both earnings and revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2017. In fact, the company delivered positive earnings surprise in 13 of the last 15 quarters. Earnings grew on the back of cost savings as well as lower currency impacted earnings, while acquisition of food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group (RB Foods) and Enrico Giotti SpA and a shift in the portfolio to more value added products boosted sales. Despite higher brand marketing expenses and material costs, the company delivered double-digit adjusted operating income growth and expanded its adjusted operating income margin, marking seven consecutive quarters of margin expansion.The company also raised its sales, operating income and earnings guidance to reflect the acquisition of RB Foods. Moreover, the company expects lower currency impact on fiscal 2017 earnings. The company expects higher brand marketing, increased pricing, new products, expanded distribution and acquisitions to contribute to growth. Further, the company anticipates pricing actions to offset higher material costs, which are anticipated to rise by mid-single digits.Better-than-expected third-quarter results also pulled up shares of the company. We observed that the stock has outperformed the industry on a year-to-date basis. While the stock yielded around 7%, the industry declined 9.7% in the said time frame.Estimates RisingThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter as well as for fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018 has been moving north over the last seven days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter climbed 4.9%. Estimates increased 3.7% for fiscal 2017 and 2.2% for fiscal 2018, respectively.McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  McCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | McCormick & Company, Incorporated QuoteAcquisitions Boosting SalesMcCormick has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. In the emerging markets too, the company has extended its reach where it had little or no distribution. The recent acquisition of RB Foods in August is the largest deal for the company till date. The deal has added iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce, French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce to the company’s robust spices portfolio. These brands will position the company in the leading U.S. condiments category and will strengthen and expand McCormick's business presence internationally. Further, these brands will perfectly suit McCormick’s plan of offering healthy and flavored foods to consumers.In the past too, the company has made significant acquisitions, including the buyout of Italy-based Enrico Giotti SpA (December 2016), Australia-based Botanical Food Company (April 2016), Austin, TX-based One World Foods, Inc., the seller of Stubb's barbeque sauces (August 2015), New Jersey-based Brand Aromatics (March 2015) and Drogheria & Alimentari (February 2015), which significantly contributed to sales.Product Innovation & Shift Toward Healthy ProductsMcCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to remain competitive and tap the rising demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. The company also focuses to fulfill consumer demand for flavored foods.McCormick has strong retail acceptance on new products, including McCormick and Lawry's brand spice and seasonings, Gourmet Garden and Stubb's products and McCormick brand recipe mixes. The company is also looking to offer innovative flavors in breakfast platform and ready-to-serve gravies. McCormick is also shaping up its portfolio with gluten-free, non-GMO and organic products to satisfy the evolving needs of consumers.

Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program has helped the company to focus on reducing costs and enhancing productivity. The company has used CCI savings to increase its investments, thereby leading to higher sales and profits. The company is also divesting low margin businesses in EMEA region to further improve productivity across the organization.McCormick expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017, up from at least $100 million expected previously. It expects savings of around $400 million by Nov 30, 2019.Better ReturnsWe note that the company has delivered better returns than the industry as well as S&P 500.Valuation MultipleMKCIndustryS&P 500ROE26.1%10.7%15.9%ROA8.2%4.5%3.0%ROC13.3%6.6%8.3% Further, a low beta of 0.53, a dividend yield of 1.92%, and a long-term earnings growth rate of 9.4% also makes the stock attractive.Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

2080,EL,"We expect Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports third-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Feb 1. The company posted positive earnings surprise of 4.7% in the last reported quarter.Moreover, the company has delivered positive earnings surprises consistently in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 11.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.84, reflecting year-over-year decline of 1.1%. We note that earnings estimate for the current quarter has trended up in the last seven days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.65 billion, down about 3.9% from the year-ago quarter.Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Ralph Lauren Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Ralph Lauren Corporation QuoteRalph Lauren has outperformed the industry in the past month, reflecting increased optimism on the stock ahead of the earnings release. The company’s shares have surged 13.8%, compared with industry’s growth of 7.1%.Factors at PlayRalph Lauren has a robust surprise trend with positive earnings surprises delivered in 11 straight quarters. Favorable geographic and channel mix shifts along with lower promotions and reduced product costs have been aiding bottom-line performance. Additionally, results in recent quarters have been gaining from foreign currency tailwinds.The company’s third-quarter and updated fiscal 2018 guidance clearly reflect the gains from recent positive movements in foreign currency rates. The company expects foreign currency to benefit revenue growth by nearly 160-170 basis points (bps) and operating margin by 10-20 bps in the third quarter. Furthermore, it now estimates foreign currency to aid revenue growth by nearly 80 bps, compared with the previous guidance of minimal negative impact. Moreover, foreign currency is now anticipated to have a minimum effect on operating margin, compared with 40-50 bps negative impact predicted earlier.Looking ahead, management remains confident of Ralph Lauren’s performance, based on its efforts related to global brand reorganization, constant infrastructural investments and e-commerce enhancements. Further, the company’s efforts to evolve product and marketing bode well. All these factors make us optimistic about Ralph Lauren’s upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Ralph Lauren is likely to beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.17% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.88 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.84.

2081,EL,"Dismal earnings trend and fall in Active Representatives have been major concerns for Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), which has been losing investor confidence. Further, the company’s strained margins and high bad debt expenses indicate that the troubles for this beauty products company are far from over.Scoring low on investor confidence, the company has witnessed steep fall in stock price lately. Evidently, it lost as much as 36.8% in the last six months, against the industry’s growth of 23.4%. Further, this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company’s Momentum Score of F suggest that the stock is not likely to pick up any time soon. That said, let’s get a more detailed picture of the troubles for Avon.Surprise Trend Hurt by Waning Active RepresentativesAvon’s troubles are not very new. The company has been displaying a dismal earnings trend for the past five quarters. Though sales outpaced estimates in third-quarter 2017, it had lagged in the preceding four quarters. The dismal performances can primarily be attributed to waning Active Representatives, which declined 3% in the most recent quarter. Additionally, we note that Active Representatives have been consistently recording a decline of 3% for the trailing four quarters. The fall in Active Representatives is due to decline in all segments.Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteStrained MarginsApart from soft top and bottom-line results, Avon has been witnessing strained margins over the past few quarters. Notably, the company’s operating margin contracted 70 basis points (bps), 230 bps and 130 bps in the third, second and first quarters of 2017. The decline in operating margin mainly stemmed from higher bad debt expenses, particularly in Brazil. Additionally, increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses have been hurting margin growth in the last two quarters.Bleak OutlookWhile Avon expects modest growth in fourth-quarter 2017 backed by favorable trends in various markets, it projects results to fall short of expectations in 2017. The company now anticipates both constant-dollar revenues and adjusted operating margin in the band of flat to slightly up compared with the prior-year period.Though management remains focused to drive growth through innovations, solid team execution, improving Representative experience, we believe it will take time to realize the benefits from its strategies.Competition to Take a Toll on ResultsAvon faces intense competition from other cosmetics products retailer in domestic and international markets. Changing market trends and evolving consumer preferences might also weigh upon the performance and hurt overall profitability.Not Done Yet?

2082,EL,"With acquisitions and efforts to boost online business rolled up in its sleeves, Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) seems well on track to augment market share in the world of beauty and cosmetics. In fact, these factors have been fueling the top line performance of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company for a while.However, a major obstacle in Coty’s growth path is the sluggishness in the Consumer Beauty segment. This has been denting the company’s organic sales performance. So, let’s see if Coty’s growth drivers can help the company to tide over obstacles and sustain its growth in the forthcoming periods.Acquisitions: A Vital Growth DriverImproved consumer confidence has not only been favoring higher spending on food and beverage items, but has also increased spending on personal care and cosmetic products. Such trends have been boosting Coty’s Luxury and Professional segments performance and have also encouraged the company to engage in business expansion through buyouts.In fact, Coty has made several strategic acquisitions to enhance its rich line-up of brands. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company’s top line improved more than 100% year over year, mainly driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout and positive synergies from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. Other instances include the buyout of 60% stake in LLC and the takeover of international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare.Other Efforts to Boost PerformanceFurther, Coty is boosting end-to-end digital transformation efforts including e-commerce across its divisions and regions. The company has been making great strides in this regard, which has driven e-commerce sales growth in Consumer Beauty and Luxury segments in the first quarter. Notably, through the peer-to-peer social selling platform Younique, Coty has been able to establish improved connectivity with customers. Further, the company is making progress with COVERGIRL brand through Custom Blend app. The app enables customers take a digital, social and influencer-led go-to-market approach as well as personalize and customize it as per desire.Additionally, Coty is committed toward enhancing cost structure. This is indicated from the fact that the company’s gross margin has been expanding for a while now. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the adjusted gross margin increased 280 basis points, courtesy of supply-chain efficiencies; procurement synergies and contributions from buyouts. Also, the adjusted operating income jumped 17% to $195.1 million, driven by Coty’s stringent financial discipline.Aided by such upsides, shares of the company have surged 32.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s rally of 22.1%.Can Strategic Plans Offset Headwinds?Lately, persistent softness in Consumer Beauty segment has been a worry for the company. The segment has been struggling against underlying challenges in North America, thanks to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Soft market trends in major cosmetics categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in the United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for the segment. Evidently, organic sales in this segment tumbled 8% in the first quarter, following declines of 10% and 6% in the fourth and third quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively.Nevertheless, Coty’s strategic business expansion and efficiency-building endeavors have helped the company to develop a robust brand line-up. We expect such efforts to help the company overcome the aforementioned headwinds.Greedy for Consumer Staples Stocks?

2083,EL,"U.S. Senate Republicans revealed a tax plan that entails the deferment of corporate tax cuts for a year. Such a delay raised concerns about President Trump’s ability to pass laws, aggravated by the Wall Street ending an eight-week winning streak. After all, lowering of taxes was one of the major campaign promises made by Trump that helped push the major indices to a series of record highs since the 2016 presidential election. Add to this the high valuations and corporate debt plaguing the broader markets and the decade-long Bull Run is without a question nearing an end.In the wake of such uncertainty, picking stocks isn’t easy. But there are ways to reduce the chances of making a bad investment. In such a scenario, stocks that are undisturbed by market gyration provide steady earnings growth and have higher market capitalization, making solid bets.Tax Overhaul AmbiguityThe Senate seeks to delay the tax reduction plan until 2019. This hasn’t gone down well with investors as lowering of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% can strengthen the labor market and revitalize the economy. It will also encourage the world’s ingenious entrepreneurs to establish their business in the United States.On top of it, the Senate added that the plan will impose a minimum of 10% on income from intangible assets like intellectual property. Multinational companies that generate a significant portion of non-U.S. profits from intellectual properties were in the line of fire. Notable among them are companies from the tech sector. Tech & Banks Affected the MostTech companies, in the meanwhile, benefit immensely from the lowering of the tax rate. Their after-tax earnings improve leading to repatriation of trillions of dollars held abroad by such companies. Tech companies can use this extra cash for research and developments, and mergers and acquisitions. Hence, a possible delay in the much-anticipated corporate tax cuts resulted in a bout of selling of tech stocks.Banks weren’t spared either. This is because lowering of corporate taxes will bolster investments and will be a boon for lenders. Adding to the trouble for banks was a flattest yield curve for a decade, which will affect an already weak interest income at the nation’s largest lenders.Eight-Week Winning Streak Comes to an EndIn fact, the broader equity market registered its first weekly loss in two months as investors remained wary after the congressional Republicans failed to make inroads with passing tax cuts. The 30-stock Dow Jones fell 39.73 points to close at 23,422.21 on Nov 10 and the S&P 500 index declined 1%, finishing at 2,582.3. Both the indices recorded an eight-week winning streak, their longest since 2013. Meanwhile, the index of small-cap stocks, the Russell 2000, fell 1.3% and posted its steepest weekly decline since August.Volatility has crept back into the markets. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), a gauge which uses options-trading data to measure implied volatility of S&P 500 stocks, jumped 9.6% to close at 11.51. VIX also ended the week slightly above its 2017 average after touching a record low the week earlier.Other Potential Red FlagsNot only the delay in tax reforms, markets are flashing several warning signs. The biggest roadblock is lofty valuations. The bull market already stretches back to March 2009 as a result the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of the S&P 500 is well above 31, the second-highest valuation in a century as per Lyn Alden, founder of Lyn Alden Investment Strategy, in Atlantic City, NJ. It now lags valuations seen in the late 1990s dot-com bubble.We should also remember that there is too much risk in the Bull Run as the gains are concentrated on certain stocks. According to David Winters, CEO of Wintergreen Advisers and portfolio manager of Wintergreen Fund such stocks include Alphabet (GOOGL  -  Free Report), Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report), Apple (AAPL  -  Free Report), eBay, Facebook, Microsoft Corp., Netflix, Priceline (PCLN), Salesforce (CRM) and Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), all have gained an average of 29% so far this year. They have also contributed almost a third of the S&P 500’s return since the end of 2014.Last but not the least, corporate debt ceiling is on the rise. As per JP Morgan’s recent ‘Guide to Markets’, corporate debt as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) touched 45% the highest in recent history.Time to Buy Ultra-Safe Stocks: 5 Solid ChoicesWith the markets apprehending a healthy pullback after a strong run, investing in stocks that are immune to market gyrations seems judicious. The best way to go about doing this is by creating a portfolio of ultra-safe stocks.They essentially have a low beta, which makes them less volatile than the markets they trade in.

2084,EL,"The consumer staples sector has been on a growth trajectory since the beginning of the year, on the back of improved economic scenario buoyed by rising consumer confidence, which is a key determinant of the economy’s health. Although consumer confidence declined marginally in September due to hurricane Harvey and Irma’s impact in Texas and Florida, we believe the economic conditions are quite favorable and indicate that the economy will continue to grow in the near term.The improving economy was also supported by labor market optimism and the recent gross domestic product (GDP) rate provided by the Commerce Department in consumer spending for the second quarter 2017. The commerce department stated that GDP rose 3.1% in the second quarter of 2017, the highest in two years. The recent tax cut proposal proposed by President Trump further instills confidence.However, we understand that the U.S. economy is not fully immune to global uncertainties, which could limit growth potential. But the encouraging data as well as the new tax reforms reflects that the economy is in good shape and the spending power is likely to increase going forward. This is also well reflected in the three key U.S. indexes, which have closed in positive territory so far this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 13.0%. The S&P 500 rose 11.9%, while Nasdaq grew 20.3% on a year-to-date basis.How Will Investors Gain From This Scenario?At this moment, investors must be looking for those stocks that have been gaining momentum and are expected to outpace market’s performance in the coming months.

2085,EL,"The cosmetic industry is in huge demand currently. With the improvement in the U.S. economy, shoppers have started spending on beauty and personal care products as well as apparel, footwear and personal accessories apart from buying essential and non-durable goods. The rise of e-commerce and social media has provided a further impetus to the fast-growing beauty channels. In such a scenario, many companies are looking for opportunities to strengthen their footholds in the fast-growing beauty segment. Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) is no exception. This global consumer products giant recently clinched a deal to buy cosmetics company Carver Korea for 2.27 billion euros ($2.71 billion) from Goldman Sachs, Bain Capital and Carver's founder. Bain and Goldman jointly held 60.39% of Carver at the end of 2016, while its founder Lee Sang-rok held a 35% stake. Carver generated sales of 321 million euros ($381 million) with core profit of 137 million euros in 2016.Acquisition Benefits for UnileverNotably, the Anglo-Dutch company has been striking many skincare and cosmetics deals in the past to expand its footprint in the global beauty business as well as move away from its slower-growth food segment. Carver will join brands including Hourglass, Murad, Kate Somerville and REN in Unilever’s Prestige division.The acquisition is likely to provide ample growth opportunities to Unilever in both North and South Korea, despite geopolitical tensions between China and Korea related to the missile tests and China’s banning of tour packages to South Korea. The deal will open doors for Unilever in South Korea, where skincare sales are expected to reach $6.3 billion this year, according to research firm Euromonitor. Unilever will be able poised for growth in the skincare business in South Korea through its AHC brand of anti-ageing creams, moisturizers and other skin products. Unilever will also have access to North Asia’s skincare market, where Carver has significant presence. With this acquisition, Unilever will expand in the fourth-largest skincare market, as per reports.The buyout will also place the company in the beauty category which has been witnessing high growth, driven by social media content and diversified professional make-up techniques. Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) are growing significantly courtesy of rising demand for beauty products. We expect the acquisition to strengthen Unilever’s portfolio and generate substantial revenues.We note that Unilever has been trying all means to become more reliant on bath, body and beauty products after the unexpected $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) in February 2017. Since then, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends as well as raise its margin target in order to boost its performance. In April, Unilever has reportedly decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter. Furthermore, the company announced plans to raise cost-savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever PLC QuoteStock Price MovementThe company has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying since the company rejected Kraft Heinz deal. Since Feb 17, the company’s shares have rallied 35.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 11.8% and the broader Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 4.5%. Unilever currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2086,EL,"Of late, the Consumer Staples sector has been witnessing rising consumer confidence, backed by improving economic and labor market conditions as well rising GDP numbers.  This has further triggered an increase in consumers spending power. Apart from purchasing essential items such as grocery, food and beverage products, consumers are also seen to spend heavily on apparel items, personal care and beauty products.  Moreover, luxury spending is also aided by the increasing preference for e-commerce.While such trends have been benefiting cosmetics companies like The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises Inc (NUS  -  Free Report), other companies in the industry are still struggling with competitive pressures. One such company is Coty Inc (COTY  -  Free Report). We observed that Coty’s shares have declined close to 14% since it announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 22. Moreover, the company’s shares have declined more than 9% in the past six months against the industry’s gain of 11.3%.Headwinds Impacting the Company                                   Although the company’s strategic acquisitions, including ghd and Younique, have aided its top-line expansion, such measures have also increased the company’s marketing spending and have led to an increase in its fixed cost structure.In addition to increased operational expenditures, Coty’s segments have not depicted growth during fiscal 2017. In fact, its Consumer Beauty segment has remained sluggish since the past few quarters. The segment has been consistently witnessing underlying challenges, especially in North America, driven by a combination of weak market trends across several of its categories and some reduction of shelf space for few brands like Astor.Additionally, increasing competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences have been hurting the company’s performance. In particular, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the United States and mass fragrance in Western Europe and in the domestic market are expected to impact business. Dismal Earnings Trend & Estimate Revisions We note that Coty has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 27.7%. Sales have also lagged estimates in two out of the past four quarters.Estimate revisions have also been down trending owing to ongoing challenges. Estimate for the forthcoming first-quarter fiscal 2018 has declined 18 cents to reach 7 cents, in the past thirty days, while the same for fiscal 2018 has also gone down 22 cents to reach 69 cents.  Coty’s ScorecardSome of the key financial ratios of Coty are also observed to be weaker than the industry, as depicted in the scorecard below.Final ThoughtsAlthough Coty has been working towards improving its segments and achieving a turnaround from its sluggish performance, the transition is expected to take time. Further, Coty carries a VGM Score of D and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating that the stock is currently not a safe pick for investors.Looking For Consumer Staples Stock?

2087,EL,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with the former marking its third straight beat. While the top line surged considerably thanks to gains from buyouts, organic sales declined year over year owing to weakness in the Consumer Beauty segment.Nonetheless, the better-than-expected results and Coty’s solid ongoing prospects seems to have encouraged investors. Evidently, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are up 9.1% in the pre-market trading session. Let’s see if this can bring a turnaround to Coty’s past stock performance, as shares of this cosmetics company have plunged 25% in the past six months, as against the industry’s 10.6% gain.The company’s adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share slumped 57% year over year, while it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of 3 cents per share.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. Quote Quarter in DetailThe company generated revenues of $2,238.3 million, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,224 million. Further, revenues surged over 100% year over year, driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout. Also, contributions from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique aided sales growth. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5%.Excluding the impacts from ghd and Younique, organic revenues of the combined company (Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business) dipped 2% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly accountable to softness in the company’s Consumer Beauty segment, somewhat compensated by solid growth in the Luxury unit and modest improvement in the Professional Beauty unit.Adjusted gross margin expanded 280 basis points to 61.6% in the quarter thanks to the buyouts of higher margin businesses, as well as synergies from supply chain and procurement. While adjusted operating income jumped 17% to $195.1 million, adjusted operating margin contracted 670 basis points to 8.7% in the quarter.Segment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues surged 70% to $764.4 million on a reported basis, backed by gains from the P&G Beauty business buyout. On a currency neutral basis, the combined company’s revenues rose 4%, attributable to strength in Hugo Boss, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Gucci. Adjusted operating income for Luxury remained flat year over year at $89.9 million in the quarter.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty soared 82% to $1,043.4 million on a reported basis, driven by contributions from Younique and P&G Beauty business. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues of the combined company climbed 2%, thanks to 10% contribution from Younique, largely offset by an 8% drop in underlying revenues of the combined entity.The latter stemmed from continued sluggishness in the global mass beauty space and weak performance of some retail hair brands. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty advanced 54% to $88.3 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $430.5 million improved over 100%, driven by gains from P&G Beauty business and ghd buyouts. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 13% for the combined entity, including 12% gains from ghd and consistent strength in Wella and System Professional sales. This was partly mitigated by lower Clairol Professional sales. Adjusted operating income for Professional dipped marginally to $16.9 million.On a region-wise basis, net revenues surged over 100% (on a reported basis) across North America and Europe, driven by Younique and ghd’s contributions, respectively. However, the respective sales were partly hampered by softness in the United States and Germany. Sales at the ALMEA region jumped 74% on a reported basis.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended the quarter with with cash and cash equivalents of $919.2 million, long-term debt (net) of $7,541.9 million and total shareholders’ equity of $9,452.3 million (excluding non-controlling interests).The company used net cash from operating activities of $8.9 million and free cash flow in the quarter amounted to negative $120.3 million.In a separate press release, the company also announced a dividend of 12.5 cents per share, payable on Dec 14 to shareholders of record as on Nov 30. Further, on Sep 14, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share for a total of $93.6 million.Other DevelopmentsEarlier this month, the company concluded the buyout of its unique international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare, which will extend over the long term.OutlookManagement remains pleased with the solid growth at its Luxury business and ongoing momentum at the Professional segment. Further, enhanced gross margin and effective cost management helped the company log higher profits. The company remains optimistic about the ongoing synergies from buyouts, which have been solidifying its portfolio.That said, the company expects improved net revenue growth in the remainder of fiscal 2018, with organic sales likely to remain flat year over year in the second half of the fiscal. Management also expects healthy margin improvement over the remainder of fiscal 2018.Looking for More Promising Bets? Check These Trending PicksThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

We note that sales have been lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters, including the current one. However, net sales for the fourth quarter depicted a 5.7% growth from the year-ago period, owing to acquisition-integrated benefits from Gourmet Guru, Inc. and Haddon House Food Products.Also, during the fourth quarter, the company experienced inflation of 13 basis points (bps), thereby breaking the chain of deflation experienced over the past few quarters.Gross margin during the period expanded 15 bps to 15.8%.

However earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.54 per share.Net sales for the fiscal year of $9.3 billion depicted a rise of 9.5% from last year, mainly due to gains from the acquisitions of Nor-Cal Produce, Inc., Global Organic/Specialty Source, Inc., Haddon House Food Products, Inc. and Gourmet Guru, Inc.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.64 is below this guided range. The company also expects a negative impact of 3 cents upon the projected earnings, due to the adoption of ASU (Accounting Standard Update) 2016-09, which would lead to raising the tax rate.Our Take While United Natural has been gaining from its strategic acquisitions, competitive pricing has been hindering its performance.Moreover, although United Natural’s sales have finally begun benefiting from inflation, its growth rate has been meager in the fourth quarter.Looking for Consumer Staples Stocks?

2090,EL,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report), which has an impressive foothold in the cosmetics space, has seen its shares tumble 11.6% over a year, as against the industry’s 13.9% increase. Investors’ bearish stance on Coty can be mainly accountable to persistent softness at the Consumer Beauty segment, which has been posting weak organic sales for three straight quarters now. However, Coty is undertaking significant efforts to improve the performance of this segment. So, let’s delve deeper into all aforementioned aspects and see if the Consumer Beauty segment is up for revival.What’s Behind Consumer Beauty’s Lackluster Performance?Coty’s consumer beauty segment has been grappling with underlying challenges in North America, mainly due to changing consumers’ preferences and a highly competitive environment. Notably, Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report) was also bearing the brunt of dismal sales in North America to an extent which compelled this cosmetics player to exit the region. Coming back to Coty, soft market trends across some major categories and reduced shelf space for few brands (in United States and Europe) have been acting as deterrents for its consumer beauty segment.Owing to these headwinds, organic sales at the segment declined 6% and 10% in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. In fact, fiscal 2017 also witnessed a 10% drop in organic sales at this division. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, consumer beauty organic sales tumbled 8% due to persistent softness in the global mass beauty market, along with weakness in some brands like retail hair. In fact, softness in Consumer Beauty was also a major reason for the 2% dip in Coty’s overall organic sales in the quarter.Is There Any Scope for Revival?Management remains focused on reviving the performance of this unit, which accounted for close to half of Coty’s top line in the first quarter. Evidently, the company has been taking steps to make innovations, and enhance product development and communication processes to address the changing consumer demands and provide on-trend products. Progressing on these lines, Coty recently announced the relaunch of COVERGIRL brand, and plans to reposition Max Factor and Sally Hansen brands.Also, Coty is making considerable efforts to speed up end-to-end digital transformation and boost e-commerce development. Apart from this, management remains impressed with Consumer Beauty’s performance in the ALMEA region, especially Brazil that has been depicting robust results for a while now.While these growth strategies and prospects from Brazil make this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company confident of seeing better trends at its vital Consumer Beauty segment, management expects the recovery to take some time. Until then, investors can count on the following better-ranked stocks from the same sector.2 Consumer Staples Stocks in the SpotlightThe Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

(The) Quote On including certain one-time items like restructuring costs associated with Leading Beauty Forward initiative and charges related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”), earnings came in at 33 cents, down significantly from $1.15 reported in the year-ago period.Estee Lauder’s net sales of $3,744 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,673 million. Moreover, sales increased 17% from the prior-year quarter, driven by acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced, which contributed about 2 percentage points of the reported sales growth. Further, sales advanced 14% on a constant currency basis, courtesy of exceptional growth in travel retail, Asia and the company’s global online sales. Further, several regions in Europe and most product categories delivered double-digit sales growth. Also, the brands delivered stellar e-commerce results in the holiday season, with customizable gift choices being major contributors.Gross profit increased 16% to $2,991 million but gross margin shrank 20 basis points (bps) to 78.3% as improved revenues were offset by higher cost of sales.Product Based Segment ResultsOn the basis of product category, Skin Care reported sales growth of 20% year over year (up 17% on a constant currency basis) to $1,494 million, owing to double-digit improvements in brands including GLAMGLOW, La Mer, Origins and Estée Lauder.

While Aveda gained from solid online performance, Bumble and bumble sales were backed by its launch in Ulta Beauty (ULTA  -  Free Report). These were somewhat countered by lower salon sales.Regional ResultsSales in the Americas increased 5% (on a constant currency basis as well) to $1,308 million, with North American sales benefiting from the acquisitions of Too Faced and BECCA and improvements in many other brands. This in turn was backed by higher holiday season demand. The company’s online and specialty-multi channels also registered strong growth in the region. Sales in Latin America and Canada also witnessed noteworthy improvements. All these upsides were partially offset by soft retail traffic in few U.S. brick-and-mortar stores.Sales in Europe, the Middle East & Africa region improved 20% (up 15% on a constant currency basis) to $1,562 million owing to double-digit sales growth in retail travel sales and in regions like Italy, Benelux and India.

However, the Middle East region registered lower sales owing to macroeconomic challenges.In the Asia/Pacific region sales soared 33% (up 30% on a constant currency basis) to $874 million.

2093,EL,"On Sep 14, the U.S. market’s broadest benchmark homed in on the crucial 2,500 mark during a relatively quiet session of trading. This was the second successive record close for the S&P 500, a feat matched by the two other primary gauges of market performance. Of course, underneath the cautious optimism, wariness about a near-term pullback continued to linger. However, analysts at independent broker LPL Financial believe that after a five-month streak of wins, the S&P 500 is on track to mop up further profits this month. Further, the index has nearly always gained in the one-year period immediately following this winning streak. This makes it imperative to pick up S&P 500 stocks, which have mopped up strong gains during this period.Third Strongest Bull Run for S&P 500The S&P 500 gained 0.1% on Sep 13, ending at 2,498.37, only marginally short of the 2,500 mark. Since March 2009, the index has gained a stunning 269%, eclipsing the 266% increase recorded during the Bull Run extending from 1949 to 1956. This increase makes the current Bull Run the third strongest ever recorded. These insights were revealed by data from Bloomberg and the S&P 500 Dow Jones Indices.Although the extent of these increases could raise selloff fears among investors, such alarm is unwarranted. But this is because this stretch of gains loses its luster when considering annualized returns. This measure comes in at only 17%, the fourth poorest when considering 13 such periods. The reason for such a dismal showing is not difficult to discover, of course. At eight and a half years, this is the second longest Bull Run of all time.Five-Month Stretch of Gains to Power Future IncreasesBut for March, when it lost 0.04%, the S&P 500 has now gained for five straight months in a row. In fact, the index has now gained for nine months out of the last 10. Taking total returns into account, which includes the impact of dividends, the index has increased every single month since October 2016.Even as a large swathe of investors worry about pricey valuations, this long streak of gains should serve to ease their fears. Analysts at LPL Financial have stated that such five month stretches of gains are usually followed by year over year increases nearly 96% of the time. The average increase recorded over this period stands at 13.2%. The S&P 500 had gained for five successive months during the period stretching from March to July last year. Between July 2016 and 2017, the index gained 13.7%.Considering a shorter time frame, the S&P 500 also increases over the month following such a winning streak, opines LPL Financial. Per the company’s data such gains have occurred 20 out of 25 times in the past. During the month immediately after a five-month winning stretch, the index has increased by an average level of 1.3%. Incidentally, the S&P 500 has already gained 1.1% till now this month.       Our ChoicesWith the S&P 500 lingering near the 2,500 mark, market naysayers are already raising the specter of a pullback. However, long term trends show that a five month winning streak is usually followed by strong year-over-year gains.Further, such a stretch of increases usually leads to gains in the month immediately following such a period. Picking S&P 500 stocks which have notched up strong gains during this period makes for a profitable option. However, picking winning stocks may be difficult.This is where our VGM Score comes in.

2096,EL,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500.

2097,EL,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has turned out to be pretty well so far, especially on the revenue front. In fact, the season has been witnessing a sturdy revenue momentum, above average proportion of positive surprises alongside a favorable revisions trend for the present and the upcoming quarters.Per the lastest Earnings Outlook, nearly 185 S&P 500 members have already reported results. Of these, approximately 82.2% delivered a positive earnings surprise while 80% surpassed the top-line expectations. Notably, earnings for these companies have improved 13.3% from the year-ago quarter with revenues up 8.2%.For the fourth quarter as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are projected to rise 11.9% year over year on 7.6% growth in revenues.A Look at Consumer Staples SectorSoap & cleaning materials and Cosmetics stocks form part of the Consumer Staples sector. The sector is poised to benefit from the buoyant U.S. economy, supported by rising consumer confidence, modest consumer spending and a steady labor market.Furthermore, we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which two sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the current quarter. Though the Consumer Staples sector has gained 5.3% in the last three months, it has lagged the S&P 500’s growth of 9.6%. However, the sector is likely to witness a year-over-year growth of 5.9% and 2.5% in earnings and revenues, respectively.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s see what awaits this Consumer Staples duo which is slated to report quarterly results on Feb 2.What’s in Store for EL and CLX?The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its solid focus on buyouts and product launches, sturdy foothold in the beauty space and robust online business. Driven by these efforts, this cosmetics giant marked its 13th and 3rd straight earnings and sales beat, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018. While Estee Lauder has a solid presence in emerging markets, solid prospects from China appear bright as sales in this region soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. Management thus envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from Asia/Pacific region is pegged at $763 million, depicting year-over-year growth of 15.8%.Moreover, the company’s skin care and makeup categories have been performing particularly well for nearly a year. We expect these categories to remain major drivers in the fiscal second quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for skincare and makeup sales is currently pegged at $1,434 million and $1,515 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 15% and 16%, respectively. Also, the consensus mark for fragrance and hair care sales stands at $553 million and $147 million compared with the year-ago period sales of $497 million and $137 million, respectively.Clearly, Estee Lauder is expected to continue with its top- and bottom-line growth trend in the second quarter. Management forecasts net sales growth of 13-15% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 10-11%. Further, the company envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $1.38-$1.41 per share for the to-be-reported quarter, thereby marking an increase of 13% to 15% over the prior-year earnings. Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 for the second quarter moved up in the past 30 days, and represents more than 18% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,673 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

The strategy is likely to be achieved through the key accelerators like investment in brands, development of e-commerce, technological advancements, enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight. Despite a strong start to fiscal 2018, the company lowered its view for the period due to hurricane-related impacts and the divestiture of Aplicare business. Further, inflation as well as high commodity and logistics costs might dent gross margin.

2098,EL,"Ulta Beauty Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its effective marketing initiatives, loyalty program, sturdy e-commerce business, superb salon operations and strength in prestige cosmetics. Additionally, favorable traffic is driving comparable store sales (comps) growth. The company’s notable growth in e-commerce sales has also helped it stand out amid intense online competition.However, declining margins and stiff competition remain impediments. The company shares have declined 13.6% in the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 19.8%.Let’s delve deeper to analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stock.Splendid Earnings History & Robust OutlookUlta Beauty has maintained a solid earnings surprise trend having reported 16 straight quarters of earnings beat. Moreover, the company’s top line has surpassed estimates in 15 of the last 16 quarters. Of late, solid top- and bottom-line performances can be attributed to enhanced market share gains and benefits from attractive loyalty program offers. Additionally, the company is witnessing solid growth across all product categories with prestige cosmetics standing out. Further, robust traffic at stores is boosting comps, which improved double-digits in the most recent quarter.Looking ahead, the company expects to deliver comps growth (including e-commerce) in the range of 10-11% for 2017. Meanwhile, it anticipates e-commerce sales growth in a range of 50-60%. Earnings per share are envisioned to grow in the high twenties percentage range.Robust Online and Omni-Channel GrowthUlta Beauty has garnered goodwill in a short span amid stiff competition because of its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. Also, the company has successfully managed to grow both e-commerce and in-store sales. Evidently, the company registered whopping 62.9% growth in e-commerce sales, which reflects about 370 bps of the total comps growth. The increase in e-commerce sales was driven by traffic growth of 57% and mobile traffic surge of 92%. The omni-channel customers now form nearly 9.1% of the company’s loyalty members compared with 7.5% in the year-ago period.Effective Merchandise InitiativesUlta Beauty’s effective merchandising offerings largely contribute to growth of in-store sales. Notably, the company’s stores are a one stop shop for beauty enthusiasts, featuring prestige and discount beauty brands as well as offering salon products and services all under one roof. Also, the company remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings and improving store traffic with superior services. In fiscal 2016, the company had added 69 new brands and executed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores.Adding to its portfolio of prestige brands, the beauty retailer also rolled out Estee lauder’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand this year. Ulta plans to expand this to about 120 stores by the end of fiscal 2017.Sturdy Loyalty ProgramUlta Beauty’s loyalty program was one of the major sales drivers in third-quarter fiscal 2017. Buoyed by its excellent marketing and merchandising endeavors and in-store conversions, Ulta Beauty saw 21% growth in Ultamate Rewards members to $26.4 million by the end of October. Moreover, sales per member, average member ticket, retention rates and frequency of shopping remained sturdy in the quarter.Final ThoughtsWhile all seems well, Ulta Beauty witnessed a decline in both gross and operating margins in the fiscal third quarter. Also, the company is exposed to risk in the customer-driven industry as cheaper alternatives may hinder customers’ loyalty for the brand and thus impacting the sale of products under Ulta banner. Nevertheless, we believe the solid initiatives taken by the company will help it to overcome these hindrances.Do Retail-Miscellaneous Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2099,EL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report), once an investors’ favorite, has lost its shine following dismal third-quarter 2017 results and lowered its outlook for the year. Also, it has been witnessing strained margins for a while now. In fact, the Zacks Consensus Estimate moved south as the analysts were disappointed on the stock.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 27.3% following its third-quarter results on Nov 2. In the past three months, the stock has plunged 37.4%, significantly wider than the industry’s decline of 10.5%. The downturn was due to the after-effects of Hurricane Harvey that resulted in increased inflationary pressure owing to low resins’ supply. Further, a Growth Score of F confirms the weakness in the stock.Deeper AnalysisQ3 & Negative Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and 2017 has declined to 75 cents and $2.81, respectively, over the past 30 days. This follows Newell Brands’ dismal performance in the third quarter, which marked its first earnings miss in more than three years. Also, sales lagged estimates after two straight beats.Results were below the company’s expectations and were hurt by soft late-quarter sales with respect to retailer inventory rebalancing, mainly related to the decelerated market growth, in the United States through the Back-to-School period. As a result, markets were weak across various categories. Though its bottom line improved 10.3% year over year, management slashed its outlook for 2017, marking the second guidance cut in three months. (Read: Newell Misses Q3 Earnings & Sales, Lowers '17 Outlook)Newell Brands now expects normalized earnings per share in the range of $2.80-$2.85, down from $2.95-$3.05, projected earlier. Also, in September, the company had trimmed its earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressure due to low resins’ supply owing to impacts from the Harvey.Other ConcernsNewell Brands has been witnessing weak margins for the last few quarters now. Despite gains from cost synergies and Project Renewal savings, the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment weighed on margins in the third quarter.Apparently, the company’s gross margin contracted 100 basis points (bps) in the third quarter, while operating margin declined 40 bps. In the first and second quarters of 2017, Newell’s gross margin had declined 410 bps and 20 bps, respectively. While operating margin soared in the preceding quarter, it recorded a 250 bps decline in the first quarter.Additionally, Newell Brands faces intense competition from numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer and commercial products. This might dent the company’s operating performance and overall profitability.Newell Brands Vs IndustryBottom LineThough Newell Brands is on track to attain its transformation goals through market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement and Project Renewal Program, the turnaround might take some time.Meanwhile, you can count upon some better-ranked stocks in the broader Consumer Staples space that also witnessed positive estimate revisions recently.The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) consensus mark for 2017 and 2018 has moved up by 29 cents per share and 15 cents to $6.08 and $6.15, respectively, in the last 30 days.

(VGR  -  Free Report) earnings estimates for the fourth quarter and 2017 have increased by a penny to 12 cents and 2 cents to 66 cents, respectively, in the past 30 days.

2100,EL,"In an effort to enhance makeup standards and give a unique touch to beauty, Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) recently decided to reinvent its iconic makeup brand — COVERGIRL. The reinvention of this brand satisfies the vision of “I Am What I Make Up”, with an opportunity of expressing oneself and personal transformation.The COVERGIRL multifaceted redefinition covers all areas of the brand, with packaging, designing, in-store look, tagline and logo. Also, this focuses on the outer appearance of the products, including tone and feel, across all communications, that begins with a long-form film — Made in the Mirror — and continues its roll-out for the balance of 2017 and into 2018.On the part of its customers, this redesigning of the brand will help them reveal their unique personalities with a new makeup version. In fact, with this latest invention, COVERGIRL brand rejoices its diversity and genuineness, simultaneously avoiding impractical and idealized standards.In fact, the film, Made in the Mirror, featuring six known personalities as COVERGIRLs, is likely to inspire women and help understand the new parameters of beauty. Going forward, Coty will provide a new definition to beauty with its redesigned products, and, in turn, better serve consumers.Being one of the leading beauty companies in the world, we believe this action is much required by Coty for the moment. The company has been witnessing persistent weakness in its Consumer Beauty division for quite some time, unlike the Luxury and Professional Beauty segments. Evidently, Consumer Beauty declined 10% organically, reflecting continued pressure on COVERGIRL, Clairol, and Sally Hansen, during fourth-quarter fiscal 2017.In fact, the company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 27.7%. In the reported quarter, operating income declined due to higher marketing spending and interest expense. The quarter also witnessed higher investments to support acquisitions. Furthermore, mounting competitive pressure and changing consumer preferences have been hurting Coty’s growth. Unfavorable currency impacts also remain major deterrent for the company.Consequently, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company’s shares have declined 8.2% year to date, as against the industry’s gain of 6.8%.Though Coty has been making strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio and improve performance, this will take time. Further, we expect COVERGIRL’s transformation to boost Coty’s top line and overall profitability.Looking for Promising Stocks?

2101,EL,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been depicting strong growth momentum backed by a diverse portfolio, well-planned acquisitions and notable progress in e-commerce. Evidently, shares of the company have surged 27.4% in the past six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.1%.The company reached a 52-week high of $109.83 during the trading session on Sep 11, eventually closing at $108.74. In fact, shares of the company have gone up almost 11.1% since it posted upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results.Let’s delve into the aspects that have been aiding the company’s impressive performance.Acquisitions Boost Performance Acquisitions have been one of the primary growth drivers for this leading beauty company. The buyouts of BECCA and Too Faced (during first-quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened Estée Lauder’s fastest growing prestige beauty brands portfolio. The acquisitions have contributed about 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fourth quarter and approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. During June, the company invested in DECIEM, a fast-growing multi-brand company, which is expected to benefit the company’s top line in the upcoming periods. Few other notable acquisitions of the company include By Kilian, GLAMGLOW, RODIN olio lusso and Le Labo. These acquisitions have significantly enhanced the company’s portfolio and widened customer base.Online Business SurgeA large number of consumers now prefer to shop online. This trend is well reflected in Estée Lauder’s e-commerce platform that witnessed an astounding 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion during fiscal 2017. In order to maintain this growth, the company plans to implement new technology and digital experiences to better serve consumers.Presence in Emerging MarketsEstée Lauder also has a strong presence in emerging markets which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in matured markets. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Estée Lauder has bright prospects in China, as management believes that the region is under penetrated. The company is expanding footprint in smaller cities in China where skin care category has bright growth prospects. Leading Beauty Forward InitiativeUnder the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, the company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs in order to drive beauty business. The company plans to optimize some of its corporate functions including supply chain and regional marketing structures and exit underperforming businesses. The company expects to complete these initiatives through fiscal 2021. After its full implementation, the company expects Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.Bottom Line Estée Lauder’s dismal business trend in Hong Kong owing to political issues has also been posing concerns for the company for a while now. Decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores have also posed challenges in generating revenue for some of its leading beauty brands such as MAC.Nevertheless, Estée Lauder is strongly positioned in the beauty arena given its robust brand portfolio and productive growth strategies. Such dedicated efforts have aided this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 12 straight quarters. The stock currently has a long term growth rate of 12.2% and carries a VGM Score of B, both indicating its underlying strength.Looking for More?

2102,EL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) has agreed to acquire Chesapeake Bay Candle in a $75-million deal. Subject to working capital adjustments and certain closing conditions, the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017. The company plans to fund the acquisition mainly using its cash in hand.Chesapeake Bay Candle, being one of the market leaders in manufacturing and marketing of premium candles, will be a valuable addition to Newell’s portfolio. In order to strengthen candle business, Newell had also acquired WoodWick fragranced candles business during the first quarter of 2017. Contributions from the WoodWick acquisition had favorably impacted sales during the second quarter.These acquisitions are in line with the company’s Growth Game Plan, whereby it makes prudent investments in areas with high growth potential. On similar grounds, the company also acquired the Sistema food storage business during the first quarter, which resulted in top-line expansion.On Track with Growth Efforts In addition to strategic acquisitions, Newell is also devoted toward simplifying its operating structure. Accordingly, during the first quarter it undertook the divestiture of four of its businesses namely — tools, consumer storage totes, fire building and fire starting, and the rope and chain business.Further, the company has an agreement in place to divest Teutonia, its central European baby gear business. It is on track with its plan of exiting product lines with annual sales of $200-$300 million across its combined business with Jarden, over the next two to three years. Newell’s Project Renewal Program is also on schedule, and the company expects annual cost savings from this program to approach $700 million by 2017 end or 2018 beginning.Guidance Tweaked on Impacts of Hurricane Harvey Newell recently trimmed earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressures due to lower resins supply. The decline in supply was caused by the impact of Hurricane Harvey. Normalized earnings are now envisioned in the band of $2.95 to $3.05 per share versus the previous expectation of $3.00 to $3.20. However, net sales and core sales guidance remain intact.The effects of Harvey have significantly disrupted huge parts of the United States’ resin manufacturing supply chain, significantly raising operating costs. Further, these resin supply issues and increased inflation is likely to persist through the rest of 2017 and in 2018. The impact of such challenges is visible on the company’s share price performance. Newell’s shares have gone down 11.8% in the past one month, wider than the industry’s decline of 2.1%Despite the headwinds concerning resin supply, Newell is expected to continue delivering growth on the back of savings and acquisition related initiatives. Management also expects to boost performance in the second half backed by new distribution gains, a strong pipeline of innovations and e-Commerce strength.Currently, Newell carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).                               Looking for More?

2103,EL,"The Consumer Staples sector has been reaping benefits from an improving economy and rising consumer confidence, lately. Further, labor market optimism and gradual wage acceleration has been positively impacting consumer’s spending nature.However, investors are skeptical regarding headwinds plaguing the sector such as unfavorable currency, declining volumes, price wars, an aggressive promotional environment and rising competition. One such stock affected by the ongoing challenges is Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report).Kimberly-Clark, engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world, has been disappointing investors for a while now with dismal organic sales trend. As a result, the company’s top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last seven quarters in a row, including the recently concluded second-quarter 2017.Headwinds Derailing the Stock                  The company has been witnessing weakness in organic sales particularly due to a tough industry environment in North America. During the first and second quarters of 2017, the region’s organic sales declined due to high competition, reduced promotional shipments and lower net pricing. Although organic sales have been positive in the developing and emerging markets, its growth rate has decelerated in the past few quarters.  Though the company expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017, the current promotional environment is weakening current market dynamics.Kimberly-Clark has incurred lower input cost in 2016, but the trend has changed since the first quarter of 2017. Rising input costs are now hurting the company’s margins. Moreover, it expects the inflationary trend to persist in the periods ahead and anticipates increased prices for several raw materials, including pulp, in 2017. Of late, the company has also experienced a negative shift in consumer behavior in its diaper segment.Dull Outlook, Estimates Showing DowntrendThis Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company continues to expect industry headwinds to linger and has therefore issued soft earnings guidance for the full year. It now expects earnings per share at the low end of its previous targeted range of $6.20-$6.35. Following the company’s discouraging performance and dull outlook, the Zacks Consensus Estimate also witnessed a downtrend in the past 60 days. In the said period, estimates for 2017 have gone down nine cents to reach $6.22. Also estimated earnings of $1.55 for the third quarter depict a decline of five cents. Shares Underperforming the IndustryKimberly-Clark has been trying to spark a turnaround through initiatives such as aggressive cost cutting, planned innovation and marketing campaigns. However, these initiatives have failed to attract investor’s confidence. Shares of the company haven’t reflected any signs of recovery and have declined more than 2% since its dismal second-quarter results. In the past six months, the company’s shares have lost 9.1%, underperforming the industry’s decline of 7.6%. Meanwhile, the Consumer Staples sector, which includes the company, has depicted growth of 4.3% in the same time frame.The ongoing weakness in Kimberly-Clark’s results has made investors jittery, amid global tensions. We note that investors are skeptical about President Trump’s policies. North Korea’s latest nuclear test has further raised geopolitical tensions and increased pressure on the Trump administration.Despite these worries, it may be a good idea to look at some other consumer staples stocks that have the potential to outperform the industry.

2104,EL,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Oct 26. In the trailing four quarters, this producer and seller of alcohol beverages has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by an average of 50%. In the preceding quarter, the company witnessed a positive earnings surprise of 82.2%. Unsurprisingly, investors are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that Boston Beer surpasses earnings estimate even this time. Let’s delve deep and find out the factors impacting the results.How are Estimates Shaping Up?Analysts polled by Zacks expect third quarter revenues to be $259.1 million, down 4.5% year over year. This is in sharp contrast with the company’s performance in the second quarter, when the top line improved 1.3% from the year-ago period. The scenario is similar for the bottom line too, which is also likely to decrease from the year-ago quarter. The consensus estimate for the quarter under review is currently pegged at $1.84, portraying a significant decline of roughly 26% from the year-ago period. We note that earnings per share have surged 14.1% in the preceding quarter.Factors Influencing This QuarterDepletion trends have been a cause of worry for Boston Beer for quite some time now. However, depletion trends have shown a considerable improvement from earlier in the year. Depletions decreased 3% in the second quarter following a 14% decline in the preceding quarter. Well this kindles hope at one end, soft trends in the craft beer and cider categories raises concern on the other. Further, challenges related to a competitive retail backdrop, can’t be ignored.Depletion volumes in the second quarter were primarily impacted by persistent decline in the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, as well as fall in Coney Island. This was partly mitigated by growth in Twisted Tea and Truly Spiked & Sparkling brands. The company continues to project soft depletion trends for 2017. Evidently, depletions for the year-to-date period through the 29 weeks ended Jul 22, 2017 are estimated to have declined nearly 7% from the comparable year-ago period in 2016.Nevertheless, Boston Beer is banking on its three-point growth plan focused on revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation to lift performance. The company's focus on pricing, packaging and product innovation along with brand development are also likely to boost its operational performance and market position.Boston Beer Company, Inc.

2105,EL,"SUPERVALU INC. (SVU  -  Free Report) has been struggling against declining sales in its retail segment owing to rising competition in the grocery industry. Nevertheless, the company’s focus on accelerating business by focusing on acquisitions and supply agreements in the wholesale segment has proved to be quite yielding.With these aspects in mind, let’s delve into the factors that have been impacting SUPERVALU’s performance.Sluggish Retail Segment & Other HeadwindsSUPERVALU is facing price competition, competitive store openings and challenging retail environment, particularly in the retail segment. Such factors have been denting the company’s retail sales for a while now and the trend is likely to continue in fiscal 2018. This has further weakened the segment.SUPERVALU’s future sales growth prospects have also been shadowed by the wind-down of existing transition services agreements with Albertson’s LLC. The company expects a revenue decline of approximately $40 million from the Albertson’s TSA in fiscal 2018.Also, the recent acquisition of Whole Foods Market by Amazon.com (AMZN  -  Free Report) has sent ripples across the grocery segment. Immediately after the acquisition became effective, Amazon slashed down the prices of a large number of Whole Foods products, thereby pressuring other companies in the same segment.The impact of ongoing headwinds is well reflected in the company’s share price performance. SUPERVALU’s shares declined 16.5% wider than the industry’s fall of 7.7%.Focus on Wholesale Business & other Growth Initiatives  SUPERVALU derives a major portion of its revenues from the wholesale business. Sales from this segment grew 12.4% year over year in the last reported first-quarter fiscal 2018, up from 3% growth in the preceding quarter. This shows that the segment offers great potential and will boost company’s sales. The company is trying to develop wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. The company’s recent acquisition (completed on Jun 23) of Unified Grocers, justifies such growth initiatives. Although the bankruptcy protection filing by Marsh Supermarkets in May 2017 has resulted in volume decline in the first quarter, the company expects to mitigate these with sales to new and existing customers.The company is also undertaking store sales and closures for underperforming locations, which will allow the company to focus its resources and investments on a smaller number of strong performing locations. Additionally, SUPERVALU has been striving to reduce cost and resorted to ‘single sourcing’ in its independent businesses, in order to induce greater operating efficiency.Bottom LineWhile we applaud SUPERVALU’s growth initiatives, its retail segment is yet to revive itself from the industry-wide headwinds. Given the mixed pros and cons, SUPERVALU currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More?

2106,EL,"Pinnacle Foods, Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its acquisitions and productivity enhancing initiatives to drive margins. However, the company’s growth remains challenged due to sluggish Specialty Segment and Pickle business.Let’s now delve deeper into some of the factors that have been impacting the company’s performance.Acquisitions & Innovation Aiding PerformanceAcquisitions have been a prime growth driver for Pinnacle Foods in the past few years. Through the acquisition of Boulder Brand (completed in 2016), the company achieved synergies of $15 million in 2016 and is expected to achieve synergies of $15 million in 2017. This will benefit both gross margin and SG&A overhead. Also, some of the earlier notable acquisitions of Pinnacle Foods include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone salad dressings business.Pinnacle Foods has also been innovating products to offer variety and maintain market share. Some popular innovations in the past include new varieties of the Duncan Hines Decadent, Duncan Hines Perfect Size baking kits and Birds Eye product lines. In fact, during the second quarter, the company launched Perfect Size for One, a unique baking solution kit and Vlasic purely pickles. It also launched five new platforms in the second quarter of 2017 to ensure continued momentum of the Birds Eye franchise.Initiatives Inducing Productivity & Savings The company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fiscal 2016, the company’s operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4.0%, as compared with 4.4% in fiscal 2015. Such savings related initiatives have also been aiding the company to offset input cost inflation, thereby improving gross margin. Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives such as expanding its product mix through innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization.The company’s growth initiatives have positively impacted its share price performance. Shares of Pinnacle Foods have increased 16.1% in the last 12 months against the industry’s decline of 13.8%.Sluggish Segment & Other Headwinds Impacting Performance Pinnacle Foods’ Specialty segment has been witnessing weakness since four consecutive quarters now. In the second quarter of 2017, sales in the segment declined 15.1% due to reduced volume/mix and the exit of low-margin businesses such as Aunt Jemima. Further, management expects the Specialty segment to remain challenged in the upcoming quarters due to sales loss from divestitures. The company has witnessed sluggishness in Pickle business due to continued competitive environment in the form of pricing and innovation. Although the company has been undertaking innovations to improve the performance of the Pickles business, the turnaround is expected to take some time.Additionally, regular innovations have led to increased product introductory costs. Enhanced investment in consumer marketing and input cost inflation also adds to expenses. Moreover, Pinnacle Foods has been dealing with macroeconomic headwinds including stiff competition and a general shift in consumer preferences toward healthier food items.Bottom LineDespite such headwinds impacting the company’s performance, we remain hopeful that its consistent productivity initiatives and business expansion strategies through innovation and acquisitions will yield significant results and continue aiding growth.Pinnacle Foods currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More?

2107,EL,"Beauty products retailer, Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), seems to going through a rough phase for quite some time now.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company touched a 52-week low of $2.50 yesterday, though it recovered slightly to close the day at $2.55. Further, the stock has plunged over 49% year to date, as against the Zacks Cosmetics industry’s gain of 3.2%. In fact, its shares have declined nearly 30% in a month due to dismal second-quarter 2017 results. Currently, the industry ranks in the top 35% of the Zacks classified industries (90 out of 256).Dismal Performance & Soft GuidanceWe note that Avon has long been struggling owing to weak Active Representatives growth and adverse currency translations. In fact, both its top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth straight quarter, when the company reported second-quarter results. Also, Avon has been incurring losses for the last two quarters.Results in the second quarter were mainly impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter. Additionally, it was hurt by decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across all the segments, barring Ending Representatives growth in North Latin America.Consequently, management now expects revenue growth for 2017, on constant-dollar basis, to be at the low-end of its previous guidance range of low-single-digit growth. (Read: Avon Falls on Q2 Loss & Sales Lag, Cuts FY17 View) Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise   Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteDownward Spiral in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Avon declined sharply over the last 30 days, following the dismal quarter and bleak outlook. Over the said time frame, four earnings estimates have gone lower for both 2017 and 2018.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents for 2017 and 27 cents for 2018 moved down 11 cents and 9 cents, respectively.Other Headwinds/ConcernsAvon faces intense competition from cosmetics products retailer like Inter Parfums, Inc. (IPAR  -  Free Report), in domestic and international markets. Globally, the company competes with products sold to consumers by other direct-selling and direct-sales companies and through the Internet, and against products sold through the mass market and prestige retail channels.In fact, as Avon operates in a consumer centric market, its ability to garner profits depends largely on how well it can predict changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns for beauty products, and respond in a timely manner to fulfill the same. Additionally, material shifts in market demand for a product and other macroeconomic headwinds may ultimately hurt the company’s results.Transformation Plan - A Revival Strategy?The stringent focus and swift progress on the Transformation Plan could be rewarding for the company.Interestingly, Avon is in the second year of its three-year Transformation Plan that was announced in January 2016.  This plan mainly focuses on investing in growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility.Crossing the half-way mark of the plan period, the company has witnessed significant progress compared to its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.In 2017, management targets cost savings of $230 million, including run-rate savings from 2016 along with in-year savings from current year initiatives. Meanwhile, the company stated that savings realized through first-half indicate that it is on track to achieve its goals for 2017.With regard to investing in growth, management plans to invest nearly $350 million over the three-year period, including $150 million toward media and social selling as well as $200 million for service model evolution and information technology. This expenditure is mainly aimed at bolstering the overall Representative experience.Bottom LineIn such times of struggle, Avon’s Transformation Plan seems to be a ray of hope for the company but it is also failing to spark a turnaround in its current performance now. Hence, it would be advisable to stay away from the stock unless the success of its Transformation Plan starts to reflect in the company’s performance.Want to Know About the Gems in the Same Industry?Better-ranked stocks in the same industry include The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report).Estee Lauder looks good with long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8% and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

2108,EL,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) posted fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein while earnings lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate, revenues beat the same.The company posted break-even adjusted earnings in the quarter, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents. Adjusted earnings also declined from the year-ago earnings of 13 cents due to a decline in adjusted operating income related to higher marketing spending and higher interest expense.Quarter in DetailThe company generated revenues of $2.24 billion in the fourth quarter beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.17 billion by 3.1%. Revenues surged 108.4% from the prior-year quarter, driven by the positive contribution from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5%.Excluding acquisition impact, net revenues of the combined company of Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business declined 3% on a constant currency basis. This reflects the benefit of approximately 1% from pre-shipments to customers prior to the termination of transition services for Europe under the Transition Services Agreement (TSA) signed on July 1.Adjusted gross margin expanded 420 basis points to 62.1% in the fourth quarter driven by the addition of the higher gross margin P&G Beauty and Younique businesses. However, adjusted operating margin contracted 480 basis points to 4.0% in the quarter due to higher marketing investment to support the momentum in the business as well as higher fixed costs.Notably, Coty’s shares have been underperforming for quite some time now. The stock has increased 3.9% in the last six months in comparison to the industry, which gained 13.5%. The industry is part of the top 26% of the Zacks Classified industries (70 out of the 265).Fiscal 2017 ResultsThe company posted adjusted earnings of 63 cents in fiscal 2017, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents by 16%. Adjusted earnings also declined 54% from the year-ago earnings.Revenues reported were $7.650 billion in fiscal 2017, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.58 billion by 0.9%. Revenues also surged 76% compared to Legacy-Coty net revenues in the prior year, driven by the positive contribution from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique. The acquisition of Brazilian product line Hypermarcas S.A. (February 2016) also provided an impetus to the growth. On a constant currency basis, revenues of the combines company grew 1%. Excluding the positive impact of acquisitions, the combined company organic net revenues declined 5% on a constant currency basis due to flat performance in Professional Beauty, a modest decline in Luxury, and continued underlying challenges in Consumer Beauty.Coty Inc. Price and Consensus Coty Inc. Price and Consensus | Coty Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues grew 61% to $648.0 million on a reported basis. Revenues grew 5% organically, supported by strong performance at Hugo Boss, Gucci, Chloe and philosophy brands. Adjusted operating income for Luxury declined 66% to $10.0 million in the quarter.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty increased 85% to $1.126 billion on a reported basis and declined 10% organically, reflecting continued pressure on COVERGIRL, Clairol, and Sally Hansen. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty increased 37% to $64.9 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $467.3 million increased from $63.6 million in the prior year and increased 3% organically, driven by growth in Wella and System Professional and moderating declines in OPI brand. Adjusted operating income for Professional declined 14% to $15.2 million compared with Legacy-Coty in the prior-year period.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended fiscal 2017 with cash and cash equivalents of $535.4 million, total debt of $7.2 billion, and total shareholders’ equity of $9.3 billion.Net cash provided by operating activities was $757.5 million compared to $501.4 million for Legacy-Coty in the prior year reflecting improved working capital for the combined company, partly offset by an increase in cash acquisition related and restructuring costs. Free cash flow in fiscal 2017 of $325.2 million decreased from $351.3 million in the prior year, reflecting a significant increase in capital expenditures associated with the P&G Beauty Business integration.The company also paid a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share for a total of $93.4 million in June.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCoty currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the same sector may consider some better-ranked stocks such as Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.

2109,EL,"Shares of Big Lots, Inc. (BIG  -  Free Report) hit a new 52-week high of $63.28 on Jan 26, though it closed a tad lower at $63.27. Notably, the company has been gaining from its strategic endeavors apparent from its eighth straight earnings beat in third-quarter fiscal 2017.Impressively, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has also surged 30.3% in a year, outperforming the Retail-Discount industry’s growth of 24.9%. The industry ranks amongst the top 21% (53 of 256) of all Zacks industries.What’s Pushing Big Lots’ Shares Higher?Big Lots’ furniture financing programs and soft home category have been consistently gaining traction. In fact, furniture has been the leading performer in the last few quarters and is likely to continue the trend in fiscal 2017 as well. Moreover, management has been expanding assortments in this category by including lawn and garden items such as patio furniture, gazebos and gas grills.Furthermore, to tap the opportunities in the furniture and soft home categories, management added more brands and revamped the food department by giving it a fresh look for the convenience of customers. Also, the company rolled out its cooler/freezer facility in stores in an attempt to expand its merchandise of food-related items to target food stamp recipients. Meanwhile, its merchandising strategies and effective marketing seem to be paying off quite well.Driven by these robust initiatives, Big Lots has shown impressive comparable-store sales (comps) growth. Evidently, comps have increased in 13 of the trailing 15 quarters. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, comps are expected to be up in the range of flat to up 2%. Additionally, management projects fiscal 2017 adjusted earnings in the band of $4.23-$4.28 per share, representing growth of 16-18% from $3.64 recorded in fiscal 2016. It envisions fourth-quarter earnings in the range of $2.35-$2.40 per share.Encouragingly, analysts are steadily growing bullish on the stock that is evident from the rise in earnings estimates. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.29 for fiscal 2017 and $4.94 for fiscal 2018 have moved north 2 cents and 8 cents, respectively, in the last seven days. Also, the estimate of $2.41 for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 inched up by a penny in the said time period.Valuation PerspectiveBig Lots looks appeasing from valuation metrics as well evident from its Value Score of B. The company with a price-to-sales ratio of 0.5 versus the industry’s 0.9 indicates that the stock has enough upside potential. Also, it looks attractive with respect to a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.3 versus industry’s 26.5. Further, its EV/EBITDA ratio of 7.6 is lower than 11 for the industry.Bottom LineThough these attributes raise optimism in the stock, the company’s gross margin looks somewhat pressurized and is likely to decline year over year in the fiscal fourth quarter. Moreover, sluggishness in electronics, toys and accessories remains a headwind.However, we expect the company’s robust strategies to offset these hurdles, and help it continue with its growth story.Apart from Big Lots, companies like Burlington Stores, Inc. (BURL  -  Free Report), The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) and Nu Skin Enterprises, Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report) scaled 52-week highs on Jan 26.

Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,010 million, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayLeggett remains exposed to major volatility in raw material prices, with steel being one of the company’s key raw materials and the market for the same being cyclical in nature. Incidentally, the company’s bottom line has declined year over year for three straight quarters now, owing to raw material price inflation. In the last quarter, earnings and EBIT fell 3% and 7.4% year over year, respectively due to steel price inflation. Moreover, management recently announced a second guidance cut for 2017 in less than two months. This was mainly accountable to increased steel price inflation, alongside a rise in LIFO costs and soft demand in the furniture and bedding space.Battered by these factors, Leggett’s shares have tumbled 8% in the last three months, worse than the industry’s 6.3% drop.On the brighter side, Leggett remains on track with its 2019 goals — aimed at achieving top-third TSR target in next three years. This will be aided by revenue growth, margin enhancement and shareholder-friendly moves. Though these initiatives bode well for the long run, we believe that Leggett’s bottom line is likely to be hurt by steel price inflation in the third quarter.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Leggett is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Leggett has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 61 cents. Moreover, the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2112,EL,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this consumer goods behemoth will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has posted in-line earnings in three out of the past four quarters, though its top line has missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for nearly four years now. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise  Colgate-Palmolive Company Price and EPS Surprise | Colgate-Palmolive Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 73 cents, which is in line with the year-ago period figure. Also, the earnings estimate has been stable over the last 30 days. Notably, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,928 million, up 1.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors Driving this QuarterColgate has been witnessing soft sales for quite some time now. While its dismal sales surprise history has already been highlighted above, we note that this global consumer goods big-wig hasn’t witnessed year-over-year sales growth for quite some time. On the contrary, the company’s bottom line has risen year over year for four straight quarters now, thanks to its robust cost-saving initiatives. Thus, the company’s shares have gained 13% so far this year, though it lagged the industry’s rally of 17%.Glimpse of Q2 & Estimates for Q3In the last quarter, Colgate’s sales dipped 0.5% as benefits of 1% increase in prices were offset by a 1% drop in global unit volumes and a negative impact of 0.5% from currency fluctuations. Further, sales were hurt by the persistent softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. However, this was somewhat offset by strong organic sales growth in Latin America and the return to positive organic sales growth in Hill’s Pet Nutrition. Also, better pricing and gains from the company’s funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program boosted the gross margin, alongside helping earnings jump 3% year over year.Notably, sales from Latin America constituted about 26% of Colgate’s total revenues, which is the highest among all regions. For the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales growth in this region is a marginal 0.1%, backed by a slight rise in organic sales and volumes. On the other hand, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for North American sales growth is pegged at a dip of 0.01%. This fares better than a 3.5% decline in the previous quarter. For the company as a whole, the consensus estimate for sales growth is currently pegged at 0.02%, on organic sales increase of 0.02%. While the consensus estimate for volume growth is flat for the quarter to be reported, pricing is anticipated to have a positive impact of 0.01% on the top line — which in turn should fuel the bottom line growth.Robust Strategies to Drive the Bottom LineDuring the second-quarter conference call, management projected the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. Nevertheless, the company remains encouraged by the progress of its 2012 Restructuring Program and continues to pursue additional savings opportunities under the program. In this regard, the company stated that the additional opportunities identified in the second quarter provide visibility for reaching the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range. We believe that benefits from these initiatives and revenue contributions from Latin America should help drive Colgate’s bottom line in this quarter as well.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Colgate may beat earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components.Zacks Rank & ESP: Colgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings.Further, the company currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.50%. A favorable Zacks ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter. The combination of Colgate’s Zacks Rank #2 and a positive ESP make us reasonably confident of a positive earnings beat.Other Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +2.03% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Carter's, Inc.

2113,EL,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) further confirms weakness in AVP.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen five estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with just no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 9 cents a share a month ago to its current level of a loss of 2 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Avon Products has seen four downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 6 cents a share from 13 cents over the past 30 days. The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 19.7% in the past month.Avon Products, Inc. Price and Consensus Avon Products, Inc. Price and Consensus | Avon Products, Inc.

2114,EL,"Shares of Pinnacle Foods, Inc (PF  -  Free Report) have been underperforming of late, owing to underlying weaknesses in its Specialty segment and pickle business. The company’s share performance has remained dismal since it released second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, wherein sales were negatively impacted by the divestitures of its low-margin businesses.Further, shares of the company have also declined 3.5% in the past three months, compared with the industry’s fall of 1.5%.Investors seem to be disappointed with the company’s murky sales surprise history, whereby it missed estimates in 10 out of the past 14 quarters. Being a leading marketer and distributor of canned meat, shelf-stable pickles and frozen seafood, Pinnacle Foods has been struggling with consumers shift toward healthy and natural food products. Stiff competition, aggressive promotional spending and tight margins have also been bothering firms in the food industry.Considering its ongoing challenges, Pinnacle Foods now expects earnings for 2017 to be at the lower end of its expected range of $2.55-$2.60 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the forthcoming third-quarter 2017 results as well as for 2017 has also declined by a penny to reach 58 cents and $2.55 respectively, in the past 60 days. Nevertheless, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company remains hopeful on improving its performance backed by dedicated expansion initiatives. Let’s now delve into some of the efforts undertaken by the company to improve performance and the factors from which it has been gaining.Acquisitions Aiding Portfolio Expansion The acquisition of Boulder Brands, completed in January 2016, gave Pinnacle Foods a new growth platform for refrigerated foods and also added brands such as Udi's, Glutino, Smart Balance, Earth Balance and EVOL to the company’s portfolio. The benefits from the acquisition are expected to be spread over 2017, in areas such as procurement, manufacturing and logistics. The company received synergies of $15 million from the acquisition of Boulder Brand in 2016. It expects to achieve the same worth $15 million in 2017.The company has been carrying out various acquisitions over the years to expand its distribution network and customer base and boost long-term growth. Few noteworthy acquisitions of the company in the past include Duncan Hines, Garden Protein and Wish-Bone salad dressings.Initiatives to Enhance Savings & Margins The company has an operational excellence program in place designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain. In fiscal 2016, the company’s operational excellence initiative drove productivity savings of 4%, as compared with 4.4% in fiscal 2015 and 3.7% in fiscal 2014.These productivity savings, along with higher pricing, have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins. The company continues to expect gross margin to improve 300 to 400 basis points by 2019.In order to enhance gross margin, Pinnacle Foods is also pursuing other initiatives, including the improvement of its product mix through innovation. The company has also been exiting from low-margin businesses in order to utilize resources more efficiently.In this respect, the company had undertaken divestiture of Aunt Jemima frozen breakfast products in May 2017, and also closed down its Boulder UK operations in November 2016. Such rationalizing efforts have negatively impacted the company’s top line of late, in the long run. These initiatives are expected to aid Pinnacle Foods to focus specifically on growth oriented businesses.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

2115,EL,"United Natural Foods, Inc’s (UNFI  -  Free Report) shares have returned 8.8% since the company reported upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Sep 13. United Natural has been benefiting from increased consumer preference for natural and organic brands, despite industry concerns such as stiff competition, aggressive promotional spending and tight margins that are bothering most of the grocery firms. The company’s top line has also been gaining from strategic acquisitions.Altogether, such factors have also been aiding the company’s price performance over the past three months. United Natural’s shares have surged 14.1% in the said time frame, compared with the industry’s decline of 1.9%.Let’s now delve into some of the factors that have been impacting United Natural’s performance of late.Acquisitions - A Major Growth DriverAcquisitions have been one of the primary growth drivers for United Natural over the past few years. The acquisition of Haddon House (May 2016) and Gourmet Guru (August 2016) have helped the company boost sales by 5.7% during the fourth quarter of 2017. Such acquisitions have aided United Natural to expand distribution network, customer base, launch new brands as well as expand its footprint in key markets.Few other major acquisitions of the company in the past include Nor-Cal Produce, Inc, Tony’s Fine Foods (in July 2014), Trudeau Foods (in September 2013) and SunOpta Inc (in June 2010).Consumer Shift Toward Organic & Natural FoodThe growth rate of the natural products industry has outpaced the same for the overall food-at-home industry in recent times, as a result of increasing demand for healthy lifestyle, food safety and environmental sustainability. The company’s e-commerce channel is also witnessing growth in natural and organic food products. This rapid adoption rate of organic products has led to new opportunities for United Natural and has resulted in increased shelf space across a growing number of retailers.Efficiency Enhancing Efforts The company has also been on track with reducing its operating expenses and enhancing operating efficiency including initiatives to exit from less-profitable businesses. During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, United Natural sold off its stake in Kicking Horse Coffee business. The sale generated profits of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, and contributed toward improving the company’s bottom line. Bottom LineNotably, the food industry is undergoing dramatic changes after the acquisition of Whole Foods Market by online biggie Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report). It has also resulted in uncertainty over United Natural’s partnership agreement with Whole Foods for the distribution of the latter’s products.Nevertheless, we expect that United Natural’s consistent efforts to drive its organic and natural food products sales through acquisitions and restructuring will aid the company toward overcoming such challenges and thereby sustain growth momentum.Considering the pros and cons, United Natural currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

2116,EL,"The Q4 earnings season is in full swing, with more than 250 companies, including 81 S&P 500 members, releasing quarterly results this week. Moreover, the earnings picture so far has been encouraging. Per the latest Earnings Outlook released on Jan 19, 53 S&P 500 members have already released quarterly results. Earnings of these companies increased 11.7% and revenues rose 7.5%.The Zacks Consumer Staples sector is yet to witness major releases. Of the 16 Zacks sectors, Consumer Staples is among the top 44%. Per the Earnings Outlook, the sector is likely to witness earnings growth of 4.6% and revenue increase of 2.6% this earnings season.The sector seems to be faring well, courtesy of rising consumer optimism, which received boost from an improving economy. Also, efforts such as focus on innovations, strategic buyouts and product launches are likely to drive players in this space. Additionally, aggressive cost-saving initiatives and attempts to keep pace with changing consumer patterns bode well for the stocks in the space.Such endeavors seem appropriate considering the heightened competition, price wars, input cost inflation and promotional environment. Notably, the Consumer Staples sector has gained 11.8% in a year, whereas the S&P 500 market rallied 23.7%.Let’s see what awaits McCormick & Company Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report), which is set for earnings release on Jan 25.Per our research, stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP are likely to post a positive earnings surprise.

The company is poised to beat earnings this season, as it now has an Earnings ESP of +0.49% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s look into some of the factors which are likely to impact McCormick’s performance this season.Acquisitions & Costs Saving Efforts Bode Well For McCormickMcCormick’s performance is expected to gain from positive acquisition synergies, particularly from the buyout of Reckitt Benckiser Group. Consequently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for year-on-year sales growth for the fourth quarter related to consumer and industrial business segments are currently pegged at 0.18% and 0.25%, respectively. Further, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2017, which indicates the positive impacts from the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser Group and lower currency.Additionally, McCormick’s cost-saving and productivity-enhancing initiatives through the Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program are expected to boost profits. The company expects to deliver cost savings of at least $105 million in fiscal 2017, up from the previous expectation of at least $100 million.Increasing Costs: A WorryAlthough the company has been progressing well with savings and business expansion plans, higher input costs have been hurting McCormick’s margins. Prices of raw materials like cinnamon, oregano and rice along with packaging costs have been rising for a while. In fiscal 2017, the company expects material cost inflation in mid-single digits. The company’s increased spending on brand marketing also poses adequate threats to profits. (Read More: Will McCormick's (MKC  -  Free Report) Q4 Earnings Gain From Acquisitions?)Wrapping UpMcCormick’s performance in the fourth quarter is likely to benefit from business expansion and cost-saving efforts. We also expect that the company’s efficient pricing strategies will help it tide over cost-related hurdles.Notably, expected earnings for the quarter under review and the fiscal 2017 grew 19.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from the year-ago figure. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $1,475 million for the fourth quarter, up 20.2% from the year-ago quarter. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2017 sales is pegged at $4.82 billion, up 9.3% from fiscal 2016 sales.All said, we expect McCormick to deliver impressive results in the upcoming release.    Other Stocks With Favorable CombinationsHere are some more companies which, per our model, have the right combination of elements to deliver earnings beat.The Estee Lauder Companies, Inc.

2117,EL,"Avon Products, Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) has underperformed the industry in the past year owing to its dismal earnings surprise history. In fact, third-quarter 2017 also marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of earnings miss. The company has been witnessing declining Representatives for the past few quarters as well.Shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have plunged nearly 66.4% in a year, as against the industry’s growth of 14.2%.  Why the Downside?Avon has delivered an average negative earnings surprise of 98.7% in the trailing four quarters. In the third quarter, the company posted adjusted earnings of 3 cents per share that lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents.Meanwhile, the comapny has been struggling with waning Active Representatives and Ending Representatives. Evidently, Active Representatives declined 3% year over year and Ending Representatives dipped 2% in the quarter.Furthermore, operating margin has been under pressure for quite some time. Operating margin contracted 70 bps to 6.3% in the third quarter owing to higher bad debt expenses along with increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses, all mainly in Brazil.Though Avon expects modest growth in fourth quarter due to improving trends witnessed in various markets, results are likely to lag expectations in 2017.Additionally, Avon faces intense competition from cosmetics products retailer like Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) in domestic and international markets. Changing market trends and evolving consumer preferences might also weigh upon the company’s performance and hurt its overall profitability.Estimates Trending DownwardsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has moved down from 9 cents to a loss of 2 cents in the last 30 days. Also, the estimate for 2018 has declined by 9 cents to 18 cents. Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc.

2118,EL,"After reporting weaker-than-expected results in the first half of 2017, Philip Morris International Inc (PM  -  Free Report) continued with its dismal performance in the third quarter. Both earnings and revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter 2017 results. Moreover, the company lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 due to higher impact of unfavorable currency.Quarter in Detail Adjusted earnings of $1.27 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.39. While the company benefited from strong pricing and growth in Reduced Risk Products, lower cigarette volumes hurt its performance. Nevertheless, adjusted earnings in the reported quarter inched up 1.6% from the year-ago periodNet revenue, excluding excise taxes, was $7,473 million, which increased 7% (up 9% excluding unfavorable currency of $136 million) in the third quarter. Favorable pricing and volume/mix in the quarter drove revenues. While, revenue increased across Asia, Latin America & Canada and the European Union (EU), the same had declined in Eastern Europe, the Middle East & Africa (EEMA).During the quarter, revenues from combustible products declined 3.6% (down 4.6% excluding negative currency) to $6.5 billion. On the contrary, Reduced Risk Products (RRPs) reported a whopping increase from last-year quarter, stemming from the shift of customer preference away from tobacco products. The company generated revenues of $947 million from RRPs, significantly higher than $212 million reported last year.However, net revenues lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,616 million.Total cigarette and heated tobacco unit shipment volume fell 0.5% to 208.2 billion units. The figures were unfavorable in the EU, EEMA region and in Latin America & Canada mainly owing to low cigarette shipment volumes. These were offset by increased volumes in Asia, as well as higher heated tobacco unit shipment volume across all regions. While cigarette shipment volume declined 4.1% in the quarter, heated tobacco unit shipment volume of 9.7 billion units, increased significantly from 2.1 billion units recorded in third-quarter 2016.Adjusted operating companies income was up 2.2% year over year to $3.1 billion due to favorable pricing and growth witnessed in Asia. Excluding currency impact of $140 million, adjusted operating income increased 6.8%. However adjusted operating margin was down 190 basis points to 42%.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuoteFinancial UpdateDuring the quarter, Philip Morris increased the regular quarterly dividend by approximately 2.9% to reach an annualized rate of $4.28 per share.GuidancePhilip Morris lowered its earnings guidance for 2017 and now expects the same in range of $4.75 to $4.80, lower than the previous range of $4.78 to $4.93.

2119,EL,"SUPERVALU INC (SVU  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected sales and earnings in second-quarter fiscal 2018.The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 46 cents that surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents and the year-ago earnings of 21 cents. Robust earnings were driven by higher sales in the Wholesale business and the benefits from the completed acquisition of Unified Grocers in June.Though the company reported a strong second quarter, its share performance has been unimpressive due to negative surprises reported in two of the past four quarters. In fact, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have underperformed the industry over the last three months. The stock has lost 27.7% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 3.8%.Quarter in Detail SUPERVALU’s net sales rose 35% year over year to $3,800 million. Also, the top line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 3,758 million. This upside was backed by increased sales witnessed at the Wholesale segment, but were hurt by decline in Retail net sales.Gross profit for the quarter amounted $428 million that depicted 8% growth from the prior year. However, margin contracted 280 basis points to 11.3%, owing to store closing costs and changes in business segment mix. Wholesale segment accounted for a large portion of the total sales and gross profit during the quarter.During the quarter, SUPERVALU’s operating loss was of $7 million, as compared with the operating earnings of $58 million in the prior-year period. This was caused by higher selling and administrative expenses.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSegment DetailsWholesale: Net sales at Wholesale business grew 58% year over year to $2.74 billion, mainly driven by the revenues from Unified Grocers business. Additionally, the segment also gained from sales to new customers and stores. These were partially offset by reduced military sales and stores that no longer receive supplies from SUPERVALU. Also, the segment’s operating income totaled $61 million, up from $58 million in the year-ago quarter.Retail: Net sales at Retail slipped 1.1% to $1.02 billion. This decrease represents store closures and unfavorable identical store sales of 3.5%, partly mitigated by sales from acquired and new outlets.In fact, we note that this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to competitive pressures. This is the tenth consecutive quarter of sales decline of the retail segment.Further, the segment reported operating loss of $58 million, wider than the operating loss of $12 million in the year-ago quarter. The downside was driven by lower sales and reduced gross margin owing to enhanced promotional activities.Corporate: During the second quarter, fees earned under services agreements were down 2.4% to $40 million. Further, the segment delivered operating loss of $10 million, as against operating income of $12 million delivered in the year-ago quarter.Financial Update The company’s cash and cash equivalents stood at $209 million as of Sep 9 compared to $252 million as of Jun 17.Long-term debt was $1,601 million and total stockholders’ equity totaled $373 million as of Sep 9, compared with long-term debt of $1,282 billion and stockholders’ equity of $397 million as of Jun 17.Further, the company’s year-to-date net cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations amounted $116 million, as compared with $208 million in the previous year.Outlook For fiscal 2018, management continues to expect adjusted EBITDA, including Unified Grocers of $475-$495 million.We commend SUPERVALU’s efforts to develop the wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the acquisition of Unified Grocers has yielded positive results and is expected to radically boost the company’s wholesale segment, alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies. It also recently announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire Associated Grocers for approximately $180 million. The company has also been working hard toward achieving a turnaround in its retail segment, reduce costs and increase operating efficiency. Looking for More?

2120,EL,"With rising consumer confidence, spending on beauty and personal care products in addition to apparel and footwear has increased. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has driven growth of the beauty segment.The Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report), one of the leading manufacturer and marketer of beauty products, has been a favorite pick for investors. Shares of the company have surged 29% in the past six months compared with the industry’s gain of 13.2%. Recently, its shares have hit a new 52-week high of $111.79 during the trading session on Oct 16, eventually closing at $111.28.Let’s delve into the aspects which have been aiding the company’s impressive performanceE-commerce on the Rise Estée Lauder has been continuously opening sites across different regions and targeting sustained growth in its e-commerce platform. During the fiscal year 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. Further, Estée Lauder is implementing new technology and digital experiences including online booking for each store appointment and omni-channel loyalty programs. These initiatives are expected to boost the company’s top line.Well Planned AcquisitionsEstée Lauder has been widening its portfolio through acquisitions. The buyout of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of fiscal 2017) have strengthened its fastest-growing prestige portfolio. This, in turn, have contributed about 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fiscal fourth quarter and approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The recent investment in DECIEM — a fast-growing multi-brand company — is also expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming periods.Other notable acquisitions of Estée Lauder include By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso, GLAMGLOW and Le Labo. Such acquisitions aid the company to expand its portfolio and maintain the respective loyal customer base.Strategic Allocation of Resources & Marketing Fuels Sales Effective promotions help cosmetic and beauty companies to influence consumer sentiments and thereby enhance sales. Estée Lauder emphasizes heavily on marketing, especially through digital media and social networking.The company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, in order to boost its beauty business. After its full implementation, Estée Lauder expects the initiative to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses of $200-$300 million, before taxes.Favorable EstimatesAhead of its first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, the Zacks Consensus Estimate inched up by a penny to reach 97 cents in the past 30 days. Estimated earnings for the forthcoming quarter lie in the upper end of the management’s guidance of 94-97 cents. This marks an increase of 12% to 15% over the prior-year earnings of 84 cents. However, estimated earnings of $3.97 per share for the fiscal year 2018 surpass management’s anticipated range of $3.87-$3.94.Final Thoughts                                                                                Estée Lauder has been struggling with social and political issues in Hong Kong. Though the company is attempting to strengthen its business with local consumers in Hong Kong, we do not anticipate a significant increase in consumption from the region in the near term.Nevertheless, the company expects to easily offset such challenges based on its strong growth in other emerging regions. The Middle East, North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Asia Pacific markets offer extensive untapped potential for the company. Estée Lauder also expects strong growth of its brands in China, and has therefore been expanding steadily in the region.Moreover, Estée Lauder is strongly positioned in the beauty arena, with its robust brand portfolio and productive growth strategies. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B, indicating its inherent growth potential.Looking for More?

2121,EL,"Coty Inc.’s (COTY  -  Free Report) division Calvin Klein Fragrances along with Calvin Klein, Inc, jointly announced a new advertising campaign for ETERNITY brand. The campaign will feature actor Jake Gyllenhaal as its new face. Calvin Klein, is a wholly owned subsidiary of PVH Corp (PVH  -  Free Report). Coty acquired the licensing agreement for Calvin Klein’s fragrance line from Unilever in 2005.The veteran actor has been a part of many successful movies such as Brokeback Mountain, Stronger and Nocturnal Animals. The new campaign also stars Liya Kebede, a leading model and advocate. The celebrities would be a part of ETERNITY’s television and print advertising campaigns. The campaign highlights Calvin Klein’s ideologies of contemporary life such as commitment, intimacy and love.Celebrity endorsements for marketing beauty products have been quite popular, as it aids increasing acceptance of the brand, more effectively amongst teenagers. Coty, one of the pioneering companies in the beauty industry, along with peers such as Estée Lauder Companies Inc (EL  -  Free Report) and L’Oréal (LRLCY  -  Free Report), has been utilizing celebrity power to endorse many products. For instance, advertising campaigns for Coty’s Rimmel lipsticks and other color cosmetics line features Kate Moss and Georgia May Jagge. Similarly, Beyoncé Knowles, Enrique Iglesias and David Beckham are other well-known celebrities who have endorsed Coty’s iconic brand line up.Other Brand Strengthening Initiatives by Coty Coty continuously evaluates strategic acquisitions and new brand licenses to enhance its portfolio. The company consistently introduces new products in response to shifting consumer preferences and markets new as well as established products through strategic advertising and merchandising. Moreover, the product launches made in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 including Hugo Iced and Boss Tonic, Chloe Love Story Eau Sensuelle and Miu Miu L'Eau Bleue proved to be beneficial and have yielded results in the fourth quarter. In addition, Gucci Guilty Absolute, which was launched in the end of March 2017, also witnessed strong growth.Further, the company is repositioning some of the brands, including COVERGIRL, Max Factor and Sally Hansen, in order to reconnect these brands with consumers. Coty also seeks to divest non-performing brands in order to focus and utilize resources in other attractive opportunities. This includes investing in Professional Beauty segment and Luxury segment, which have been depicting strong growth.Headwinds Pulling Down Shares Coty’s acquisitions, product launches and licensing agreements have led to higher marketing spending and increased operating expenses, which have been affecting the company’s profits. Moreover, the new celebrity endorsement campaign for ETERNITY Calvin Klein is expected to further raise marketing spends for Coty.Moreover, weak market trends across several of its categories, especially in North America and some reduction of shelf space for a few brands like Astor have weakened the company’s Consumer Beauty segment over the last few quarters. While the new marketing campaign for ETERNITY is expected to enhance Coty’s revenues in the Luxury segment, it may not be sufficient to counter the weakness in Consumer Beauty division.As a result of such headwinds, shares of Coty have underperformed the industry in the past 12 months. In the said time frame, Coty’s shares declined 32.8% as compared with the industry’s fall of 10.1%. Ahead of the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, estimates for the same have also declined by 18 cents in the past 60 days.Coty currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2122,EL,"Consumer products giant Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) has been focused on shaping its portfolio to achieve sustainable growth. To offer organic and healthy food products to consumers, Unilever recently agreed to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mãe Terra. The terms of the transaction remain undisclosed and is subject to customary regulatory approvals.Benefits of the AcquisitionFounded in 1979, Mãe Terra offers food products under categories like organic cereals, cookies, snacks and culinary products. Per Euromonitor, the main Mãe Terra categories represent a Brazilian market worth more than 8 billion euros.The deal is a strategic fit for this European consumer products giant as the company is looking to expand in the high-growth naturals and organic segment.

Mãe Terra is also expected to get scale with Unilever’s expertise and distribution channels.Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever PLC Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever PLC QuoteUnilever Strengthening PortfolioNotably, the Anglo-Dutch buyer has been on an acquisition spree over the last few quarters. In fact, this is the third acquisition in a month. Last week, Unilever agreed to acquire a Seoul-based cosmetic company Carver Korea, maker of toners and moisturizers, for $2.7 billion. In September, it bought Pukka Herbs for an undisclosed amount.We note that Unilever has been trying all means to strengthen and enhance efficiency after the failed $143 billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co. (KHC  -  Free Report) in February 2017. Since then, the company has undertaken a comprehensive review to return more cash to shareholders through buybacks and dividends as well as raise its margin target in order to boost its performance. In April, Unilever has reportedly decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter. Furthermore, the company announced plans to raise cost-savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Stock Price MovementThe company has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying since the company rejected Kraft Heinz deal.

2125,EL,"Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) posted first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate with the former marking its third straight beat. While the top line surged considerably thanks to gains from buyouts, organic sales declined year over year owing to weakness in the Consumer Beauty segment.Nonetheless, the better-than-expected results and Coty’s solid ongoing prospects seems to have encouraged investors. Evidently, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are up 9.1% in the pre-market trading session. Let’s see if this can bring a turnaround to Coty’s past stock performance, as shares of this cosmetics company have plunged 25% in the past six months, as against the industry’s 10.6% gain.The company’s adjusted earnings of 10 cents per share slumped 57% year over year, while it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7 cents. On a GAAP basis, the company reported a loss of 3 cents per share.Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Coty Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Coty Inc. Quote Quarter in DetailThe company generated revenues of $2,238.3 million, which topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2,224 million. Further, revenues surged over 100% year over year, driven by contributions from the P&G Beauty business buyout. Also, contributions from the acquisitions of ghd and Younique aided sales growth. On a constant currency basis, revenues increased 5%.Excluding the impacts from ghd and Younique, organic revenues of the combined company (Legacy-Coty and P&G Beauty Business) dipped 2% on a constant currency basis. This was mainly accountable to softness in the company’s Consumer Beauty segment, somewhat compensated by solid growth in the Luxury unit and modest improvement in the Professional Beauty unit.Adjusted gross margin expanded 280 basis points to 61.6% in the quarter thanks to the buyouts of higher margin businesses, as well as synergies from supply chain and procurement. While adjusted operating income jumped 17% to $195.1 million, adjusted operating margin contracted 670 basis points to 8.7% in the quarter.Segment DetailsLuxury: Luxury net revenues surged 70% to $764.4 million on a reported basis, backed by gains from the P&G Beauty business buyout. On a currency neutral basis, the combined company’s revenues rose 4%, attributable to strength in Hugo Boss, Tiffany & Co. (TIF  -  Free Report) and Gucci. Adjusted operating income for Luxury remained flat year over year at $89.9 million in the quarter.Consumer Beauty: Consumer Beauty soared 82% to $1,043.4 million on a reported basis, driven by contributions from Younique and P&G Beauty business. On a currency-neutral basis, net revenues of the combined company climbed 2%, thanks to 10% contribution from Younique, largely offset by an 8% drop in underlying revenues of the combined entity.The latter stemmed from continued sluggishness in the global mass beauty space and weak performance of some retail hair brands. Adjusted operating income for Consumer Beauty advanced 54% to $88.3 million.Professional: Professional Beauty net revenues of $430.5 million improved over 100%, driven by gains from P&G Beauty business and ghd buyouts. On a currency-neutral basis, sales grew 13% for the combined entity, including 12% gains from ghd and consistent strength in Wella and System Professional sales. This was partly mitigated by lower Clairol Professional sales. Adjusted operating income for Professional dipped marginally to $16.9 million.On a region-wise basis, net revenues surged over 100% (on a reported basis) across North America and Europe, driven by Younique and ghd’s contributions, respectively. However, the respective sales were partly hampered by softness in the United States and Germany. Sales at the ALMEA region jumped 74% on a reported basis.Other Financial UpdatesCoty ended the quarter with with cash and cash equivalents of $919.2 million, long-term debt (net) of $7,541.9 million and total shareholders’ equity of $9,452.3 million (excluding non-controlling interests).The company used net cash from operating activities of $8.9 million and free cash flow in the quarter amounted to negative $120.3 million.In a separate press release, the company also announced a dividend of 12.5 cents per share, payable on Dec 14 to shareholders of record as on Nov 30. Further, on Sep 14, the company paid a quarterly dividend of 12.5 cents per share for a total of $93.6 million.Other DevelopmentsEarlier this month, the company concluded the buyout of its unique international license rights for Burberry Beauty luxury fragrances, cosmetics and skincare, which will extend over the long term.OutlookManagement remains pleased with the solid growth at its Luxury business and ongoing momentum at the Professional segment. Further, enhanced gross margin and effective cost management helped the company log higher profits. The company remains optimistic about the ongoing synergies from buyouts, which have been solidifying its portfolio.That said, the company expects improved net revenue growth in the remainder of fiscal 2018, with organic sales likely to remain flat year over year in the second half of the fiscal. Management also expects healthy margin improvement over the remainder of fiscal 2018.Looking for More Promising Bets? Check These Trending PicksThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc.

This is because Active Representatives and Ending Representatives were hurt by decline in various segments. However, average orders were up 3% owing to growth in all segments, mitigated by flat Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) orders. While total units sold dipped 5%, price/mix improved 5%.Adjusted gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) year over year to 61.2%, mainly on the back of positive impact from price/mix.However, adjusted operating margin contracted 70 bps to 6.3%. The year-over-year decline was due to higher bad debt expenses, alongside increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses, all mainly in Brazil. These factors were partly negated by positive lower incentive compensation plan costs and lower fixed costs that include cost-reduction gains from the Transformation Plan. Avon Products, Inc.

Crossing the half-way mark of the plan period, the company has witnessed significant progress compared with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.In 2016, the company surpassed cost saving targets, realizing cost savings of roughly $120 million and considerably improved balance sheet as it reduced debt by about $260 million and extended maturity profile.In 2017, the company targets cost savings of $230 million including run-rate savings from 2016 along with in-year savings from current-year initiatives. Per Avon, savings realized through the nine months of 2017 indicates that it has roughly $25 million of savings target outstanding for the year.Going forward, management is likely to focus on the business foundations and improve overall performance to attain its savings target. Though Avon is facing challenges, it is expected to focus on investment in modernizing systems, delivering unique and competitive Representative experience. Further, it aims to provide deeper insights and analytics into Representative’s behavior and requirements to boost experience.In fact, the company also remains encouraged to minimize service disruption along with pilot programs that cover service from end to end.OutlookFollowing the mixed quarterly results and favorable trends, management expects modest growth in the fourth quarter of 2017. Though management remains focused to drive growth through innovations, solid team execution, improving Representative experience, it will take time to realize the benefits from its strategies.Furthermore, Avon expects results to fall short of expectations in 2017. The company now expects both constant-dollar revenues and adjusted operating margin in the band of flat to slightly up compared with the prior-year period. Also, it expects to achieve cost savings target and generate positive free cash flow for 2017 on the back of slower-than-anticipated capital expenditures in the current year.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderAvon holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

2127,EL,"The food industry’s performance has been dismal for quite some time now due to the prevailing pricing and competitive pressure. Evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms have been plaguing the industry. A shift in consumer preference toward non-genetically modified, organic, and gluten free products is also hurting business. The acquisition of Whole Foods by online giant Amazon.com has further made competitors skeptical and raised concerns.Despite industry-wide issues, Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) has been on a growth trajectory over the last few months. We believe Sysco’s impressive earnings history and solid growth strategies are making the stock a viable bet. Let’s delve deeper and try to find out what’s taking this food company higher.Why Invest in Sysco?Favorable Rank and VGM Score: Sysco, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) flaunts a VGM Score of A, which makes it a favorable investing option. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. We note that the VGM Score is a comprehensive tool that will allow investors to filter through the standard scoring system and choose better winning stocks. In order to screen out potential winning stocks, we consider only those that have a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a VGM Score of A or B.Share Price Performance: Sysco has exhibited a bullish run in the past six months gaining roughly 4.6% as against the industry’s decline of 7.4%. The industry is currently placed at the top 35% of the 265 Zacks Classified industries. The stock also exceeded the Consumer Staples sector, which gained only 3.8% in the said time frame.  Further, we believe there is still much momentum left in the stock, which is quite evident from its low beta of 0.52 and a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.4%.Rising Estimates: Analysts have become increasingly bullish on the stock over the last 60 days with estimates moving up. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is pegged at 73 cents, up from 72 cents per share in the said time frame. Similarly for fiscal 2018, the Zacks Consensus Estimate increased from $2.75 per share to $2.77, over the same time frame.Impressive Earnings History: Sysco delivered positive earnings surprises in six of the past seven quarters, with in-line results in one. Acquisition and margin improvement has been driving the company’s earnings. We note that Sysco has been consistently witnessing an improvement in sales, driven by acquisitions and volume growth. The buyouts of London-based Brakes Group and Supplies on the Fly e-commerce platform are encouraging. Sysco’s acquisition of London-based Brakes Group in July 2016 has benefited the company significantly. In fiscal 2017, Brakes performed reasonably well in midst of challenging environment in UK and it recorded earnings of 14 cents per share, exceeding its EPS estimates. Brakes is also making good progress in its supply chain transformational efforts, which is helping them to be efficient and will ultimately improve overall service and reduce costs.Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Sysco Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Sysco Corporation Quote Improving Margins: Sysco has been impressively managing expenses since the past few years and is making progress in both SG&A and supply chain, which is reflected in higher operating income growth.Further, Sysco delivered positive gross margins in the last nine quarters, after declining consistently since the last two fiscal. Modest inflation will also lead to margin improvement. Sysco was under deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters, and the trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Meat prices are abating, and dairy and produce prices have also begun to rise.Valuation Multiples: If we look into the company’s P/E and P/S multiples, we note that the company generally trades below its industry average.Sysco has a forward PE ratio of 19.6. This level actually compares pretty favorably with the market at large, as the PE for the S&P 500 is 22.5. Further, the stock’s PE also compares favorably with the Zacks classified industry’s PE ratio, which is pegged at 20.3. This indicates that the stock is relatively undervalued right now, compared to its peers.Right now, Sysco has a P/S ratio of about 0.5. This is significantly lower than the industry average of 1.8 and S&P 500 average, which comes in at 12.5 right now.Looking for More?

Further, it raised its guidance for full-year earnings.

2129,EL,"The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been delivering better-than-expected earnings over the past several quarters backed by acquisitions, online business growth, and cost savings measures. In fact, strong yields from acquisitions drove its recently announced fourth-quarter 2017 results.Let’s now look into some of the factors that have been impacting the performance of this company.Strong Fourth Quarter Results Both earnings and sales surged during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, which was released on Aug 18. The company posted adjusted earnings of 51 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 43 cents. Adjusted earnings also surged 21.4% year over year.Estée Lauder’s net sales of $2.89 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.85 million by 1.5%. Moreover, sales grew 9% from the prior-year quarter, primarily driven by acquisitions. Almost all the brands, geographic regions and product categories, except hair care reported sales growth in the quarter.Immediately after posting an upbeat fourth-quarter result, the company hit a 52-week high of $106.45, eventually closing at $105.92. We also note that shares of this cosmetic giant surged 7.7% since its fourth-quarter earnings release. Shares of this cosmetic giant have been rising primarily on the back of growth initiatives. We observe that shares of Estée Lauder went up 15.9% compared with the industry’s decline of 13.9% over the past year.Strategic Acquisitions Supports Growth The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first quarter of 2017) has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio and contributed approximately 3.5 percentage points of the reported sales growth during the fourth quarter. For fiscal 2017, these acquisitions contributed about 2 percentage points of the reported sales growth.The recent investment made in DECIEM – a fast-growing multi-brand company – is expected to aid beauty sales in the forthcoming quarters. Earlier acquisitions including By Kilian, RODIN olio lusso and GLAMGLOW have also boosted Estée Lauder’s skin care portfolio apart from aiding it to bolster its international presence.Online Business Acceleration & Other FactorsEstée Lauder has a strong e-Commerce business and the company expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years as well. During fiscal 2017, global online sales of the company depicted a 33% growth to reach $1.3 billion. A number of brands of the company such as MAC, Tom Ford and La Mer witnessed strong online sales growth during the year. Additionally, under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, the company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs in order to drive beauty business. Estée Lauder also has a strong presence in emerging markets which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. The company also gains from the rising demand for beauty products, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup.Bottom Line Estée Lauder has remained cautious regarding slower retail growth in Hong Kong and unfavorable currency. It has also been witnessing a decline in retail traffic in U.S. brick-and-mortar stores, principally for MAC, Estée Lauder and Clinique.Nevertheless, with a strong portfolio of brands, lucrative acquisitions and well-planned cost and resource allocation strategies, Estée Lauder is well placed in the beauty arena and is expected to easily overcome current challenges.Estée Lauder currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Looking for More Consumer Staples Stocks?

2130,EL,"The food industry has been struggling with rising competition, tight margins and an aggressive promotional environment. Larger food chains are strengthening their position by expanding their franchises and undertaking acquisitions. Moreover, Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN  -  Free Report) recent takeover of Whole Foods Market has disconcerted major food and grocery retailers. Amazon’s growing strength through such strategic buyouts cut down revenue opportunities for other companies in the industry. While grocery stocks have been under pressure, meat stocks are seen to be doing well, owing to rising consumer demand. One such stock is Tyson Foods, Inc (TSN  -  Free Report) that has been displaying strength due to the rising demand for its protein-packed products.However, we observe that margin pressure and promotional environment has weighed down the company’s shares in the past six months. Shares of Tyson Foods have gained 5.8% compared with the industry’s advance of 8.1%.  Nevertheless, Tyson Foods has undertaken several initiatives to revive its performance. Let’s now delve into some of the aspects that have been impacting this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Strong Volume Growth in the Third QuarterTyson Foods’ third-quarter fiscal 2017 results benefitted from strong volume growth and solid performance of its Beef, Pork and Chicken segments. The company’s results were boosted by the rising demand of these products. Notably, the Beef segment was seen to be sluggish in the past. Nevertheless, robust domestic demand for beef products, improved availability of cattle supply and higher exports aided the segment’s growth during the third quarter. Further, for fiscal 2018, the USDA expects overall domestic protein production (chicken, beef, pork and turkey) to increase.Strategic Acquisitions & Focus on Protein Packed Brands Acquisitions have been one of the important growth drivers for Tyson Foods. The successful completion of AdvancePierre acquisition in June 2017, aided Prepared Foods segment sales volume to rise 2.4%, as witnessed in the company’s third-quarter results. Tyson Foods expects the transaction to generate net synergies of approximately $200 million within the next three years. Further, the acquisition will enable the company to expand its fastest-growing portfolio of protein-packed brands and fresh prepared foods offerings. Other notable acquisitions of the company that enabled portfolio diversifying include Hillshire, Circle Foods and Don Julio Foods.Additionally, the acquisition of AdvancePierre and divestment of non-protein businesses (such as Sara Lee Frozen Bakery, Kettle and Van’s) are in-line with the company’s strategy to widen its protein-packed brands. Moreover, consumers are observed to shift away from red meat and opt for chicken, owing to health reasons. Taking advantage of this trend, Tyson Foods has been expanding its poultry plant capacities.Innovation Aids Portfolio Growth Tyson Foods continuously innovates and adds products to an already rich food line up. As an increasing number of health-conscious U.S. consumers are focusing on nutritious breakfasts, Tyson Foods considers it a high potential category. Recent launches like Jimmy Dean Frittatas, Stuffed Hash Browns, Tyson Food Service Fully Cooked Drumsticks and Buffalo Chicken Crispitos are getting good response from consumers.Looking for More?

2131,EL,"The consumer staples sector has been in investors' good graces of late, buoyed by an improving economy, strong labor market and continued hiring, improved GDP numbers as well as a resurgent housing market. These factors hint on rising consumer confidence in the months ahead and suggest that the economy is in good health.Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, also plays a major role in the upward revision. It grew 3.3% in the second quarter, compared with the government’s earlier estimate of 1.9%.Though Hurricanes Harvey and Irma storms along with North Korea’s back-to-back nuclear tests on Japan have spurred global tensions and unnerved investors, we believe these short-term headwinds can be overlooked as we can see signs of continuing strength in consumer confidence, which in turn will lead to higher consumer spending and fuel growth in the near term.The increase in consumer spending has also triggered growth in the cosmetics industry, particularly in the luxury arena and in makeup. Apart from buying essential and non-durable goods ranging from everyday grocery, food items, beverages, tobacco and other household essentials, consumers started spending on beauty and personal care products, on top of larger purchases such as apparel and footwear and personal accessories.The rise of e-commerce and social media has further aided the fastest-growing beauty channels. In fact, per media sources, the U.S. beauty sector is expected to reach $90 billion by 2020, and the majority of the growth will come from premium beauty products and services.How Is the Cosmetics Industry Placed?We note that the Zacks Cosmetics industry is currently placed at top 31% out of the 265 Zacks Industries. The industry has also been outperforming the S&P 500 market lately. In the last six months, the industry recorded around 10.1% growth, well above the S&P 500 Index’s growth of 5.4%. However, it carries a Zacks Sector Rank of #7 (out of 16), placing it at the top 44% of the Zacks Classified sectors.That’s why it may be a good idea to invest in cosmetics stocks at this juncture, as signs of surging consumer confidence and economic recovery is making the industry attractive. Despite of industry gaining momentum, there are still some stocks in the cosmetics market that have been delivering sluggish results and are expected to continue to remain weak in the near term.Given this backdrop, investors may want to reshuffle their portfolio and include those cosmetics stocks which have been doing well for quite some time and have the potential to deliver returns in the coming months. Also, investors should consider avoiding those cosmetics stocks, which are not capable of delivering desired returns.How to Pick Viable Stocks?We have narrowed down our search to the following two stocks based on their Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). These stocks also have positive estimates revision and their share prices are trending higher than the industry as well as broader sector’s average.2 Prominent PicksThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report)Estée Lauder is a leading global manufacturer of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The stock has been on growth trajectory backed by a diverse portfolio, well-planned acquisitions and notable progress in e-commerce.These attributes have aided this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s earnings to surpass the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 12 straight quarters. The stock currently has a long-term growth rate of 12.2% and has a beta rating of 0.67, which means the stock is also less volatile than the market average.Evidently, shares of the company have surged 27.4% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader Consumer Staples sector’s improvement of 2.9%. In fact, shares of the company have gone up almost 11.6% since it posted upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 18. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have also gone up 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days.Nu Skin Enterprises Inc. (NUS  -  Free Report)Another Zacks Rank #2 stock is Nu Skin Enterprises, which is engaged in the development and distribution of consumer products, offering beauty and wellness solutions under its Nu Skin personal care, Pharmanex nutrition brand and ageLOC anti-aging category brands in over 50 markets worldwide. The Provo, UT-based firm has a VGM Score of A and has a long-term growth rate of 8.7%.On Aug 2, the company posted second-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both earnings and sales surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. In fact, the company’s earnings have surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in four out of last six quarters, with in-line results in one.Moving forward, this skin care and nutritional products retailer remains focused on boosting its customers and sales. Nu Skin also plans to launch ageLOC LumiSpa product in the fourth quarter of this year, which is expected to generate roughly $100 million in revenues. Further, for fiscal 2017, management raised its guidance for earnings which is now projected in the band of $3.2-$3.3 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have also gone up 4.2% and 2.1%, respectively, for 2017 and 2018 over the last 60 days.Evidently, shares of the company have surged around 17% in the last six months, outperforming the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader Consumer Staples sector’s improvement of 2.9%. In fact, shares of the company have gone up almost 11.6% since it posted upbeat fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 18. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have also gone up 2.6% and 1.6%, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days.2 Stocks to AvoidThe below mentioned stocks from the industry have been underperforming since past many quarters and have also witnessed decline in share price in comparison to the industry as well as the broader sector. We suggest avoiding these stocks, which also carry Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell), possess a negative surprise trend and have witnessed downward estimate revisions.Coty, Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report) at the moment is not a valuable stock. Based in New York, Coty presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and a VGM Score of D. The Zacks Consensus Estimates have significantly declined 24.2% and 15%, respectively, for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 over the last 30 days.This manufacturer and global marketer of beauty products has posted negative earnings surprise in three out of the trailing four quarters, making an average negative surprise of 27.65%. This signals that the company has been witnessing headwinds in the near term, which have pulled down the shares over the last six months period. The stock has declined 13.1% in the last six months, as against the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader sector’s gain of 2.9%.We note that sluggishness in the consumer beauty segment, increasing competitive pressure, and changing consumer preferences have been the major deterrents for the company. In fact, declines in the retail nail, color cosmetics and hair color categories in the United States and mass fragrance in Western Europe and the United States are expected to continue to impact business. The company also remains exposed to unfavorable foreign currency translations as it has a considerable international presence.Another stock which is underperforming is Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report), which currently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). This global direct-selling beauty company offers cosmetics, fragrances, toiletries, jewelry and accessories and has reported negative earnings surprise of 150% in second-quarter 2017, which were negatively impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter.Also, weak Active Representatives growth has been denting the results over the past few quarters. The company has lagged earnings estimates for four consecutive quarters, with an average miss of 90.7%. Additionally, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 has declined 55% in the last 60 days and around 23% for 2018.Moreover, the stock nosedived 43.9% in the last six months, as against the industry’s growth of 10.1% as well as the broader sector’s improvement of 2.1%. In fact, the company has lost around 24% since it reported dismal earnings on Aug 3.Bottom LineAn intelligent selection of stocks greatly benefits investors and the abovementioned stocks can prove to be valuable additions to your portfolio.You can also use the Zacks Stock Screener to find other stocks with this winning combination.

2132,EL,"The J. M. Smucker Company (SJM  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Aug 24. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this food products manufacturerwill be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company delivered an average earnings beat of 4.00% in the trailing four quarters.However, fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results of Smucker failed to impress investors. While earnings during the quarter fell 19% year over year due to lower revenues and decline in gross profits, sales dipped 1% due to lower net price realization.The dismal quarterly performance was also reflected in the share price performance of the company. If we look into the company’s last six months performance, we will notice that shares of Smucker underperformed the industry. In the said time frame, shares of the company have declined 13.4%, compared with the industry’s fall of 6.2%. Notably, the industry is part of the bottom 28% of the Zacks Classified industries (185 out of the 265). The broader Consumer Staples sector, which is at top 25% of the Zacks Classified sectors (4 out of 16), has increased 2.5% in the said time frame.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has declined 3.0% over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at $1.61 per share, which is also down 13.4% from $1.86 per share delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.82 billion, almost in line with the prior-year period.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteFactors to ConsiderOf late, the U.S. Retail Coffee segment, which is Smucker’s biggest revenue generating segment, is going through a rough patch. Owing to escalating coffee costs, Folgers brand has been witnessing reduced volumes. Not only this, Smucker’s Pet Food business has also been facing several challenges. Heightened competition from premium brands and challenges in dry dog food against a deflationary macro environment is weighing on Kibbles 'n Bits brand’s performance. Sourcing challenges have also posed a concern in this segment.The introduction of Nature's Recipe premium pet food in second-quarter fiscal 2017 is anticipated to stabilize Kibbles 'n Bits brand, as well as benefit the entire dog food portfolio. The acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brand and the launch of Dunkin Donuts K-cup pods are also fueling sales. Notably, Dunkin Donuts is part of Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. (DNKN  -  Free Report).Smucker also remains hopeful that its cost-reduction initiatives, combined with the restructuring and innovation related efforts, would improve the company’s performance in the near term. However, the company expects earnings to decline due to softness in the coffee and pet foods segments, moving ahead. Smucker’s international business performance also remains under pressure due to currency headwinds.Earnings Whispers?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Smucker is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Smucker has an Earnings ESP of -1.01% as the Most Accurate estimate of $1.60 is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.61 per share. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its -1.01% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies in the consumer staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:SunOpta, Inc. (STKL  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +33.3% and a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Estée Lauder Companies, Inc.

2133,EL,"Newell Brands Inc. (NWL  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 results, wherein both earnings and revenues missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Moreover, the company’s top line declined year over year. Consequently, management lowered its outlook for 2017.Consequently, Newell’s shares declined 10.5% in the pre-market trading session. The stock was down 39.1% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 9%.Results were below the company’s expectations and were hurt by soft late-quarter sales with respect to retailer inventory rebalancing, mainly related to the decelerated market growth, in the United States through the Back-to-School period. As a result, markets were weaker across various categories.Q3 HighlightsNewell’s normalized earnings of 86 cents per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 92 cents in the third quarter but improved 10.3% year over year from 78 cents in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year growth was driven by modest core sales improvement, the ongoing cost savings and related synergies, Project Renewal, acquisitions along with a more favorable tax rate. However, these were somewhat mitigated by the lost earnings from divested businesses, adverse product mix, commodity cost inflation, higher advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment coupled with a greater share count.On a reported basis, including one-time items, the company recorded earnings of 48 cents per share compared with 38 cents a year ago.Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Newell Brands Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Newell Brands Inc. QuoteNet sales dropped 7% to $3,678.2 million in the quarter, also missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,702 million. This represents a net adverse impact of 770 basis points (bps) from acquisitions and divestitures.Core sales increased 0.4%, driven by solid performance by Baby and Food businesses within the Live segment, Waddington as well as Consumer and Commercial business within the Work segment, Team Sports and Fishing in the Play segment.Segmental Performance Live net sales increased 2.3% year over year to $1483.3 million while core sales improved 0.6%. The uptick was backed by solid results in the Baby and Food businesses, substantially offset by soft results from Appliances and Cookware.Net sales in the Learn segment edged up 0.7% to $642 million while core sales were up 0.5%, on the back of modest improvement in all its divisions.Work net sales rose 1.6% to $738 million while core sales improved 1.9%, owing to persistent growth on Waddington as well as robust results from the Consumer and Commercial business.Sales at the Play segment increased 2.4% to $611 million while core sales advanced 2.3%, driven by growth across all the divisions along with solid growth in Team Sports and Fishing.Net sales at the Other segment plunged 62.4% to $204 million, primarily due to the divestitures of the Tools, Winter Sports, Fire Starter as well as Fire Log and Cordage businesses. Further, core sales decreased 10.6% owing to soft Process Solutions business.MarginsNewell’s normalized gross margin contracted 100 bps to 35% as cost synergies and savings gains were more than negated by adverse mix as well as higher commodity cost inflation.Normalized operating income fell roughly 9.5% to $551 million. Normalized operating income margin also declined 40 bps to 15%. Gains from synergies and Project Renewal savings were higher than compensated with the absence of earnings related to divested businesses, commodity cost inflation, adverse product mix and increased advertising, promotion and e-commerce investment.Other Financial DetailsNewell ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $792.3, long-term debt of $10,184.4 million and total shareholders’ equity of $12,770 million. In the nine months of 2017, the company used $58 million cash in operating activities.Further, operating cash flow was $183 million in the quarter versus $513 million in the last year.Additionally, the company’s board of directors has approved a share buyback plan in addition to the existing share repurchase program. Under the revised plan, Newell is authorized to buyback up to $1 billion of its outstanding shares through 2020-end. Still the company had $256 million left under its current $500 million share buyback plan. Earlier, the existing plan was expected to expire at the end of 2017 but now it is extended through the end of 2020.OutlookNewell is on track to attain its transformation initiatives. In fact, market share gains, point of sale growth, innovation, e-commerce improvement, along with cost-savings plans are expected to drive growth. Further, it continued to obtain cost synergies as anticipated, with an additional $86 million in the quarter.However, management trimmed its guidance for 2017. Newell now expects normalized earnings per share in the range of $2.80-$2.85, down from $2.95-$3.05, projected earlier. In September, the company had trimmed its earnings guidance for 2017 on increased inflationary pressure due to low resins’ supply owing to impacts from the Hurricane Harvey.Further, the company expects net sales for 2017 in the band of $14.7-$14.8 billion, reflecting 11.3-11.8% improvement from prior-year quarter. Moreover, core sales growth is anticipated in a range of 1.5-2%. However, the company had earlier maintained its net sales and core sales guidance. Newell Brands anticipated net sales for 2017 in the range of $14.8-$15 billion, reflecting 11.5-13% growth. Also, it forecasted core sales growth in a range of 2.5-4%.Zacks Rank & Key PicksNewell Brands has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

2136,EL,"Wednesday, November 1, 2017On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500. Not too shabby for a product without any federal government backing anywhere in the word, and with plenty of high-powered naysayers like JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon.Huge Day for Q3 EarningsAfter the closing bell today, we will see earnings results from a metric ton of notable companies in big tech and elsewhere. Facebook (FB  -  Free Report) and Tesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) and the two marquee names, but this afternoon also includes Qualcomm (QCOM  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Fitbit (FIT  -  Free Report), Shake Shack (SHAK  -  Free Report) and dozens of others. Q3 earnings season is again bearing out market strength, even among small-cap stocks, as this interview with Tracey Ryniec and Zacks Director of Research Sheraz Mian illustrates: Is This a Buying Opportunity in Small-Cap Stocks?Ahead of today’s opening bell, specialty retailer Estee Lauder (EL  -  Free Report) is up 7% on a strong fiscal Q1 2018 quarter which saw earnings rise 42% year over year and revenues up 14%. $1.21 per share topped the 98 cents in the Zacks consensus, and sales of $3,274 million outperformed our estimate of $3,164 million. Estee Lauder also raised its earnings guidance for both Q2 and full-year 2018.Consumer discretionary giant Clorox Group (CLX  -  Free Report) also outperformed its fiscal Q1 2018 expectations during today’s pre-market, posting $1.46 per share for a 5-cent beat on $1.50 billion in quarterly sales, ahead of the $1.48 billion anticipated. However, the company shaved down full-year estimates for both sales and earnings. Shares are up 1% ahead of the opening bell.Specialty tech products firm Garmin (GRMN  -  Free Report) also beat estimates on its top and bottom lines this morning: 75 cents per share topped the 66 cents expected, and revenues of $743 million outpaced the $718 in the Zacks consensus. The company also raised guidance, and we see shares up 4.7% in today’s pre-market.Mark VickerySenior EditorQuestions or comments about this article and/or its author?

2137,EL,"Unilever Plc (UL  -  Free Report) recently confirmed the buyback of its outstanding Dutch preference shares, through a public offer worth 450 million euros. The company is aiming to simplify its corporate structure through this buyback initiative. The public offering is in connection with Unilever’s agreement to purchase 6% and 7% preference shares in Unilever N.V. held by NN Investment Partners and insurer ASR Netherlands. The offer, which initiated on Oct 11, 2017, will cease on Oct 25.Simplifying the Corporate Structure The company has been considering corporate restructuring for its dual-headed legal structure, to make it more agile. To this respect, the purchase of 6% and 7% cumulative preference shares holdings of the company’s Dutch-listed entity, Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report), is a radical step. As the consumer products giant is listed both in Amsterdam and London, the move will aid the company to improve corporate governance. The review of Unilever N.V.’s corporate structure is expected to be completed by the end of this year.Other Initiatives to Boost Performance Unilever has been focusing on strengthening and enhancing efficiency after the failed $143-billion takeover attempt by Kraft Heinz Co (KHC  -  Free Report). Since then, the company has been undertaking several initiatives to boost shareholder returns and raise its margin target in order to improve performance.Acquisitions have also been an important growth driver for Unilever. Unilever recently agreed to acquire Brazilian natural and organic food business Mãe Terra. It also clinched a deal to buy cosmetics company Carver Korea for 2.27 billion euros in September. The buyout will place the company in the beauty category which has been witnessing high growth, driven by social media content and diversified professional make-up techniques. Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder Companies, Inc (EL  -  Free Report) have also been growing significantly, on the back of rising demand for beauty products.Unilever has been considering moving out of slow-growing business areas. In April, Unilever decided to sell its shrinking spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter. Further, the company announced plans to raise cost-savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses. It also announced the buyout of the Australian ice cream brand Weis.Investors remain impressed with Unilever’s ongoing initiatives to streamline its business through buybacks, consolidations and acquisitions. Evidently, shares of the company have returned 15.7% in the past 6 months, compared with the industry’s rise of 5.6%.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company currently carries a VGM Score of A, indicating its inherent strength. You can see see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

2139,EL,"It's been a dramatic past few weeks around the world, and that has led to some hesitant trading.

Markedly, the sector is on growth trajectory since the beginning of 2017, supported by buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.In fact, we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which nine sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter.

The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this apparel manufacturer and designer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The company has a very mixed record of earnings surprises in the trailing four quarters. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Hanesbrands Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Hanesbrands Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 61 cents, which reflects year-over-year growth of 8.9%. Also, the earnings estimate has trended upward in the last seven days. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1,806 million, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.Factors at PlayHanesbrands reported preliminary numbers for third-quarter 2017 last week, when it also announced the buyout of Alternative Apparel. Hanesbrands further stated that it anticipates net sales for the quarter to come in at roughly $1.8 billion, which marks a year-over-year increase of 2.5%. Also, the bottom line is envisioned to be approximately 60 cents per share, showing growth of 7.1% from the prior-year period. These projections fall within management’s previously guided range. Notably, both top and bottom lines for the quarter are likely to be fueled by robust growth at the company’s international segment. Also, management earlier predicted more back-to-school shipments to fall in the third quarter versus a year ago, which should lead to higher sales.A Look Back at Q2 & Estimates for Q3Well, the international segment largely drove Hanesbrands’ results in the last quarter, which broke the company’s negative sales surprise trend of five quarters. During the quarter, both sales and earnings jumped year over year, mainly backed by acquisition related synergies. The benefits from acquisitions were mainly related to Champion Europe and Hanes Australasia that had been completed in 2016. Moreover, sales from online channel globally increased 25%, majorly benefitting from strength in Global Champion Activewear.Looking at segments, the international segment witnessed a substantial 76% surge in sales that came in at $475.2 million. The growth was primarily driven by acquisitions and strong results in Asia. In fact, European acquisition synergies led to a 152% increase in the operating profit of the segment. Turning to the Activewear segment, sales climbed 1% to $379.6 million, though the operating profit tumbled 10% due to higher Project Booster expense and retailer bankruptcies. In fact, Project Booster expenses also marred operating profit at the Innerwear segment, wherein sales declined 2.5% to $719 million. Nevertheless, the rate of sales decline decelerated from the previous two quarters.Clearly, the international segment appears to be the driving factor for Hanesbrands’ top and bottom lines in the quarter to be reported. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for international revenues is currently pegged at $502 million for third-quarter 2017, showing a 5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus estimates for Activewear and Innerwear revenues are pegged at $530 million and $689 million, reflecting year-over-year advancements of 3.7% and 0.1% respectively.Possible DeterrentsWhile online sales grew year over year, it only formed 9% of the company’s total sales. Thus, the company still generates a major chunk of sales from brick-and-mortar operations, which have been pressurized owing to an evolving retail landscape. Also, the retail landscape has been highly competitive and promotional, which may also weigh upon Hanesbrands’ performance. Some analysts also perceive the company’s North American operations to be troubled, on account of such headwinds. However, we expect growth in the international segment, benefits from buyouts and focus on Project Booster to drive Hanesbrands’ performance this quarter. Notably, the company’s shares have gained 7.7% year to date, surpassing the industry’s rise of 4.6%.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hanesbrandsis likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

2148,EL,"Mohawk Industries, Inc. (MHK  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26.The company’s third-quarter performance is likely to be affected by the recent hurricanes, which have resulted in considerable demand and supply disruption.Also, increased raw material costs, start-up expenses and currency headwinds continue to raise concerns. On the brighter side, Mohawk implemented price increases across most product categories and regions to make up for higher material costs and currency changes in the third quarter.The company is likely to benefit from its strategy of driving growth through acquisitions. These acquisitions broaden Mohawk’s product portfolio and expand its geographic footprint and market share. Since the beginning of 2017, the company has executed four buyouts.We are also encouraged by Mohawk’s increased investments in product innovation, productivity and distribution. The company is introducing higher value products, adding service centers and unique merchandise in promotions to optimize each channel. The company intends to spend more than $850 million in 2017 on product innovation, enhanced automation and driving synergies from the four acquisitions made so far this year.Coming to the segments, as per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, sales at the Global Ceramic segment are expected to increase 1.9% sequentially and 11.9% year over year on the back of the recent acquisitions. Flooring North America segment sales will likely increase 3.5% sequentially and 6.5% year over year. However, Flooring Rest of the World segment sales are anticipated to decrease 6.3% sequentially but improve 3% on a year-over-year basis. Overall, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $2.46 billion, up 6.4% from the year-ago quarter.The solid improvement in the top line, driven by increased revenues from all segments, is expected to boost earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings stands at $3.74, reflecting an increase of 6.7% year over year.

2150,EL,"Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter and fiscal 2017 results on Aug 18, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this leading manufacturer and marketer of skin care and hair care products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter.We note that the company has delivered a positive surprise in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 10.9%. In fact, its earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 11 straight quarters now.Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil? Our proven model does not show that Estée Lauder is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Estée Lauder has an Earnings ESP of -2.38% as the Most Accurate estimate is at 41 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 42 cents. The company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP. However, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.Estimate Revisions Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter has been stable over the last 30 days at 42 cents while for fiscal 2017 it has increased by a cent to $3.40. Estimates for the quarter depict a year-over-year decline of 2.3% while the same for the fiscal year depicts a growth of 6.1%.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.85 billion, up 7.7% from the prior-year quarter. The same for fiscal 2017 are anticipated to be $11.78 billion, depicting a growth of 4.6% from the previous year.Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteFactors at Play Estée Lauder’s strategic acquisitions have aided the company to enhance its portfolio. The acquisitions of BECCA and Too Faced (during the first-quarter fiscal 2017) has strengthened its fastest growing prestige portfolio. It has contributed approximately half the reported sales growth in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Lately, the company invested in DECIEM, a rapidly growing multi-brand company, which will also aid beauty sales. In addition to acquisitions, the company also emphasizes on marketing, through digital media and social networking sites.Under the Leading Beauty Forward initiative, the company continues to reallocate resources and reduce costs in order to drive beauty business. After its full implementation, the company expects Leading Beauty Forward to yield annual net benefits, primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses, of between $200 million and $300 million, before taxes.Estée Lauder also has a strong e-Commerce business and expects it to be a major growth engine for the upcoming years. Moreover, the company’s strong presence in emerging markets insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. Such factors combined with a solid portfolio of brands, have aided Estée Lauder’s stocks to march ahead of the industry in the past six months. Shares of the company have gained 19.7% compared with the industry’s growth of 7.7%.Although Estée Lauder expects continued growth opportunities in the global prestige beauty industry, currency volatility, economic challenges, terrorism and social and political issues are affecting consumer behavior in few countries. In this respect, slower retail growth in Hong Kong and decline in consumer spending in France, the Middle East and in the U.S. have been posing concerns. For fiscal 2017, foreign currency is expected to negatively impact sales by 2%. Nevertheless, the company’s strategic policies are well on track to aid its performance and overcome industry related challenges.Other Favorable Picks Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Churchill Downs Inc.

2151,EL,"Similar to wise buying decisions, exiting certain underperformers at the right time helps maximize portfolio returns. Selling off losers can be difficult, but if both the share price and estimates are falling, it could be time to get rid of the security before more losses hit your portfolio.One such stock that you may want to consider dropping is Coty Inc. (COTY  -  Free Report), which has witnessed a significant price decline in the past four weeks, and it has seen negative earnings estimate revisions for the current quarter and the current year. A Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further confirms weakness in COTY.A key reason for this move has been the negative trend in earnings estimate revisions. For the full year, we have seen eight estimates moving down in the past 30 days, compared with no upward revisions. This trend has caused the consensus estimate to trend lower, going from 91 cents a share a month ago to its current level of 69 cents.Also, for the current quarter, Coty Inc. has seen six downward estimate revisions versus no revisions in the opposite direction, dragging the consensus estimate down to 7 cents a share from 25 cents over the past 30 days.  The stock also has seen some pretty dismal trading lately, as the share price has dropped 17.7% in the past month.Coty Inc.

2152,EL,"Many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, but this can be very tough to define. There is great debate regarding which metrics are the best to focus on in this regard, and which are not really quality indicators of future performance. Fortunately, with our new style score system we have identified the key statistics to pay close attention to and thus which stocks might be the best for momentum investors in the near term.This method discovered several great candidates for momentum-oriented investors, but today let’s focus on The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) as this stock is looking especially impressive right now. And while there are numerous ways in which this company could be a great choice, we have highlighted three of the most vital reasons for EL’s status as a solid momentum stock below:Short Term Price Change for Estée LauderA great place to look for finding momentum stocks is by inspecting short term price activity. This can help to reflect the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand right now. It is especially useful to compare it to the industry as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.With a one week price change of 2% compared to an industry average of -0.6%, EL is certainly well-positioned in this regard. The stock is also looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the four week price change compares favorably with the industry at large.Longer Term Price Change for Estée LauderWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. That is why looking at longer term price metrics—such as performance over the past three months or year-- and comparing these to an industry at large can be very useful.And in the case of EL, the results are quite impressive. The company has beaten the industry at large over the past 12 weeks by a margin of 11.7% to 0.3%, while it has also outperformed when looking at the past year, putting up a gain of 20.7%. Clearly, EL is riding a bit of a hot streak and is worth a closer look by investors.  Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) Price | Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. (The) QuoteEL Earnings Estimate Revisions Moving in the Right DirectionWhile the great momentum factors outlined in the preceding paragraphs might be enough for some investors, we should also take into account broad earnings estimate revision trends. A nice path here can really help to show us a promising stock, and we have actually been seeing that with EL as of late.Over the past two months, three earnings estimates have gone higher compared to none lower for the full year, while we are also seeing that four estimates have move upwards with no downward revision for the next year time frame. These revisions have helped to boost the consensus estimate, as two months ago, EL was expected to post earnings of $3.76 per share for the full year, though today it looks to have EPS of $3.95 for the full year, representing a solid increase which is something that should be welcome news to would-be investors.Bottom LineGiven these factors, investors shouldn’t be surprised to note that we have EL as a security with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.So if you are looking for a fresh pick that has potential to move in the right direction, definitely keep EL on your short list as this looks be a stock that is very well-positioned to soar in the near term.One Simple Trading IdeaSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

2153,EL,"The rough phase seems to be far from over for the beauty products retailer, Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) as it continues to struggle with dismal top-line and bottom-line performances. Notably, the company delivered dismal second-quarter 2017 results, lagging top-line and bottom-line estimates for four consecutive quarters now.The impact of this dismal trend and the recently reported soft second-quarter 2017 results is clearly reflected in the company’s stock price. Evidently, the Avon stock has lost nearly 17.6% since reporting second-quarter results on Aug 3. Further, shares of this Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company have declined 45% year to date, while the industry has gained nearly 4.8%.What’s Behind the Decline?Clearly, the stock is struggling due to strained earnings and revenues, as discussed above. In the recently reported second-quarter 2017, Avon’s adjusted loss from continuing operations of 3 cents per share, compared unfavorably with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 5 cents. Further, constant-dollar revenue dipped 4%.Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteResults for the quarter were mainly impacted by strong comparisons with the prior-year quarter. Additionally, results were hurt by decline in both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives across all segments, barring Ending Representatives growth in North Latin America.While the company registered gross margin growth, operating margins were hampered by constant-dollar revenue decline resulting in deleveraged fixed expenses; higher bad debt expense, particularly in Brazil; increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses; elevated transportation costs, mainly in Russia; and investments in advertising for product launches.Driven by second-quarter performance, the company now expects constant-dollar revenue growth for 2017 to be at the low-end of its previously provided guidance range of low-single digits growth. This led to a downtrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last seven days. Estimates for 2017 and 2018 have fallen by 6 cents and 5 cents, respectively, to 9 cents per share and 27 cents per share.Is There Scope for Revival?While Avon’s surprise history, stock performance and estimates trend suggest a bumpy road ahead, we believe the company’s three-year Transformation Plan, which is in its second year, could be a silver lining in these dark clouds.Crossing the half-way mark of the plan period, the company has witnessed significant progress compared with its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience. In 2016, the company surpassed cost saving targets, realizing cost savings of roughly $120 million and considerably improved balance sheet as it reduced debt by about $260 million and extended maturity profile. In 2017, the company targets cost savings of $230 million, including run-rate savings from 2016, along with in-year savings from current year initiatives.With significant progress on enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility under the Transformation Plan, the company is now keen on the third component of the plan – investing in growth. To this end, it is focused on implementing strategies that will aid in strengthening Avon while driving profitable growth. After deliberate evaluation, the company is now focused on putting in key enablers in place. These enablers include delivering a competitive, seamless experience for Representatives; making sure the Representatives have the right product to sell; and ensuring it is expanding in the right geographies. With regard to investing in growth, management plans to invest nearly $350 million over the three-year period, including $150 million toward media and social selling; and $200 million for service model evolution and information technology. This is mainly aimed at bolstering the overall Representative experience.Bottom LineThe stringent focus and swift progress on the Transformation Plan could be rewarding for the company. However, the dismal revenues and earnings indicate that more efforts need to be put in. We would hence prefer to stay away from the stock until the success of its Transformation Plan starts to reflect in top-line and bottom-line results.Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks in the same industry include The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

2154,EL,"Sysco Corporation (SYY  -  Free Report) is slated to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Aug 14, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this global food products maker and distributor will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average surprise of 6.9%.Let’s delve deeper on how things are shaping up for this announcement. Which Way are Estimates Treading? A look into estimate revisions give us an idea of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and for fiscal 2017 has been stable over the last 30 days at 71 cents and $2.47, respectively.Estimated earnings for the fourth quarter depict a year-on-year growth of 11.2%, while the same for fiscal 2017 is estimated to grow 17.8%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of 14.23 billion for the fourth quarter, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not show that Sysco is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Sysco has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 71 cents. The company carries a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult.Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Walt Disney Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Walt Disney Company (The) QuoteFactors Influencing the Quarter Sysco’s strategic acquisitions, especially London-based Brakes acquisition in Jul 2016 have aided the growth of its distribution network, customer base and drive long-term growth. In fact, this acquisition is likely to be modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share by low to mid-single digits in fiscal 2017, with acceleration in fiscal 2018 and beyond. Such acquisitions have significantly improved the company’s top-line.Sysco has also been managing its expenses quite efficiently since the past few years. We are impressed with the fact that Sysco has delivered higher gross margins for eight consecutive quarters now, on the back of SG&A and supply chain process improvements.  Further, the company remains on track to achieve the recently raised three-year adjusted operating income growth target to approximately $600 million to $650 million through the end of FY18.However, Sysco has been facing deflationary pressure for an unprecedented six consecutive quarters. The trend is finally beginning to shift toward inflation from third-quarter fiscal 2017. Though the company is anticipating overall modest inflation in the fourth quarter, the impact on the company might take little more time. The grocery/supermarket business is also grappling with stiff competition, aggressive promotional environment and reduced store traffic.Such industry wide headwinds have hurt the company’s share prices. Nevertheless, the decline was narrower than the industry owing to its strong fundamentals. We note that Sysco’s shares have declined 1% over the last one year, narrower than the industry that fell 10.2%. This makes it quite evident that the company’s growth strategy is paying off and its efforts to boost sales and margins are bearing fruit.Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

QuoteOn a reported basis, the company posted loss per share of 12 cents compared with earnings of 7 cents in the year-ago quarter.Deeper InsightTotal revenue dipped 3% year over year to $1,395.9 million and fell short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,443.3 million. On a constant currency basis, total revenue declined 4%.Active Representatives declined 3% compared with the prior-year quarter, while Ending Representatives dipped 2%. Both Active Representatives and Ending Representatives were hurt by decline in all segments, barring Ending Representatives growth in North Latin America. Average orders were down 1% due to decline in Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA) and North Latin America, mitigated by growth in South Latin America and flat Asia-Pacific orders. Units Sold dipped 5% due to decline in all segments.Adjusted gross margin expanded 180 basis points (bps) year over year to 62.4% on the back of favorable price/mix and net positive impact from foreign currency transaction gains and foreign currency translation.Adjusted operating profit increased 32.9% to $70.1 million, while adjusted operating margin contracted 230 bps to 5%. Operating margin was hampered by constant-dollar revenue decline resulting in deleveraged fixed expenses; higher bad debt expense, particularly in Brazil; increased Representative, sales leader and field expenses; elevated transportation costs, mainly in Russia; and investments in advertising for product launches. This was partly negated by positive impact from currency, improved price/mix and lower incentive compensation plan costs.Segment PerformanceAvon’s revenues of $494.6 million in Europe, the Middle East and Africa slipped 5% year over year. On a currency neutral basis, revenues dipped 6%, mainly driven by a 3% fall in both Active Representatives and average orders. Price/mix in the region went up 2%, while units sold declined 8%. Ending Representatives dipped 1%.Revenues in South Latin America increased 4% year over year to $558.1 million and remained flat in constant-dollars, mainly owing to 2% growth in average orders, partly negated by 2% decline in Active Representatives. Furthermore, price/mix increased 5%, while units sold were down 5%. Ending Representatives also declined 2%.North Latin America reported a revenues decline of 7% year over year to $207.8 million, and fell 5% in constant-dollars, due to 2% decline in Active Representatives and 3% fall in average orders. Also, price/mix declined 2% while units sold fell 3%. However, Ending Representatives inched up 1%.The Asia-Pacific division’s revenues fell 11% to $124.7 million and decreased 7% in constant dollars. The decline was mainly attributed to a 7% decline in Active Representatives. While average orders remained flat, units sold fell 3%, price/mix dropped 4% and Ending Representatives declined 7%.Financial DetailsAvon ended the second quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $633.8 million, long-term debt of $1,873.8 million, and shareholders’ deficit of $853.1 million (excluding non-controlling interests).Transformation Plan UpdateAvon is in the second year of its three-year Transformation Plan that was announced in Jan 2016.  The plan mainly focuses on investing in growth, enhancing cost structure and improving financial flexibility. Crossing the half-way mark of the plan period, the company has witnessed significant progress against its targets of enhancing cost structure and improving financial resilience.In 2016, the company surpassed cost saving targets, realizing cost savings of roughly $120 million and considerably improved balance sheet as it reduced debt by about $260 million and extended maturity profile.In 2017, the company targets cost savings of $230 million, including run-rate savings from 2016, along with in-year savings from current year initiatives. The company stated that savings realized through first-half indicate that it is on track with its goals for 2017. These savings have considerably aided in countering inflation.With significant progress on two factors, the company is now keen on investing in growth by implementing strategies that will aid in strengthening Avon while driving profitable growth. After deliberate evaluation, the company is now focused on putting in key enablers in place. These enablers include delivering a competitive, seamless experience for Representatives; making sure the Representatives have the right product to sell; and ensuring it is expanding in the right geographies.With regard to investing in growth, management plans to invest nearly $350 million over the three-year period, including $150 million toward media and social selling; and $200 million for service model evolution and information technology. This is mainly aimed at bolstering the overall Representative experience.OutlookOn the back of second-quarter performance, the company now expects constant-dollar revenue growth for 2017 to be at the low-end of its previously provided guidance range of low-single digits growth. This expectation continues to be based on its previously stated Active Representatives growth of 0–1% in second-half 2017, along with solid innovation pipeline and the effects of the ongoing Transformation Plan. Additionally, the company had earlier projected modest currency tailwinds to aid top-line growth.Further, the company expects the aforementioned top-line growth and its ongoing cost savings initiatives to result in operating margin expansion. Moreover, the company now anticipates free cash flow to increase from its previous guidance of slightly positive free cash flow. This reflects a $20 million reduction capital expenditure from the previously planned $65 million increase.Zacks RankAvon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2156,EL,"Ulta Beauty, Inc. (ULTA  -  Free Report) looks good on the back of its splendid surprise history, robust marketing initiatives and solid e-Commerce as well as omni-channel focus. This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock boasts a VGM Score of “B”, with a long-term earnings growth rate of 20.4%, which also highlights its inherent potential. Let’s delve deep to find out more.Growth InitiativesBeing a leading beauty retailer, Ulta Beauty has created a niche market based on the products it offers. It features prestigious and discounted brands as well as offers salon products and services under one roof. Going forward, the company remains keen on enhancing beauty products offerings and improving store traffic with superior customer services.Notably, the company added 69 new brands and executed more than 500 prestige brand expansions across new and existing stores in fiscal 2016. In addition to its portfolio of prestige brands, the beauty retailer is on track with the roll out of The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) most popular MAC brand in its stores, and expanding it to about 100 stores by the end of fiscal 2017. Furthermore, management expects to enhance its services by offering the MAC makeup services at all its stores, where the brand is featured.Meanwhile, Ulta Beauty remains well on track backed by the expansion of its store base. While the company had been opening stores in suburban regions, given the advantage of lower rents and leaner competition, it is now ready to explore urban markets as evident from its recent plans to open about five stores in urban locations.It is to be noted that Ulta Beauty is known for its strategy of striking the right balance between online and physical stores. While the key players in the retail industry are struggling due to rising competition from online retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN  -  Free Report), Ulta Beauty has managed to grow both e-Commerce and in-store sales. Evidently, it registered whopping 70.9% growth in e-Commerce sales in first-quarter fiscal 2017, which also marked its highest ever quarterly growth since 2014.Sturdy PerformanceBacked by its robust strategies, Ulta Beauty has been delivering better-than-expected top-line and bottom-line results consistently for over three years.  In fact, the company maintained this robust trend in first-quarter fiscal 2017 as well, which marked its 14th straight quarter of earnings and sales beat.In the fiscal first quarter, results were driven by constant merchandise innovations and marketing initiatives, along with outstanding e-Commerce improvement and continued progress at the company’s salon operations. Consequently, management raised its comparable store sales and earnings outlook for fiscal 2017. Currently, the company envisions earnings per share growth to come in mid-twenties percentage band, up from low-twenties percentage range, guided earlier.Moreover, earnings for the fiscal second quarter are projected in the range of $1.72–$1.77 per share compared with $1.43 delivered in second-quarter fiscal 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate, which has been stable in the last 30 days, is currently pegged at $8.28 and $1.78 for fiscal 2017 and the fiscal second quarter, respectively.The company’s strategic initiatives and solid performance are well reflected in its share price movement. Shares of Ulta Beauty have inched up 1.5% year to date against the Zacks categorized Retail – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 10.5%.Ulta Beauty Vs IndustryBottom LineWhile the company’s limited global brand awareness, challenges related to cheaper alternatives and changing consumer preference remain major concerns, we believe Ulta Beauty can easily overcome these headwinds on the back of its robust growth strategies.Meanwhile, you may have a look at another top-ranked stock in the same industry that is Barnes & Noble, Inc. . Barnes & Noble has a long-term earnings growth rate of 10% and currently carries the same Zacks Rank as Ulta Beauty.

2157,EL,"Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (BUD  -  Free Report), alias AB InBev, is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 16.7%.In fact, AB InBev has reported negative surprises in the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 32.8%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior this announcement.What to Expect?Analysts polled by Zacks expect AB InBev to register a significant improvement in the top and bottom lines during the third quarter. With estimates showing an upward revision of 31 cents in the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.50. This exhibits a year-over-year increase of 81% against a decline of more than 10% witnessed in the preceding quarter.Total revenue is also anticipated to surge 39% to $15.4 billion, following an increase of 31.2% in the second quarter.Factors at PlayAB InBev is likely to benefit from its impressive brand portfolio, solid geographical reach and focus on business expansion. The company is well on track with SABMiller’s integration — which reinforced its presence in the brewing space — and realized synergies worth $335 million during second-quarter 2017.The company also remains focused on portfolio diversification to resonate with consumers’ evolving drinking patterns. Given the accelerated shift toward low and no-alcohol products, AB InBev keeps introducing near beer alternatives, along with no- and low-alcohol beers to provide more choices to consumers.AB InBev’s expansion in the craft beer space further highlights its practice of capitalizing on all the possible growth avenues. To make the most of this lucrative market, this Belgium-based brewer made numerous acquisitions to strengthen its position in the competitive craft beer space.While all is well with AB InBev, the company delivered its sixth consecutive negative earnings surprise in second-quarter 2017. This can be attributed to weakness in Brazil, negative impact of mark-to-market adjustment and increased finance costs. Nevertheless, with Brazilian economy on a path of recovery, it is likely to benefit the company going forward. However, analysts believe that total volume in the third quarter is likely to be impacted by hurricanes, which affected the two major beer states — Texas and Florida.Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that AB InBev is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

2158,EL,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 26. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this manufacturer and distributor of branded food products will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 3.1%.Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has been stable at 58 cents in the last 30 days. However, the estimate reflects a year-over-year growth of about 9% from the year-ago quarter.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $751 million, down more than 1% from the prior-year period.Markedly, Pinnacle Foods is part of the Consumer Staples sector. As of Oct 20 Earnings Preview, the Consumer Staples sector’s earnings as well as revenues are expected to grow 1.8% each.Factors Likely to Influence the QuarterPinnacle Foods has been gaining from its solid brand portfolio and robust strategic initiatives. The company has been also innovating products to offer variety and maintain market share. Additionally, the company’s expansion via acquisitions drives growth and remains impressive. The notable acquisitions include Boulder Brands and Duncan Hines.Meanwhile, Pinnacle Foods’ operational excellence program designed to generate annual productivity savings across the supply chain, remains encouraging. Productivity for 2017 is estimated to be at the top or marginally above its cost of products sold range of 3.5–4%. These productivity savings, along with higher pricing have been mitigating the impact of input cost inflation to drive gross margins.Additionally, in order to enhance gross margin, Pinnacle Foods is pursuing other initiatives including improving its product mix through product innovation and low-margin SKU rationalization, increasing the effectiveness of trade promotional spending, and realizing synergies from acquisitions.These initiatives are reflected in the company’s share price, which increased 4.8% year to date, as against the industry’s decline of 10.3%.Further, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter revenues of the Frozen, Grocery and Specialty Foods segments are currently pegged at $315 million, $259 million and $84 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year increase of about 2%, 3.8% and 5.8% for each segment, correspondingly.Also, volume for the Frozen and Grocery segments is likely to increase 0.04% and 0.01%, respectively, in the quarter. However, volumes are expected to decline 0.04% for the Specialty Foods segment. We note that Pinnacle Foods has been witnessing sluggish net sales and adjusted EBIT for its Specialty segment since four consecutive quarters now, despite solid growth in the Snacks business. Evidently, sales at the segment declined 15.1% in the previous quarter.Meanwhile, the company has witnessed sluggishness in its Pickle business due to continued competitive environment in the form of pricing and innovation. This, in turn has put pressure on the performance of Vlasic pickles. Though innovation and in-store support for the brand is expected to strengthen trends for the business in the second half of 2017, the turnaround might take some time.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.

2159,EL,"Fomento Economico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V. (FMX  -  Free Report) or FEMSA is slated to report third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, after the closing bell.The company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 19.4%. Therefore, the question lingering in investors’ minds now is, whether FEMSA will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.27, which has moved up by 6 cents in the last 30 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $6,359 million, representing growth of more than 18% from the year-ago quarter.Notably, FEMSA forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. As of Oct 20 Earnings Preview, the Consumer Staples sector’s earnings and revenues are expected to grow 1.8% each.Factors Likely to Impact the QuarterFEMSA has been grappling with soft margins for more than a year now. This can be attributed to strained margins at Coca-Cola FEMSA and growth of lower-margin businesses at FEMSA Comercio. Additionally, higher operating expenses at Coca-Cola FEMSA and FEMSA Comercio’s Health division weighed upon the company’s operating margin in the last reported quarter. Also, operating margin declined across all of the company’s segments in second-quarter 2017, barring FEMSA Comercio’s Retail division. In fact, margins were hurt by the consolidation of Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results in the Philippines as well.Further, FEMSA has been facing difficult times due to currency headwinds, which has been weighing on Coca-Cola FEMSA’s results for a while now. We believe the continuation of these trends will impact the future results.Consequently, FEMSA’s shares have lost 11.7% in the past three months, wider than the industry’s decline of 1.2%.While these factors pose concern about the company’s upcoming performance, we remain impressed with FEMSA’s focus on strategic measures. These measures include increasing store count, diversifying business portfolio and focusing on core business activities. Evidently, FEMSA has been taking prudent steps to diversify its product portfolio while expanding in the small-box retail segment, which bodes well for future operating performance.Moreover, the company’s focus on achieving growth via acquisitions bode well. Furthermore, its exposure in various industries including beverage, beer and retail, gives FEMSA an edge over competitors. In fact, the company’s strong cash flow generation capacity enables it to make incremental investments in business expansion.So, let’s see if FEMSA’s upcoming quarterly performance can help it break the dismal earnings surprise trend backed by its strategic endeavors.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not show that FEMSA is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

2160,EL,"Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB  -  Free Report) is slated to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 23, before the opening bell. The company’s earnings have missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters. In the preceding quarter, it missed the consensus mark by 0.7%. Therefore, the question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Kimberly-Clark will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the third quarter.Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Kimberly-Clark Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Kimberly-Clark Corporation QuoteFactors Likely to Impact the QuarterKimberly-Clark has been witnessing slower organic sales growth in developing and emerging markets for quite some time now. While performance improved in China, it softened in Latin America, particularly in Brazil and Argentina, due to lower volumes and highly competitive promotional activity.Though management expects modest improvement in the overall environment in developing and emerging markets in the second half of 2017, the current promotional environment is weakening the market dynamics.In 2017, management anticipates input costs to increase owing to modestly inflationary environment. Input cost inflation are expected to be higher in the range of $200-$300 million from its previous estimate of $150-$250 million. This uptick can be attributable to higher prices for several raw materials including pulp.Nevertheless, we note that the company’s higher cost savings, continued product innovation, strong international presence have been the catalysts that are expected to drive growth. For 2017, the company expects to generate cost savings in the range of $425 to $450 million from the FORCE program, up from the prior estimate of $400 million.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.54. Although the current-quarter estimate has moved down by a penny in the last seven days, it is couple of cents above from the prior-year quarter figure. The consensus estimate for revenue is currently pegged at $4,668 million for the to-be-reported quarter, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.6%.Expectations of an increase in both the top and bottom lines boost investor confidence about the stock’s performance in the quarter.Sales for Personal Care, Consumer Tissue and K-C Professional segments are projected to be $2,354 million, $1,490 million and $817 million, respectively. These estimates show a year-over-year increase of 1.8%, 1.2% and 1.9% for each segment, respectively.Further, we note that volumes are estimated to increase 0.03% for both the Personal Care and Consumer Tissue segments, and 0.02% for the K-C Professional segment.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively show that Kimberly-Clark is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

2161,EL,"Investors with a strong risk appetite usually target momentum stocks for attractive returns. In this context, Driehaus Strategy could be used, which Richard Driehaus formulated using the ""buy high and sell higher"" principle. The success of this investing strategy earned Driehaus a place in Barron’s All-Century Team. The American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) proved that the strategy has the potential to offer high returns. AAII’s portfolio, which was developed following the strategy, returned 13.5% and 18.1% in the five- and 10-year time frames, respectively, compared with -1.1% and 4.2% returns registered by the S&P 500. Thus investors with a high risk appetite may opt for this strategy to boost their portfolio returns.A Detailed Look into the Driehaus StrategyRegarding the strategy, Driehaus once said: “I would much rather invest in a stock that’s increasing in price and take the risk that it may begin to decline than invest in a stock that’s already in a decline and try to guess when it will turn around.” In line with this insight, AAII took into account the percentage 50-day moving average as one of the key criteria before creating a portfolio following Driehaus’ philosophy.It is calculated by dividing the numerator (month-end price minus 50-day moving average of month-end price) by the 50-day moving average of the month-end price. Another momentum indicator – positive relative strength – has also been included in this strategy. A positive percentage 50-day moving average indicates that the stock is trading at a price higher than its 50-day moving average level, indicating an uptrend.Moreover, AAII found that Driehaus primarily focuses on strong earnings growth rates and impressive earnings projections to pick potential outperformers. Companies with a strong history of beating estimates are also given importance in this strategy, which was made to provide better returns over the long term.Screening Parameters In order to make the strategy more profitable, we have considered only those stocks that have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A or B. Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.• Zacks Rank equal to #1(Only Strong Buy rated stocks can get through. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.)• Last 5-year average EPS growth rates above 2% (Strong EPS growth history ensures improving business)• Trailing 12 month EPS growth higher than 0 and industry median (Higher EPS growth compared to the industry average indicates superior stocks)• Last four-quarter average EPS surprise greater than 5% (Positive EPS surprise indicates potential)• Positive % 50-day moving average and relative strength over 4 weeks (High % 50-day moving average and relative strength signal uptrend)• Momentum Score equal to or less than B (Favorable momentum score indicates that it is ideal to take advantage of the momentum with the highest probability of success)These few parameters have narrowed down the universe of over 7,870 stocks to only 23.Here are five of the 23 stocks:CRA International, Inc.
