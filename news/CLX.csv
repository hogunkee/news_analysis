5,CLX,"U.S. stock indexes turned mixed in soft volume Wednesday, as the market awaited the Federal Reserve's minutes from the June 13-14 meeting. The focus is expected to be on any hint about the timing of a reduction in the Fed's bond portfolio.XThe Nasdaq rose 0.4%, the S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.1%. Small caps bled the most with the Russell 2000 off 0.7%. Volume was running lower across the board in the stock market today.Chip stocks chalked up good gains in the morning, interrupting at least for now a downtrend that began in early June among the semiconductor stocks. Chip stocks rising included Macom (MTSI), up 3%; Nvidia (NVDA), up 1.5%; Applied Material (AMAT), up 1%; and Microchip Technology (MCHP), up 0.5%. The four stocks are 10% to 15% off recent highs.Going into Wednesday's session, the chip sector was No. 4 of 33 sectors. While that's a good reading, it represented the first time the chip sector was not in the top three since March 1. In the second half of February, just before the chips moved into the top three, the bank sector held the top spot.Banks are now No. 9, up from No. 24 at the beginning of June. A handful of the money-center banks are near 52-week highs, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Citigroup (C), Bank of New York Mellon (BK) and Morgan Stanley (MS).JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley could be positioned for breakouts. JPMorgan rose 0.66 to 93.41, just under a 94.08 buy point. Morgan Stanley added 0.21 to 45.82, near a 46.08 buy point. Both are in second-stage bases.Many of the banks are forming or have recently formed bases. The stages are mostly first or second stage. As a stock rises, it pauses to consolidate. A breakout from a first- or second-stage consolidation is more likely to work than those from later-stage bases.Midday Wednesday, the defensive soap group held up well, as Clorox (CLX) aimed for a third consecutive up day. The stock is 5% off its high.The Redbook weekly gauge of same-store sales at chain stores, discounters and department stores rose 2.7% for the week ended July 1 vs. 2.2% in the prior week.Factory orders for May missed the Street's consensus estimate. The gauge for the dollar value of new orders for durable and nondurable goods fell 0.8% vs. views for a 0.5% drop.The Fed will release the minutes from the June 13-14 meeting. The Fed has signaled that it is ready to trim its bond portfolio, but it has not made clear when it will do so or how aggressively it will do so.RELATED:IBD/TIPP Economic Index Slips In JulyThese Stocks Expected To Benefit From 3-D Sensing Smartphones

6,CLX,"Shares of Kraft Heinz (KHC) fell nearly 2% Tuesday afternoon after the food giant ""amicably agreed to withdraw"" its $143 billion, $50-a-share proposal to merge with consumer goods conglomerate Unilever (UN), but deal buzz continued to support the two giants as well as other food and consumer product makers.""Unilever and Kraft Heinz hold each other in high regard,"" said the Sunday release. ""Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever.""The joint statement from Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB)-backed Kraft Heinz and Unilever spurred a 180-degree shift from Friday's market action, in which Kraft Heinz's stock spiked 10.7% on public confirmation of the bid. Friday's statement from Kraft Heinz had also indicated that it would continue to pursue the parent company of Dove and Vaseline, despite its initial rejection of the offer. Shares ended the day off 1.78 to 94.87.Unilever shares plunged nearly 8% to 45.09 on the stock market today after soaring 15.3% Friday. The company, which trades as both Unilever NV and Unilever PLC (UL) said last week that the proposal ""fundamentally undervalues"" the company and provides no financial or strategic merit for Unilever shareholders.The quick reversal in Kraft Heinz's intentions may stem from Warren Buffett's sentiment toward hostile takeovers. Berkshire Hathaway ""will join only with partners making friendly acquisitions,"" he said in his 2015 annual letter to shareholders. He acknowledged that some hostile bids are ""justified.""""We, though, will leave these 'opportunities' for others,"" he wrote. ""At Berkshire, we go only where we are welcome.""Berkshire Hathaway and 3G engineered the 2015 merger of Kraft and Heinz. Berkshire Class B shares were up fractionally.A Kraft Heinz-Unilever merger would have made for the second-largest food-and-drink company in the world, according to Bloomberg data, bringing together brands such as Oscar Mayer and Planters and Lipton and Hellmann's. The combination of Kraft and Heinz two years ago created the fifth largest.While Kraft and Unilever retreated Tuesday, they kept a good share of Monday's gains on speculation that industry consolidation could still happen.Other consumer goods heavyweights were on the move Tuesday as speculation circulated that Kraft Heinz might have another acquisition target in mind. Colgate Palmolive (CL) was up 1.2%. Clorox (CLX) ticked up 0.9%. Procter & Gamble (PG) edged 0.5%. Kimberly-Clark (KMB) inched up 1.2%.Colgate, Clorox and Kimberly-Clark posted big gains Friday on the initial Kraft-Unilever news. Dow component P&G inched up to a 2-year high Friday after surging earlier in the week on news that activist investor Trian Fund Management had taken a $3.5 billion stake.Meanwhile, Mondelez International (MDLZ) was up 4.9% as it announced an overhaul of its snack line, while General Mills (GIS) added 2.8%. Mondelez shares fell Friday after previously rallying on hopes of a Kraft takeover bid.

7,CLX,"Kraft Heinz (KHC) withdrew its $143 billion offer for Unilever (UN) on Sunday, citing the Anglo-Dutch consumer and food products giant's opposition. So which companies may Kraft target next?""Kraft Heinz's interest was made public at an extremely early stage,"" spokesman Michael Mullen said Sunday in an e-mailed statement. ""Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. It is best to step away early so both companies can focus on their own independent plans to generate value.""Unilever said Friday that the $50-a-share offer undervalued it, with management quietly concerned about Kraft Heinz's cost-cutting culture.Shares of Unilever rose 15.3% to 48.79 in Friday stock market trading. Kraft leapt 10.7% to 96.65. Both set record highs.Snacks giant Mondelez (MDLZ) fell 1.6%, paring earlier losses. Mondelez, maker of Oreos and other Nabisco products, rose 4.4% on Dec. 15 on Kraft buyout buzz.Meanwhile, Colgate Palmolive (CL) popped 4.3%, retaking its 200-day moving average. Clorox (CLX) popped 2.8% to a six-month high, while Kimberly-Clark (KMB) advanced 4.2% to its highest levels since late July. Colgate has a $64 billion market cap, Colgate $17 billion and Kimberly-Clark 47%.Procter & Gamble (PG), which has a $233 billion valuation, edged 0.3% higher on Friday, hitting a fresh two-year high. Procter & Gamble had gapped up 3.7% on Wednesday following the disclosure that activist investor Trian Fund Management snapped up a $3.5 billion stake in the Dow industrials component.It's unclear to what extent investors were snapping up consumer products stocks on takeover speculation, or speculation that industry consolidation generally would boost pricing power broadly.Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) and Brazil's 3G Capital own about 50% of Kraft Heinz stock. The duo paired up to buy Heinz in 2010 and then Kraft two years later.RELATED:Kraft Heinz's Unilever Bid Lifts Clorox, Colgate, Kimberly-Clark, P&GKraft Heinz To Pursue Unilever Despite Snub; Mondelez, General Mills Fall

Trian likely will press P&G to ramp up its cost-cutting and intensify its focus on core brands.Investors may see Colgate, Kimberly-Clark and other consumer product firms as possible takeover targets. Or they could be betting that a Kraft Heinz-Unilever combination would lead to a reduction in rival products, lifting industry pricing.Kraft Heinz, under the direction Brazilian hedge fund 3G, has been squeezing costs aggressively to boost profits even as sales decline.RELATED:Kraft Heinz To Pursue Unilever Despite Snub; Mondelez, General Mills Fall
"
9,CLX,"As Walt Disney (DIS) Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger's scheduled retirement date looms closer, the entertainment giant's search for his replacement remains low-profile, a departure from the open process it previously employed.It's been seven months since heir apparent Tom Staggs' abrupt departure left Iger without a clear-cut successor. The top executive recruiting firms say they haven't been hired by Disney, and Iger hasn't moved members of his executive team into newer or more prominent roles to audition them for the top spot. The company has said only that there is a process in place that the board is following, which will include evaluating internal and external candidates.While there's still time to conduct a search before Iger's contract ends in June 2018, the quiet nature of the current succession planning stands in sharp contrast to the widely watched, five-year bake-off from which Staggs emerged as the leading contender for the job. That's fueling speculation that the board could request that Iger, 65, stay on longer than his scheduled retirement date, something it has already asked of him twice before.""I don't think anyone — employee, investor or director — would be hesitant in granting him a new contract,"" said Anthony DiClemente, an analyst at Nomura Securities in New York. ""That could happen quickly and easily. Why hasn't it happened already? That's a fair question.""Iger said on a May conference call with investors that he didn't have any plans to stick around past the current date.""The board is very actively engaged in a succession process, as it has been actually for some time,"" he said. ""It believes that it has ample time to identify a successor under timing circumstances that will be just fine for the company.""A spokeswoman for Disney declined to comment further. Disney board members on the governance and nominating committee, including former Starbucks (SBUX) CEO Orin Smith, Twitter (TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey, Facebook (FB) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and former Clorox (CLX) Chairman Robert Matschullat, didn't respond or declined to comment.Typically it takes a big public company six to seven months to complete a search once the board begins to contact and interview prospective candidates, though additional time is required before that, said Peter Crist, chairman of Crist Kolder Associates, a boutique search firm outside Chicago. ""We do lots of mapping projects with the company that take months"" about the qualities it wants and needs in a new CEO, Crist said.At Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) executive recruiter Spencer Stuart began consulting with directors about what the company needed in a new leader and who they should consider about a year before Doug McMillon was named the retailer's CEO in November 2013, according to people familiar with the situation who asked not to be identified because they aren't authorized to talk publicly. The board narrowed its search to two internal candidates, McMillon and former head of U.S. operations Bill Simon, about six months before making its final decision.At Procter & Gamble (PG), directors first started talking about replacing then-CEO Bob MacDonald in July 2012 and then asked A.G. Lafley to return as CEO and chairman in May 2013. Lafley, who'd already served as CEO at P&G from 2000 until 2009, immediately reorganized the company into four businesses, each headed by a president who was considered a contender for the CEO post. One of the four, David Taylor, was named global president of home care and subsequently also took charge of P&G's beauty business.In July 2015, Lafley and P&G's other directors named Taylor the consumer giant's new CEO, concluding the two-year process.Iger himself was promoted in 2005 after a six-month search by the board. The executive, who had led Disney's TV operations and international business and had served as president for five years, was evaluated against external candidates with help from Heidrick & Struggles, directors said at the time. He got the top job only after a high-profile campaign by some shareholders to oust then-CEO Michael Eisner. Former directors in a long-running feud with the company still criticized Iger's selection as hasty, but the board said it had been thorough and careful.Until this year, it looked as if Disney's choice for Iger's successor would be more orderly, with a seasoned executive waiting in the wings in the COO position. Staggs had risen to the No. 2 spot at the company after a five-year period in which he and another senior manager, Jay Rasulo, competed with each other to become Iger's successor. The two even switched jobs to give Staggs more experience operating a business and Rasulo exposure to the executive suite. Rasulo, then serving as chief financial officer, left the company last year after Staggs' promotion to COO.Staggs' exit, after failing to gain the full backing of Iger and the board, left no other internal candidate with both operational experience and a corporate role.Of the six CEOs since Disney's founding in 1923, only Eisner came from the outside. Eisner, who served from 1984 to 2005, joined the company from Paramount Pictures, where he was president.While the board contemplates who will lead the company after June 2018, Iger remains active in planning how to shape Disney's future. In recent weeks, he considered buying Twitter, but decided to pass, partly because of price and partly because of concern about bullying on the social-media site, people familiar with the matter said last month.At an October event in Boston, Iger said it wasn't enough for the company to own key brands like ABC, ESPN and Pixar. Disney needs to have a direct connection to consumers through mobile devices, he said.""What we're thinking about a lot is what role does technology have in distributing from us to the consumer?"" he said. ""How must we invest in that?""In its search for Iger's replacement, Disney's board should be casting a wide net, looking for candidates inside and outside the company, particularly ones with high-tech chops, said Paul Winum, a senior partner at the management consulting firm RHR International and co-author of ""Inside CEO Succession.""""The landscape is changing so rapidly, technology is opening up new distribution platforms, overseas markets will be  huge opportunities,"" he said. ""The leadership skills have changed dramatically just in the last two years.""When a CEO succession plan unravels, as it did at Disney, the company usually starts thinking about the next, younger generation of executives inside, giving them bigger and different kinds of experience to prepare them for the top job, said Joseph L. Bower, a Harvard Business School professor who has studied succession planning. Disney hasn't made any major changes recently to suggest it's grooming anyone internally, however.""Disney isn't in trouble and currently has a strong CEO in place,"" Bower said. ""But you don't want someone to come in at the last minute to take over.""

10,CLX,"Stacey Smith and her husband looked at about three dozen homes in the San Francisco Bay Area and lost a bidding war before finally purchasing a four-bedroom house in June for $1.5 million — 40% more than the asking price.Their search wasn't in Silicon Valley or San Francisco. It was just across the bay in Oakland, which has supplanted its pricier and better-known neighbors to become the region's most heated real estate market.""Something we had to wrap our head around really quickly was the fact that we were automatically going to bid at least 30% over asking,"" said Smith, a 50-year-old strategy consultant who moved from San Francisco in search of more space for her family's three kids. ""It's the new normal.""Oakland's housing market is still soaring, even as growth cools in San Francisco, where million-dollar median home prices have left buyers searching for more-affordable alternatives. The East Bay city had California's highest annual appreciation of home values and the biggest rent growth of the 50 largest U.S. cities as of June, according to data compiled by Zillow.Despite persistently high crime rates and political turmoil, Oakland is attracting residents for its relative affordability, vibrant cultural scene, diverse population and urban environment within commuting distance to San Francisco. Companies such as Uber Technologies are moving in — helping to fuel a 43% jump in office rents in two years — while big investors including Blackstone Group (BX) and Boston Properties (BXP) are putting money into residential projects in the city.""Oakland is the hottest residential real estate market in the Bay Area,"" said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It's still expensive, but it's more affordable"" than San Francisco.Oakland home values soared 16% in June from a year earlier to a median $616,300, the biggest gain of California's major cities, according to Zillow. The median monthly rent jumped 15%, the most in the U.S., to $2,846 in the same period. That was almost triple the 5.5% growth in San Francisco, and more than five times the nationwide increase.Houses are selling fast — and far above list prices. The average home in Oakland sold for 17% more than asking in the second quarter, according to data from Paragon Real Estate Group measuring properties that didn't go through a price reduction first. That compared with 9% for San Francisco and 5% in Silicon Valley's Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Oakland homes were on the market an average of 20 days, fewer than the 34 days in San Francisco.""Most markets would be pleased if they averaged asking price, or 1% or 2% over asking price,"" said Patrick Carlisle, chief market analyst at Paragon. ""To see things averaging 9% to 17% over asking price is virtually unheard of. It's the highest I've ever seen.""The median home price in Oakland has soared 178% since 2011, almost double the gain in San Francisco, Paragon data show.Oakland is still struggling with a reputation for social and political unrest. Its police department is operating without a chief after three departed, one after another, in the span of about a week in June amid a sex scandal involving officers and a teenage prostitute. It's also an epicenter of social protests, including those connected to the Black Lives Matter and Occupy Wall Street movements.The troubles aren't deterring newcomers, city officials say.""It's not slowing growth in the way that it used to five or 10 years ago,"" said Marisa Raya, an economic analyst in Oakland's office of economic and workforce development. ""But we are certainly seeing a lot of political activism around the superfast rent growth.""Oakland voters will consider ballot measures in November to strengthen rent control and issue bonds for affordable housing.Blackstone has teamed with CityView, a property company started by former U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, to build a 423-unit apartment complex in Oakland. The $175 million project at 3093 Broadway, due to be finished in 2018, is the first development in the city for the world's largest alternative-asset manager.Jon Gray, Blackstone's billionaire head of real estate, said he thinks Oakland may become the next Brooklyn — a comparison that has frequently been evoked in recent years as the city comes into its own as a hot spot after previously being overshadowed by its glitzier neighbor.""We very rarely do ground-up development, so this project reflects our strong confidence in the transformation under way in Oakland,"" Gray said in an e-mail.Boston Properties, the largest publicly traded U.S. office owner, signed a letter of intent to invest in a 25-story residential development in Oakland's Temescal neighborhood, Chief Executive Officer Owen Thomas said on a July 27 earnings conference call.""Given the high cost of multifamily product in the San Francisco market, we believe we can deliver high-quality units that are approximately at a 20% discount to San Francisco rents in a location that is a 16-minute transit ride from the Embarcadero BART Station in downtown San Francisco,"" he said on the call. Arista Joyner, a spokeswoman for the company, declined to comment further.Oakland's job growth also is showing signs of outpacing its neighbor, with listings up 16% since April, compared with a 1% decline in San Francisco, according to LinkUp, a job-search engine based in Minneapolis. Among the companies setting up shop is San Francisco-based Uber, which last year bought the old Sears (SHLD) building in Oakland's urban core and is renovating it, with plans to open in late 2017.The city is home to consumer-products maker Clorox (CLX); Kaiser Permanente, a nonprofit health insurer and hospital chain; and internet-radio service Pandora Media (P).The rate for top-quality office space in the city has grown 43% in the second quarter compared with two years earlier, while San Francisco's rent is up 20% in that time, according to data from real estate brokerage CBRE Group (CBG).The influx of companies is helping to prop up housing prices. Even as the technology industry slows, there are still ""many, many buyers"" in Oakland, said Carla Buffington, a real estate broker at Pacific Union in the city.""We're seeing a majority of properties selling with multiple offers,"" Buffington said. ""Almost weekly, I am shocked by the price that a certain property will get.""RELATED:America's Hottest Housing Markets Are Mainly Out WestSkyrocketing Rents Are Sputtering — But Mostly In High End MarketsSan Francisco's Commercial-Property Frenzy Showing Signs Of Slowing

11,CLX,"Amazon.com (AMZN) on Tuesday said it added more than 50 more brands to its lineup of wireless Dash Buttons, and it said the frequency of Dash orders rose 70% in the past three months.Amazon said Prime members are increasingly using Dash Button to order everyday essentials and that order frequency doubled in the past three months among Prime member who use the service.Research firm Slice Intelligence, however, recently released a study showing that fewer than half the people who have ordered Dash Buttons have actually made an order via the device.Amazon launched the Wi-Fi connected, thumbnail-sized Dash Button in 2015, with 29 brands. There is a separate button for each product. Amazon says it now has more than 150 buttons, across dozens of retail categories from household goods and toys to guitar strings. Brands include Proctor & Gamble (PG), Kimberly-Clark (KMB) and Clorox (CLX). Products include Maxwell House coffee, Tide detergent, Gatorade and Gerber baby food.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99, but they're essentially free, since users get a $4.99 credit on their first order. The press of a Dash Button leads to an automatic reorder at Amazon, with free shipping for Prime customers.Amazon stock closed up 2.4% at 707.95 in the stock market today. Amazon appears to have found support at its 50-day moving average for the first time since breaking out April 29 on a favorable Q1 earnings report.

The Procter & Gamble (PG) product has accounted for 21% of button orders, followed by Bounty paper towels (18%), also from P&G. Cottonelle toilet paper from Kimberly-Clark (KMB) came in third with 17%, followed by Glad plastic bags (12%) from Glad Products, which is majority owned by Clorox (CLX).The top Dash Button for consumer spending is Gatorade, owned by PepsiCo (PEP). The average shopper has spent $120 on Gatorade since they purchased a Gatorade Dash Button.Other top Dash Buttons for average consumer purchases include Smartwater ($82.52), Bounty ($74.37), Cottonelle ($61.95), Tide ($58.13) and Charmin ($52.11)Slice Intelligence, an e-commerce analytics firm, based its study on data generated from its panel of over 4 million online consumers between March 31, 2015, and June 18, 2016.E-commerce leader Amazon now sells over 100 Dash Buttons for everyday household items, from coffee and snacks to condoms and feminine care products.Dash Buttons are available to Prime members for $4.99 each, and they're essentially free because members get a $4.99 credit to their Amazon account with their first order using the button.When customers are running low on an item, they can simply press a Dash Button to automatically reorder the item and have it delivered with free Prime shipping.Amazon stock fell 1.1%, to 691.36, in the stock market today, on another Brexit beatdown day for stocks.

18,CLX,"When the stock markets are as rattled as they have been lately, there’s a certain comfort in putting your money into companies with consumer-friendly products, iconic brand names and steady dividend payments.Clorox (CLX) is a case in point. The maker of cleaning and household products set a record stock high in December and continues to show resilience even as the broader markets falter.It’s easy to overplay the “defensive” nature of defensive stocks -- those that investors gravitate toward in down markets or rocky economies. But in the case of Clorox, “it’s not overplayed at all,” said Linda Bolton Weiser, analyst at B. Riley & Co.“They produce very strong free cash flow, their dividends are bulletproof, and their earnings don’t vary significantly in a recession,"" she said.Clorox is one of four “true” consumer staple stocks in her coverage universe. The others are Proctor & Gamble (PG), Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB). Clorox is the least risky of the four, partly because it has much less exposure to markets outside the U.S., Weiser says.Clorox gets less than 20% of its sales from its international segment, in contrast to 80% for Colgate-Palmolive, 60% for P&G and 53% for Kimberly-Clark.“Clorox has a relatively small international exposure, so you’re not getting as much currency risk as you are from the other companies,” Weiser said. At the same time, she says, Clorox has gotten a boost from falling prices of commodities used to make, package and distribute its products. They include resin, cardboard and soybean oil.“They’re benefiting from commodity tailwinds and are not as badly hurt by unfavorable currency exchange rates,” Weiser said. “They’re really in a sweet spot right now.”Clorox’s share price reflects that sweet spot. The stock hit a high of 131.78 on Dec. 17, currently trades near 132 and has risen more than 15% over the last year.How much higher can it push? Probably not much, analysts say.“While we believe Clorox is one of the best managed companies under our coverage, we believe the stock is already trading at fair value,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi noted in a report.Weiser has a similar take.“Everything that is going well for Clorox is fully reflected in its stock price. It’s a very expensive stock right now,” she said.Clorox has delivered steady if unspectacular growth through the years. It hasn’t grown quarterly sales more than 4% since the December 2012 quarter. With few exceptions, its earnings growth rarely ventures into double digits.But the company does produce solid profits and more often than not ekes out annual sales gains. Much of the credit goes to the strong brand recognition of its products, including its namesake cleaning products as well as Glad wraps and trash bags, Liquid Plumr drain cleaner, Kingsford charcoal briquets, Pine-Sol cleaners, Hidden Valley salad dressings, KC Masterpiece barbecue sauces, Brita water filters and Burt’s Bees personal care products.Clorox operates in four segments: cleaning, household, lifestyle and international. It mainly sells its products to supermarkets and grocery stores. Discount chain Wal-Mart (WMT) is its biggest client, accounting for about 26% of sales.The cleaning and household segments -- encompassing everything from its iconic laundry bleach to garbage bags -- each contributed 32% of overall revenue during fiscal year 2015, which ended in June. The lifestyle segment, including salad dressings and lip treatments, contributed 17%. The international segment pitched in 19%.Clorox’s performance during this year’s first fiscal quarter was one of its best in years. It posted earnings of $1.32 a share, up 20% from the prior year and well ahead of consensus estimates for $1.18. Revenue climbed 3% to $1.39 billion, slightly above views.On Nov. 17, Clorox’s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of 77 cents a share, payable Feb. 12 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on Jan. 27. The company benefited from price increases and higher volumes during the first quarter, which helped offset currency headwinds.The overall volume of products sold increased 3% from the prior year. Gross margin climbed 220 basis points to 45% from 42.8% a year earlier, thanks mainly to cost savings, higher sales and favorable commodity costs.“Clorox’s volumes have now been positive for five straight quarters, and the company’s focus on investing additional gross margin savings into (advertising and promotions) should keep this metric in the black for the foreseeable future,” Modi noted.Revenue in Clorox’s cleaning segment rose 5% during the quarter, driven by a strong performance from home care brands such as Clorox disinfecting wipes. The household segment posted 5% revenue growth, while the lifestyle segment logged a 7% gain.The international segment reported an 8% revenue decline because of unfavorable exchange rates. On a currency-neutral basis, international revenue rose 5%.To help deal with challenges in foreign markets, Clorox has adopted a “go lean” strategy that includes cutting costs and reducing infrastructure.“Strong execution of our go-lean strategy in international is particularly important as we look ahead to the balance of the fiscal year,” Clorox spokesman Steven Austenfeld said on a conference call with analysts. “(We recognize) the possibility that foreign currency headwinds may worsen, which would put additional pressure on profitability in our international business.”Clorox is scheduled to report fiscal second-quarter results before the open on Feb. 4. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect earnings of $1.05 a share, up from 97 cents the previous year. Revenue should remain about flat at $1.35 billion.

21,CLX,"If the market launches a new uptrend that works, defensive stocks are likely to give way to stocks that tilt toward growth.With that thought, let's look at the dividend stocks that offer growth potential.We sifted IBD's Dividend Leaders screen, culling for the best earnings growth expected in 2016. (Not all those stocks appear on the table in the paper.) We considered only stocks with upward earnings revisions. The top five:Brinker International (EAT): The Street expects the owner of Chili's Grill & Bar and Maggiano's Little Italy restaurants to boost earnings 16% in the fiscal year ending in June. Pretax margin hit at least a nine-year high in fiscal 2015.On Feb. 2, Brinker declared an increase in the quarterly dividend from 28 cents a share to 32 cents. The annualized yield is 2.6%.Campbell Soup (CPB): Recently the soup maker has been acting more like a growth stock than a dividend stock. Analysts expect earnings to jump 14% the fiscal year ending in July, which would be the best annual growth since 1999.Campbell hasn't raised the dividend since 2013. The quarterly payout is 31.2 cents a share for an annualized yield of 2.1%.Air Products & Chemicals (APD): The Street is pegging earnings growth at 13% for the year ending in September. In 2015, Air Products raised its dividend for the 33rd year in a row. Look for another increase to be declared sometime in March. The  yield is 2.5%.Dunkin' Brands (DNKN): Analysts see earnings growth at 13% this year. That's up from 11% last year but below the three-year growth rate of 15%.  Dunkin' declared a dividend increase early this month. The quarterly payout was raised from 26.5 cents a share to 30 cents. The yield is 2.8%.CME Group (CME): EPS are expected to rise 13% this year. The company recently raised the quarterly dividend from 50 cents a share to 60 cents. The yield is 2.6%.Honorable mention: Hasbro (HAS) 12% EPS growth; Hormel Foods (HRL), 11%; and Clorox (CLX), 10%.

47,CLX,"When economic times are good, conservative investors sometimes stretch for yield.In good times, it's hard to imagine anything going wrong, so why not pick up a bigger dividend?The problem is that stretching can change a portfolio from low risk to high risk in a hurry. It's like a modified 1911 Little Willie verse:Willie's yields were dynamite,

48,CLX,"Didn't understand it, quite.
"
49,CLX,"They heard the blast in the Serengeti,
"
50,CLX,"Willie's portfolio is now confetti.In bad times, risks sometimes come into play. Earnings shrink, making payouts questionable. If earnings shrink enough, then dividend increases end. If earnings worsen further, the dividend is cut. And if things really head south, the dividend is eliminated.Of course, an investor can always sell before trouble emerges. However, that's easier said than done. By the time a sell rule applies, much of the paper gains will have vanished. Timing a bad investment is more difficult than timing a good investment.A good investment doesn't require perfect execution in order to make money. A longer climb gives the investor more opportunities to leave with a gain.Stocks with only a high yield going for them aren't necessarily guaranteed to rise, which means that investors will have to play them that much better. So dividend investors will sleep more soundly if they don't focus too much on yield.What, then, should they focus on?A stock's liquidity, dividend growth rate and dividend stability are worth considering. Such an approach isn't absolutely safe (what is?), but it decreases the odds of getting burned badly.The screen above, run on Sept. 1, shows liquid stocks with good dividend growth rates and dividend stability ratings. IBD's daily Income Investor column has recently covered some of them.Another way to keep a conservative bent on a portfolio is to buy stocks in the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrat list. These are stocks that have increased their dividend payouts for 25 consecutive years.The Aristocrats list is well-balanced. Its 52 constituents represent ten sectors. (Sometimes chasers of high yields end up invested in only a few sectors, which increases risk. Normal sector rotation can create havoc for such investors.)As of Aug. 31, sector exposure in the Dividend Aristocrats broke down like this: consumer staples, 25% (results are rounded); industrials, 15%; health care, 13%; financials, 13%; materials, 12%; consumer discretionary, 12%; energy, 4%; utilities, 2%; telecom, 2%; and information technology, 2%.The Aristocrats list includes stocks such as food distributor Sysco (SYY), utility Consolidated Edison (ED), home improvement store Lowe's (LOW), steel producer Nucor (NUE) and cleaning products firm Clorox (CLX).

94,CLX,"If you think managing innovation crushes freethinking, think again. The opposite is true: The more you facilitate and streamline creativity, the faster good ideas can make it to market and earn cash.So says innovation expert Steve Uban, the chairman of the Standards Committee at the Product Development and Management Association. That trade group feels so strongly about innovative discipline that it has launched a standard to measure how effectively firms capitalize on their genius.""Some people think innovation standard is sort of an oxymoron: You're not supposed to manage innovation; it's supposed to be free-flowing,"" Uban told IBD.""But we can show, through the research that we do, that when you manage product and service innovation, you get better results.""How much better? ""You get a 90% better return on your investment if you use best practice tools,"" he estimated.The PDMA's International Innovation Management Standard provides benchmarks that executives can use to increase idea flow and product development at any firm. The standard, a result of the group's research into product development by heavyweights such as Harley-Davidson (HOG), DuPont (DD) and Clorox (CLX), is designed to help firms figure out the elements of high-impact innovation.Executives and innovative teams can measure themselves against the standard through a self-assessment or an audit from the PDMA.Adopt these characteristics to capitalize on ingenuity at your firm:• Inventive outlook. At crackerjack-thinking workplaces, ideas come naturally. But there's a strategy to it, Uban explains, and it's not just about buying trendy couches or glow-in-the-dark whiteboards.Think about how chiefs respond to bold thinking or react to flops, the occasional byproduct of sizzling brainstorms.• Patience. ""If risk taking and making mistakes are treated harshly in a company, no matter what you do, you are going to have a cloud over the innovation process,"" Uban noted. ""That will restrict how innovative (employees) are.""• Increased idea volume. The most brilliant firms are constantly brewing their next best-seller. ""How fully loaded is your innovation pipeline?"" Uban asks.You should be stabbing at industry upheavals, he adds, along with tweaking today's top-selling items.• Crunch. You can boost innovation by giving workers the gift of time, Uban teaches, to let their minds wander and scan trends in other industries — to sketch, test and stretch. ""You need to have long-range innovation along with short-term projects,"" he said. ""It's like a balanced portfolio.""• Creative connection. To develop good ideas, every department should embrace innovation.Consider hatching new goals to reward all employees for shepherding strong concepts. You can also retool your budget to reimburse divisions for the time they spend on innovation, Uban says.• Calculated criticism. Give leaders plenty of chances to question and probe potential breakthroughs. But think strategically about when to identify holes in an idea.""You don't want leadership coming in at the end of a project and saying, 'No, this isn't right,'"" Uban explained. ""If they want input, they need to do that at the beginning, before the team gets started.""• Mix and hatch. ""One of the secrets I have found works is this cross-pollination of knowledge between design, engineering and marketing,"" said Robert Hale, PDMA's chairman. ""The OCI (outstanding corporate innovator) award winners always talk about how they cross-pollinate.""

124,CLX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 8.7% in that time frame.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CLX due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Clorox Q3 Earnings Beats Estimates, Trims '18 EPS ViewClorox posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Earnings and revenues also improved on a year-over-year basis. This marks the company’s sixth straight quarter of earnings beat, with sales returning to positive after a miss in the previous quarter.Q3 HighlightsQuarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.37 per share were up 5% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. The bottom line primarily gained from higher sales and lower effective tax rate, offset by contraction in gross margin.Net sales of $1,517 million advanced nearly 2.7% year over year and marginally came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,511 million. Top-line growth can be attributed to improvement across all the company’s segments as well as 2020 Strategy, which focuses on boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. Also, volume growth of 3% in the quarter along with higher prices aided the increase in revenues. The uptick was somewhat compensated with adverse mix and negative impact from the sale of the Aplicare business.Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin, which contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 42.8% in the quarter. Lower margins can be attributed to elevated commodity and logistics expenses, which were partly mitigated with gains from cost savings and higher prices.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 3% to $513 million, mainly driven by gains in Home Care, showing strength in Clorox disinfecting wipes along with the launch of Scentiva branded products. This was partly offset by fall in Professional Products business, particularly due to the sale of Aplicare business in August 2017.Household sales inched up 1% to $493 million backed by double-digit gains in the Cat Litter business owing to broad-based business strength. This was partly offset with lower shipments in Charcoal owing to unfavorable weather throughout the quarter.Sales at the Lifestyle segment improved 2% to $252 million driven by all-time record shipments of Hidden Valley bottled dressings and gains in the Natural Personal Care business. The upside was negated by lower shipments in Water Filtration due to a timing shift in the merchandising activity.At the International business segment, sales grew 4% to $259 million backed by improved pricing and increased volumes in Canada. However, these factors were offset by adverse mix and foreign currency exchange rates.FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,174 million, and long-term debt of $1,789 million. In the nine months of fiscal 2018, the company generated $574 million of net cash from continuing operations.2018 GuidanceClorox updated its guidance for fiscal 2018 to include the effects from the acquisition of Nutranext and revised tax rate.The company now projects sales growth of nearly 3% compared with the earlier guided range of 1-3%. The guidance includes contribution of 1 point from the Nutranext acquisition and an estimated 3 points gain from product innovation. Also, it includes nearly 1 point reduction in the fiscal year related to the Aplicare divestiture.Gross margin is now estimated to decline in the range of 100-150 bps due to estimated impacts from one-time charges with respect to the Nutranext acquisition. Also, it reflects higher logistics and commodity expenses.For fiscal 2018, the company envisions effective tax rate of 22-23% compared with 23-24% guided earlier.Consequently, management now anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.15-$6.30 per share, down from the previous guidance of $6.17-$6.37 per share.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been five revisions lower for the current quarter.The Clorox Company Price and Consensus The Clorox Company Price and Consensus | The Clorox Company QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, CLX has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for value, growth and momentum investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, CLX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

125,CLX,"Benchmarks finished mostly in the red on Thursday as investors switched from equities to bonds after Treasury bond yields continued to hover near their best levels since April 2014. Additionally, weak earnings results from United Parcel Service weighed on the broader S&P 500. Further, the tech-heavy index, Nasdaq fell ahead of major tech earnings. However, rising rate hike prospects pushed financial blue-chips like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan upward, which in turn boosted the Dow.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.1%, to close at 26,186.71. However, the S&P 500 fell 0.1% to close at 2,821.98. The tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,385.86, losing 0.4%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 1.6% to close at 13.75. A total of around 7.80 billion shares were traded on Thursday, higher than the last 20-session average of 7.23 billion shares. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.24 -to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.01-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.What Moved the Benchmarks?In its two-day policy statement following the meeting ended Jan 31, the Fed indicated that the labor market remained strong, while inflation will likely “move up” in 2018 and will reach the desired 2% rate in the “medium term.” The central bank also said federal funds rate is likely to increase at a “gradual” pace in coming months.Tighter labor market and prospects of rise in inflation raised rate hike prospects as early as Fed’s next policy meeting in March, which in turn weighed on investor sentiment. Higher rate environment and optimism of steady economic growth and higher inflation weighed on bond prices.Lower bond prices supported the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield, which increased from 2.722% on Wednesday to 2.773% on Thursday, its best levels since April 2014. Also, 30-year U.S. Treasury yield surged more than 3% for the first time since May 2017.

The decrease was in contrast to previous quarter’s increase of 2.7%.Moreover, the ISM manufacturing index declined from 59.3% in December to 59.1% in January. But the index remained at its best level since June 2004. Reading above 50 indicates expansion in the activity.

127,CLX,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release fourth-quarter 2017 results on Jan 24, after the closing bell. Last quarter, the company reported a negative earnings surprise of 1.8%.In fact, Whirlpool has missed estimates in the last four quarters, with an average negative earnings surprise of 4.8%. Notably, third-quarter 2017 marked the company’s fifth straight quarter of negative earnings surprise and second consecutive quarter of sales lag. The primary concern for the company in recent quarters has been raw material cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $4.01, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 7.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.8 billion, up 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Whirlpool Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteMoreover, we note that the stock has declined 13.6% in the last six months. However, this compares better than the industry’s 26.1% downside.Factors at PlayWhirlpool’s aforementioned dismal surprise trend has been a concern for investors. The company is clearly grappling with adverse product price/mix and raw material cost inflation has been denting the  operating margin for the last few quarters. Moreover, the company anticipates higher raw material prices to persist through 2018. This has resulted in a lowered earnings view for 2017.The company now envisions adjusted earnings per share for 2017 in a range of $13.60-$13.90 compared with $14.50-$15.00, guided earlier. On a GAAP basis, Whirlpool anticipates earnings in a range of $11.10-$11.40 per share compared with the previous estimate of $12.40-$12.90 for 2017.Further, we believe that volatility in commodity prices, particularly steel, may adversely affect the company’s operating performance. Additionally, Whirlpool derives a significant portion of revenues from international operations, which exposes it to risks in global market. Whirlpool’s customer concentration is also high which is likely to hurt the margins.However, Whirlpool’s robust product pipeline, solid innovations and cost productivity initiatives keep it on track to deliver long-term goals. It aims to deliver organic revenue growth of 3-5% every year through 2020. Further, it anticipates growth efforts to boost consumer demand and lead to enhanced price mix, which encouraged management to target EBIT margin to exceed 10% by 2020.Moreover, Whirlpool has been riding on innovation strategy that helps it to tap additional sales and gain market share. Further, the company is striving to improve margins through a series of measures including cost-based price increments and cost-reduction initiatives focused on enriching business efficiency.That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can turnaround the aforementioned near-term challenges.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Whirlpool has an Earnings ESP of +2.99% as the Most Accurate estimate of $4.13 is pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.01 per share. However, the company’s Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) lowers the chances of a beat in the ensuing release. We caution against stocks with Zacks Rank #4 and 5 (Strong Sell).Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Tractor Supply Company (TSCO  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.53% and a Zacks Rank #2.

128,CLX,"The Consumer Staples sector, which is considered to be defensive even in the times of economic disruptions, has been benefiting from the uptick in the U.S. economy. The sector looks well placed buoyed by rising consumer confidence, modest consumer spending and accelerating labor market. Also, the sector has a Zacks Sector Rank of #5 (out of 16).Despite the prospering Consumer Staples sector, Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM  -  Free Report) is one stock that has been losing luster due to its dismal surprise history. The company’s sales lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate for more than three years now, alongside delivering negative earnings surprise in eight of the last 10 quarters. As a result, the stock has declined 6.5% in a year’s time against the sector’s 14.7% growth.What’s Troubling Archer Daniels?Archer Daniels is experiencing the jolts of the tough operating environment in the Agricultural industry owing to fluctuating commodity prices and oversupply. This, in turn, has been largely weighing upon the company’s top and bottom lines while keeping margins strained. In third-quarter 2017, top line declined across all of the company’s segments while strained margins at the Agricultural Services and Oilseeds Processing segments hurt the bottom line.Agricultural Services segment was hurt by soft merchandising and handling results for North America Grain due to lack of competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans in global markets. Further, lower crushing margins as well as lower South American origination margins resulted in reduced margins at the Oilseeds Processing segment.Consumer Staples Space Still Has Some Solid PicksThough Archer Daniels looks troubled, the Consumer Staples sector still has stocks that are doing well and promise solid growth in the future. Here, we have handpicked stocks that carry Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.3 Solid BetsThe Estee Lauder Companies Inc.

By its actions, the company is poised to boost growth for its categories as well as overall market share. This has helped the company put up an impressive record of earnings and sales surprises.Notably, this consumer products behemoth has gained 8.1% in the past three months, against the industry’s decline of 4.5%. So, let’s take a closer view of the factors that have spurred investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its spectacular show on.Focus on 2020 StrategyClorox is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of e-commerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight. The strategy aims at achieving certain long-term goals, including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing EBIT margin by 25-50 basis points (bps) and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.Brand Management, Go Lean StrategyClorox's diversified brand portfolio positions it well ahead of peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain it in the currently challenging environment.

We believe these strategies will aid the company in catering to near-term challenges.Keeps with Current Trends – E-commerce in FocusIn response to the changing retail environment, Clorox is keen on making strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities not only in the physical world but also online. Consequently, the company has bolstered digital capabilities in the last few years leading to a strong performance in e-commerce, which now represents 4% of total sales. Moreover, the company recorded nearly 40% annual growth in e-commerce sales in the last two fiscal years. Looking ahead, the company is ahead of track and nearing its 2020 target of $500 million from e-commerce sales.Clorox’s Strategies Aid Quarterly PerformanceClorox’s actions and strategic initiatives have gone a long way in aiding the company’s earnings and sales scores. The company has a marked record of delivering positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, while sales has topped estimates in the preceding two quarters. The company’s last reported first-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings gained from solid sales and gross margin expansion, while sales was driven by growth across the United Sates and International businesses, alongside rise in volumes.Growth at the International business was particularly backed by increased pricing, offset by unfavorable mix. Additionally, the company’s efficient cost-saving initiatives and improved International pricing aided gross margin growth. Going forward, the company remains confident of the continued strength in underlying business performance.Uptrend in EstimatesClorox’s robust past performances and a favorable view on its business has led to an uptrend in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the last 30 days.

130,CLX,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc.’s (CHD  -  Free Report) stock has been moving up the charts, thanks to its focus on innovations which have also helped the company to put up an impressive past record. Well, this consumer products behemoth has gained 6.8% in the past three months, as against the industry’s dip of 0.3%. So, let’s take a closer view of the factors that have spurred investors’ confidence in this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock, which is most likely to keep its spectacular show on.Focus on Innovations, Solid Brand PortfolioThis developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of household, personal care and specialty products has a diversified portfolio with 11 power brands, including ARM & HAMMER, Trojan, OxiClean, Spinbrush, First Response, Nair, Orajel, Xtra, VMS, Water Pik and Batiste. The company’s regular innovation helps in improving brand positions and market share in the consumer categories. Thus, management remains committed toward innovations in particular, as it believes that remains the biggest driver for its top and bottom-line growth in future.Robust Acquisitions Bolster GrowthChurch & Dwight, which started with only one brand (ARM & HAMMER) has acquired a number of superior brands with high margin over time. These asset-light businesses boosted the company’s revenues from $1.5 billion in 2004 to $3.5 billion in 2016. Progressing on these lines, Church & Dwight concluded the buyout of Waterpik in the third quarter of 2017 and is on track with its integration. The company's other recent acquisitions include Agro BioSciences in May and VIVISCAL business in January 2017. Prior to that, the acquisitions of ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands from Johnson & Johnson in December 2016 provided impetus to the company’s international business. Talking of international, let’s analyse the company’s Consumer International segment that remains its major growth driver.Consumer International Segment: A Major DriverChurch & Dwight’s Consumer International business has been doing exceptionally well. Evidently, consistent strength at this segment has been driving the company’s overall organic sales growth for more than a year now. In the third quarter, organic sales in the consumer international segment jumped 6.2% thanks to higher volumes. Also, overall consumer international sales surged 21.7% on the back of extensive sales of household and personal care items. Incidentally, sales at this segment received considerable impetus from FEMFRESH, OXICLEAN and STERIMAR in the export business, STERIMAR and ARM & HAMMER baking soda in Mexico, FEMFRESH in Australia as well as ARM & HAMMER cat litter and BATISTE in Canada. Further, the company is opening new offices to support increase in export business, and it continues to invest in the consumer international business to sustain its strong sales growth.Impressive Past RecordChurch & Dwight’s third-quarter 2017 results marked the company’s fourth consecutive quarter of positive earnings surprise, whereas sales have outpaced the consensus mark in 12 out of the last 14 quarters now. Results were backed by continued organic sales growth, which in turn was driven by higher volumes. Clearly, the company’s investment spending is paying off. Despite bearing the brunt of hurricanes, Church & Dwight’s organic sales rose 3.2%, backed by growth in domestic sales, continued international business expansion and solid Specialty Products business growth. Management remains impressed with the broad-based growth and it also remains hopeful of achieving bottom-line growth of 8.5% in 2017.All said, we believe that Church & Dwight’s stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of innovative products and aggressive productivity programs should keep driving its performance.Looking for More?

Also, the company has delivered a robust start to fiscal 2018 as both first-quarter earnings and sales topped estimates and improved year over year.Consequently, the stock scaled a 52-week high $149.90 on Dec 22, though it closed a tad lower at $149.52. In the past three months, the company’s shares have gained 15.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 0.6%.Let’s make a detailed analysis of the stock.2020 Strategy – A Long-Term Growth DriverClorox remains keen on the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In fact, the whole strategy is meant to achieve certain long-term aspirations including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing operating margin by 25-50 basis points and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.The strategy is likely to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands, development of e-commerce, technological advancements, enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds - desire, decision and delight.Brand Strength & E-CommerceClorox's diversified brand portfolio positions it well ahead of peers to generate above-average industry growth.

132,CLX,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) announced the opening of its latest manufacturing facility in Atlanta. This new facility is expected to produce Home Care products, thereby strengthening the Home Care unit of the company’s Cleaning segment.Spanning across 258,000 square feet, the new manufacturing facility, Atlanta West is adjacent to the Atlanta Main, which also makes Home Care products. This investment is likely to enhance the supply-chain capabilities and drive growth. Notably, this opening reflects Clorox’s Home Care unit’s continued success and the strength of Clorox-branded products.Apparently, Scentiva products, including disinfecting wipes and sprays, that were introduced in January 2017 delivered solid sales in the recently reported first-quarter fiscal 2018. This helped boost the sales of the Home Care business.Being an important center for Clorox, Atlanta is expected to create significant opportunities for the community in the days ahead. The company already employs nearly 800 people in its offices in Alpharetta, Kennesaw and Forest Park. Further, the new Atlanta West facility has added about 100 jobs in the Clayton County. Going forward, we expect Clorox to serve the needs of the community in a more efficient manner based on its constant efforts and differentiated products.Cleaning Segment Bodes WellAs one of the most important divisions, the Cleaning Segment contributed nearly 37.3% to overall sales in the first quarter. This marks the highest contribution from any of the company’s segments.

133,CLX,"On this first day of November — following a robust October, which was the best trading month since February — the ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private-sector payroll wastes no time shedding light from the month of October from labor market activity. This also means Friday will bring us the non-farm payroll report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) which together bring us more or less up to date on the health of the domestic jobs market.The latest ADP headline number was well out in front of expectations: 235K new private-sector jobs filled well surpassed the 190K analysts had expected. However, September’s total was revised downward by 25K new jobs to 110K overall. Averaging the two months — which may be useful in helping comb-out anomalies related to the two major hurricanes that struck the continental U.S. shores several weeks ago — we come up with 170K. This is still far stronger than what the economy “needs” to continue strengthening the U.S. labor market.Pointing toward the post-hurricane rebuild, the sector breakdown shows 62K Construction jobs having been created in the month, the top job-creating industry last month, followed by the steadily growing Leisure/Hospitality and Education/Healthcare results of 45K and 39K, respectively. Goods-producing jobs reached 85K while Services maintained its strong advantage at 150K jobs in October.The estimate for Friday’s BLS report is 315K. This is an impressive headline, but also may be susceptible to the same hurricane-related affects, including downward revisions. Somewhere in the high 100Ks is where analysts are looking for that two-month average to wind up.Bitcoin’s Record HighThe CME Group (CME  -  Free Report) announced it will launch a futures trading platform on the Bitcoin cryptocurrency sometime before year’s end. Bitcoin has been hard to ignore in 2017, trading up nearly 500% year to date, and currently trades at an all-time high near 6500.

135,CLX,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) posted robust first-quarter fiscal 2018 results, wherein both top and bottom line topped estimates and grew year over year. Notably, earnings marked the fourth straight quarterly beat, while sales surpassed estimates for the second consecutive quarter.Q1 HighlightsQuarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.46 per share jumped 7% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41. Results primarily gained from solid sales and gross margin expansion.Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteNet sales of $1,500 million advanced nearly 4% year over year, also coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,478 million. The top line beat was driven by growth across the United Sates and International businesses, as well as 4% rise in volumes. Growth at the International business was backed by increased pricing, offset by unfavorable mix.Clorox’s gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 44.9% in the quarter, thanks to efficient cost savings and improved pricing in the International business, somewhat offset by increase in manufacturing and logistics expenses as well as greater commodity expenses.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 5% to $559 million, mainly driven by strength in Home Care with higher shipments for several Clorox branded products, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes, along with Scentiva wipes and sprays introduced in January 2017.Household sales grew 5% to $441 million aided by volume growth across all businesses, particularly Cat Litter. Results also benefited from increased merchandising activity for product innovation in Bags and Wraps and greater shipments of Glad premium trash bags.Sales at the Lifestyle segment rose 4% to $246 million driven by strength in Burt's Bees Natural Personal Care, which witnessed double-digit volume growth. Top-line growth also reflected the benefits of improved sales in Dressings and Sauces, supported by increased merchandising for bottled Hidden Valley ranch products.In the International business segment, sales grew 1% to $254 million driven by improved pricing, partly negated by volume declines, particularly in Argentina.FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $468 million, and long-term debt of $1,787 million. In first-quarter fiscal 2018, the company generated $257 million of net cash from continuing operations.Looking AheadFollowing the first-quarter results, the company slashed guidance for fiscal 2018 to include the hurricane-related impacts and the divestiture of the Aplicare business in August 2017.The company now expects fiscal 2018 sales growth in a range of 1-3%, compared with the previous guidance of 2-4% growth. The lowered guidance reflects a slightly less than 1 percentage point reduction in the fiscal year related to the Aplicare divestiture.Gross margin is now estimated to be down slightly, versus the earlier guidance of expanding slightly. The recent guidance reflects significant cost pressures due to the recent hurricanes, particularly in the second and third quarters.Driven by an anticipated 10 cent impact from hurricanes, the company now envisions fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to range from $5.47-$5.67 per share, reflecting a 5 cent decline from the previous guidance of $5.52-$5.72 per share. However, the company anticipates the impacts of hurricanes to be partly mitigated by continued strength in its underlying business performance. Clorox currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

136,CLX,"We have crossed the halfway mark of the third-quarter earnings season, which has turned out to be pretty good. Of the notable factors influencing this season, rising momentum on the revenue front remain impressive. Moreover, the above-average proportion of positive earnings surprises has been maintained in the quarter while the estimate revision trend for the December quarter remains favorable.In fact, the overall third-quarter earnings for the S&P 500 index remains on track to reach a new all-time quarterly record by beating the previous earnings season’s record.Per the Earnings Preview dated Oct 27, nearly 272 S&P 500 members have already reported their results. Of these, approximately 75.7% delivered positive earnings surprises, while 66.2% beat top-line expectations. Notably, earnings for these companies have advanced 8.7% from the same period last year, with revenues up 6.7%.For the third quarter as a whole, total earnings for the S&P 500 index are projected to improve 5.4% year over year on 5.5% growth in revenues.A Look at Consumer Staples SectorCosmetics, soap & cleaning materials and food stocks form part of the Consumer Staples sector. Markedly, the sector is on growth trajectory since the beginning of 2017, supported by buoyant economy and improving consumer confidence despite a competitive landscape and geopolitical turmoil.In fact, we note that the performance of the index depends upon all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which nine sectors are expected to witness an earnings decline in the third quarter. However, the Consumer Staples sector is likely to witness 2.6% and 1.9% growth in earnings and revenues, respectively. Also, a Zacks Sector Rank of #6 (out of 16), places it at the top 38% of the Zacks classified sectors. Evidently, the sector has gained 7.1% year to date, lower than the S&P 500’s growth of 15%.  Furthermore, our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter .That said, let’s see what awaits these stocks that are slated to report their quarterly results on Nov 1.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report), the manufacturer and marketer of consumer and professional products, remains keen on the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy through investment in brands, development of e-commerce and technological advancements.Despite a competitive retail environment, analysts anticipate higher volumes, better pricing and benefits from RenewLife (acquired in May 2016) to augment sales performance. Also, management has earlier pointed that competition has intensified — especially across core categories like litter and trash bags — which remains a threat to margins.

This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.29% with a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), consequently making the surprise prediction difficult.Further, revenues are expected to be $1,478 million in the quarter, up 2.4% from the year-ago quarter. Per the analysts polled by Zacks, sales at the Cleaning segment are expected to come in at $542 million (up 1.5% year-over-year) while for Household the same is projected to be $436 million (up 3.3%). Sales at the Lifestyle segment are envisioned to be $245 million (up 1.2%) while for the International segment sales are forecasted to be $254 million (up 3.8%).Next, let’s see what’s in store for The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report), the leading manufacturer and marketer of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Markedly, the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2018 results are likely to benefit from rising consumer spending on beauty and personal grooming products, owing to improvements in consumer confidence. Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has been boosting the beauty space, which bodes well for the company.

The company expects earnings to be in the range of 94-97 cents, which marks an increase of 12-15% from the prior-year earnings of 84 cents. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal first quarter is currently pegged at 98 cents.Analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $3,164 million during the quarter, up 10.8% from the prior-year period. Also, management predicts sales growth of 9-10%. Furthermore, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales in the fragrance, skin care and hair care categories are expected to be $470 million, $1,171 million and $138 million, respectively. These sales estimates indicate an improvement of 6.3% for both fragrance and skin care categories from the prior-year figure while the hair care segment is expected to increase 1.5%.The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) is a leading food and beverage company in the world. We note that the company has been witnessing top-line weakness over the past several quarters due to soft global retail and consumer demand. In fact, the food industry has been performing dismally for quite some time now. Also, consumption trends in a number of the company’s key categories remain challenged. Nevertheless, Kraft Heinz expects organic sales growth to ramp up in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. This is likely to be driven by strong marketing, go-to-market and product quality initiatives. Also, it has implemented several cost-saving initiatives including the integration of Kraft Foods and Heinz.

138,CLX,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) continues to progress well with its savings programs along with a disciplined capital strategy and other initiatives. However, the company has a dismal sales trend.Savings Programs Bode WellColgate remains committed to its savings programs as both Global Growth and Efficiency Program (or 2012 Restructuring Program) as well as Funding the Growth initiatives are delivering impressive results.Furthermore, the company stated that the additional savings opportunities identified under the program in the second quarter of 2017 provide visibility to reach the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range. Consequently, the company expects both GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.Markedly, this four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program focuses on reducing structural costs in order to improve gross and operating profit, standardizing processes to improve the decision-making procedure and enhance its market share position worldwide.Meanwhile, through funding growth initiative the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers while reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are anticipated to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Other CatalystsColgate commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories. In fact, innovation and in-store implementation have been the guiding principles of the company’s growth strategy over the years, thus enabling it to capture market share across all regions and categories. Management further expects to grow market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Going forward, the company remains focused on four fundamentals to boost profits including, increased spending on more impactful advertisements, innovation across portfolio of businesses, higher spends on high growth e-commerce business and aggressively maximizing productivity.Additionally, Colgate has always followed a disciplined capital allocation strategy. This strategy focuses on making investments to develop business while using the excess cash to enhance shareholder returns through dividend payouts and share buybacks owing to its strong cash generation ability.Stellar Earnings TrendColgate, which shares space with Church & Dwight Co., Inc.

Notably, the company has posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.ConcernsColgate has a dismal sales trend as its top line has lagged estimates in 16 of the trailing 17 quarters. In fact, the company’s second-quarter results marked its fifth straight sales miss. Sales in the quarter were hurt by the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. Furthermore, low global unit volumes and negative currency fluctuations were deterrents.Management anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide in the near term.Bottom LineWhile the soft sales trends indicate weakness, we remain confident of the company’s growth prospects, given its innovation track record and ongoing initiatives. We believe the company’s actions will help counter the dismal sales trends. Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

139,CLX,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) announced the sale of its Aplicare skin antisepsis business to Medline Industries. This was done in accordance with the former’s 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. However, the financial terms of the deal that concluded on Aug 21, remained under covers.Notably, Aplicare business that was part of Clorox’s Professional Products business, contributed nearly $46 million in fiscal 2017, reflecting not more than 1% of the company’s overall sales as well as insignificant earnings.In fact, the Illinois-based Medline Industries, which is the leading privately-held maker and distributor of medical supplies, is likely to enhance the performance of the Aplicare business with its solid capabilities and explorations. Also, it will cater top-tier health care products and services to its customers.With the sale of its Aplicare skin unit, Clorox does not free itself from the responsibility of focusing strategically on its Professional Products business and the company will continue to stop the spread of infection as well as kill pathogens.Throwing light upon Clorox’s 2020 Strategy, we note that the strategy is aimed at achieving certain long-term aspirations, including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing EBIT margin by 25-50 basis points and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.Meanwhile, Clorox seems to be well on track with the execution of the strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of eCommerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds – desire, decision and delight.Evidently, the 2020 Strategy coupled with other factors drove the company’s fiscal 2017 performance. Going forward, Clorox is likely to deliver another year of solid earnings and sales growth in fiscal 2018 aided by these factors. Concurrently, management has also stated that it will issue an updated outlook for fiscal 2018 on Nov 1, when it reports fiscal first-quarter results.In fact, shares of Clorox have outpaced the broader Consumer Staples sector in the last three months.

140,CLX,"Shares of Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) declined 5.2% over the last three months, as against the industry’s gain of 5.3%. Moreover, the stock has underperformed the broader Consumer Staples sector that gained 1.4%. However, management remains on track to deliver growth on the back of its savings programs and other initiatives.Further, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock exhibits a VGM Score of “D”. Let’s delve deep to explore more about the stock.Soft Sales Trend & Bleak OutlookColgate’s dismal sales trend reveals that its top line has lagged estimates for the last 17 quarters. Moreover, the company’s revenues fell short of expectations for the fifth straight quarter in second-quarter 2017 due to continued softness in North America and challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.Going forward, the company anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. While it reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low-single digits growth, the company lowered its organic sales growth guidance on account of a soft first-half 2017.Furthermore, Colgate anticipates GAAP earnings per share, on a dollar basis, to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range compared with the previously stated flat guidance.Consequently, the estimates witnessed downward revisions in the last 30 days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.89 for 2017 and $3.11 for 2018 has declined 1% and 1.6%, respectively.Other HeadwindsForeign exchange continues to be a headwind for Colgate in some markets as it derives around 75% of revenues from outside the U.S. In fact, the Asia-Pacific region and the Hill’s Pet Nutrition business were impacted by negative currency translations in the second quarter. Also, management expects it to hurt results throughout 2017.In addition, the company faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) and The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Strategic InitiativesOn the positive side, Colgate has been infamous among investors with its meet or beat earnings track record. The company posted in-line earnings in four of the last seven quarters, while it surpassed estimates in the remaining three.Further, Colgate is progressing well with its savings programs, as both, its Global Growth and Efficiency Program or 2012 Restructuring Program and Funding the Growth undertakings are delivering impressive results. Evidently, these initiatives contributed in gross margin expansion in the quarter, and expect GAAP and adjusted gross margin to expand in 2017.With these initiatives, Colgate focuses on reducing structural costs, standardizing processes and enhancing its market share position worldwide. Also, the company aims at opening new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, while also reducing fuel and transportation costs. These programs are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Moreover, it commands a market-leading position in the oral care and personal care product categories and maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy. Going forward, the company expects to further grow its market share in 2017 via a series of innovative product launches lined up for the year.Bottom LineWe believe Colgate’s growth drivers to outweigh the obstacles in the near term, and help regain its momentum.Meanwhile, you can count upon a better-ranked stock from the same industry, which is Unilever N.V. (UN  -  Free Report), with long-term earnings growth rate of 9.4%. Also, it carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In fact, the whole strategy is aimed at achieving certain long-term aspirations, including growing net sales by 3−5%, improvement of EBIT margin by 25−50 basis points, and generating free cash flow of 10−12% of sales, all on a yearly basis.We note that the company is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of eCommerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds – desire, decision and delight.Sturdy Q4 Results & Favorable OutlookClorox posted solid fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results, wherein both the top and bottom lines grew year over year and topped estimates. Notably, earnings marked the third straight quarter of a beat, while sales reverted to its positive surprise track after a miss in the last quarter.While the bottom line gained from strong sales and cost-savings, the top line was fueled by higher volumes, better International pricing and benefits from RenewLife (acquired in May 2016). Further, sales grew year over year in each segment in the quarter. The company’s fiscal 2017 performance also remained robust with solid top- and bottom-line growth year over year. (Read More: Clorox Q4 Earnings & Sales Beat the Zacks Consensus)Further, management is encouraged by its International operations, and expects pricing and cost savings to continue driving results. It expects fiscal 2018 to represent another year of strong earnings and sales growth. For fiscal 2018, Clorox expects sales to grow in a range of 2–4%, and earnings from continuing operations to rise 3–7% year over year.Other StrengthsWe believe Clorox's diversified brand portfolio places the company well above its peers to generate above-average industry growth and sustain itself in the currently challenging environment.In fact, its focus on boosting sales through brands is well-evident from its constant innovations and marketing strategies to drive top-line growth. Alongside, it maintains a disciplined capital allocation strategy, making investments to develop its business while using the excess cash to lower debts and enhance shareholder returns.Concerns/WeaknessHowever, the stock is not devoid of concerns/headwinds, which might dampen its performance in the near term. Clorox’s significant international presence exposes it to major foreign currency risks (especially in Argentina), which have hurt results for a while in the past. Also, currency headwinds are expected to have one point adverse impact on sales growth in fiscal 2018.Additionally, Clorox faces intense competition from other well-established players in the consumer products industry, such as Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report), Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) and The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) on the basis of pricing, promotional activities and new product introductions.Bottom LineWhile these headwinds, along with a retail landscape that is expected to be more competitive in fiscal 2018, the company’s focus on its 2020 strategy and continued investments in innovating products and brands, will help drive results.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

142,CLX,"Another big morning for Q2 earnings posts, with mostly positive results. We also see new Initial Jobless Claims numbers ahead of tomorrow’s big non-farm payroll report and unemployment rate headline. After yesterday’s ADP (ADP  -  Free Report) private sector payroll report that was consistent with good news we’ve mostly been experiencing of late, expectations are for roughly 180K new jobs created. The unemployment rate last read was 4.4%.Initial Jobless Claims fell 5000 to 240K last week, as the previous week had been revised up 1000. Again we see results range-bound between 225K-250K week to week, with very few outliers, over the past year or more. The 4-week moving average is currently 241,750, down 2500 week over week. Continuing claims again remained below 2 million, at 1.968 million.And the Bank of England is taking steps to brace for its coming Brexit — the separation of Great Britain from the European Union, which was voted on last year (and cost Prime Minister David Cameron his job, pretty much) to the greater world’s surprise. BOE Governor Mark Carney is quoted as having said, “the assumption of a smooth transition to a new economic relationship with the EU will be tested.” As such, the Monetary Policy Committee will be keeping rates unchanged, and the BOE has lowered economic growth projections. The British Pound is down today.Ahead of the bell, medical insurance giant Aetna (AET  -  Free Report) blasted past earnings estimates of $2.34 per share to post $3.42 ahead of this morning’s open. This represents 46% growth year over year. Membership was actually down year over year by 1.6%, but revenues also easily topped forecasts: $15.50 billion versus $15.35 billion expected. Shares are up over 4% in the pre-market.Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report) beat projections on both top and bottom lines this morning, posting 68 cents per share on sales of $1.45 billion in the quarter. The Zacks consensus had been looking for 61 cents per share and $1.41 billion in revenues, respectively. Comps at both KFC and Taco Bell were up: 3% and 4%, respectively.Avon Products (AVP  -  Free Report), however, has faired badly ahead of this morning’s open, down 10% in early trading on missed earnings and sales. A loss of 3 cents per share was lower than the gain of 5 cents expected, and revenues of $1.35 billion failed to reach the $1.44 billion in our Zacks consenus. Further, CEO Sheri McCoy has announced she will be stepping down from her post. Reports are that board pressure is the main reason.Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report) posted narrow beats on top and bottom lines this morning.

Volumes mainly gained from the strength in Home Care, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes, along with strong volumes at the Professional Products’ cleaning brands.Household sales grew 4% to $632 million, with volumes rising 5%. Volumes were mainly aided by the RenewLife acquisition, benefits from Cat Litter and greater shipments from Glad premium trash bags.Sales at the Lifestyle segment rose 2% to $258 million, while volumes dipped 1% due to reduced shipments from KC Masterpiece barbeque sauces, partly compensated by strength in Burt's Bees Natural Personal Care.In the International business segment, sales grew 5% to $255 million.

This was partially negated by softness in certain Latin American countries, especially Argentina.Fiscal 2017: At a GlanceFiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations of $5.35 per share jumped 9% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.30. Net sales of $5,973 million advanced nearly 4% year over year, beating our estimate of $5,967 million.FinancialsClorox ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $418 million, and long-term debt of $1,391 million.

147,CLX,"We expect Kellogg Company (KHC  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results before the market opens on Aug 3. Last quarter, this cereal and snacks company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 4.95%. The company delivered a positive earnings surprise in the trailing four quarters, the average beat being 6.16%.The chart below depicts the surprise history.Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise  Kellogg Company Price and EPS Surprise | Kellogg Company QuoteWhy a Likely Positive Surprise?Per our proven model, Kellogg has the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — to be able to beat estimates.Zacks ESP: The Most Accurate estimate stands at 94 cents per share, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 92 cents, resulting in an Earnings ESP of +2.17%. This is a meaningful indicator of a likely positive surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Kellogg carries a Zacks Rank #2.We caution against Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.Factors at PlayThe company has been witnessing top-line weakness for the last two years, primarily due to weak performance by its cereal products in developed markets, as well as soft U.S. snacks business, owing to lower demand.Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid change in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories. Kellogg, like a number of other U.S. food producers, has been struggling due to the shift in consumer preference toward natural and organic ingredients over packaged and processed food. This trend is unlikely to change in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, the company expects its sales in the European business to remain soft in the second quarter due to lower volumes, tough comparisons and currency headwinds. However, strong performance in Latin America and Asia is likely to compensate for the above headwinds.Nonetheless, given the tepid sales growth, the company is making aggressive efforts toward improving its food offerings. In order to counter the sluggish sales trend, the company is investing in brand building, in-store capabilities along with product and packaging innovation.Cost-savings initiatives like Project K and zero-based budgeting (ZBB) program are somewhat compensating for the weakness in sales. Although the top line has been weak, Kellogg’s margin growth has been impressive.Overall, for the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 92 cents, reflecting a 1.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the consensus estimate for revenues is $3.15 billion, implying a 3.5% decline.Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

Soft spending by U.S. shoppers along with rapid change in consumer preferences and behavior are hurting the company’s categories.

149,CLX,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cloroxis seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CLX in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $1.50 per share for CLX, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CLX, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.67% heading into earnings season.Clorox Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise Clorox Company (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market.

150,CLX,"Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 61%.In fact, Hertz has missed our estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 24.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price and EPS Surprise  Hertz Global Holdings, Inc Price and EPS Surprise | Hertz Global Holdings, Inc QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Hertz will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is a loss of 10 cents per share, compared with earnings of 41 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $2.21 billion, down 2.7% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 15.6%, while the industry grew 3.1%.Factors at PlayHertz’ bearish run can mainly be attributable to its disappointing past performance, as the company has lagged bottom-line estimates for three consecutive quarters now.In first-quarter 2017, Hertz suffered a loss and also recorded soft revenues. Earnings were hurt by weak sales, increased fleet investments along with higher spending on tech and brand development, while fall in revenues was due to soft domestic and international sales.Though performance remained disappointing, the company remains focused on turnaround plan, which keeps customers at centre stage. Further, the company remains keen on solving issues related to fleet and services, which were the main deterrents. In this regard, management remains on track to make investments in fleet, services, brand development and technology in 2017, which should help it regain solid market position.Nonetheless, the aforementioned negative factors and unfavorable currency movements make us cautious about the upcoming results.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Hertz is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Hertz has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at a loss of 10 cents per share. While the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need to have a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise.

151,CLX,"Dean Foods Company (DF  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 8. Last quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 23.5%.In fact, Dean Foods has missed our estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 8.4%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise  Dean Foods Company Price and EPS Surprise | Dean Foods Company QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Dean Foods will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 30 cents per share, reflecting a 20% year-over-year decline. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.96 billion, up 6% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader sector in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 12.5%, while the Consumer Staples sector grew 2.3%.Factors at PlayDean Foods’ performance remains challenged by rising competition and escalated raw milk costs. The company’s business is heavily dependent on commodities such as raw milk, soybeans, diesel fuel and others, the prices of which often fluctuate. Hence, any rise in their prices will hurt margins.Though raw milk prices started declining from Dec 2014, the company witnessed escalated raw milk costs again in first-quarter 2017, both on a year-over-year and sequential basis. During the quarter, raw milk costs rose about 6% from fourth-quarter 2016 and jumped 18% from first-quarter 2016.Moreover, the company is facing severe competition from other dairy products suppliers due consolidations in the retail grocery industry.However, contributions from Friendly’s acquisition have been providing a boost to ice cream sales volumes. This is in turn aiding top-line growth. We also applaud the company’s efforts to grow in the organic space, which is evident from its recent deals with Good Karma and Organic Valley as well as the acquisition of Uncle Matt's juices. Further, its focus on cost productivity and growth plans bode well.Additionally, the company remains on schedule with growth and productivity plans, and expects it to ramp up throughout 2017. Management remains committed toward taking strategic steps to optimize capital allocation and concentrate on core business activities. With such strategic initiatives in place, we can hope that Dean Foods would be able to lift its performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Dean Foods is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

152,CLX,"Waste management firm Stericycle, Inc. (SRCL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results after the closing bell on Aug 3. In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5 cents. The company has a modest earnings history with three beats in the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 4.4%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderStericycle is focused on increasing its SQ customer base (small-quantity customers that include outpatient clinics, medical and dental offices, long-term and sub-acute care facilities, and retail pharmacies), as it generates higher gross margins than the LQ customers (large-quantity customers that include hospitals, blood banks, and pharmaceutical manufacturers). In addition, Stericycle offers multiple service offerings to its customers, which add to the value of each account. For its SQ customers, the services include Steri-Safe and clinical compliance offerings and for LQ customers, services comprise Bio Systems and Rx Waste Compliance. Within the SQ business, the company is continually investing in data analytic capabilities to improve its performance.The company expects a revenue growth rate of 3–5% for the next three to five years on the back of favorable demand patterns. The healthy demand schedule is largely driven by factors including an aging population and growing needs of healthcare, higher enforcement of compliance regulations, and continued trend by customers to outsource services to focus on core businesses.A significant portion of Stericycle’s historical growth was due to the successful integration of acquisitions in both domestic and international markets. The company is continuously on the lookout for strategic acquisitions that will grow its market share and expand its geographic base. The acquisition pool of the company remains robust in multiple geographies and lines of business. International growth rates are expected to accelerate due to increasing customer adoption of multiple services and expansion into new lines of business. The global acquisition strategy increases Stericycle’s customer base by providing a long-term growth platform for selling multiple services. Strategic acquisitions and a steady stock repurchase program are likely to supplement organic growth initiatives and drive additional shareholder value.However, Stericycle operates in a highly-competitive market. The barriers to entry into the regulated waste collection and disposal business and the pharmaceutical returns business are very low. Competitors may also resort to aggressive pricing to gain market share. In the past, the company was forced to reduce prices for LQ customers due to competitive pressure, which could be repeated in the future. This forces us to be bearish on the stock to some extent.High operating costs continue to be a headwind for Stericycle. In addition, a challenging macroeconomic environment and volatility in foreign exchange are affecting margins and the bottom line.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Stericycle is likely to beat earnings this quarter as it does not possess the key components. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here as you will see below:Zacks ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and Zacks Consensus Estimate, is 0.00% as both are currently pegged at $1.13.

153,CLX,"Church & Dwight Co., Inc. (CHD  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3, before the opening bell. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading manufacturer and marketer of personal care, household and specialty products will be able to post a positive earnings surprise again in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with in-line earnings in the remaining one, with an average beat of 6.3%. In fact, it has posted positive earnings surprise in 10 out of 13 straight quarters.Consequently, the solid performance of the company is clearly reflected in its share price movement. We note that over the last three months, shares of this consumer products giant have moved up 8.1%, compared with the industry’s rally of 5.9% and the broader Consumer Staples sector’s growth of 3.8%.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Church & Dwight is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +2.56%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at 40 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 39 cents. This is very meaningful and a leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise for shares. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Church & Dwight currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with Zacks Ranks #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) and 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating estimates. Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 and 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Church & Dwight’s Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +2.56% makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and full year 2017 have improved marginally in the last 30 days. In fact, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 39 cents and $1.93 for the second quarter and 2017 reflects a year-over-year decline of 9.0% and a growth of 8.8%, respectively.Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $904.2 million for the said quarter, up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter. Also, revenues for 2017 are projected to grow 5.5% to $3.7 billion.Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Church & Dwight Company, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Church & Dwight Company, Inc. QuoteFactors at PlayChurch & Dwight remains optimistic about its future performance on the back of a stable portfolio of value and premium products, launch of new and innovative products, aggressive productivity programs and tight management of overhead expenses, along with robust sales and earnings growth. However, it also expects a competitive environment in 2017 due to new product introductions by competitors and persistent pricing pressure. Moreover, the company’s Specialty Products business has been underperforming of late. Sales at this segment witnessed a year-over-year decline in all the four quarters of 2016. However, the same showed a slight increase in first-quarter 2017 due to lower volumes in the specialty chemical sector of the business. Encouragingly, the animal productivity business improved in both price and volume due to higher demand from the U.S. dairy industry as milk prices and dairy farm profitability seem to have stabilized. Further, management remains on track to revive this division’s performance to boost overall profitability.Though the company expects rising commodity costs and foreign currency headwinds to prevail in 2017, the recent acquisitions of Agro BioSciences, VIVISCAL business and ANUSOL and RECTINOL brands are expected to add further strength to the company’s sturdy portfolio and improve business.For the second quarter, the company expects reported and organic sales growth of approximately 1 to 2%. In fact, its sales have outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in 11 of the last 12 quarters, alongside witnessing year-over-year growth for the last five straight quarters. While gross margin for the first half is expected to be flat, adjusted earnings are expected to increase approximately 5%.Stocks with Favorable Combination Here are some other companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #3.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.49 per share, reflecting a year-over-year growth of 18.3%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has been stable ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.64 billion, up 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.However, we note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 0.7%, while the industry grew 2.9%.Factors at PlayClorox’s potential is visible in its robust outlook, progress on 2020 Strategy, diversified brand portfolio and disciplined capital strategy. The company’s solid brand portfolio places it well in the challenging environment. Further, it remains keen on the execution of 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth and overall market share.While Clorox expects the macroeconomic headwinds to persist going forward, it is all set to counter the hurdles with prudent strategies. The company plans to offset stiff competition with increased brand investments. Further, it is on track with the Go Lean strategy to fight slowing global economies. Moreover, the company aims to keep cost-savings and pricing in place, to battle the expected inflation and increasing commodity pricing.Further, the company anticipates boosting sales and volumes in fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 backed by the intense advertising and promotion investments to enhance brand value that were incurred in the fiscal third quarter.  It also envisions EBIT margin to improve in the fourth quarter on the back of lower selling and administrative costs. That said, management remains confident of delivering another year of top-line and bottom-line growth.However, management expects trade promotional investments, along with inflationary pressure and foreign currency headwinds to lead to gross margin deceleration in fiscal 2017.Nonetheless, we believe that Clorox’s growth drivers far outweigh the obstacles and will help the company sustain its impressive momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Clorox is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

155,CLX,"We expect beauty and cosmetic goods company, Avon Products Inc. (AVP  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports second-quarter 2017 results on Aug 3. In the last quarter, the company delivered a loss per share of 7 cents against our expectations of break-even results.The company has recorded negative earnings surprise in three of the trailing four quarters. However, it has an average positive surprise of 3.7% in the last four quarters.Avon Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Avon Products, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Avon Products, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Avon will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is 5 cents per share, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 21.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been going down ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.44 billion, up 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has underperformed the industry in the last one month. The company’s shares have declined 4%, while the industry grew 3.7%.Factors at PlayThough Avon’s surprise trend is yet to recover, we remain encouraged by the company’s Transformation Plan that was announced in Jan 2016.With its Transformation Plan, the company targets bringing down costs over the long term and investing the savings back into growth initiatives like media, IT systems and social selling. It is on track to generate targeted savings of $230 million in 2017. Additionally, Avon is confident of achieving long-term goals of low-double digit operating margin growth, Active Representatives growth of 1–2% and constant-dollar revenue growth in the mid-single digits.Moreover, the company is undertaking strategic endeavors to boost top-line growth, trimming costs and improving working capital. Further, Avon has made significant progress in improving balance sheet through refinancing activities, along with cutting costs by slashing jobs and exiting operations in the underperforming markets. We believe these actions will help Avon to streamline operations by focusing more on high-priority markets and activities as well as enhancing efficiency.However, the company’s persistent dismal performances due to soft Active Representatives growth and currency headwinds cannot be ignored. The beauty products retailer’s recent records reveal that it has lagged both earnings and sales estimates for three straight quarters now. Despite its efforts to revive Active Representatives, the same declined 3% in first-quarter 2017 compared with the prior-year quarter. Furthermore, Ending Representatives dipped 1%.Further, it anticipates the increase in bad debts (in Brazil) to linger in the second quarter, which is expected to remain challenging. That said, let’s wait and see if Avon’s transformation efforts can aid in reviving near-term performance.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model shows that Avon Products is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

It should be noted that the company has posted three negative earnings surprises in the last four quarters, resulting in an average negative surprise of 22.6%.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to the announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model shows that Molson Coors is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, is +4.90%.

Conversely, the Sell-rated stocks ( Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Molson Coors’ Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of +4.90% makes us very optimistic about a possible earnings beat.Which Way Are Estimates Trending?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter and 2017 has been declining over the last seven days.

For 2017, Zacks consensus revenue is pegged at $11.1 billion, reflecting a 127.6% year-over-year increase.Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Molson Coors Brewing Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Molson Coors Brewing Company QuoteFactors to Consider Molson Coors has been struggling with weak sales volume trend of late. While the acquisition of the Miller global brands helped improving sales in the International regions, sales volume continued to decline in Canada and Europe. A difficult economy, unfavorable currency and competitive pressure remained the major deterrents. The company’s dismal performance is reflected in its share price. Molson Coors’ shares have fallen 12.3% in the last one year, in comparison to the industry’s growth of 2.4%. In order to revive its performance, Molson Coors has been focusing on expanding its foothold through strategic agreements and targeting above-premium brands to help grow its market share.The recent agreement with Hornell Brewing Co., Inc., an affiliate of AriZona Beverages, is in line with Molson Coors’ current business expansion initiatives. The deal will give Molson Coors the license to market and distribute a new Flavored Malt Beverage (FMB) brand, Arnold Palmer Spiked Half & Half, through its U.S. division MillerCoors. This would aid Molson Coors to capture the momentum of ready-to-drink teas (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) in the U.S.In regard to its cost savings target, the company exceeded its 2016 goal by achieving more than $165 million of in-year cost reductions. The acquisition of the remaining 58% stake in MillerCoors will also drive substantial cost synergies in the next three years and continues to expect this transaction to be significantly accretive to underlying earnings in the first full year of operations. This will also help the company to drive top-line growth, profit, cash generation, debt pay-down and total shareholder returns in the years ahead. The company expects cost savings of $550 million over the next three years till 2019.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

However, it has delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Spectrum Brands this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. QuoteSpectrum Brands has an Earnings ESP of -1.56%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is at $1.89, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.92. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #3 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise.What to Expect?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92 and $5.82 for the fiscal third quarter and fiscal 2017, respectively, has declined by two cents each in the last seven days.Furthermore, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $1.38 billion and $5.08 billion for the said quarter and the fiscal year, respectively.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the earnings growth for the Consumer Staples sector looks decent. While total earnings for the sector are estimated to rise 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Factors Influencing the QuarterSpectrum Brands’ shares have declined 14% in the last three months, wider than the industry’s loss of 3.1%. In contrast, the Zacks categorized Consumer Staples sector gained 2% and is currently placed at top 13% of the Zacks Classified sectors (2 out of 16).We note that the company’s top line has lagged estimates in four of the last seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. Moreover, its sales have been declining since the last three quarters, primarily due to soft sales recorded at the Global Batteries & Appliances, Global Pet Supplies and Global Auto Care segments. In fact, sales decreased 3.3% and 0.6% in the second and first quarters of fiscal 2017, respectively. The same had slumped 4.5% in the final quarter of fiscal 2016.Further, Spectrum Brands continues to battle adverse foreign currency effects, which is likely to mar its results in the near term. Management expects net sales for fiscal 2017 to include about 100–150 basis points impact from currency headwinds.However, on the positive front, we remain encouraged by the company’s innovative products in all categories and persistent leverage of its global infrastructure and shared services. Also, it is making acquisitions and exiting underperforming businesses to improve profitability, margins and free cash flow. So let’s wait and see if Spectrum Brands can counter the hurdles and be able to pull off a positive earnings surprise in the upcoming quarter with these initiatives.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

158,CLX,"Aaron's, Inc. (AAN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 28. The question facing investors is whether this rent-to-own retailer will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported.Aaron's posted a positive earnings surprise of 21.2% in the last reported quarter, which marked its fourth consecutive earnings beat. The company has an average positive earnings surprise of 10.6% in the trailing four quarters.Aaron's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Aaron's, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Aaron's, Inc. QuoteWhat to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2017 has been stable in the last 30 days. However, the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of 58 cents per share for the quarter reflects a year-over-year decline of 1.7%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $790.4 million, up 0.1% from the year-ago quarter.Aaron’s forms part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Retail-Wholesale sector’s earnings are expected to fall 0.2%, while revenues are expected to grow 3.9%.Factors at PlayWhile Aaron’s has a solid earnings history, the top line continues to struggle. Though the company managed to beat sales estimate in the first quarter, after four consecutive misses, its top line declined year over year mainly due to soft performance at its core – Aaron’s Business. Additionally, sales were impacted by lower franchised revenues, a drop in comparable store sales (comps) and lower customer count on a same-store basis.However, management remains impressed with the performance of Progressive division, which continues to have strong prospects. Going forward, the company remains optimistic of growing Progressive business further, and continues to focus on transforming Aaron’s direct-to-consumer operations.Further, we note that Aaron’s has outperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 24%, while the industry grew only 5%.That said, let’s wait and see if the strength in the Progressive division and the company’s transformation efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Aaron’s is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Aaron’s currently sports a Zacks Rank #1, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 58 cents.

159,CLX,"Altria Group, Inc. (MO  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this tobacco maker will be able to deliver a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. The company’s earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4% in the first quarter. However, it has pulled off average positive earnings surprise of 0.7% in the trailing four quarters.Let us see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show earnings beat for Altria this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Altria Group Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Altria Group QuoteAltria has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 86 cents. Moreover, the company carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which further makes surprise prediction difficult.We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter has declined by a penny in the last 30 days, while the same has remained stable at $3.28 for 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $4.97 billion and $19.70 billion for the second quarter and 2017, respectively.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Altria has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and higher cigarette prices in response to rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Additionally, consumers’ preference for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes are largely affecting the cigarette volume.Evidently, Altria’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in six of the last seven quarters, including the last reported quarter. We expect the company to continue to feel the pinch of declining cigarette volumes in the upcoming quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk or reduced-risk products.To match up this trend, the company is also shifting toward low-risk, smokeless tobacco products. Its flagship MarkTen e-cigarette brand (launched in 2014) and Green Smoke e-vapor products are expected to boost Altria’s results in the near term.A glimpse of Altria’s stock performance shows that its shares have gained 3.5% in the last six months, underperforming the industry’s rally of 13.2%. In fact, the industry is currently placed at the bottom 25% (191 out of 256). Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector, of which they are part of, advanced 7.7%. Per the latest Earnings Preview, the earnings growth for the sector looks decent. While total earnings for the Consumer Staples sector are estimated to rise 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

160,CLX,"Pinnacle Foods Inc. (PF  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Jul 27. The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this branded food manufacturer will be able to maintain its positive earnings surprise streak in the to-be-reported quarter. We note that the company has outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three out of the trailing four quarters, with an average of 3.9%.Pinnacle Foods forms part of the Consumer Staples sector. Per the latest Earnings Preview, we note that the above mentioned sector’s earnings growth looks decent. While total earnings for the sector are estimated to grow 3.1%, revenues are projected to improve 1.2%.Let’s delve deeper how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at earnings estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before the earnings release. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review has declined by a cent over the last 30 days and is currently pegged at 52 cents. However, it is up 23.5% from 42 cents delivered in the year-ago quarter. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $765.9 million, up 1.3% from the prior-year period. The stock also carries a VGM Score of ‘‘C’’, which makes it unfavorable for investors.Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Pinnacle Foods, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Pinnacle Foods, Inc. QuoteWhat the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Pinnacle Foods is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Pinnacle Foods has an Earnings ESP of -1.92%, as the Most Accurate Estimate of 51 cents is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 52 cents. A negative ESP makes it unlikely to beat earnings estimates. Further, it carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). It is to be noted that we caution against Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Factors Influencing the Quarter Shares of Pinnacle Foods have moved up 3.8% in the last three months against the industry’s decline of 4.7%. The company’s strong portfolio, robust acquisitions and productivity efficiency remain the strengths of the company. However, the stock has been pressurized lately, majorly due to shunned merger speculations with Conagra Brands, Inc. (CAG  -  Free Report). If market sources were to be believed, talks of possible acquisition of Pinnacle Foods by Conagra Brands, which began on May 31, were shunned within a few days due to price disagreement between both parties.We also observed that sluggish Specialty segment and Pickle business along with increased expenses have also impacted the company’s performance negatively.The company has witnessed sluggish net sales and adjusted EBIT for the Specialty segment over the last three quarters, despite solid growth in the Snacks business. Due to a highly competitive and bidding environment for the already low-margin USDA stew business, the company continues to expect Specialty to remain challenged through 2017.Pinnacle Foods is facing sluggishness in its Pickle business due to continued category weakness and a heightened competitive environment over the last few months. Competition has increased in the form of pricing and innovation, which has put pressure on Vlasic pickles. Though innovation and in-store support for the brand is expected to be rolled out in second-quarter 2017 and is likely to strengthen trends in the second half of the year, we believe the turnaround might take some time.Regular innovations and related introductory costs have also increased the company’s expenses. Higher expenses were also caused by the enhanced overhead structure of the Boulder Brands business. Increased investment in consumer marketing and input cost inflation also adds to the expenses. We continue to anticipate inflation to adversely impact the company’s profits in the near-term.Still Interested in Consumer Staples Stocks?

161,CLX,"The Boston Beer Company, Inc. (SAM  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter fiscal 2017 results on Jul 27. Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 73.1%.In fact, Boston Beer has reported positive surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 30.6%. Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise  Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) Price and EPS Surprise | Boston Beer Company, Inc. (The) QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Boston Beer will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $1.28, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 37.6%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been going down ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $228.9 million, down 12.4% from the year-ago quarter.Furthermore, we note that the stock has underperformed the broader industry in the last three months. The company’s shares have declined 4.9%, while the industry grew 3.1%.Factors at PlayBoston Beer has been reeling under soft depletion trends of late, evident from its dismal stock performance. This softness can primarily be attributed to soft depletion trends that stemmed from weakness in Samuel Adams, soft craft beer and cider categories, alongside a troubled retail backdrop. Moreover, the competition in the craft beer segment has intensified as new craft brewers are entering the market and existing ones are expanding distribution and tapping capacities, providing more options for drinkers.Notably, the aforementioned factors significantly weighed on the company’s performance in last reported quarter. The company posted year-over-year decline in earnings and sales in first-quarter 2017. Moreover, it has been witnessing contraction in the gross margin for five straight quarters now. Additionally, the company observes that the soft depletion trends have continued into second-quarter 2017. Depletions through the 15 weeks ended Apr 15, 2017 have declined nearly 13% from the comparable year-ago period in 2016. Based on these trends, the company remains uncertain about volumes and profitability for 2017.However, we remain encouraged by Boston Beer’s three point growth plan which focuses on revival of Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands, cost saving initiatives and long-term innovation. Further, the company’s focus on pricing, product innovation and brand development are likely to boost operational performance and its market position.  Its practice of acquiring assets to expand geographically, along with brand-building efforts and initiatives to add new products remain key revenue drivers.The company is keen on reviving the Samuel Adams and Angry Orchard brands through packaging, innovation, promotion and brand communication initiatives. Moreover, its cost savings plans are likely to boost gross margin by 1% every year over the next three years.Given the ongoing troubles as well as the company’s efforts to overcome the same, we remain uncertain about the upcoming results. While the near-term outlook indicates a dismal performance in the fiscal second quarter, we would wait and see if its growth efforts make any difference.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Boston Beer is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Boston Beer has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at $1.28 per share.

162,CLX,"Whirlpool Corp. (WHR  -  Free Report) is slated to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26. Last quarter, the company posted a negative earnings surprise of 6.4%.In fact, Whirlpool has reported negative surprise in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.9%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Whirlpool Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Whirlpool Corporation QuoteWhat to Expect?The question lingering in investors’ minds now is whether Whirlpool will be able to post positive earnings surprise in the quarter to be reported. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is $3.56, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 1.7%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate has been declining ahead of the earnings release. Analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $5.4 billion, up 3.1% from the year-ago quarter.We note that the stock has outperformed the Zacks categorized Consumer Discretionary sector in the last three months. The company’s shares have increased 5.7%, while the sector grew 2.4%.Factors at PlayThough Whirlpool’s surprise history is not very impressive, its stock performance remains solid backed by the cost productivity initiatives, solid innovations and robust product pipeline. The company remains focused on its innovation strategy that aids in tapping additional sales and significant market share gains. Moreover, its solid integration and cost-productivity activities have been enhancing performance. These factors, along with a robust brands portfolio have been catalysts for the stock.These initiatives keep the company on track to deliver upon its long-term goals, which include EBIT margin growth of over 10% by 2020, organic sales growth of 3–5% every year, annualized earnings per share growth of 10–15% and generating free cash flows at 5–6% of revenues by 2018.Further, the company’s cost productivity programs are in place to deliver improved margins in 2017 and ahead. Evidently, the company delivered solid top-line growth in first-quarter 2017 driven by strength in North America and Latin America.However, the company’s results in the last reported quarter were impacted by raw material inflation and temporary integration challenges in Europe. Further, the company anticipates the integration related challenges to continue in the near term. Consequently, the company trimmed earnings forecasts for 2017.While Whirlpool’s long-term plans and solid brands portfolio reflect strength, we cannot ignore the near-term challenges hurting the results. That said, let’s wait and see if the company’s strategic efforts can aid in sustaining the stock momentum.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Whirlpool is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

163,CLX,"Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao (CBD  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 25. The company posted a positive earnings surprise of 30% in the preceding quarter.A glimpse at CBD’s stock performance shows that it has been gaining ground over the last six months. Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock have gained 12.4% over the said time frame, outperforming the industry’s 8.7% gain. Notably, the industry is part of the top 41% of the Zacks Classified industries (108 out of the 256).Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Which Way Are the Estimates Headed?Let’s look at the estimate revision trend in order to get a clear picture of what analysts expect from the company right before the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter and 2017 earnings has been stable over the last 30 days.Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Companhia Brasileira de Distribuicao QuoteWhat Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for CBD this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.CBD has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 6 cents. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive ESP to be confident about an earnings surprise. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Note that we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing a negative estimate revisions momentum.Factors at PlayOn Jul 12, the company announced sales results for the second quarter, wherein it reported net growth of 9.0% driven by strength at Assai and the Extra banner. Both Multivarejo and Assai continued to gain market traction in the quarter. However, sales growth was lower than the preceding quarter’s 9.5% hike on a year-over-year basis. Comparable store sales grew 13.5% in the quarter, with strong customer traffic expansion and increase in sales volume offsetting the effect of the slowdown in food inflation. Inflation levels declined from 5.2% in the first quarter to 2.3% in the second.During the second quarter, the company opened three stores, of which two were in the Minuto Pao de Acucar format and one in Assai (another four are under construction).We note that this Brazilian company has been showing strong improvement in Extra Hiper markets and consistent growth at Assai.Store openings and conversion of Extra Hiper stores to Assai is also boosting sales. The conversions will help accelerate expansion of GPA’s cash-and-carry banner into new cities and states across Brazil. We are also encouraged by the company’s operating efficiency and productivity projects. Further, a higher gross margin and a decline in selling, general and administrative expenses at Multivarejo boosted the EBITDA margin.However, CBD has been witnessing margin compression over the past many quarters. It is struggling to keep prices in check in the face of inflation in Brazil, which is hurting gross margin. Also, strong growth in the Assai business, though helping sales growth, is impacting margins as this business is characterized by low prices. A challenging economic scenario in Brazil has also dampened demand and consumer confidence.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

164,CLX,"Colgate-Palmolive Co. (CL  -  Free Report) posted adjusted earnings of 72 cents a share, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate and up 3% from 70 cents earned in the prior-year quarter.  Including one-time items, earnings came in at 59 cents a share compared with 67 cents reported in the year-ago period.Despite earnings beat, Colgate’s shares are down 2.3% during pre-market trading hours, as investors remained skeptical about the company’s top-line performance that fell short of expectations for the fifth straight quarter. In fact in the last three months, the stock has declined 2.1% compared with the broader industry’s growth of 2.9%.Deeper InsightTotal sales of $3,826 million dipped 0.5% from the year-ago period and came below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,885 million. The benefits of 1% increase in prices were offset by a 1% drop in global unit volumes and a negative impact of 0.5% from currency fluctuations.On an organic basis (excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestitures), the company’s sales were flat with last year. The flat results were due to the persistence of softness in North America and challenges in Asia-Pacific. This was considerably mitigated by strong organic sales growth in Latin America and the return to positive organic sales growth in Hill’s Pet Nutrition.Adjusted gross profit margin was 60.7%, up 50 basis points (bps), driven by benefits of cost-saving initiatives under the company’s funding-the-growth and 2012 Restructuring Program, along with better pricing. These were partly neutralized by increased raw and packaging material expenses, including currency exchange transactions costs.In the reported quarter, adjusted operating profit of $995 million dipped 1%, with the adjusted operating margin contracting 10 bps to 26% on 40 bps increase in adjusted selling, general & administrative expenses as a percentage of sales, offset by improved gross margin.Year to date, Colgate’s market share of manual toothbrushes has reached 32.8%. Further, the company continued to lead with market share in the global toothpaste with a gain of 43.6% year to date.Segment DiscussionNorth America net sales (20% of total sales) fell 3.5%, reflecting a 2% drop in unit volume and 1.5% decline in pricing. However, currency fluctuations were flat with the prior-year quarter. On an organic basis, sales declined 3.5% on account of market share losses in the dish liquid business and increased slowdown in category growth, both in the U.S.Latin America net sales (26% of total sales) jumped 7% year over year gaining from 4.5% increase in pricing and 2.5% volume gains, while currency fluctuations were flat with the prior-year quarter. Volume growth can mainly be attributed to increase in Brazil, the Andean region and Argentina. On an organic basis, sales increased 7%.Europe net sales (15% of total sales) slipped 3.5% year over year, due to 1% decline in unit volumes and negative impact of 3% from currency fluctuations, partially offset by 0.5% increase in pricing. Unit volumes were hurt by declines in Germany and Norway, offsetting gains in the Netherlands, U.K. and Poland. Europe organic sales dipped 0.5%.Asia Pacific net sales (18% of total sales) declined 5%, attributable to 2% decline in unit volume and 1.5% fall in pricing and 1.5% negative impact from currency fluctuations. Unit volumes declines in India, Thailand and Australia were partly offset by gains in the Philippines, Vietnam and New Zealand. On an organic basis, sales for Asia Pacific decreased 3.5% due to the inventory reductions by wholesalers in India in anticipation of the new Goods and Services Tax that went into effect on Jul 1, 2017. Additionally, increased competition related activities in Australia and lower consumptions in Thailand acted as headwinds.Africa/Eurasia net sales (6% of total sales) inched up 1% year over year, fueled by 4.5% jump in pricing and positive currency effects of 4%, partly offset by 7.5% drop in unit volumes. Volume declines in the Sub Saharan Africa region, Turkey and South Africa were partly offset by gains in Russia. Organic sales for Africa/Eurasia dropped 3%.Hill’s Pet Nutrition net sales (15% of total sales) were flat with the year-ago quarter. During the quarter, positive impact from 2% increase in pricing was neutralized by 1.5% decline in volumes and 0.5% negative impact from foreign exchange.

Net cash provided by operating activities came in at $1,305 million for the six months ended Jun 30, 2017.OutlookLooking forward, Colgate anticipates the backdrop to remain challenging due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide. Consequently, the company reiterated net sales projection for 2017 anticipating low-single digits growth. However, on account of the soft first half 2017, management now envisions organic sales growth for 2017 to be in the low-single digit range, compared with the previous forecast of moderately below 4–7% range.Nevertheless, the company remains encouraged by the progress on its 2012 Restructuring Program and continues to pursue additional savings opportunities under the program. In this regard, the company stated that the additional opportunities identified in the second-quarter provide visibility for reaching the upper end of its previously announced cost and savings guidance range.Consequently, on a GAAP basis, management forecasts gross margin expansion for the year. Further, it expects GAAP earnings per share, on a dollar basis, to decline in the mid-single-digit percentage range, compared with the previously stated flat guidance.Excluding charges related to the 2012 Restructuring Program and the other 2016 one-time items, Colgate continues to project low-single-digit earnings per share growth on a dollar basis for 2017. Further, the company anticipates robust operating cash flows, gross margin expansion and rise in advertising investment for the year.Zacks Rank & Key PicksColgate currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

165,CLX,"SUPERVALU Inc. (SVU  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report first-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jul 25, before the market opens.The question lingering in investors’ minds is, whether this leading grocery dealer will be able to deliver positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 6.7%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for SUPERVALU this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  SuperValu Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | SuperValu Inc. QuoteSUPERVALU has an Earnings ESP of 0.00% as both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are pegged at 10 cents. The company has a Zacks Rank #2, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, its ESP of 0.00% makes surprise prediction difficult. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 10 cents for the fiscal first quarter has been stable in the last 30 days and reflects year-over-year decline of 47.4% from 19 cents posted in the year-ago quarter. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents for fiscal 2018 shows growth from 29 cents delivered in fiscal 2017.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3.98 billion and $12.85 billion for the impending quarter and fiscal 2018, which are 23.5% and 14.2% lower than the respective year-ago periods.Factors at PlayWe note that SUPERVALU has been witnessing difficulties in delivering growth, of late. In fact, the company has been reporting lower-than-expected sales for the last few quarters, primarily due to soft comparable store-sales. Evidently, its top line has lagged estimates for seven of the last nine quarters.In addition, this leading grocery dealer is witnessing sluggish sales in the retail business due to tough competitive pressure, lower store traffic and deflationary environment in the food industry. Notably, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, retail sales fell 3.2% year over year with same-store sales remaining negative at 5.8%, thereby marking the eighth consecutive quarter of decline.We note that the food/grocery industry is grappling with a number of headwinds of late. Shift in consumer purchase decisions, evolving shopping behavior and increasing presence of small firms continue to plague the industry. Moreover, the fact that SUPERVALU is not completely immune to the industry’s headwinds, have been denting its financial results.Nonetheless, management at SUPERVALU is striving hard to spark a turnaround and return to its growth trajectory. The company is also geared to expand its retail banners in order to boost sales, along with the intent to capitalize on the private brands portfolio among the retail banners. Moreover, it is trying all means to rejuvenate its retail segment, reduce costs and increase operating efficiency.We commend SUPERVALU’s efforts to develop the wholesale operations, primarily through adding new customers, retaining and developing business with existing customers and acquisitions. In fact, the recent acquisition of Unified Grocers is expected to radically boost the company’s wholesale segment, alongside offering new growth opportunities across multiple geographies. Its wholesale business will drive the momentum further and boost its near-term results.Notably, SUPERVALU’s shares have rallied 10% in the last one month against the Zacks categorized Food – Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 2.8%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector fell 0.3%.Per the latest Earnings Outlook, total second-quarter 2017 earnings for the sector are expected to rise 3.9%, while revenues are projected to improve 1.5%. In fact, we observed that the Consumer Staples sector has lagged the broader market in the last one year. While the Zacks categorized sector gained 1.1%, the S&P 500 index advanced 13.5%.Stocks with Favorable CombinationHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

166,CLX,"McCormick & Company, Inc. (MKC  -  Free Report) recently announced plans to acquire food division of Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, a British consumer products company, for $4.2 billion. The transaction, subjected to regulatory approvals, will be funded through a combination of debt and equity and is expected to be completed either in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.Per Bloomberg, Reckitt has been looking to divest its food business since April, which invited many potential buyers including Post Holdings Inc. and Conagra Brands Inc. Other bidders included JM Smucker Co., Campbell Soup Co., Pinnacle Foods Inc. and Ajinomoto Co., as per sources. Unilever PLC (UL  -  Free Report) was also reportedly battling with meat producer Hormel Foods Corporation to buy the foods division of Reckitt Benckiser.Why is the Buyout a Strategic Fit for McCormick?McCormick, which is well known for manufacturing and distributing spices, seasonings, specialty foods and flavors to the entire food industry across the globe, has been strategically increasing its presence through acquisitions in order to grow its spices and seasonings portfolio. The acquisitions (Gourmet Garden in Apr 2016 and Enrico Giotti SpA in Dec 2016) contributed toward increasing sales by 3% during the second quarter of 2017, reported last month.The acquisition of Reckitt’s food division is a strategic one as it will significantly boost the company’s robust spices portfolio with iconic brands like Frank's RedHot Hot Sauce, French's Mustard, French's Crispy Vegetables and Cattlemen's BBQ Sauce. Notably, both Frank's RedHot and French's Mustard hold top most positions in their respective categories in the U.S. and Canada. As a result, these brands will position the company in the leading U.S. condiments category and will strengthen and expand McCormick's business presence internationally too. The deal is also expected to result in combined pro forma 2017 annual net sales of approximately $5 billion.SynergiesWith the addition of foods business, McCormick expects cost synergies of approximately $50 million which will be achieved by 2020. The company expects to achieve significant margin and earnings accretion in 2017 and will achieve additional favorable impacts following the realization of targeted synergies.Share Price Performance A promising portfolio combined with robust initiatives has been favoring the company which is well reflected in the share price performance of the company. The company has also delivered positive earnings surprise in 12 of the last 14 quarters. Shares of McCormick have moved up 5.1% in the last six months against the Zacks categorized Food–Miscellaneous/Diversified industry’s decline of 5.6%. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a VGM Score of “B” which further makes it attractive.However, negative impact of material costs and currency has been impacting the company’s performance of late. Currency headwinds of approximately 2% impacted the second-quarter results of the company. Such impacts are likely to persist throughout fiscal 2017.Bottom LineNevertheless, McCormick is expected to overcome these challenges on the back of sustained cost savings efforts and the growth arising out of strategic acquisitions.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks in the industry are The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report), both carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clorox and Colgate-Palmolive have long-term earnings growth rate of 6.8% and 9.2%, respectively.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana. Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

167,CLX,"Philip Morris International Inc. (PM  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20, before the opening bell.The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this tobacco leader will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Its earnings have lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average miss of 2.3%. Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What Does the Zacks Model Unveil?Our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Philip Morris this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP for this to happen.Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Philip Morris International Inc Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Philip Morris International Inc QuotePhilip Morris has an Earnings ESP of -1.63% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.21, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged higher at $1.23. Although the company’s Zacks Rank #2 increases the predictive power of ESP, we need a positive Earnings ESP in order to be confident about an earnings surprise. You may uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Which Way Are Estimates Treading?Let’s look at the estimate revisions in order to get a clear picture of what analysts are thinking about the company right before earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.23 for the second quarter has been stable in the last seven days and reflects growth from $1.15 posted in the prior-year period. However, the same has moved up by a penny to $4.90 for 2017 and also shows growth from $4.48 delivered in 2016.Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $7.06 billion and $28.63 billion for the impending quarter and 2017, which are also 6.2% and 7.3% higher than the respective year-ago periods.Factors Influencing the QuarterWe note that Philip Morris has been witnessing declining demand for cigarettes due to the ongoing anti-tobacco campaigns, government restrictions and rising taxes on it. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also made it mandatory for tobacco companies to use precautionary labels on cigarette packets to dissuade customers from smoking. These regulations adversely impact the company’s performance and, in turn, its overall profitability. Moreover, consumers are currently opting for e-cigarettes or substitutes for cigarettes, thereby affecting cigarette volume. Evidently, the company’s top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate in five of the trailing six quarters, including the last reported quarter.As smoking rates are declining in developed countries, the race to replace traditional cigarettes is putting pressure on the tobacco industry. Particularly, serious health hazards due to cigarette smoking have pushed consumers toward low-risk, reduced risk products. Therefore, Philip Morris is aggressively investing in creating smoke-free products such as IQOS (Heatsticks that heat tobacco instead of burning it) in order to boost its business and market share. Meanwhile, it continues to benefit from its strong portfolio of tobacco brands and always managed to remain afloat and generate revenues with higher cigarette pricing.We expect the company’s continued focus on accelerating IQOS volume growth and pricing actions will help it deliver upbeat results in the upcoming quarter as well as in 2017.Driven by these factors, shares of Philip Morris have rallied 30.1% year to date, comfortably outperforming the Zacks categorized Tobacco industry’s advance of 18.5%. Meanwhile, the broader Consumer Staples sector gained 9.2%.Stocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +0.67% and a Zacks Rank #2.

168,CLX,"Unilever NV (UN  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 20. Last quarter, the company delivered organic sales growth of 2.9% (in local currency).A glimpse of Unilever’s stock performance shows that its shares have been rallying for the last six months. Shares have rallied 37.4% over the said time frame, outperforming the Zacks categorized Soap & Cleaning Materials industry’s 13.1% gain. Notably, the industry is part of the top 3% of the Zacks Classified industries (7 out of the 256).Unilever currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and we believe there is much value in the stock which is quite evident from its VGM Score of ‘B’.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.What’s Driving the Stock?The Anglo-Dutch company Unilever has been trending higher on the back of its recent strategic business reviews, aiming to deliver profits and boost shareholders value amid sluggish growth and increasing competition in the global packaged goods industry.The consumer products giant is divesting its underperforming businesses and has reportedly decided to sell its unprofitable spreads business, including brands like Flora and Stork butter, in April. Furthermore, the company announced that it would buyback shares, hike dividends, raise cost savings target as well as combine foods and refreshments businesses.Unilever has also undertaken a program called Connected 4 Growth to reduce costs, under which individual expenses are reviewed during each accounting period rather than rolled over. The company is also consistently focusing on product improvement through innovation. Moreover, it has set a target for net debt of two times EBITDA, which would mean enough flexibility for acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders.Notably, Unilever has entered into many deals to fortify its position in home care and personal care products. These acquisitions will strengthen its portfolio and generate substantial revenues. Unilever is reportedly battling with meat producer Hormel Foods Corporation (HRL  -  Free Report) to buy the foods division of British consumer goods maker Reckitt Benckiser.Meanwhile, the company continues to struggle with declining volumes in Brazil. Further, it is witnessing softness in the developed markets in North America and Europe with little sign of recovery. Nevertheless, the company remains focused on boosting sales in the emerging markets which accounts for about two-thirds of the company’s total revenue. Though these markets are generally volatile, they offer robust long-term prospect.Unilever NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  Unilever NV Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Unilever NV QuoteStocks Poised to Beat Earnings EstimatesHere are some companies in the Consumer Staple sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

169,CLX,"Kellogg Company (K  -  Free Report) closed its operations in Venezuela, thanks to tumultuous economic condition. Poor access to raw materials due to economic barriers, supply chain disruptions and the limited access to dollars to import goods due to currency controls have disrupted operations of the company’s Venezuelan subsidiary.The Venezuelan division produced 75% of the breakfast cereals for the country, per the company's website and employed around 400 workers. Post the news of discontinuation of operations in Venezuela, Kellogg’s manufacturing plant has been captured by the leftist government, under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro. Importantly, Kellogg deconsolidated and changed to the cost method of accounting for the Venezuelan subsidiary in December 2016.What’s Exactly Happening in Venezuela?The oil-rich country of Venezuela is now reeling under hyperinflation and strict price controls. The country is divided between the followers of the United Socialist Party (PSUV), earlier led by Hugo Chávez and currently fronted by Nicolas Maduro, and those who want an end to the more than 15-years of rule of the party.Venezuela, having one of the largest oil reserves in the world, heavily depended on revenues from oil imports for sustenance. During the presidency of Hugo Chavez in early 2000s, oil prices were booming. The leader used this money to fund various social programs and was successful in addressing illiteracy, healthcare and poverty issues. Also, the price of key items, food and medicines were fixed at a rate below the cost of production to make it affordable. Chavez also restricted the conversion of national currency into dollars and fixed the rate.When oil prices began to fall the economy went haywire. The government failed to support the projects, paralyzing the country with poverty and inflation. Moreover, the government also stopped companies from raising prices to keep up with hyperinflation.Venezuelan President ReactsThe enraged president Maduro decided to hand the company over to the workers so that they can continue production. He believes that Kellogg’s exit is unconstitutional and has begun judicial proceedings against management.In retaliation, Kellogg said that the company is not responsible for the unauthorized use of the commercial names as well as brands and will exercise legal actions if needed.Importantly, Kellogg is not the first company to exit the country. Other companies include Clorox (CLX  -  Free Report), Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report) and General Motors (GM  -  Free Report). Though Kellogg stated that it looks forward to resume operations once conditions improve, we believe that chances are dim considering the dismal economic situation.Zacks RankKellogg currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

170,CLX,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) posted robust second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings per share which beat estimates, while revenues lagged the same. Notably, earnings marked the fifth straight quarterly beat, while sales missed estimates for after two consecutive beats.Q2 HighlightsQuarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.77 per share jumped 55% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. Results primarily gained from solid sales and lower effective tax rate, offset by fall in gross margin.Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Clorox Company (The) Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | Clorox Company (The) QuoteNet sales of $1,416 million advanced nearly 0.7% year over year, but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,430 million. The top-line growth was driven by improvement across the International, Lifestyle and Cleaning segments, backed by increased prices. This was partly offset by unfavorable mix.Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin, which contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 43% in the quarter. Lower margins can be attributed to elevated input costs associated with commodities and further contraction of the transportation market. Additionally, results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost savings initiatives, slightly mitigated by benefits of cost savings.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 1% to $472 million, mainly driven by strength in Home Care with higher shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, along with the launch of Scentiva branded products. This was partly offset by fall in Professional Products business, particularly due to the sale of Aplicare business in August 2017 and unfavorable mix within the segment.Household sales declined 3% to $410 million due to lower volumes in the Bags & Wraps, Cat Litter and Charcoal businesses, partly negated by double-digit gains in the Digestive Health business due to strength in the e-commerce channel.Sales at the Lifestyle segment improved 3% to $268 million driven by strength in Water Filtration, which witnessed double-digit volume growth, alongside the launch new Brita Long Last filters and Brita Stream pitchers. Top-line growth also reflected the benefits of improved sales in the Natural Personal Care business.In the International business segment, sales grew 4% to $266 million on the back of improved pricing. Volumes remained flat as gains in Canada were offset by decline in certain Asian and Latin American countries.FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $489 million, and long-term debt of $1,788 million. In first six months of fiscal 2018, the company generated $322 million of net cash from continuing operations.Looking AheadFollowing the second-quarter results, the company reiterated sales guidance for fiscal 2018, while it raised the earnings per share view to include the benefits of the new tax reform.The company continues to expect fiscal 2018 sales growth in a range of 1-3%. The guidance includes nearly 1 percentage point reduction in the fiscal year related to the Aplicare divestiture. It also reflects an estimated 3 percentage point gain from product innovation.Gross margin is now estimated to decline modestly due to elevated input costs associated with commodities and tightening of the transportation market. This compares with the earlier guidance of being down slightly.The company now envisions effective tax rate of 23-24% for fiscal 2018 compared with 32-33% guided earlier. In the long term, the company expects effective tax rate in the mid-20s range.Consequently, the company now anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to range from $6.17-$6.37 per share, up from the previous guidance of $5.47-$5.67 per share. The company expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share to include 70-75 cents per share gain from the new tax reform, which will be partly offset by lower gross margin. Clorox currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

However, the sector is likely to witness a year-over-year growth of 5.9% and 2.5% in earnings and revenues, respectively.Our research shows that when a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) stock is combined with a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of beating earnings estimates is high. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.All said, let’s see what awaits this Consumer Staples duo which is slated to report quarterly results on Feb 2.What’s in Store for EL and CLX?The Estee Lauder Companies Inc. (EL  -  Free Report) has been gaining from its solid focus on buyouts and product launches, sturdy foothold in the beauty space and robust online business. Driven by these efforts, this cosmetics giant marked its 13th and 3rd straight earnings and sales beat, respectively, in first-quarter fiscal 2018. While Estee Lauder has a solid presence in emerging markets, solid prospects from China appear bright as sales in this region soared nearly 50% in the first quarter. Management thus envisions continued strength in luxury products in China, which keeps it encouraged about making incremental investments in the region. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales from Asia/Pacific region is pegged at $763 million, depicting year-over-year growth of 15.8%.Moreover, the company’s skin care and makeup categories have been performing particularly well for nearly a year. We expect these categories to remain major drivers in the fiscal second quarter as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for skincare and makeup sales is currently pegged at $1,434 million and $1,515 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of about 15% and 16%, respectively. Also, the consensus mark for fragrance and hair care sales stands at $553 million and $147 million compared with the year-ago period sales of $497 million and $137 million, respectively.Clearly, Estee Lauder is expected to continue with its top- and bottom-line growth trend in the second quarter. Management forecasts net sales growth of 13-15% in the quarter. On a constant currency basis, sales are expected to improve 10-11%. Further, the company envisions adjusted earnings in the range of $1.38-$1.41 per share for the to-be-reported quarter, thereby marking an increase of 13% to 15% over the prior-year earnings. Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.44 for the second quarter moved up in the past 30 days, and represents more than 18% growth from the year-ago period. Moreover, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,673 million, up 14.5% from the year-ago reported figure.

173,CLX,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. This consumer goods company has been reporting weak organic sales growth along with continued market share losses for quite some time now (read more: Will New Products Lift Procter & Gamble's Q2 Sales?).However, the company has managed to post higher earnings despite tepid sales owing to productivity and cost savings plans in order to boost margins, thereby lifting profit level.Let’s take a look at how the company's margin is shaping up for this earnings season.In order to counter the tepid sales growth, Procter & Gamble has been benefiting from its ongoing cost-saving program aimed at reducing costs and driving efficiency. The company has been taking various restructuring initiatives aimed at generating higher profit and lowering costs. These initiatives have helped the company to accelerate margins growth amid the slowdown in sales.However, the company failed to expand margins in the last two reported quarters. In the last reported quarter, Procter & Gamble’s core gross margin decreased 40 basis points (bps) year over year to 51.2%, as productivity cost was more than offset by headwinds such as increased commodity costs, unfavorable geographic and product mix, and product reinvestments. Even, the company’s core operating margin decreased 40 bps year over year to 23% in the quarter, reflecting lower gross margins and higher marketing and overhead costs.That said, the company’s focus on reducing its SG&A (selling, general, and administrative) costs and lowering its marketing and advertising spending have helped it in supporting its operating margins to some extent. Its SG&A margin decreased 10 bps and productivity savings positively impacted its profitability by 190 bps.Overall, for the to-be-reported quarter, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s margins are likely to remain subdued due to higher input costs that has heightened further by the recent hurricanes. The company expects higher commodity costs, including pulp, kerosene, ethylene, and propylene, to adversely impact its profitability by $300 million in fiscal 2018.Again, unfavorable mix and lower pricing in the shave care category is likely to impact margins further. Procter & Gamble’s investing in price to drive sales of its razors and blades, due to increased competition from shave clubs, have affected its market share. Yet, productivity savings will partly offset these woes.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Gross Margin (TTM)  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Gross Margin (TTM) | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the Zacks Consumer Staples sector are Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

174,CLX,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is climbing charts, courtesy of its robust earnings trend in recent quarters. Additionally, the company’s upside story relates to the smooth progress on its 2020 Strategy as well as efforts to boost e-commerce sales. The positive effects of these elements are clearly visible in its solid stock movement.Stock SurgesThough shares of Clorox dropped 3.5% in the past month, it fared better than the industry’s decline of 5.1%. However, the stock witnessed growth of 3% after reporting solid results on May 2 while the industry dropped 0.2%.Clorox delivered earnings and sales beat in third-quarter fiscal 2018, marking its sixth straight earnings beat. Additionally, the company’s sales beat expectations in three of the last four quarters. Bottom lines primarily gained from solid sales and lower effective tax rate. Sales gains were driven by improvement across all segments, backed by higher volumes and prices.The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise  The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Clorox Company QuoteLet’s find out more about the growth drivers for this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Robust Sales ViewFollowing the strong third quarter, Clorox perked up its sales guidance for fiscal 2018, driven by incremental sales from innovation-led products and acquisition of Nutranext as well as improved pricing and revised tax rate. The company now projects sales growth of nearly 3%, which is at the high-end of its previous guidance of 1-3%. The guidance includes the contribution of 1 point from the Nutranext acquisition and an estimated 3-point gain from product innovation.2020 Strategy Bodes WellClorox is progressing with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. The whole strategy is aimed at achieving certain long-term aspirations, including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing EBIT margin by 25-50 basis points (bps) and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales all on a yearly basis. Clorox is well on track with its 2020 Strategy, which is meant to be achieved through key accelerators like investment in brands; development of e-commerce; technological advancements; enhancement of growth culture and focus on the 3Ds -- desire, decision and delight.Boosting E-commerce SalesIn response to the changing retail environment, Clorox is making strategic partnerships with retail customers and evolving capabilities, not only in the physical world but also online. In the past few years, Clorox has boosted digital capabilities, leading to a strong performance in e-commerce, which is now a significant revenue contributor. The company recorded nearly 40% annual growth in e-commerce sales in the last two fiscals. The company is on track to meet its 2020 target of generating $500 million of e-commerce sales.Possible DeterrentsThough earnings and sales topped estimates in third-quarter fiscal 2018, the soft-margin trend continued to be a headwind. The company witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the reported quarter, owing to elevated commodity and logistics expenses, which are likely to continue hurting margins in fiscal 2018. Driven by the soft margins, the company also trimmed its earnings guidance for fiscal 2018.Final ThoughtsClorox’s robust earnings trend, as well as growth strategies, positions it for growth ahead. However, soft margins may be a hurdle to earnings growth in the near-term, keeping investors worried.Do Consumer Staples Stocks Grab Your Attention?

175,CLX,"The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) posted impressive third-quarter fiscal 2018 results, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts. Earnings and revenues also improved on a year-over-year basis. This marks the company’s sixth straight quarter of earnings beat, with sales returning to positive after a miss in the previous quarter.Q3 HighlightsQuarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.37 per share were up 5% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30. The bottom line primarily gained from higher sales and lower effective tax rate, offset by contraction in gross margin.The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise The Clorox Company Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise | The Clorox Company QuoteNet sales of $1,517 million advanced nearly 2.7% year over year and marginally came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,511 million. Top-line growth can be attributed to improvement across all the company’s segments as well as 2020 Strategy, which focuses on boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. Also, volume growth of 3% in the quarter along with higher prices aided the increase in revenues. The uptick was somewhat compensated with adverse mix and negative impact from the sale of the Aplicare business.Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin, which contracted 120 basis points (bps) to 42.8% in the quarter. Lower margins can be attributed to elevated commodity and logistics expenses, which were partly mitigated with gains from cost savings and higher prices.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 3% to $513 million, mainly driven by gains in Home Care, showing strength in Clorox disinfecting wipes along with the launch of Scentiva branded products. This was partly offset by fall in Professional Products business, particularly due to the sale of Aplicare business in August 2017.Household sales inched up 1% to $493 million backed by double-digit gains in the Cat Litter business owing to broad-based business strength. This was partly offset with lower shipments in Charcoal owing to unfavorable weather throughout the quarter.Sales at the Lifestyle segment improved 2% to $252 million driven by all-time record shipments of Hidden Valley bottled dressings and gains in the Natural Personal Care business. The upside was negated by lower shipments in Water Filtration due to a timing shift in the merchandising activity.At the International business segment, sales grew 4% to $259 million backed by improved pricing and increased volumes in Canada. However, these factors were offset by adverse mix and foreign currency exchange rates.FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,174 million, and long-term debt of $1,789 million. In the nine months of fiscal 2018, the company generated $574 million of net cash from continuing operations.2018 GuidanceClorox updated its guidance for fiscal 2018 to include the effects from the acquisition of Nutranext and revised tax rate.The company now projects sales growth of nearly 3% compared with the earlier guided range of 1-3%. The guidance includes contribution of 1 point from the Nutranext acquisition and an estimated 3 points gain from product innovation. Also, it includes nearly 1 point reduction in the fiscal year related to the Aplicare divestiture.Gross margin is now estimated to decline in the range of 100-150 bps due to estimated impacts from one-time charges with respect to the Nutranext acquisition. Also, it reflects higher logistics and commodity expenses.For fiscal 2018, the company envisions effective tax rate of 22-23% compared with 23-24% guided earlier.Consequently, management now anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to be in the range of $6.15-$6.30 per share, down from the previous guidance of $6.17-$6.37 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $6.17, which is likely to witness downtrend in the coming days.Clorox currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

Earnings of these companies have increased 25.1% from the year-ago quarter, while revenues have risen 10%.Further, earnings and revenues are well on track to mark the highest growth in seven years. As a whole, earnings for the S&P 500 companies are anticipated to improve 22.6% year over year on revenue growth of 8.4%. In fourth-quarter 2017, earnings and revenues rose 13.4% and 8.6%, respectively.A Look at Consumer StaplesThe performance of the index is determined by all 16 Zacks sectors, out of which 15 are expected to witness year-over-year earnings growth this season. The Consumer Staples sector being one of them is expected to record earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue increase of 3.1%.The Consumer Staples sector is currently placed at the bottom 6% (15 of 16) of all Zacks sectors, thanks to several bottlenecks. The sector has long been grappling with rising input costs as well as intense competition. This, in turn, has created significant pricing pressure, compelling companies to undertake aggressive promotional activities. Owing to such deterrents, the sector has lost 5.9% in a year, while the S&P 500 market gained 11.7%.Amid such challenges, companies operating in the segment have been trying to keep afloat through innovation, strategic buyouts and restructuring efforts in sync with a changing consumer landscape. Additionally, the recent tax cuts are expected to favor Consumer Staples companies.Considering the diverse factors, let’s see what’s in store for the following stocks when they release their quarterly results on May 2.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of a positive earnings surprise is high.

For the quarter under review, analysts polled by Zacks expect net sales of $2,436 million, down from $2,449 million in the year-ago quarter. Also, input cost inflation is a concern as management expects input cost inflation in 2018 to be nearly $50 million greater than 2017, on account of aluminum and diesel fuel among other inputs. To top it, Molson Coors has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and Earnings ESP of -0.21%, which dim the possibility of an earnings beat.

It has also been undertaking several restructuring initiatives to reduce costs and boost profits. Given these factors, along with expected gains from tax reforms, Zacks analysts expect earnings in the quarter to grow 5.3% year over year to 80 cents. However, the estimate has gone down by 4 cents over the past 30 days. (Read More: Will Soft U.S. Volumes Dent Molson Coors Q1 Earnings?)The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC  -  Free Report) has been experiencing top-line weaknesses for a while, thanks to unfavorable demand conditions in the United States and Canada.

(Read More: Will Weak Sales Hurt Kraft Heinz's Earnings in Q1?)Owing to such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect only nominal growth in Kraft Heinz’s first-quarter sales. Further, the consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 82 cents, reflecting a 2.4% year-over-year fall.This Zacks Rank #3 company has been striving to boost its performance through savings initiatives, innovations and strategic investments to enhance brand performance. However, such efforts are less likely to reflect in the results this season. Further, owing to its Earnings ESP of -0.20%, a bottom-line beat seems unlikely this time around.The Clorox Company’s (CLX  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 performance is likely to benefit from dedicated brand management, cost savings and productivity initiatives. Also, it undertakes strategic partnerships to expand capabilities across its online and brick-and-mortar platforms. Recently, management agreed to buy Nutranext, the Florida-based dietary supplements leader, for $700 million. Additionally, it is progressing with the smooth execution of its 2020 Strategy, which is aimed at boosting growth for the improvement of categories and overall market share. In the light of such factors, analysts polled by Zacks expect quarterly revenues of $1,511 billion, up 2.3% from the year-ago quarter.However, Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin in the fiscal second quarter, which is likely to continue. Margin was strained by escalated input costs for commodities and tightening of the transportation market. Also, results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost-saving initiatives, which might continue to drive expenses and hurt profits. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.30 for the quarter under review moved south by a penny over the last 30 days and reflects a decline of 0.8% year over year. Further, Clorox’s Earnings ESP of -0.33% and a Zacks Rank #4 indicate there are little chances of an earnings beat this earnings season. (Read More: Will Clorox Retain Positive Earnings Trend in Q3?)The Estee Lauder Companies Inc.’s (EL  -  Free Report) third-quarter fiscal 2018 results are expected to reflect well-chalked buyouts, innovation, saving efforts, extensive market reach as well as robust online and travel retail network. This cosmetics stalwart has made several strategic acquisitions, such as BECCA and Too Faced, to enhance its portfolio. It also boasts a strong online business and expects it to be a major growth catalyst in the years to come. Estee Lauder continues to focus on enhancing travel retail business, which has lately emerged as a major sales driver. Management stated that growth in this category is majorly fueled by continued investments in emerging markets, particularly Asia, along with double-digit increase in five of its biggest brands in the travel retail network.Buoyed by such factors, the company expects adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1.02-$1.04 for the third quarter, which marks a considerable increase from the prior projection of 91 cents. On a constant currency basis, adjusted earnings are expected to improve 7-9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.07. Moreover, the company’s Earnings ESP of +0.67% combined with a Zacks Rank #3 makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat this season.  Further, analysts polled by Zacks expect revenues of $3,234 million, up 13.2% from the prior year. Also, management forecasts sales growth of 12-13% in the third quarter.However, management anticipates lower sales from North America due to a decline in retail traffic in the U.S. brick-and-mortar stores.

With focus on investing in brands being a key part of its strategy, this consumer products’ maker recently agreed to purchase Nutranext — the Florida-based dietary supplements leader — for $700 million.The deal is expected to expand the Clorox's dietary supplements business, thereby accelerating growth of its top brands in the fast-growing categories alongside focusing on health and wellness. It also acquired the RenewLife brand, digestive health leader in May 2016, which has been significantly contributing to the Clorox’s e-commerce and extended distribution in the retail businesses.Expected to close in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the deal is likely to reduce GAAP earnings by 7-11 cents per share in the quarter and 8-12 cents in fiscal 2019. Thereafter, the deal will be accretive to earnings in fiscal 2020.

181,CLX,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 6.7% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is CLX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Clorox Beats on Q2 Earnings, Raises FY18 EPS ViewThe Clorox Company posted robust second-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings per share which beat estimates, while revenues lagged the same. Notably, earnings marked the fifth straight quarterly beat, while sales missed estimates for after two consecutive beats.Q2 HighlightsQuarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.77 per share jumped 55% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.22. Results primarily gained from solid sales and lower effective tax rate, offset by fall in gross margin.Net sales of $1,416 million advanced nearly 0.7% year over year, but lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,430 million. The top-line growth was driven by improvement across the International, Lifestyle and Cleaning segments, backed by increased prices. This was partly offset by unfavorable mix.Clorox witnessed significant pressure on gross margin, which contracted 170 basis points (bps) to 43% in the quarter. Lower margins can be attributed to elevated input costs associated with commodities and further contraction of the transportation market. Additionally, results were hurt by strategic investments in growth and cost savings initiatives, slightly mitigated by benefits of cost savings.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 1% to $472 million, mainly driven by strength in Home Care with higher shipments of Clorox disinfecting wipes, along with the launch of Scentiva branded products. This was partly offset by fall in Professional Products business, particularly due to the sale of Aplicare business in August 2017 and unfavorable mix within the segment.Household sales declined 3% to $410 million due to lower volumes in the Bags & Wraps, Cat Litter and Charcoal businesses, partly negated by double-digit gains in the Digestive Health business due to strength in the e-commerce channel.Sales at the Lifestyle segment improved 3% to $268 million driven by strength in Water Filtration, which witnessed double-digit volume growth, alongside the launch new Brita Long Last filters and Brita Stream pitchers. Top-line growth also reflected the benefits of improved sales in the Natural Personal Care business.In the International business segment, sales grew 4% to $266 million on the back of improved pricing. Volumes remained flat as gains in Canada were offset by decline in certain Asian and Latin American countries.FinancialsClorox ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $489 million, and long-term debt of $1,788 million. In first six months of fiscal 2018, the company generated $322 million of net cash from continuing operations.Looking AheadFollowing the second-quarter results, the company reiterated sales guidance for fiscal 2018, while it raised the earnings per share view to include the benefits of the new tax reform.The company continues to expect fiscal 2018 sales growth in a range of 1-3%. The guidance includes nearly 1 percentage point reduction in the fiscal year related to the Aplicare divestiture. It also reflects an estimated 3 percentage point gain from product innovation.Gross margin is now estimated to decline modestly due to elevated input costs associated with commodities and tightening of the transportation market. This compares with the earlier guidance of being down slightly.The company now envisions effective tax rate of 23-24% for fiscal 2018 compared with 32-33% guided earlier. In the long term, the company expects effective tax rate in the mid-20s range.Consequently, the company now anticipates fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to range from $6.17-$6.37 per share, up from the previous guidance of $5.47-$5.67 per share. The company expects fiscal 2018 earnings per share to include 70-75 cents per share gain from the new tax reform, which will be partly offset by lower gross margin.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?In the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions higher for the current quarter compared to one lower.Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus  Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus | Clorox Company (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, CLX has an average Growth Score of C, a grade with the same score on the momentum front.  The stock was also allocated a grade of C on the value side, putting it in the middle 20% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.Based on our scores, the stock is equally suitable for momentum, value and growth investors.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions has been stable. Notably, CLX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

182,CLX,"Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL  -  Free Report) has been gaining on the recent progress of its savings program. Moreover, the company remains well poised with innovation, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives. However, strained margins remain a threat.Let’s analyze the pros and cons of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock.Robust Savings Plan: A Key ToolColgate remains optimistic about its Global Growth and Efficiency Program as well as Funding the Growth undertakings, which are delivering impressive results. Also, the company has extended its Global Growth and Efficiency Program through Dec 31, 2019. This will enable the company to take advantage of the incremental opportunities in the process of streamlining operations. Additionally, it expects after-tax savings from the program to increase to $500-$575 million compared with $425-$475 million projected earlier.In fact, Colgate’s four-year Global Growth and Efficiency Program will help the company to improve gross and operating profit and enhance its market share position worldwide. By funding the growth initiative, the company intends to open new environmentally sustainable distribution centers to offer better service to its customers, besides reducing fuel and transportation costs. The aforementioned endeavors are expected to contribute significantly toward the improvement of gross and operating margins over the long term.Innovation Aids GrowthColgate has been undertaking innovation and in-store implementation, as a key component of its growth strategies, over many years. This has enabled the company to capture the market share across all regions and categories. On the innovation front, it is coming up with Naturals, an innovation to counter local toothpaste brands, particularly in Asia and Eurasia. Colgate has managed to tailor the Naturals offerings in each of its major markets as well.Decent Earnings Trend & Bullish OutlookColgate has delivered in-line earnings for the third consecutive quarter in fourth-quarter 2017. In fact, this marked the company’s fifth in-line earnings in the last six quarters. Results can be attributed to solid sales and significant market share gains. Going forward, the company remains on track with the brand building and productivity maximization initiatives.Following the results, Colgate provided a bullish outlook for 2018. The company now anticipates net sales to increase in the mid-single-digit range and organic sales growth of low to mid-single digit. Also, including benefits from the tax reform, GAAP earnings are envisioned to improve in the double-digits range while adjusted earnings are anticipated to be up nearly 10%.Bottom LineWhile all seems well with Colgate, it is currently plagued with strained margins for the past few quarters. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company faced increased raw material and packaging costs as well as higher advertising expenses, thus creating pressure on margins.Looking ahead, the company expects adjusted gross margin to expand 50-70 bps in 2018. However, it also expects to incur higher advertising expenses, which is likely to weigh upon operating margins. In addition, Colgate anticipates the challenging backdrop to persist due to uncertain global markets and slowing category growth worldwide.Consequently, shares of Colgate have lost 2.4% in the past three months, outperforming the industry’s decline of 6.8%.Nevertheless, Colgate’s robust savings program, innovations, brand building and productivity maximization initiatives are likely to drive long-term growth.Looking for More Promising Bets?

187,CLX,"The Procter & Gamble Company (PG  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter fiscal 2018 results on Jan 23, before market open. This consumer goods company has been struggling to boost sales for the last few years. Weak volumes and slowing market share growth have been hurting its sales. Soft consumer-spending environment in developed markets, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom, also adds to the worries.The company’s total sales grew only 1% in the first quarter. The improvement during the last reported quarter was due to higher shipment volumes. However, lower pricing had a negative impact on sales. Organic sales grew 1%, softer than 2% growth in the prior quarter.Nonetheless, this $65-billion conglomerate remains focused on balanced growth through improved product, packaging, and marketing initiatives in order to boost sales.Resultantly, Procter & Gamble’s shares have gained 3.2% in the last six months, compared with the industry’s growth of 1.2%.Let’s see how the company's top line is shaping up for this earnings season.Although the company has refrained from providing any quarter-specific sales guidance, the company’s management remains positive and expects new product launches to improve sales in fiscal 2018. Its innovation-led products like premium Olay and SK-II products are creating higher demand and the trend is likely to follow in the to-be-reported quarter as well. Procter & Gamble anticipates 3% growth in sales for the year. Organic sales are expected in the range of 2-3%.Segment Discussion: The Fabric Care and Home Care segment (accounting for 33% of the total sales) is likely to witness 1.9% sequential and 4.1% year-over-year growth to $5.5 billion per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, banking on improvement in both Fabric Care and Home Care divisions.The company’s Baby, Feminine and Family Care segment (accounting for 27% of its total sales) revenues of $4.8 billion is expected to grow 2.6% year over year and 4.9% sequentially in the second quarter, per the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company remains upbeat about China Baby Care sales this fiscal year and expects Pampers to return to share growth, marking a significant turnaround. Again, premium innovations like Whisper Infinity and Radiant is likely to drive Family Care organic sales.The company’s Beauty segment (19% of total sales) revenues of $3.1 billion is expected to decline 2.1% sequentially but witness 4.5% growth year over year, banking on improvements in Skin & Personal Care, owing to continued growth across PG’s “superpremium” SK-II skincare brand in China.Again, the consensus estimate for Health Care (11%) segment revenues of $2.1 billion are likely to increase 11.6% sequentially and 2.5% year over year. On the other hand, consensus estimate for Grooming segment (10% of total sales) revenues of $1.7 billion indicates an increase of 10.7% from the prior quarter but a decline of 2.4% on a year-over-year basis. Aggressive competitive activity, changes in grooming fashions and habits, and increasing online competitors in some markets like the United States are hurting the performance of the grooming segment.Overall, for the fiscal second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $17.34 billion, reflecting a sequential growth of 4.1%. Revenues of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company are likely to increase 2.9% year-over-year. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The soft category growth rate in developed countries and higher competition in the United States like Dollar Shave Club and Harry’s Razor in the male grooming category is likely to hurt the company’s razors and blades’ sales. Again, lower pricing owing to increased competition in the shave care category and higher commodity costs are added woes. That said, new product launches are likely to offset the negatives.Procter & Gamble Company (The) Revenue (TTM)  Procter & Gamble Company (The) Revenue (TTM) | Procter & Gamble Company (The) QuoteStocks to ConsiderA few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Church & Dwight Company, Inc.

189,CLX,"A small handful of multinational conglomerates seemingly own almost every major consumer packaged goods brand, food company, or restaurant chain—yet some big-name brands and firms have managed to survive, sometimes for decades, all on their own.Nestle (NSRGY  -  Free Report), PepsiCo (PEP  -  Free Report), Coca-Cola (KO  -  Free Report), Kraft-Heinz (KHC  -  Free Report), Unilever (UN  -  Free Report), General Mills (GIS  -  Free Report), Yum! Brands (YUM  -  Free Report), and an array other firms dominate consumer-facing industries, snatching up brands left and right. The reach of these multibillion-dollar companies is greater than ever, especially as some of the largest companies begin to join forces in order to compete long-term on a grand scale.But there will always be companies that avoid being swallowed up by brands for various reasons, especially if their stocks are performing well and their bottom lines continue to grow.Now let’s look at four companies that are almost certainly household names throughout the U.S. that many people might find hard to believe are still their own publicly traded firms.Tootsie Roll Industries, Inc. Little tiny Tootsie Rolls have been staples in Halloween baskets for decades. But the candy company’s success might make investors think it got scooped up by a candy giant, such as Mars, years ago. On the contrary, Tootsie Roll has turned into a bit of a powerhouse itself.The company now boasts an array of different candy brands—from Blow Pop and Caramel Apple Pops to Dots and even Junior Mints. With a market cap of $2.38 billion, shares of Tootsie Roll have climbed steadily in recent years. The candy power’s stock now sits just a few dollars below its all-time high of $40.44 per share and has popped from under $20 a share just over five years ago.The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report)Like Tootsie Roll, Clorox has turned itself into a bit of a conglomerate. The cleaning company’s brands include Green Works, Pine-Sol, Glad, 409, and others. With a market cap of nearly $17 billion, the company is certainly not small and wouldn’t be easily acquired, but with giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG) and Kimberly-Clark (KMB  -  Free Report) out there lurking, it is a testament to the company’s strength that it still stands on its own.The company, which has been around for more than 100 years, is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but earned an “A” for Growth in our Style Scores system. Shares of Clorox have soared over the last decade and have gained 9.40% since the start of the year.Nathan's Famous, Inc. The host of the famous 4th of July hot dog eating contest has been churning out cased-meats since 1916. Nathan’s Famous is a small cap company with a market cap of around $310 million, and it has seen its stock price do a 360-degree turn in just the last two years. Nathan’s stock sat at an all-time high of over $81 per share in 2015 before it sank to $30 a share. Shares then climbed back slowly and now rest at around $74.The company owns a line of grocery store dogs, burgers, fries, and pickles, as well as a chain of restaurants, yet it has not been scarfed up by big chains such as Yum! Brands.Hostess Brands, Inc. (TWNK  -  Free Report)This iconic maker of Twinkies, Ho Hos, and others screams Americana. It is hard to believe that Hostess Brands has not been bought by a big CPG company, but, it in fact, just recently went public.Hostess Brands was almost bankrupt less than a decade ago, then two investment firms bought the company out of liquidation in 2013. The company then went public in 2016. With a market cap of $1.78 billion, the newly public snack maker’s stock price has fared well. Shares of the company that has been around since before the Great Depression gained a modest 6.15% since the start of the year, but Hostess Brands is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market.Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it.

190,CLX,"Consumer goods behemoth, The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) is riding on its strategy for 2020, impressive earnings history and other growth initiatives. These factors have helped the company gain 14.6% so far this year, outperforming the Zacks Consumer Staples sector’s 12.5% growth. However, the company remains vulnerable to the threats of rising commodity costs and stiff industry competition. Will these hurdles limit Clorox’s growth? Let’s delve deeper and find out.Impressive Earnings Surprise History Despite a Tough ScenarioClorox’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results marked its third straight quarter of earnings beat, while sales reverted to its positive surprise track after a miss in the preceding quarter. Further, both the top and bottom lines grew year over year, with sales growth witnessed in each segment. Even in the face of a challenging retail environment, Clorox managed to deliver a robust show, as earnings gained from strong sales and cost savings, whereas sales were fueled by higher volumes, better International pricing and benefits from RenewLife. The company’s fiscal 2017 performance also remained robust with solid top and bottom line growth year over year.Further, management remains encouraged with its International operations, and expects pricing and cost savings to continue driving results. That said, the company expects fiscal 2018 to represent another year of strong earnings and sales growth. For fiscal 2018, Clorox expects sales to grow in a range of 2-4% and earnings from continuing operations to rise 3-7% year over year to $5.52-$5.72 per share.Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus  Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus | Clorox Company (The) QuoteStrategy for 2020 – A Major Growth Driver  Much of the credit for Clorox’s past performance can be attributed to its focus on the 2020 strategy, which is directed toward improvement of categories and overall market share. The whole plan is aimed at achieving certain long-term targets, including growing net sales by 3-5%, increasing EBIT margin by 25-50 bps and generating free cash flow of 10-12% of sales, all on a yearly basis. Clorox intends to achieve these goals through key accelerators like investment in brands, development of e-commerce and technological advancements.Focus on Brand Management Bodes Well   Clorox’s approach to brand management allows each of its brands to develop further through rigorous research and development, marketing strategies, financial control and operating leverage. Clorox’s focus on boosting sales through brands is well evident from its constant innovations and marketing strategies. Incidentally, these efforts fueled sales and volume growth of 3% each, in the fiscal fourth quarter. Given these factors, strength of many of its brands along with opportunities in distribution, we believe that the company is set for significant long-term growth.High Commodity Costs & Stiff Competition Weigh Upon Estimates   Well, management stated that competition has intensified — especially across core categories like litter and trash bags — which remains a threat to margins. Further, the company remains troubled by inflationary pressure and escalating commodity expenses. Apart from this, unfavorable currency translations, a tough pricing environment and difficult economic conditions in the International region remain a worry. Management also expects softness in Argentina to linger for a while.It looks like these factors weighed upon analysts’ sentiments. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter and fiscal 2018 have declined 2.8% to $1.40 and 0.7% to $5.65, over the past 60 days.As these factors are likely to impede Clorox’s growth, it remains to be seen if this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s focus on its 2020 strategy and continued innovations can maintain its momentum.Can’s get Over Consumer Staples?

191,CLX,"It has been about a month since the last earnings report for The Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report). Shares have added about 2.4% in that time frame, outperforming the market.Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsClorox released fourth-quarter fiscal 2017 results. Quarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.53 per share jumped 21% year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.49. Results gained from solid sales and cost-savings, somewhat countered by increase in manufacturing and logistic expenses.Net sales of $1,647 million advanced nearly 3% year over year, also coming ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,640.9 million. During the quarter, gains from 3% volume growth, higher pricing at the International business and benefits from RenewLife (acquired in May 2016) were somewhat negated by unfavorable mix.Clorox’s gross margin expanded 30 basis points (bps) to 45.7% in the quarter, thanks to efficient cost savings and improved pricing, somewhat offset by increase in manufacturing and logistics expenses and greater commodity expenses.Revenue by SegmentSales in the Cleaning segment improved 2% to $502 million, with a 4% rise in volumes. Volumes mainly gained from the strength in Home Care, particularly Clorox disinfecting wipes, along with strong volumes at the Professional Products’ cleaning brands.Household sales grew 4% to $632 million, with volumes rising 5%. Volumes were mainly aided by the RenewLife acquisition, benefits from Cat Litter and greater shipments from Glad premium trash bags.Sales at the Lifestyle segment rose 2% to $258 million, while volumes dipped 1% due to reduced shipments from KC Masterpiece barbeque sauces, partly compensated by strength in Burt's Bees Natural Personal Care.In the International business segment, sales grew 5% to $255 million. Further, volumes inched up 1% on the back of strength in Asia and Europe. This was partially negated by softness in certain Latin American countries, especially Argentina.Fiscal 2017: At a GlanceFiscal 2017 earnings from continuing operations of $5.35 per share jumped 9% year over year and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.30. Net sales of $5,973 million advanced nearly 4% year over year, beating our estimate of $5,967 million.FinancialsClorox ended the year with cash and cash equivalents of $418 million, and long-term debt of $1,391 million. In fiscal 2017, the company generated $871 million of net cash from continuing operations, while it deployed $231 million as capital expenditure. Thus, the adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2017 amounted to$640 million.Looking AheadClorox remains impressed with its fourth-quarter outcome, wherein it witnessed sales growth in each segment. Further, the company’s fiscal 2017 performance remained robust with both the top and the bottom line growing year over year. The company is also pleased with the progress at its International operations. While the retail landscape is expected to be more competitive in fiscal 2018, the company’s focus on its 2020 strategy and continued investments in innovating products and brands, is likely to keep it going. All said, management expects fiscal 2018 to represent another year of strong earnings and sales growth.Considering all factors, the company issued its fiscal 2018 outlook. The company expects fiscal 2018 sales growth in a range of 2–4%, with about three points contribution from innovations, and nearly 1 point gain from pricing. This is expected to be partly offset by an adverse currency impact of 1 point.Gross margin is estimated to expand slightly on the back of better pricing and expected gains from cost savings. However, this will somewhat countered by higher commodity costs and greater manufacturing and logistic expenses. SG&A expenses, as a percentage of sales, is anticipated to be lesser than 14% in fiscal 2018. This also falls in line with Clorox’s long-term goal.Consequently, the company envisions fiscal 2018 earnings from continuing operations to range from $5.52–$5.72 per share. This reflects year-over-year growth of 3–7%.How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then? Following the release, investors have witnessed a downward trend in fresh estimates. There have been four revisions lower for the current quarter.Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus  Clorox Company (The) Price and Consensus | Clorox Company (The) QuoteVGM ScoresAt this time, Clorox's stock has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the momentum front with an D.  The stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.The company's stock is suitable solely for growth based on our styles scores.OutlookEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock. The magnitude of this revision also indicates a downward shift.  Notably, the stock has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We are looking for an inline return from the stock in the next few months.

192,CLX,"Markets gained traction on Tuesday following reports that the Trump administration had made significant progress on tax reforms. All three benchmarks posted their best one-day percentage increase for the week. Also, Trump’s speech, during which he refused to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan sent defense stocks higher, further boosting broader markets. The Norwegian sovereign-fund, also world’s biggest sovereign fund, increased its exposure to the global market. This news also boosted the sentiment and overall the markets finished higher.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 21,899.89, gaining 0.9% or 196.14 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) increased 1% or 24.14 points to close at 2,452.51. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,297.48, increasing 84.35 points or about 1.4%. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,955 to 847.  On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1,965 to 855.Trump Administration Make Progress on Tax LegislationAccording to a report in Politico magazine, President Trump and his team have made considerable progress toward shaping tax reform plans. This report was received positively by the investors and broader markets gained. This also marks the GOP’s movement beyond the six-paragraph framework laid out in July. This development comes at the right time, just when the market is recovering from setbacks it suffered last week.The tax reform team is led by Chief Economic Advisor Gary Cohn, U.S. Secretary of Treasury Steven Mnuchin, Senator Mitch McConnell, House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Finance Chair Orrin Hatch, and Ways & Means Committee Chair Kevin Brady. Together, they are also known asthe “Big 6”. However, market watchers still remain skeptical of Trump administration’s ability to push through the much awaited reforms. This is because of the muddled domestic political scenario following the backlash the President faced after the Charlottesville incident, the investigation of a possible Russian involvement in 2016 elections and the divide within the Republican Party.President’s Speech on AfghanistanIn a primetime address on Monday, Trump announced that the U.S. would not be hasty in withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. He reasoned this would provide a chance for terrorists to almost instantly return to power, referring to the situation in Iraq post withdrawal of U.S. troops. This statement also boosted investor sentiment after defense stocks gained traction, led by shares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) which surged 1.7%. This resulted in the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) gaining 1.2%.Norwegian Fund to Raise Equity ExposureThe $970 billion Norwegian sovereign fund is slated to raise its equity holdings to 70% in a bid to increase its exposure to the global market. World’s biggest sovereign fund has returned almost 202 billion kroner or $26 billion in the second quarter. This development also boosted the overall sentiment and led to broad based gains for the market.Investors Await Jackson Hole MeetingThe market has suffered low trade volumes lately. At the day’s close, 2.76 million shares were traded on NYSE and 1.59 billion shares were traded on Nasdaq. The daily average volume for August for NYSE is 3.16 billion whereas that for Nasdaq is 1.84 billion.One of the reasons for such a lull is the reluctance of traders to make large bets ahead of the annual Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium to start this Thursday. Investors have also been closely following the bond market ahead of the meeting to have the central bankers in attendance. However, economists have clearly stated that it would be wrong to expect any major monetary policy related announcements.Stocks That Made HeadlinesVerizon Communications Restructures Unlimited Data PlansU.S. telecom behemoth, Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report), has restructured and modernized its unlimited wireless data plans, so as to reach out to customers’ more diversified needs.(Read More)Investors Punish Lowe's on Q2 Earnings & Sales MissLowe’s Companies, Inc. (LOW  -  Free Report) posted lower-than-expected second-quarter fiscal 2017 results.(Read More)Clorox Divests Aplicare Skin Unit to Medline IndustriesThe Clorox Company (CLX  -  Free Report) announced the sale of its Aplicare skin antisepsis business to Medline Industries.
