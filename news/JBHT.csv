The score shows how a stock's price behavior over the trailing 52 weeks holds up against all the other stocks in our database. Decades of market research shows that the market's biggest winners often have an RS Rating of over 80 as they begin their biggest price moves. See if Hunt JB Transportation Services can continue to show renewed price strength and clear that threshold. Looking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch? Start HereHunt JB Transportation Services broke out earlier, but has fallen back below the prior 102.48 entry from a consolidation. If a stock you're watching breaks past a buy point then falls 7% or more below the original entry price, it's considered a failed base. It's best to wait for the stock to form a new pattern and breakout. Also understand that the latest consolidation is a later-stage base, which makes it riskier to establish a new position or add shares to an existing one. The company posted -4% EPS growth in its most recent report. Sales rose 7%. The next quarterly numbers are expected on or around Oct. 17.The company earns the No. 6 rank among its peers in the Transportation-Truck industry group.

16,JBHT,"Futures for the S&P 500 index, Nasdaq 100 and Dow industrials rose slightly Tuesday morning vs. fair value ahead of notable economic data and comments from Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen.XThe Nasdaq composite led Monday's selling, testing its 50-day moving average as Facebook (FB) plunged through that key support, Tesla (TSLA) triggered multiple sell signals and Apple (AAPL) kept falling.Meanwhile, a large number of mostly tech breakouts joined Apple and Tesla underwater, including Alibaba (BABA), Square (SQ) and Nvidia (NVDA).

But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well. Boeing and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are among those in buy zones. General Dynamics (GD) is close.Hilton Worldwide (HLT), Marriott International (MAR), and Hyatt Hotels (H) are among several hotel operators that have broken out. But they've generally broken out on light-to-lackluster volume. Casino stocks have been doing well, though Melco Resorts (MLCO) fell below a buy point and Wynn Resorts (WYNN) nearly did so.D.R. Horton (DHI), Toll Bros. (TOL) and LGI Homes (LGIH) are all near buy points.On a related note, Home Depot crept out to a buy point on Monday, but in below-average volume.RELATED:The Big Picture: Tech Stocks Crushed As Nasdaq Reaches A Key TestWhy Tesla May Not Be Leading This Part Of The Self-Driving Race75 Recent Breakouts, And This Stock Is The Biggest Winner So Far?New High Analysis: Nasdaq Sell-Off Spares These 7 StocksFacebook Down As Zuckerberg Scraps Stock Plan, Will Sell Shares

18,JBHT,"All in a Leap Year workday's work, Workday (WDAY) late Monday issued its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street views, though its Q1 revenue outlook missed forecasts. Shares were up in early trading Tuesday.The company's CEO said that Workday will expand its total addressable market in fiscal 2017 by pushing products in its planning, learning management and students areas, beyond its core financial management and human capital management applications.And the Q4 that ended Jan. 31 marked the 13th time in 14 quarters that Workday beat consensus on earnings and revenue since going public in October 2012, priced at 28.But CFO Mark Peek forecast Q1 revenue of $337 million to $339 million, up 35% at the midpoint but below the $343.3 million modeled by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters.Workday stock was up 8% in early trading in the stock market today, near 65. Workday stock hit a 39-month low at 47.32 on Feb. 9. The stock climbed over the past two weeks but is still down 18%  this year.Investors in software stocks, battered in recent months, had hoped Workday might encourage upward movement in the sector like Salesforce.com (CRM) did last week when its stock jumped 11% after its fiscal Q4 earnings and its outlook beat expectations. The enterprise software sector dived Feb. 5 after Big Data developer Tableau Software (DATA) issue a disappointing Q4 and gave soft guidance. Tableau crashed 49.5% that day to 41.33 and has recovered just 10% since its plunge.""We ended FY16 on a high note, with a very strong fourth quarter across product lines and around the world,"" Workday CEO Aneel Bhusri said in the earnings release. ""Demand for our financial management and HCM (human capital management) products continues to rise, as do our competitive win rates. The year ahead brings us an expanded addressable market with the delivery of Planning, Learning Management and Student applications that allow customers to drive employee engagement and productivity in new and transformative ways.""Big legacy software developer Oracle (ORCL) unwittingly might be helping Workday by somewhat reducing its automatic promotional Software as a Service to customers,  D.A. Davidson analyst Jack Andrews wrote in a research note before Workday's earnings release.JPMorgan analyst Mark Murphy asked about that topic during Workday's earnings conference call late Monday, prompting Bhusri’s competitive bluntness: Oracle has “had time to get customers into production and hasn’t been able to, (while) 75% of our customers are in production. That’s actually the real driver behind win rates.”Among big recent wins, Bhusri cited transportation firm J.B. Hunt (JBHT) for going live with Workday’s financial management suite, now its largest financial management customer, and Bank of America (BAC) for going live with Workday’s HCM suite, “our largest HCM customer in production.”Bhusri said customer satisfaction levels are at 98%.The company posted a per-share loss minus items of a penny in Q4, better than its six-cent loss in the year-earlier quarter, on revenue of $323.4 million, up 43%.Workday had guided Q4 to revenue of $317 million to $320 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had modeled $320.3 million when Q3 results were reported in November, but then revised it down to $319.6 million. Analysts had expected an adjusted loss per share of 5 cents.Though Q1 revenue guidance missed, Workday CFO Peek also had more positive news.“Looking ahead to our fiscal 2017, we are increasing our billings guidance for the first quarter from $350 million to $360 million to $365 million,” he said. “Billings for fiscal 2017 are expected to be between $1.855 billion and $1.875 billion. For the first quarter, we expect subscription revenue of $277 million to $278 million and total revenue of $337 million to $339 million.”Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a Q1 per-share loss minus items of two cents, on $343.3 million in revenue. For the fiscal year, analysts have modeled adjusted earnings of four cents per share on revenue of $1.546 billion. Workday reported fiscal 2016 revenue of $1.16 billion, up 48%, so its guidance would represent a 33% increase.

60,JBHT,"Shipments by Old Dominion Freight Lines and other North American truckers continued to climb in May, bucking weakness in the economy, a freight analyst said Thursday.
"
61,JBHT,"In fact, truck freight shipments in the first five months of the year were strongest since the end of the Great Recession, Cass Information Systems said in its May Freight Index Report.
"
62,JBHT,"The report could further boost shares of trucking companies, which are already in high gear.
"
63,JBHT,"Thomasville, North Carolina-based Old Dominion (ODFL), for example, carries a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.
"
64,JBHT,"""While this (report) seems counter to the dismal GDP reading for the first quarter, which shows a 1% drop or a contraction in the economy,"" Cass Information Systems analyst Rosalyn Wilson said in the report, ""much of the decrease in GDP can be attributed to declining inventories, slowing exports and weather-related issues.""
"
65,JBHT,"Wilson, who is also senior business analyst with infrastructure firm Delcan, said that those factors are positives for the economy going forward as inventories recover and weather improves.
"
66,JBHT,"Trucking shipment volume rose 3.6% year to year in May and 1% from the prior month. Total expenditures on trucking climbed 11.2% for the year to a record high, and 1.1% from April.
"
67,JBHT,"Cass doesn't publish dollar figures but said the amount that companies spent on trucking shipments was 77.7% higher than at the recession's end in 2009. Its index measures trends in North American truck shipping based on $23 billion annually in paid freight expenses for its customer base of hundreds of large shippers.
"
68,JBHT,"As shipments rise, Cass said, trucking supply is tightening, which is likely to lead to trucking companies charging higher rates, which the trucking industry would welcome.
"
69,JBHT,"Trucking companies have added new equipment and drivers to meet growing demand, which has driven up their costs, Wilson noted.
"

75,JBHT,"Follow James DeTar on Twitter: @IBD_JDeTar.Shipments by Old Dominion Freight Lines and other North American truckers continued to climb in May, bucking weakness in the economy, a freight analyst said Thursday.In fact, truck freight shipments in the first five months of the year were strongest since the end of the Great Recession, Cass Information Systems said in its May Freight Index Report.The report could further boost shares of trucking companies, which are already in high gear.Thomasville, North Carolina-based Old Dominion (ODFL), for example, carries a best-possible 99 IBD Composite Rating, meaning its stock has outperformed 99% of all stocks on key metrics such as sales and profit growth.""While this (report) seems counter to the dismal GDP reading for the first quarter, which shows a 1% drop or a contraction in the economy,"" Cass Information Systems analyst Rosalyn Wilson said in the report, ""much of the decrease in GDP can be attributed to declining inventories, slowing exports and weather-related issues.""Wilson, who is also senior business analyst with infrastructure firm Delcan, said that those factors are positives for the economy going forward as inventories recover and weather improves.Trucking shipment volume rose 3.6% year to year in May and 1% from the prior month. Total expenditures on trucking climbed 11.2% for the year to a record high, and 1.1% from April.Cass doesn't publish dollar figures but said the amount that companies spent on trucking shipments was 77.7% higher than at the recession's end in 2009. Its index measures trends in North American truck shipping based on $23 billion annually in paid freight expenses for its customer base of hundreds of large shippers.As shipments rise, Cass said, trucking supply is tightening, which is likely to lead to trucking companies charging higher rates, which the trucking industry would welcome.Trucking companies have added new equipment and drivers to meet growing demand, which has driven up their costs, Wilson noted.Shares of Old Dominion, a company on the IBD 50 list of top-rated stocks, rose 1.3% in afternoon trading in the stock market today, Thursday.Among other highly rated truckers, Saia (SAIA), which boasts a 96 Composite Rating, was up more than 2%.J.B.

81,JBHT,"JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) recovered from a sharp slide early Thursday, after the trucking firm offered fourth-quarter earnings guidance that fell short of analyst estimates.X Arkansas-based JB Hunt expects Q4 earnings of 77-82 cents per diluted share. That includes an 11 cents-per-share charge for a reserve on a cash advance for the purchase of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that will not meet delivery, and a 10-cent increase in reserves for certain insurance and claims. Excluding those charges, JB Hunt would earn 98 cents to $1.03.Consensus views had called for EPS of $1.03, according to Zacks Investment Research.JB Hunt foresees revenue of $1.9 billion to $2 billion, vs. $1.72 billion a year ago and the Zacks consensus of $1.9 billion.JB Hunt is scheduled to release Q4 and full-year 2017 earnings on Jan. 18. It expects the GOP tax cuts will ""primarily affect our balance sheet accounts creating an additional one-time benefit for 2017."" It added that its estimates were computed using an effective tax rate of 37.6% for Q4 because the tax legislation will likely have ""a minimal effect"" on operating income for the quarter.JB Hunt's core operating trends appear solid and the company is ""well positioned to benefit from the improving freight pricing/volume backdrop"" among cyclical transports into 2018, Baird research analyst Benjamin Hartford wrote Thursday, raising his price target on the stock to 120 from 112.He also raised his 2018 EPS estimate to $4.80 from $4.14 after factoring in a lower, 28% effective tax rate given the Trump tax cut. But Hartford kept a neutral rating on JB Hunt, reflecting his preference for names ""with greater potential for near-term operating leverage.""On the stock market today, shares of JB Hunt closed down 0.2% at 115.24, but rebounded from an intraday low of 111.33, briefly undercutting a 112.08 buy point.Among trucking peers, Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) fell 0.6%, Knight-Swift Transportation (KNX) lost 0.6%, Landstar System (LSTR) gave up 0.7% and Werner Enterprises (WERN) shed 0.8%. All are trading near long-time or record highs.IBD'S TAKE: As an investor, you may wonder why buy points are important. The chart action of this top growth stock offers an answer.JB Hunt stock broke out of a first-stage flat base in early December, but the breakout was not especially convincing.Volume was never very strong until about two weeks after JBHT first crossed the buy point, according to the IBD markets team. Now, shares are back to the buy point in volume that could end up being more than in any single day since JB Hunt made a new high. That's a bad sign, but at the same time there's no clear sell signal.On the upside, trucking stocks have been market leaders. Old Dominion pegged an all-time high of 134.07 Wednesday, with shares poised for their ninth straight month of gains as they trade in profit-taking sell territory. Knight-Swift, Landstar and Werner have also made strong advances in the past two months. Knight-Swift is just below a buy point.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Bitcoin In 2018: Can Futures, Mainstream Investors Tame The Hysteria?Here's Your Guide To The Stock Market In 2018Could These 10 Growth Stocks In The IBD 50 Have A Banner 2018?

Preliminary data showed NYSE and Nasdaq volume coming in lower than Friday.In the stock market today, Salesforce.com (CRM) bounced nearly 3% ahead of Tuesday's earnings report. But it's still underneath its 200-day moving average after correcting 28% off its high.In the Nasdaq 100, Apple (AAPL) added 1%.

Apple's 7-for-1 stock split takes place next month. The record date is June 2. Shares will start trading at the split-adjusted price on June 9.Other big percentage gainers in the Nasdaq 100 included Illumina (ILMN), TripAdvisor (TRIP) and F5 Networks (FFIV).

83,JBHT,"The high hopes for self-driving cars that Tesla (TSLA), Waymo-owner Alphabet (GOOGL), General Motors (GM) and others have offered over the years should come into clearer focus in 2018, when the real-world details of actually ushering in a new transportation revolution are worked out.X For example, some of the finer points of self-driving regulations, costs reductions and insurance are expected to emerge in the coming year.California has had self-driving regulations for a few years now, but the cars aren't really driverless. They have ""safety"" or ""backup"" drivers in the front seat, ready to take over the controls if needed. And they are restricted to testing scenarios, not public use.But in October, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles proposed updates to its regulations allowing companies to deploy autonomous vehicles on public roads without human drivers, even doing away with backup drivers. The rules could take effect by June.For the auto industry, a patchwork of self-driving regulations in 21 states is a hurdle to getting vehicles to consumers. They have pushed therefore for federal legislation, with the first national law for self-driving cars now in the works.But since California is the most populous state with the most cars in the country, it has often set the standard on regulations.In 2018, automakers should put in place the building blocks for bringing robocars to the masses.""It will be a pivotal 'test and learn' year to prepare for commitments"" they have made, Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds executive director of industry analysis, said on a media call Dec. 18.Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas estimates a GM Cruise self-driving test car, packed with up to 40 lidar, radar and camera sensors, may cost $250,000-$300,000, a prohibitive amount for many buyers.GM plans to slash lidar (or ""laser radar"") costs to $300 from $20,000 per car, helped by its acquisition of lidar tech firm Strobe. GM hasn't attached a time frame to that goal, but 2018 will be a crucial year for making progress if the company is to reach another goal of debuting self-driving cars for ride-sharing services in 2019.Meanwhile, car battery packs are also expensive and all those sensors and processors in self-driving systems are a big battery drain. GM seeks to reduce battery costs for its electric Bolt by almost a third in just three years. For its self-driving ride-sharing service, GM is intent on lowering the cost-per-mile to under $1 by 2025, down from the $2-$3 a mile that it says Uber and Lyft customers pay today.It sees that as a crucial level for profitable scale, with the potential to unlock a $750 billion ride-share market, more than 150 times the size of the current market.Waymo's self-driving vehicles are already being tested on public roads in the Phoenix metro area without anyone in the driver's seat, and the Alphabet unit plans to start a ride-hailing service with its fleet of driverless Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) Pacifica minivans soon, though it hasn't offered a firm timeline.GM will expand testing of its autonomous Chevrolet Bolts to New York City early in 2018, paving the path for its promised robotaxi service. Also in the coming year, Ford (F) will begin testing new self-driving vehicle technology in an unnamed city, while moving its autonomous strategy team from Dearborn, Mich., to nearby Detroit to explore the needs of urban mobility. For its part, Ford is targeting ""high volume"" fully autonomous cars for ride-sharing services in 2021.The types of cities where testing expands will be critical to developing technologies that allow autonomous cars to operate safely in rough weather, congestion, and different levels of lighting. And that's just the more routine stuff.The cars also must detect bicyclists or pedestrians who share urban roads, as well as determine how to proceed when people break traffic laws, when traffic lights don't work, or when unexpected construction activity makes mapping software unreliable.Meanwhile, Tesla largely has eschewed self-driving alliances and acquisitions in favor of developing its Autopilot feature, which has some autonomous capabilities.Although the company has amassed a vast trove of data from Autopilot usage that could improve performance, Tesla is now seen at risk of falling behind other carmakers on rolling out full autonomy and will likely miss a promised cross-country trip by a fully self-driving Tesla by the end of 2017.Who takes the blame if a driverless vehicle crashes? The driver or the carmaker?When Allstate (ALL) CEO Tom Wilson was asked that question in an interview on Marketplace last month, he replied, ""In that case, it would be the manufacturer of the car.""Liability is likely to loom even larger as an issue in 2018, roiling consumers, automakers and technology companies, not to mention insurers such as Berkshire Hathaway (BRKB) subsidiary Geico.That issue surfaced in California in 2017, with safety advocates seeking changes to proposed regulations on behalf of consumers. And an insurance startup said Dec. 19 that it will partner with Waymo to insure its riders for trip-related medical expenses and property damage.Eventually, autonomous cars are almost certain to make roads safer. This technology is one reason why the auto insurance sector will shrink by 71%, or roughly $137 billion, by 2050, with a lengthy and ""chaotic"" transition likely as the companies develop new business models, consulting firm KPMG said in June.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett agrees self-driving cars will be negative for auto insurers in the long term. If those vehicles prove to be safer than traditional cars, insurance costs will plummet, hurting Berkshire's Geico unit, he has warned.Daimler, the world's largest truck maker, intends to refine its ""platooning strategy"" for self-driving, connected trucks in 2018. The German giant already is testing its Freightliner Inspiration trucks for autonomous driving on public highways in Nevada, but has cautioned that ""much more development is needed,"" according to Trucks.com.The second half of 2018 will see a new entrant in this segment, as Deutsche Post DHL starts testing self-driving trucks, likely in Germany.Autonomous trucks could make delivery and logistics services more efficient, as well as address the persistent shortage of drivers. Waymo and Volvo, as well as Uber through its Otto acquisition, are also pursuing self-driving trucks.Tesla will also loom over trucks, as its Semi has seen a rush of preorders from shipping giants like J.B. Hunt (JBHT) and UPS (UPS) as well as companies with extensive logistical operations like Wal-Mart (WMT).MORE YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN:Where Are The Early Investing Hot Spots In Artificial Intelligence?The New Stock Gems: Which Top IPOs Are The Next Googles Or Ciscos?Before You Buy Bitcoin, Read ThisAutomotive Industry News

"
92,JBHT,"Among stocks in Wednesday's IBD 50, only five stocks show accelerating EPS growth in each of the past three quarters.
"
93,JBHT,"One of the five is J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), a provider of transportation services in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
"
94,JBHT,"Earnings rose 32%, 33%, 37% and 42% in recent quarters. Revenue growth did not accelerate but it was steady: 22%, 19%, 18% and 17%.
"
95,JBHT,"The revenue growth in the first quarter was partly due to fuel surcharges. The company's arrangement with customers allows J.B. Hunt to recover most higher fuel costs.
"
96,JBHT,"In Q1, for example, about four percentage points of the 17% revenue growth was due to the surcharges.
"
97,JBHT,"Rapid increases in fuel costs, however, can hurt J.B. Hunt because of weather-related idling. As of Dec. 31, the company had no derivatives to reduce fuel-price volatility.

Hunt's Transportation-Truck industry group is a mediocre 98 out of 197 industry groups, as of Thursday's IBD.In a tepid economy like today's, it's tough to find companies with accelerating profit growth.Among stocks in Wednesday's IBD 50, only five stocks show accelerating EPS growth in each of the past three quarters.One of the five is J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT), a provider of transportation services in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.Earnings rose 32%, 33%, 37% and 42% in recent quarters. Revenue growth did not accelerate but it was steady: 22%, 19%, 18% and 17%.The revenue growth in the first quarter was partly due to fuel surcharges. The company's arrangement with customers allows J.B. Hunt to recover most higher fuel costs.In Q1, for example, about four percentage points of the 17% revenue growth was due to the surcharges.Rapid increases in fuel costs, however, can hurt J.B. Hunt because of weather-related idling. As of Dec. 31, the company had no derivatives to reduce fuel-price volatility.J.B. Hunt also is vulnerable to concentration: 10 clients account for about a third of total revenue, and there are no long-term contracts.The stock's quarterly dividend is 14 cents a share, and has more than doubled since 2005. The current annualized yield is 1%.The economy — especially the retail and manufacturing sectors — is a key concern for trucking companies. Should the U.S. economy fall into recession, J.B. Hunt would be hurt. During the last recession, J.B. Hunt's earnings declined on a year-ago basis for five quarters in a row.Is a U.S. recession ahead? The Economic Cycle Research Institute says yes. In its May report, ECRI said real personal income growth in the past three months is disturbingly low. In the past 60 years, a recession has never been avoided when personal income is as weak as it is now, according to ECRI.Predictions of recessions, though, aren't particularly useful to investors. The price and volume action of the major indexes are a better guide for buying and selling.The stock is in the eighth week of a shallow consolidation.J.B. Hunt's Transportation-Truck industry group is a mediocre 98 out of 197 industry groups, as of Thursday's IBD.

107,JBHT,"Stocks rolled into the first real week of the earnings season with mixed feelings, as names like Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) backed away from early highs but remained positive, with Netflix shares soaring in after-hours action on its Q2 results.XThe Dow Jones industrial average, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 all closed within 0.03% of their starting position. Small caps had a shade more momentum, lifting the Russell 2000 index 0.1%.A weak reading on a New York-region manufacturing gauge and signs of more possible regulatory intervention in China's markets may have rattled investors early in the session. But investors were also looking toward Netflix's Q2 report and the week's increasingly busy earnings schedule, and the market was due for a breather after last week's strong performance.Specialty steel makers were at the top of the sessions best-performing industries, led by Carpenter Technology's (CRS) 6% gain. Retail and mining groups posted many of the day's strongest moves. Macy's (M), Conn's (CONN) and Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) figured powerfully in those advances.Netflix bolted 8% higher after reporting strong subscriber growth and guidance despite weaker-than-expected Q2 earnings.Apple notched its seventh straight advance, retaking its 50-day moving average, although a retreat from early highs left the stock below the session's midway mark, only pennies above the 50-day line in a weak-volume move.Akamai Technologies (AKAM) and Dollar Tree (DLTR) each rose 2%, helping boost the Nasdaq 100.On the Dow, Apple couldn't outpull IBM (IBM) and JPMorgan (JPM), which each dropped more than 1%.Trucking fleet operator J.B. Hunt (JBHT) rolled up a 3% gain in heavy trade, despite reporting second-quarter earnings below analysts' targets. The stock is up 13% from a May low and back above support at both its 10- and 40-week moving averages.Among IBD 50 stocks, YY (YY) swept ahead 3% in better than double its average trade.  That put the stock 7% above a 61.62 but point in a flat base, after breaking out past the marker with a heavy-volume 9% spike Friday.Cell tower operator Crown Castle (CCI) dropped 4% in fast trade after making a $7 billion bid to acquire Lightower Fiber Networks.

108,JBHT,"Sometimes a small prod is all it takes to make a hot investment idea go cold in no time — as small as a quarter-point bump in a benchmark rate in the case of low volatility and dividend stock ETFs.As the era of zero ends and interest rates rise, investors in exchange traded funds have turned away from certain high dividend and low volatility strategies this year. Instead, they favored more cyclical exposures that benefit from a tick up in rates — banks and transporters, for example.""Yet, thanks to product innovation, there are now strong smart-beta strategies that combine defensive and cyclical components,"" Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at CFRA, wrote in a March note. Smart beta ETFs seek to achieve better returns or lower risk vs. cap-weighted counterparts.As examples of ""next-generation products"" for a rising rate environment, Rosenbluth offered these two names:As relatively new products without a three-year history, both ETFs should be traded with care. However, Rosenbluth considers them worthy choices for large-cap stock exposure in light of the March rate hike and the Fed's signals of more gradual rate hikes this year.XRLV is the younger sibling of PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility (SPLV), an ETF that aims to give investors a smoother ride in the stock market. SPLV invests in the 100 least volatile stocks in the S&P 500 and surged in popularity during 2016's choppy markets. So did iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility (USMV).But this year through March 21, SPLV and USMV saw net outflow of $1.238 billion combined, according to FactSet data — a big chunk of their total assets, which now stand at roughly $19 billion.Hefty stakes in defensive, high-yielding sectors could be hurting them.Those equity sectors, such as consumer staples, real estate and utilities, are seen as ""bond proxies"" because of their higher yields. They have historically lagged the S&P 500 when bond yields are rising.As the Federal Reserve seems inclined to keep raising rates this year, more pain may lie in store for SPLV and USMV, in Rosenbluth's view.XRLV has little to fear in this context. It boots out the 100 most rate-sensitive stocks from the S&P 500 and so has virtually no exposure to utilities and real estate. Gas and electric companies such as Dominion Resources (D) and Southern Co. (SO), which belong in the older sibling's portfolio, are missing here.Instead, it skews heavily toward financials, technology and industrials, such as JB Hunt Transport Services (JBHT). Those economically sensitive sectors tend to perform well amid rising interest rates.Basically, XRLV is defensive — but not too much.""It's a middle ground for investors who are expecting more choppiness in the marketplace but also wish to participate in an improving economy,"" said Rosenbluth.XRLV has gained 10.3% since the Nov. 8 election, roughly in line with the S&P 500 and outpacing the 9.2% advance of the low volatility heavyweights, SPLV and USMV.While the Fidelity dividend ETF also holds stocks that perform well when rates are rising, it avoids big sector bets.It is up 4.8% year to date and has a 30-day SEC yield of 3.05%.RELATED:The Best Lage-Cap Growth ETF For 10 Years, But Is It Best For You?

112,JBHT,"Stocks came under selling pressure early yesterday morning as expected, but then did a complete 180 degree turn around closing mostly higher with the Dow up triple digits, piercing the psychologically important 18k level while the S&P surged 13 pts ending the day right on the highs as the rally that people love to hate moves on. Pressure on oil prices worked against stocks in the first moments of trading but investors/traders and the big banks ended up ignoring the news out of Doha in a move that surprised many.Mkts around the world are all celebrating today...taking their cue from the turnaround in US equities....US futures are rocketing higher - currently up 11 pts as we kiss the psychological 2100 level.....but as my friend Scott Redler (@RedDogT3) tells me on twitter this morning""The first kiss us usually meets some opposition, then the romance gets you around the bases"" - to which I say - Yes, but it is the first kiss that is the sweetest which makes you want to go back for more.....and more is what it looks like we are gonna get today.....Remember - the mkt is a discounting mechanism....it is looking 4 - 6 months out....the trading today is not about today.....(Just sayin.....) - it is really about what the mkts expect in the fall......and by the looks of it - the mkt is expecting great things...Asian mkts were all higher overnight - Japan which got clobbered on Monday - snapped back and regained 100% of Monday's losses.....as we saw the Yen weaken a bit....a stabilizing oil mkt is also helping to support mkts today....After yesterday's mkt action - it appears that investors are disconnecting from the whims of the oil mkt....at least for now and concentrating on earnings.....European mkts are also enjoying an explosive rally....because why? Earnings and oil......and the sense is that maybe - the whole Mid-East OPEC summit was all hype.....to confuse the conversation.....interesting that the possibility of increased production has caused oil to stabilize and rally a bit from the Monday lows.....Does it feel like something else is going on? FTSE +0.56%, CAC 40 + 1.21%, DAX + 2.22%, EUROSTOXX +1.58%, SPAIN +0.88% and ITALY + 0.57%.Now just a thought or two about yesterday.....and the role that the Deputy Crown Prince is now playing......Look the big story was OIL and POLITICS – Mid East politics – and after two months of all the hype about this pending agreement in a production freeze – traders and the mkts had to deal with the fact that there was no deal – which now sets up the oil mkt for a possible 'free for all'….Keep your eyes on Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman – for he is now the name to know – for it was this 30 yr old son of King Salman who has now turned over the apple cart and merged the commercial considerations of the kingdom with his political stance – a move that is in complete contrast to what was existing policy.......You see for the past 20 yrs – Ali Al-Naimi – the current Saudi oil minister has kept those two issues on separate pages – keeping supply and pricing as the main drivers of any production decisions, always cooperating with the other members – including Iran – no matter what their politics were – in the past to cut production to boost oil prices. The Deputy Crown Prince is not sure he agrees with this policy and so while all the talk has been about how the Saudi's were cooperating with Russia, Venezuela and Qatar – Iran was still the thorn in Prince Mohammed's side….so in a bid to establish himself as an emerging 'force' - as the potential heir to the throne - he nixed the oil deal sending oil mkts into a tailspin on Sunday night/Monday.What is important to understand is that the deputy Crown Prince has now burst onto the global stage since his father became King last year and appears to have every intention of letting the world know. He was appointed the Defense Minister – and is the one responsible for launching the latest military campaign in Yemen while also chairing the country's 'economic planning body' and the council that controls the massive 'state owned' oil company. In a telling interview last week with Bloomberg – the Prince was very clear –""We don't care about oil prices, $30 or $70, they are the same to us. We have our own programs that don't need high oil prices.""This is not how the rest of the OPEC and non OPEC members feel at all – so by nixing any deal he has protected the Saudi's mkt share, and has secured their role as a 'leader' while at the same time laying the groundwork for continued political instability in the region.OK - back to the mkts.....After the initial concerns over these recent developments – the focus returned to US earnings…the day started off with better numbers from Pepsico (PEP), Hasbro (HAS), JB Hunt (JBHT) and in a another surprise move – we learned that Morgan Stanley (MS) – while reporting horrible numbers did in fact ""beat all the estimates."" Net Income FELL 54%, Equity trading revenues FELL 34%, Fixed Income trading revenues FELL 52% and Investment Banking Revenues FELL 15% - but yet they somehow managed to beat the 'much lower' EPS expectation….so all this means is that we must watch out for Goldman Sachs (GS) report this morning.....Analysts expect EPS of $2.48......Now remember – Uncle Lloyd pre-announced this 're-structuring' plan late on Friday – so investors/traders have been prepped about all the bad news and how he has dealt with it head on…. – and like Cousin Jamie (Dimon) of JP Morgan (JPM)– Uncle Lloyd knows how to 'massage' the street analysts – so what I expect to hear this morning is a 'BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF EPS' beat to rival even the most generous estimate….and the clock ticks towards 7:30 am......In other news - United Health (UNH) just reported a better number - $1.81 vs. exp of $1.72, Philip Morris (PM) on the other hand missed - $0.98 vs. exp of $1.10..... Watch for Brinker (EAT), Comerica (CMA), Genuine Parts (GPC), Harley Davidson (HDI), Kansas City Southern (KSU),Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Take Good Care

Analysts polled…
"
117,JBHT,"For Old Dominion Freight Line, the less-than-truckload carrier, logistics and freight-forwarding company, 2014 turned out to be the proverbial perfect storm.
"
118,JBHT,"Industry capacity constraints, supply disruptions, the growing economy and the company's strong execution all contributed to excellent results for the North Carolina firm, said analyst Todd Fowler of KeyBanc Capital Markets.
"
119,JBHT,"One year of double-digit earnings and sales growth does not necessarily make a best-in-class operator, but Old Dominion's (ODFL) strength goes much further back. It has at least a decade of strong results under its belt with only one year of noticeable decline in profit and sales, as the recession's effects were being felt in 2009. Even then, it still registered a profit vs. many of its peers.
"
120,JBHT,"""They've been very consistent with how they've run their network, which has allowed them to generate very high incremental margins on additional tonnage or additional price that they're giving,"" said Fowler. ""They are very focused on the cost side of the business and they continue to invest in technology, which allows them to improve efficiencies across the board.""
"
121,JBHT,"Old Dominion focuses on less-than-truckload, or LTL, transport. This means that multiple shipments are usually contained on a truck, which then delivers the goods to one of its 225 service centers for distribution to clients. The firm operates in the national as well as regional markets. It also has been expanding its worldwide freight forwarding services.
"
122,JBHT,"Mover In The Market
"
123,JBHT,"The company's stellar business performance is reflected in its market performance. Old Dominion stock jumped 46% last year, while investors who had held on to the shares for a decade could benefit from a nearly 600% gain.
"
124,JBHT,"It's the highest-rated company in IBD's Transportation-Truck industry group, which includes 20 stocks. And it's second largest by market cap, after J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) . Swift Transportation (SWFT) is third in size.
"
125,JBHT,"Old Dominion was founded in 1934 by current CEO David Congdon's grandparents, with a single truck running between Richmond, Va., and Norfolk, Va. Congdon became president and chief operating officer in 1997. Currently, Old Dominion operates its service centers across most of the U.S. and runs more than 6,400 tractors and 19,400 trailers.
"
126,JBHT,"In addition to serving national markets, Old Dominion also set a goal of operating in the regional, interregional and long-haul markets, all under one corporate office and computer system, Congdon says.
"
127,JBHT,"The company has been successful in competing with small regional players as well as national carriers within the U.S. It also expanded its reach outside of the lower 48 states to Canada, Mexico, Alaska, Hawaii and the Caribbean. Partnerships in global freight forwarding have provided Old Dominion access to China and other international markets.
"
128,JBHT,"Old Dominion notes that it holds a 5% to 6% market share in the LTL industry, as estimated by an independent market research firm. The company plans to double this number within the next couple of years.
"
129,JBHT,"The carrier has one of the industry's lowest cargo claim ratios. ""Historically, the LTL industry has had a cargo claim ratio of 1% to 1.5% of revenue,"" Congdon told IBD. ""We have driven ours down this year to in the range of 0.3% to 0.35%.""
"
130,JBHT,"Several elements contributed to low claims. Those include logistics racks in all trailers to avoid shifting of shipment within the trucks during transportation, the use of airbags between cargo, the use of straps and more.
"
131,JBHT,"But the most important tool, said Congdon, is getting the employees to use these tools.
"
132,JBHT,"""You can invest all you want in all the tools,"" he said. ""But until you get employees believing in what they should be doing every day, that's the biggest key to the success.""
"
133,JBHT,"That said, the company has put a substantial amount of investment into its operations and infrastructure in the past decade. This trend is expected to continue in the next several years as it plans to take a larger slice of the LTL market.
"
134,JBHT,"""It's going to be a combination of growth capex, investing in technology and improving their existing infrastructure for when they get to bottlenecks or points that they've outgrown the existing infrastructure that they had in place,"" said Fowler.
"
135,JBHT,"What About Oil Prices?
"
136,JBHT,"Old Dominion also has a track record of effectively managing the expense side of operations.
"
137,JBHT,"With oil prices slashed to less than half of what they were just six months ago, analysts expect fuel-cost savings to be largely passed through to the customers.
"
138,JBHT,"The trucking industry has traditionally operated with fuel price surcharges that adjust on a weekly basis, and Fowler doesn't expect to see a big tail wind or headwind for the company from the changing price of fuel.
"
139,JBHT,"""What we're more focused on is the indirect impact of what's happening with changes in end markets from the standpoint that the oil and gas related to the drilling activity has consumed a lot of freight capacity,"" he said. ""If we see those end markets slow, that could free up some capacity overall in the industry.""
"
140,JBHT,"However, counterbalancing it would be the benefits consumers would receive from lower fuel costs, according to Fowler.
"
141,JBHT,"""Typically when we think about freight activity in general, it's probably two-thirds consumer oriented and one-third manufacturing,"" he noted.
"
142,JBHT,"Net-net, Fowler expects a modest benefit from lower fuel costs on the expense side.
"
143,JBHT,"Additional risks for the company include some increased competition. While the cost and barriers of entry to this business are quite steep for traditional players, the entrance of technology-based truck brokerages has created some competition by providing more favorable cost to smaller customers, explained Fowler.
"
144,JBHT,"Large companies such as FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) also have their own LTL business, which gives price advantages in bundling various services.
"
145,JBHT,"""One of the big industry issues is the driver shortage,"" said Congdon. ""There are fewer people growing up and saying 'Hey, I want to be a truck driver.'""
"
146,JBHT,"Drivers Wanted
"
147,JBHT,"Congdon estimates that today the industry is short about 50,000 to 60,000 drivers. This figure is expected to surpass 200,000 in the next decade.
"
148,JBHT,"""The good news for our company is ... we have a fertile soil to grow our drivers,"" he said.
"
149,JBHT,"Old Dominion offers competitive pay for people who can start working on its docks, without having to have college education. They can then transition into becoming drivers for pay topping $60,000 a year and sometimes as high as $100,000.
"
150,JBHT,"The company reports its 2014 fourth-quarter and year-end results on Feb. 5, before trading opens. Analyst consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters calls for sales of $717 million and $2.78 billion for each period respectively. Earnings per share are forecast to be $0.72 and $3.02, with EPS growth of 26% for 2014.

This trend is expected to continue in the next several years as it plans to take a larger slice of the LTL market.""It's going to be a combination of growth capex, investing in technology and improving their existing infrastructure for when they get to bottlenecks or points that they've outgrown the existing infrastructure that they had in place,"" said Fowler.What About Oil Prices?Old Dominion also has a track record of effectively managing the expense side of operations.With oil prices slashed to less than half of what they were just six months ago, analysts expect fuel-cost savings to be largely passed through to the customers.The trucking industry has traditionally operated with fuel price surcharges that adjust on a weekly basis, and Fowler doesn't expect to see a big tail wind or headwind for the company from the changing price of fuel.""What we're more focused on is the indirect impact of what's happening with changes in end markets from the standpoint that the oil and gas related to the drilling activity has consumed a lot of freight capacity,"" he said. ""If we see those end markets slow, that could free up some capacity overall in the industry.""However, counterbalancing it would be the benefits consumers would receive from lower fuel costs, according to Fowler.""Typically when we think about freight activity in general, it's probably two-thirds consumer oriented and one-third manufacturing,"" he noted.Net-net, Fowler expects a modest benefit from lower fuel costs on the expense side.Additional risks for the company include some increased competition. While the cost and barriers of entry to this business are quite steep for traditional players, the entrance of technology-based truck brokerages has created some competition by providing more favorable cost to smaller customers, explained Fowler.Large companies such as FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) also have their own LTL business, which gives price advantages in bundling various services.""One of the big industry issues is the driver shortage,"" said Congdon. ""There are fewer people growing up and saying 'Hey, I want to be a truck driver.'""Drivers WantedCongdon estimates that today the industry is short about 50,000 to 60,000 drivers. This figure is expected to surpass 200,000 in the next decade.""The good news for our company is ... we have a fertile soil to grow our drivers,"" he said.Old Dominion offers competitive pay for people who can start working on its docks, without having to have college education. They can then transition into becoming drivers for pay topping $60,000 a year and sometimes as high as $100,000.The company reports its 2014 fourth-quarter and year-end results on Feb. 5, before trading opens. Analyst consensus as polled by Thomson Reuters calls for sales of $717 million and $2.78 billion for each period respectively. Earnings per share are forecast to be $0.72 and $3.02, with EPS growth of 26% for 2014. Analysts expect 19% EPS growth this year.

154,JBHT,"Housing Starts and Permits data has come out this morning, posting better-than-expected results and upward revisions for the previous month. October starts rose 13.7% to 1.29 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units. This is way up from September’s upwardly revised -3.2%, or 1.135 million units. Permits — a forward indicator on future housing starts — were +5.9% last month at just under 1.3 million, following another upwardly revised September read of -3.7%.September, recall, had been ravaged by two major hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S., as well as another one that ravaged the U.S. property of Puerto Rico. That housing metrics are this solid illustrates a strong bounce-back, and likely a more robust market than many analysts had earlier anticipated.Q3 Earnings Retail RoundupTwo specialty retailers are trading up north of 20% in today’s pre-market on better-than-expected Q3 earnings reports released before the opening bell: Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) +25% and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF  -  Free Report) +20%. The athletic shoe retailer posted 87 cents per share versus 80 cents in the Zacks consensus, on $1.87 billion in sales that surpassed the $1.84 billion anticipated. Both quarterly numbers are down year over year, but after a very tough Retail space in 2017 thus far, market participants see some traction ahead of the all-important earnings holiday shopping season.Abercrombie & Fitch brought in 30 cents per share on $859 million in quarterly revenues, ahead of the 24 cents and $820 million expected. Earnings numbers year over year blew away the 2 cents per share in fiscal Q317 by more than 1300%, and is the second-straight positive earnings surprise this year.And Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) retailer Buckle Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report) is trading up 7% in the early market on a two-cent earnings beat to 41 cents per share. Sales were in-line with expectations at $224.3 million in the quarter. This marks Buckle’s third straight earnings beat, and today’s upswing in stock price has cut deeply into its -12.7% selloff since that start of 2017.New Futuristic Fireworks from TeslaTesla (TSLA  -  Free Report) CEO Elon Musk unveiled two new automotive products for the near future: a semi-self-driving electric semi truck and a new high-end roadster sportscar.

155,JBHT,"United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 17, after the market closes.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2%. Both earnings and revenues surpassed estimates and increased year over year. Strong demand for air travel boosted results.However, with rising oil prices having engulfed the entire airline industry, the prospects for United Continental seem dismal in the second quarter.Let’s look into the factors rendering such an outlook.Factors Likely at PlayHigh fuel prices are a major concern for the company in the period to be reported. Crude oil prices are currently hovering at around $70 a barrel. As fuel costs comprise a major chunk of airline expense, such high costs push up operating expenses, hampering bottom-line growth in turn. The metric is expected in the range of $2.18-$2.23 per gallon for the second quarter, much higher than $1.63 reported a year ago. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $2.22.Bedsides fuel costs, expenses pertaining to labor are also likely to hit the bottom line in the second quarter. The carrier expects unit costs (excluding fuel, profit sharing & third party business costs) to rise in the band of flat to 1% year over year in the second quarter. The company’s high leverage further adds to its woes. Its current long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) is well over 100. This compares unfavorably with its industry average of 92.6% as well as the S&P 500 index’s tally of 81.4%.However, robust growth in passenger revenues on account of strong demand for air travel is anticipated to aid the company’s top line in the second quarter. The company estimates passenger unit revenues to inch up 1-3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger unit revenues is pegged at 12.77 cents, above 11.67 cents reported a year ago.Earnings WhispersOur quantitative model does not conclusively show that United Continental is likely to beat on earnings this quarter. Per the proven model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. However, that is not the case as highlighted below.Zacks ESP: United Continental has an Earnings ESP of -0.70%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The Most Accurate Estimate is pegged at $3.05 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: United Continental carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company’s negative ESP leaves surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.United Continental Holdings, Inc.

156,JBHT,"Shares of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) scaled a 52-week high of $129.74 on May 21, before retracing a bit to close the session at $128.10. Notably, the company has performed impressively in a year’s time. While the stock has surged 52%, the industry rallied 43.1%.Lets delve deep to unearth the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.J.B. Hunt is gaining momentum backed by impressive performance of its primary division — Intermodal. Notably, this segment contributed 55% to the company’s first-quarter 2018 revenues of $1,948.2 million. Also, segmental revenues increased 14% in the quarter.Load volumes in Intermodal segment were up 6%. Revenue per load, excluding fuel surcharge revenues, rose 4% on a year-over-year basis. Operating income improved 20% year over year backed by volume growth and customer rate increases among other factors. For 2018, revenues from the segment are projected to increase between 7.5% and 11%.Apart from Intermodal, J.B. Hunt’s other key divisions — Dedicated Contract Services and Integrated Capacity Solutions — are also performing well. In fact, we expect these segments to continue the trend in the coming quarters as well. Based on this optimism, J.B. Hunt anticipates its top line to increase between 11% and 15% in 2018.Moreover, the new tax law is a boon for transportation companies like J.B. Hunt. Effective tax rate at J.B. Hunt is projected to come down to approximately 26% in 2018 from 37.9% in 2017. The significant cut in corporate tax rate should boost cash flow, which in turn, will lead to bottom-line growth.We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases. In January 2018, J.B. Hunt raised its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share, mirroring an increase of 4.3% over the previous payout. In terms of buybacks, the company had roughly $521 million remaining under its total share buyback authorizations as of Mar 31, 2018. Also, J.B. Hunt's trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) supports its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 25.9% compares favorably with ROE of 16.3% for its industry and 16% for the S&P 500 index. This implies that the company is efficiently using shareholder funds.We expect an uptick in such investor-friendly activities, courtesy of the new tax law. As a result of the huge savings generated from the reduced corporate tax rate more cash are likely to be left in hand for the company to fund such activities.Zacks Rank & Key PicksJ.B. Huntcarries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader Transportation sector are SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report), Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. (EXPD  -  Free Report) and GATX Corp. (GATX  -  Free Report). While Expeditors sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), SkyWest and GATX carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

157,JBHT,"It is a well documented fact that that high oil prices have prevented airline stocks from flying high this year. In fact, oil prices have increased more than 20% year to date. Notably, high oil prices do not bode well for companies in the airline space as fuel costs account for a significant chunk of their expenditures.Like all other airlines, high fuel costs are hurting Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) too. We remind investors that even though this Atlanta, GA-based company marginally surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the first quarter, the metric declined 3.9% year over year. The bottom-line contraction can be mainly attributed to high fuel costs. Moreover, the first-quarter earnings beat failed to translate into any strength for its stock, as evident from its year-to-date plunge of over 11%. Year- to- Date Price Performance With oil prices continuing to move northward, the stock might disappoint after the company releases second-quarter results on Jul 12. In fact, the stock could lose further value on dismal results.However, an earnings beat doesn't look very difficult for Delta in the second quarter as the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pretty conservative at $1.75, after a number of downward revisions over the last couple of months.Our quantitative model too points at an earnings beat in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Here's why:Delta has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — for increasing the odds of an earnings surprise.Zacks ESP: Delta has an Earnings ESP of +1.36% as the Most Accurate estimate is $1.77 while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged 2 cents lower. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Delta carries a Zacks Rank #3. Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Delta’s Zacks Rank #3 and a positive ESP makes us reasonably confident of an earnings beat.Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Delta Air Lines, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Delta Air Lines, Inc. QuoteFactors Likely at PlaySimilar to the last reported quarter, high fuel costs are likely to act as the key dampener to Delta’s earnings in the second quarter. We note that oil prices increased 14% in the April-June period. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter average fuel price (mainline: net of hedging gains) stands at $2.14 per gallon, much higher than the $2.01 reported by the carrier in the first quarter of 2018.In fact, Delta anticipates fuel costs to be even higher and lie in the $2.20- $2.25 range in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. Apart from high fuel costs, expenses on the labor front are expected to limit bottom-line growth. The carrier envisions non-fuel unit costs to rise approximately 3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter non-fuel unit costs stands at 10.25 cents, more than 10.24 cents reported a year ago.However, the company is expected to perform well on the unit revenue front. The airline behemoth expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to increase between 4% and 5% year over year in the second quarter. The bullish forecast is based on the strong demand for air travel across all entities in the leisure and the business segments.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) is pegged at 15.27 cents, above 14.74 cents reported in the first quarter of 2018.Stocks That Warrants a LookInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may check out CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report), SkyWest, Inc.

158,JBHT,"The transportation sector is riding high on first-quarter financial results, with total earnings from 97.8% of the sector’s total market capitalization, reported so far, up 20.9% on revenue growth of 8.7%. Both revenue and earnings surprises of 76.9% also seem impressive.This is because most of the key industry players managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both, while a few lagged.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.55 surpassed the earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $17.11 billion edged past the estimated $16.44 billion. For fiscal 2018, the company continued to expect earnings per share in the range of $7.03-$7.37. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.22 (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) missed. UNP and NSC surpassed the earnings estimate by 3 cents and 16 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $104 million and $35 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.30 at KSU lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by five cents while revenues of $639 million were also marginally below our estimated $644 million.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by three cents and revenue estimate by $30 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) also reported better-than-expected results. Earnings of 74 cents and revenues of $9.97 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 73 cents and $9.91 billion, respectively. For the second quarter of 2018, the carrier expects earnings per share in the range of $1.80-$2.00 (read: ETFs & Stocks to Fly High on Record Spring Travel).At United Continental, earnings per share of 50 cents came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny and revenues of $9.03 billion slightly edged past the estimated $9.01 billion. The company raised the lower end of the earnings per share to $7.00-$8.50 for the year from $6.50-$8.50. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $7.83.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in couple of cents below the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues were $76 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusWhile the string of solid results from industry players made the case for transport ETFs appealing, a jump in oil price and a rise in dollar led to losses over the past month. As such, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report), SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report) and First Trust Nasdaq Transportation ETF (FTXR) shed 0.8%, 2.5% and 1.8%, respectively. All these funds have a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.2% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $804.5 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 248,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETFs to Ride High on Huge Earnings Beat by FedEx).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 42 stocks in its basket. The in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 31.2% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines, and air freight & logistics take one-fourth share each. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $225.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 34,000 shares a day.FTXRThis fund offers exposure to the 30 most-liquid U.S. transportation securities based on volatility, value and growth by tracking the Nasdaq US Smart Transportation Index.

159,JBHT,"The diversified transportation sector, which includes airline companies, railroads, truckers and shippers, among others, got off to an impressive start in first-quarter 2018 earnings season. As the U.S. economy continues to grow, demand for carriage is also increasing and this momentum is anticipated to sustain in 2018.Transportation sector is the lifeblood of the economy as it moves freights across the country and offshore. Favorable economic condition along with promising fiscal and regulatory policies from the Trump administration bode well for the sector.Performance to DateSo far, two major airline operators Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL  -  Free Report) as well as freight railroad behemoth CSX Corp. (CSX  -  Free Report) delivered highly impressive results. Each of these three companies handily surpassed both the top and bottom line with respect to the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Additionally, transport logistic company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) reported mixed results. The top line outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate while the bottom line missed the same marginally.  All four stocks mentioned above carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Tax Overhaul: A Major BoostThe two pro-growth agendas of President Trump, namely, significant cut in corporate tax and deregulation are major catalysts to the Transportation sector. The corporate tax rate was recently lowered from 35% to 21%., its historic low in 78 years. A large part of transporters book much of their revenues in the homeland. Consequently, a significant reduction in corporate tax rate borne by transporters would be immediately accretive to cash flow.Capital-Intensive Nature of Transportation SectorTransportation companies, mainly railroads and airlines, invest significantly in capital expenditure as the industry is capital-intensive in nature. Under the old law, capital expenditures cannot be tax-deducted in the year they were incurred. Consequently, U.S. corporates needed to plan judiciously regarding their capital expenditure.However, following the U.S. tax overhaul, the companies will be able to deduct their capital expenditures from the taxable income immediately. In fact, going forward if the companies increase their capital expenditures, their tax bills for the year would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.This in fact will leave more cash in the hands of transporters to fund project expansions, acquisitions and share repurchases among others. Apart from railroads and package delivery companies, stocks belonging to the airline space are also likely to be huge beneficiaries of the new tax law.Robust Demand for FreightA thriving and improving economy supports the overall bullishness of the transport sector, as it implies that more goods are being transported across the United States. Improved global growth prospects, sustained business and consumer confidence have in turn helped the transport sector recover from the sluggishness in 2017 to quite an extent.Economic growth and demand for freight are positively correlated. Healthy growth in manufacturing, construction, mining and automobile production will increase demand for more freight.Moreover, the government has taken a decision to spend a whopping $1.5 trillion on several infrastructure projects like constructing new roads, bridges, highways, railways and waterways across the country over a period of 10 years. This project will generate significant demand for manufacturing sector, which in turn will raise demand for freight, benefiting the transportation sector.  Price PerformanceThe chart below shows year to date price performance of four stocks mentioned above.Bottom LineThe U.S. economy is gathering steam. With the overall economy back on track, things are looking up for the transportation sector as well. A robust U.S. economy, healthy consumer and business confidence, massive tax haul and business friendly policies of the government are anticipated to fuel transportation sector’s growth.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

165,JBHT,"J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 16.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 0.97%. It posted better-than-expected earnings and revenues in the fourth quarter of 2017. Moreover, both the top and bottom line improved substantially year over year.However, things do not look up for the company in the to-be-reported quarter. Moreover, shares of the company have underperformed the industry in the January-March period. While the stock has gained 1.9%, the industry has increased 2.9%. Factors at PlayJ.B. Hunt has been struggling with shortage of drivers for quite some time. The company’s bottom line in the first quarter is likely to be hurt by higher operating expenses due to increased driver wages among other factors.The company is highly leveraged, which further adds to its woes. This is evident from the current ratio of its long-term debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) of 59. The figure compares unfavorably with its industry’s average of 15.5.However, the new tax law is a big boon to the company. Huge savings from the reduced tax rate are anticipated to boost cash flow, which in turn should aid the bottom line.Expanded volume at the company’s primary division of intermodal is expected to aid results in the quarter to be reported.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are also impressive. In January, J.B. Hunt raised its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share, representing an increase of 4.3% over the previous payout.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: J.B. Hunt has an Earnings ESP of -0.23%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: J.B. Hunt has a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, a company needs positive ESP as well to be confident about an earnings beat. Hence, this combination leaves our surprise prediction inconclusive.We caution against all Sell-rated stocks (4 or 5) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is witnessing negative estimate revisions.J.B.

166,JBHT,"Shares of GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) gained 11.3% over the last three months, outperforming the Zacks Equipment and Leasing industry, which declined 5.9% in the same time period.   Let’s take a look at the factors responsible for the impressive price performance.In January, GATX reported higher-than-expected revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017. The strong performance of the Rail North America segment, which accounts for a bulk of GATX’s revenues, aided results.The company’s strong product portfolio is encouraging as well. Moreover, its efforts to modernize the fleet, particularly at its Rail Europe division, raise optimism in the stock.We are impressed by the company’s efforts to reward its shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments. We note that the company has been paying regular dividends, continuously since 1919. In January 2018, it raised the quarterly dividend by 5% to 44 cents per share. During 2017, it bought back shares worth $100 million.The new tax law is a blessing for transportation companies like GATX. The huge savings, induced by the new law, may result in an improvement in these shareholder-friendly activities. Apart from GATX, transportation stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (UNP  -  Free Report), Norfolk Southern Corporation (NSC  -  Free Report) and J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report) also hiked their dividend payouts this year.Estimate RevisionsUpward estimate revisions reflect optimism in a stock’s prospect.

167,JBHT,"The U.S. equity market has been on a roller-coaster of late. In fact, Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1,033 points or 4.2%  on Feb 8. Other major bourses – the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq — also finished in the red on the same day.In fact, this was the second time in a week that the Dow shed over 1,000 points in a day after the 1,175 points decline on Feb 5. Following the latest U.S. sell-off, both the Dow as well as the S&P 500 are officially into the correction territory, down more than 10% from the recent all-time high reached in January.The steep sell-off was due to the stronger-than-expected job addition along with fastest wage growth in more than eight years. These factors, in turn, triggered fears of inflation and bolstered expectations that the Fed could take a more aggressive stance in hiking rates than previously expected.Furthermore, heightened volatility on the back of a significant increase in the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) — Wall Street’s so-called fear gauge — which currently is more than 30 (near the highest level since August 2015) indicates bearish market prospects. Notably, any reading above the 20 mark indicates bearish outlook in the equity market.Given this backdrop, investing in companies that not only pay consistent dividends but also raise the same seem to prudent. This is because such companies are financially stable and mature, and can even generate steady cash flow irrespective of market conditions.Transportation Stocks Riding HighA sector that boasts well-paying stocks in terms of dividends, is the one having transportation stocks. Transports have been having a good time lately after being laid low for most of 2017, due to various headwinds like back-to-back hurricanes, increased costs to name a few.Also, the string of outperformances (in terms of earnings as well as revenues) by the key sector participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report), American Airlines Group and Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC  -  Free Report) in fourth-quarter 2017 bears testimony to the improved scenario surrounding the highly-diversified Zacks Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors).Factors Behind the ResurgenceRailroads are one of the most important sub-groups in the transportation sector. After facing multiple challenges over the past few years due to coal-related winds, stocks in the space seem to have bounced back on improvements in the coal scenario.Particularly with Donald Trump’s presidency, the coal industry is witnessing better days. In fact, Trump is aiming to revive the industry by relaxing regulations, which were hurting its prospects. Apart from coal, the scenario pertaining to another key source of revenues for railroads — intermodal — has improved by leaps and bounds lately.Airlines — another important sub-group in the broader sector – are also seeing good times now, courtesy of the improved demand for air travel. For 2018, the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) predicts global net profit of $38.4 billion for the industry. This is much higher than the profitability forecast of $34.5 billion for the current year.Moreover, package delivery companies like FedEx (FDX  -  Free Report) and United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) performed well on the back of e-commerce growth in the most recent holiday season. This further highlights the optimism surrounding transports.Trump’s Tax Overhaul — A BoonOn Dec 22, 2017, Trump signed the much-anticipated tax bill into law (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act). Under the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul package, corporate tax rates have been slashed to 21% from 35%. The significant reduction in corporate tax rate is likely to boost cash flow, which in turn will aid earnings of transportation stocks.Apart from the significant drop in corporate tax rate, the new law allows these companies to deduct their capital expenditures from taxable income in the year of their occurrence, which was not allowed earlier. This aspect hugely favors transportation stocks as they invest substantially toward capital expenditures. As a result, their annual tax bills would be lowered significantly due to higher deductions.For example, Delta, which expects revenues in 2018 to increase between 4% and 6% on a year-over-year basis lifted its earnings per share guidance anticipating the new tax law to boost its results. The company now expects earnings per share in the range of $6.35 to $6.70 (previous outlook: $5.35 to $5.70).Shareholder-Friendly Activities Likely to Pick Up PaceAs noted above, many stocks in the transportation space reward shareholders through dividend payments and buybacks. For example, United Continental Holdings — a key transportation player — announced a new buyback program late last year. Moreover, the likes of Delta and Kansas City Southern hiked their quarterly dividend payouts in 2017.Following the new tax law, we expect an increase in these shareholder-friendly activities from various transportation companies. Due to the significant reduction in their tax bills, more cash is expected to remain in the hands of these companies to fund their capital expenditures, acquisitions and share repurchases among others.Dividend Paying Transports — A Prudent ChoiceIn view of the above-mentioned tailwinds, we believe that stocks from the transportation space should be in one’s portfolio. Moreover, picking dividend stocks seems prudent during uncertain times like the current scenario.Consequently, we have zeroed in on five stocks in this high flying space, which have a strong dividend paying history. Also, these companies have raised their dividend payouts recently. All the chosen stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our first choice is, UPS, the world's largest express carrier. Markedly, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally. UPS’ board of directors cleared an approximately 10% hike in its quarterly dividend to 91 cents per share ($3.64 annually) on Feb 8. The first installment of the new dividend will be paid on Mar 7, 2018 to the stockholders of record on Feb 20.The raised dividend highlights UPS’ commitment to create value for shareholders and underscores the company’s strong financial condition as well as bright prospects, going forward.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has been rewarding shareholders with cash dividends regularly since 1969 and has more than quadrupled its dividend payout since it went public in 1999.Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of A highlights its short-term attractiveness. Notably, the Zacks Momentum Style Score indicates when the timing is right to grab a stock and make the most of its momentum.Our next choice is Union Pacific Corp. (UNP  -  Free Report), which provides rail transportation services across 23 states in the United States through its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad Company.On Feb 8, this railroad operator’s board of directors a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 73 cents per share (annualized $2.92 per share). The first installment of the raised dividend will be paid on Mar 30, 2018 to shareholders as of Feb 28.In fact, this is the company’s second dividend hike in three months.  In November 2017, the company had announced a 10% hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 66.5 cents per share. We believe that two dividend hikes in such a short span reflect the increased financial prosperity following the introduction of the new tax law.Additionally, the company has an impressive dividend history having rewarded shareholders through dividends for 119 consecutive years.The next member in our list is also a railroad operator — Norfolk Southern.  Last month, the company's board of directors increased its quarterly dividend to 72 cents per share (annualized $2.88 per share) from 61 cents per share (annualized $2.44 per share). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 10, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 2.Moreover, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. The company has paid dividends for 142 consecutive quarters, since inception in 1982.GATX Corporation (GATX  -  Free Report) is our next choice. This leading global railcar lessor specializes in railcar and locomotive operating leasing, aircraft operating leasing, information technology leasing, and venture finance for customers in diverse industrial sectors worldwide.On Jan 26, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared a 5% hike in its quarterly dividend to 44 cents per share ($1.76 annually). The first instalment of the new dividend is payable Mar 31, 2018 to shareholders of record on Mar 5.Also, it has an impressive record with respect to dividends. It has been paying dividends regularly since 1919. Furthermore, the company’s Momentum Score of B highlights its short-term attractiveness.The final member in our list is trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT  -  Free Report). On Jan 24, 2018, the company’s board of directors cleared an approximately 4.3% hike in its quarterly dividend to 24 cents per share (96 cents annually). The first installment of the new dividend is payable  Feb 23, 2018 to shareholders of record on Feb 9.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

168,JBHT,"Strong sales growth is one of the most important characteristics of potential winners in the stock market. The companies that put emphasis on sales management have a competitive advantage, as strong sales are generally converted into growth.Revenues are often more closely monitored than earnings while assessing the growth of a business. This is because investors want to make sure whether a business has the capability to generate more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base.Stable or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company and offers limited scope for sustained growth. Stagnant companies may generate near-term profit but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without solid top-line growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable over the longer term. While a company can show earnings strength by reducing expenses, a sustainable bottom-line recovery usually requires robust sales growth.However, sales growth in isolation doesn’t indicate much about a company’s future performance. Though it provides investors an insight into product demand and pricing power, a huge sales number is not necessarily translated into profits.Therefore, taking into consideration a company’s cash position along with its sales number can prove to be a more dependable strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments. Most importantly, an adequate cash position suggests that revenues are being channelized in the right direction.Choosing the Winning StocksIn order to shortlist stocks that have witnessed impressive sales growth along with a high cash balance, we have selected 5-Year Historical Sales Growth (%) greater than X-Industry and Cash Flow greater than $500 million as our main screening parameters.But sales growth and cash strength are not the absolute criteria for selecting stocks. So, we added certain other factors to arrive at a winning strategy.Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio less than X-Industry: This metric determines the value placed on each dollar of a company’s revenues. The lower the ratio, the better it is for picking a stock since the investor is paying less for each unit of sales.% Change F1 Sales Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than X-Industry: Better-than-industry estimate revision has often been seen to trigger an increase in the stock price.Operating Margin (Average Last 5 years) greater than 5%: Operating margin measures how much every dollar of a company's sales translates into profits.

Further, reports that Boeing had delivered a record number of airplanes in 2017 pushed the Dow into record territory. Both, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq increased for the sixth consecutive sessions. Meanwhile, a report from the National Federation of Independent Businesses showed that small-business optimism declined in December.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) increased 0.4% to close at 25,385.80. The S&P 500 rose 0.1% to close at 2,751.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at 7,163.58, gaining 0.1%. The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased almost 6.3% to close at 10.12. Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.02-to-1 ratio favored declining issues.Gains for Boeing Push the Dow HigherShares of Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) surged on Tuesday following reports that the aero-giant delivered a record 763 commercial airplanes in 2017. This marks a fresh record for the airplane maker as it surpassed its earlier record in 2015 by one unit.The company also announced that it had booked orders for 912 commercial airplanes, which is its seventh highest annual total. This led to its highest ever order backlog, which rose to 5,864 airplanes by the end of 2017. Such a backlog is worth around seven years of production. Such events led to shares of Boeing gaining 2.7%, which contributed as much as 57 points to the Dow.The blue-chip index amassed 120.8 points on Tuesday to finish at a record 25,385.80. What also contributed to Dow’s gains was increase in the shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ  -  Free Report), which gained 1.6% and added 15 points to the Dow.

The marks its best start to a year since 1987. Of the 11 major sectors of the broad-market index, only five ended in the positive territory with healthcare and financials leading the advancers and real estate the laggards.However, losses from real estate were more than made up by gains from financial and healthcare stocks. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV) and Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLF) gained 1.2% and 0.8%, respectively.Meanwhile, Nasdaq added 6.2 points to also close at a record for the sixth straight session — its highest since the period between 1992 and 1999.

Such a decline comes right after the Republican Tax Bill was implemented.The decline can be owed to sluggishness and imbalance in the labor market which has impacted hiring in the United States.

174,JBHT,"Friday, November 17, 2017Housing Starts and Permits data has come out this morning, posting better-than-expected results and upward revisions for the previous month. October starts rose 13.7% to 1.29 million seasonally adjusted, annualized units. This is way up from September’s upwardly revised -3.2%, or 1.135 million units. Permits — a forward indicator on future housing starts — were +5.9% last month at just under 1.3 million, following another upwardly revised September read of -3.7%.September, recall, had been ravaged by two major hurricanes making landfall in the continental U.S., as well as another one that ravaged the U.S. property of Puerto Rico. That housing metrics are this solid illustrates a strong bounce-back, and likely a more robust market than many analysts had earlier anticipated.Q3 Earnings Retail RoundupTwo specialty retailers are trading up north of 20% in today’s pre-market on better-than-expected Q3 earnings reports released before the opening bell: Foot Locker (FL  -  Free Report) +25% and Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF  -  Free Report) +20%. The athletic shoe retailer posted 87 cents per share versus 80 cents in the Zacks consensus, on $1.87 billion in sales that surpassed the $1.84 billion anticipated. Both quarterly numbers are down year over year, but after a very tough Retail space in 2017 thus far, market participants see some traction ahead of the all-important earnings holiday shopping season.Abercrombie & Fitch brought in 30 cents per share on $859 million in quarterly revenues, ahead of the 24 cents and $820 million expected. Earnings numbers year over year blew away the 2 cents per share in fiscal Q317 by more than 1300%, and is the second-straight positive earnings surprise this year.And Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) retailer Buckle Inc. (BKE  -  Free Report) is trading up 7% in the early market on a two-cent earnings beat to 41 cents per share. Sales were in-line with expectations at $224.3 million in the quarter.

175,JBHT,"The transportation sector is struggling this earnings season with total earnings from 97.9% of the sector’s total market capitalization that has reported so far down 14.2% despite revenue growth of 5.1%. This is much below earnings growth of 9.6% and revenue growth of 10% for the same period, in the last reporting cycle (read: 5 Sector ETFs for Revenue Growth Play).Earnings and revenue beat ratio of 69.2% and 61.5%, respectively, are also disappointing despite the fact that most of the industry players dominating the sector managed to beat our estimates on earnings or revenues or both.For a better understanding, let’s dig into the earnings results of some well-known industry players:Transportation Earnings in FocusThe world's largest package delivery company United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both fronts. Earnings of $1.45 surpassed our earnings estimate by a penny while revenues of $15.98 billion edged past the estimated $15.61 billion. For fiscal 2017, the company narrowed its earnings per share guidance range from $5.80-$6.10 to $5.85-$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $6.00.The major railroads Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report), Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) and Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) also beat on both the top and bottom lines. NSC outpaced the earnings estimate by a wide margin of 11 cents while earnings at UNP and KSU came ahead by a penny and three cents, respectively. Revenues for the three railroads trumped their Zacks Consensus Estimate by $102 million, $9 million and $40 million, respectively.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat the earnings estimate by four cents and revenue estimate by $42 million.The two largest U.S. airlines Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) reported better-than-expected results but the latter lagged on revenues. Earnings of $1.57 and revenues of $11.1 billion at Delta edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.54 and $11.03 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.22 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.18 but revenues of $9.878 billion slightly fell shy of the estimated $9.88 billion (read: Will Airline ETF Crash on Subdued Q3 or Take Off on Value?).Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nickel but revenues were $28 million above the estimate.ETFs in FocusGiven this, the sector saw a 2.3% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. As such, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading in the past one month. IYT shed 1.6% while XTN was down 0.4%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank #4 (Sell) rating with a High risk outlook (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large-cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 26% and 19% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm FedEx (FDX) at 14.3%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 47.2% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 30.8% of the portfolio while railroads, trucking and airlines round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $799.2 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of around 258,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees.XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 43 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 47% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 32.3% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $194.6 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a lower volume of around 22,000 shares a day (read: ETFs to Buy After Weak Jobs Report).Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

176,JBHT,"The third-quarter earnings season is in its tail end with majority of the companies having already unveiled their quarterly financial numbers. The picture that has emanated so far is a healthy one and this earnings season remains on track to end on a strong note, displaying substantial growth.The already reassuring picture is expected to get rosier by the end of this week. During the course, 826 companies including the 49 S&P 500 players are expected to report their financial figures. Consequently, we will have reports from the 455 S&P 500 players as 406 companies in the highly-sought after space had already posted results as of Nov 3.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the top and bottom lines for the 406 S&P 500 companies expanded 6.3% and 7.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, approximately 66.7% and 73.9% of the S&P 500 members have outperformed on the revenues and earnings front. This progress in the quarterly performance can be attributed to a turnaround in the economy and improved job market scenario, among other factors.In fact, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are projected to end the third quarter with their top and bottom lines expanding 5.6% and 6.5%, respectively. Also, nine of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis.Turbulent Q3 for TransportsThe widely-diversified Zacks Transportation sector does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14%, due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes.Evidently, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) in the third quarter has contracted a respective 7.6% and 28.6%, on a year-over-year basis. Thus, substantiating the fact that the transportation sector has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of the quarter.Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await third-quarter reports from sector participants like Expeditors International of Washington (EXPD  -  Free Report) and Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings (AAWW  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Nov 7.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Expeditors International of Washington provides logistic services globally. The company is engaged in the business of global logistics management including international freight forwarding and consolidation for both air and ocean freight.Higher operating expenses are likely to hit this transportation company’s bottom line in the quarter. In fact, increased volumes might lead to higher operating expenses at all the three primary divisions — Airfreight services, Ocean freight and ocean services, and Customs brokerage and other services — of the company. Personnel expenses are also expected to be high, owing to higher headcount.However, the top line is anticipated to improve in the soon-to-be reported quarter.

179,JBHT,"The Q3 earnings season is in full flow with earnings reports available from more than 135 S&P 500 companies. In fact the current week is an extremely busy one with 722 companies (including 180 S&P 500 players) slated to unveil their numbers during its course.Per the latest Earnings Preview, stocks in the highly sought-after fraternity are projected to end Q3 with their top and bottom lines expanding 5% and 2.6%, respectively. In fact, seven of the 16 Zacks sectors are expected to witness their bottom line expand on a year-over-year basis.Rough Ride for Transports in Q3?The Zacks Transportation sector, does not share this rosy picture with the sectoral earnings projected to contract 14.9% due to higher costs and the recent hurricanes. In fact, the bottom line for key sectoral participants like Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental Holdings (UAL  -  Free Report) have contracted 7.6% and 28.6%, respectively, in Q3 on a year-over-year basis.Notably, the unfavorable projection for this widely-diversified sector highlights the fact it has been one of the worst victims of the natural disasters (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico). For example, airline operators had to cancel multiple flights leading to significant loss in revenues.In fact, the negative impact of the hurricanes is also well reflected in the key transportation earnings reports available thus far. Evidently, United Continental Holdings had to cancel 8,300 flights in the quarter and consequently its third-quarter pretax income reduced to the tune of approximately $185 million.Additionally, these catastrophes have hurt operations of railroads by damaging important rail lines, leading to rapid increase in freight costs. Also, the sluggishness of the automotive unit is a cause of concern for railroads. For trucking companies, shortage of drivers remains a major headwind. Meanwhile, the rise in labor costs has hurt J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) third-quarter results and the trend is likely to continue in the rest of Q3.Stocks to Watch for Earnings on Oct 26Given this backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await Q3 reports from key sector participants like American Airlines Group (AAL  -  Free Report), United Parcel Service (UPS  -  Free Report) and Southwest Airlines (LUV  -  Free Report) that are scheduled for Oct 26.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESPand a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.American Airlines Group, headquartered in Fort Worth, TX, operates more than 6,700 daily flights to over 330 destinations in more than 50 nations across the globe. Of late, this carrier also underwent a turbulent phase like the other airlines, mainly due to the hurricanes.Consequently, the company called off approximately 8,000 flights in the third quarter. Also, increased costs (fuel and labor) are expected to hit the bottom line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price per gallon (including taxes) is pegged at $1.59, much higher than the $1.48 reported a year ago.Despite the disruptions, the scenario with respect to total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) is an improved one from the year-ago quarter, courtesy better-than-expected yields. For the third quarter, American Airlines expects total revenue per available seat mile (TRASM) to grow between 0.5% and 1.5%.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter TRASM is pegged at 14.98 cents, higher than 14.73 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter yields is pegged at 15.56 cents, higher than 15.27 cents reported in the third quarter of 2016.However, the chances of this legacy carrier beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate in Q3 are less, even though it has an Earnings ESP of +0.53%. This is because American Airlines’ Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) acts as a spoiler.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier as well. Previously, when we issued its Q3 earnings preview article, the company had an Earnings ESP of +1.41%, while the Zacks Rank remained the same.

Price and EPS Surprise | American Airlines Group, Inc. QuoteThe next company United Parcel Service is the world's largest express carrier. Markedly, UPS provides specialized transportation and logistics services in the United States and internationally.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter U.S. Domestic Package revenues is pegged at $9,695 million, just below the figure of $9,745 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. The same for International Package revenues is pegged at $3,076 million, below the figure of $3,163 million reported in the second quarter of 2017. Also, high costs are likely to hurt the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -0.06% (read more: What's in the Cards for UPS Stock This Earnings Season?).United Parcel Service, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  United Parcel Service, Inc.

Additionally, growth in e-commerce is likely to benefit UPS.Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines’ third-quarter results are expected to be hurt due to the recent hurricanes and the earthquake in Mexico. These natural disasters have forced the airline to cancel approximately 5,000 flights. Owing to the multiple flight cancellations, the company expects the quarters’ operating revenues to be hurt to the tune of $100 million.Increased costs are expected to hurt the bottom line as well. Cost per available seat miles, excluding special items, is estimated to increase between 3% and 4%. Fuel price per gallon is anticipated between $2.00 and $2.05 in the quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter fuel price is pegged at $2.00 per gallon, higher than $1.93 reported in the second quarter of 2017.According to our proven model, the chances of the company beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in this quarter are less. This is because it has an Earnings ESP of -0.61% and carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) (read more: Will Southwest Airlines Disappoint in Q3 Earnings?).Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise  Southwest Airlines Company Price and EPS Surprise | Southwest Airlines Company Quote  Zacks' Hidden Trades While we share many recommendations and ideas with the public, certain moves are hidden from everyone but selected members of our portfolio services.

180,JBHT,"Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report second-quarter 2018 results on Jul 18 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company came up with a negative earnings surprise of 1.4% on lower-than-expected earnings and revenues. Results were hurt by rough weather conditions. However, the top and the bottom line improved from the year-ago figures.Things do not look up for the company this to-be-reported quarter too.Factors at PlaySimilar to the previous quarter, revenues at the Grain, Forest products and Automotive segments might decline in the second quarter as well. Soft revenues are likely to affect the top line and overall results.The company’s high operating expenses also raise concerns and are anticipated to hurt the operating ratio, limiting bottom-line growth.Further adding to the woes are the company’s high-debt levels. Its debt-to-equity (expressed as a percentage) ratio is currently more than 100. The figure compares unfavorably with the industry’s 71.1% average and the S&P 500 index’s tally of 81.4%.Due to the headwinds, shares of the company have underperformed its industry in the Apr-June period, gaining only 3.7% compared with the industry’s 8.3% rise. However, the company’s measures to reward shareholders through dividends and share buybacks are impressive. This May, it raised its quarterly dividend per share by 15.5% to C$0.65 per share. The company is also active on the repurchase front.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Canadian Pacific is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. But that is not the case here as elaborated below.Zacks ESP: Canadian Pacific has an Earnings ESP of -0.59% as the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.44 per share, marginally lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.45.

181,JBHT,"CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) is slated to report second-quarter 2018 earnings on Jul 17 after market close.Last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 18.2% with better-than-expected earnings and revenues. Moreover, both the measures improved on a year-over-year basis. A substantial decrease in operating expenses also aided results.With the Precision Scheduled Railroading well underway, things look up for the company in the second quarter as well.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that CSX is likely to beat on earnings this quarter on the back of a perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: CSX has an Earnings ESP of +1.72%, representing the difference between the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate. While the Most Accurate Estimate stands at 87 cents per share, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged lower at 85 cents. A positive Zacks ESP is indicative of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: CSX carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. Note that stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 or 3 (Hold) have significantly higher chances of beating estimates.Conversely, Sell-rated stocks (#4 or 5) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  CSX Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | CSX Corporation QuoteFactors Likely at PlayThe company’s cost-cutting efforts are anticipated to boost results in the to-be-reported quarter. CSX has been benefitting immensely from the Precision Scheduled Railroading system, designed to improve operational efficiency, by lowering costs and optimal asset utilization. Reduced operating expenses are expected to improve operating ratio and drive bottom-line growth.Impressive performance of the intermodal and coal segments is also likely to produce better results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $476 million, higher than $448 million a year ago. The figure also compares favorably with $449 million, recorded in the preceding quarter.The consensus mark for coal revenues is pegged at $541 million. The tally compares favorably with $530 million and $503 million, reported in the prior-year quarter and the first quarter, respectively.Needless to mention, the new tax law is also expected to buoy results in the second quarter. As expected, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has been aiding results since its implementation in December 2017 and the second quarter is not likely to be any different. The reduced effective tax rate arising from the slashed corporate tax rate is expected to boost the company’s bottom line in the period to be reported.However, the company’s high-debt levels remain a cause for concern.Other Stocks to ConsiderInvestors interested in the broader Transportation sector may also consider United Parcel Service, Inc.

However, the bottom line improved 16.3% on a year-over-year basis despite higher operating expenses. In fact, the 19.6% year-over-year increase in revenues to $1,948.2 million aided results.

Shares of the company have gained 3.8% in the Apr-Jun period, outperforming the industry’s 0.6% rise. Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat on earnings this quarter because it has the perfect combination of the following two key ingredients:Zacks ESP: J.B. Hunt has an Earnings ESP of +0.95%.

The same for ICS is $308 million, more than $296 million in the preceding quarter.However, high costs might affect the company’s bottom line in the second quarter.

183,JBHT,"Investors interested in Transportation - Truck stocks are likely familiar with Werner Enterprises (WERN  -  Free Report) and JB Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, Werner Enterprises has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while JB Hunt has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).

JBHT currently has a PEG ratio of 1.91.Another notable valuation metric for WERN is its P/B ratio of 2.38. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities.

186,JBHT,"The Q3 earnings season is in the nascent stage with 32 S&P 500 participants having reported results so far. As is the norm, the early earnings reports included those of major banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM  -  Free Report) and Citigroup Inc. (C  -  Free Report).Again, this current week is going to an extremely busy one with 178 companies, including 53 S&P 500 participants, revealing their Q3 numbers.In fact, the Transportation sector (one of the 16 Zacks sectors) has seen third-quarter reports from a handful of players. Evidently, airline behemoth Delta Air Lines’ (DAL  -  Free Report) earnings per share and revenues surpassed expectations, despite recent natural calamities. On the flip side, J.B. Hunt Transport Services’ (JBHT  -  Free Report) posted mixed results,  wherein the company reported lower-than-expected earnings per share but better-than-expected revenues.Though too early to reach a definite conclusion about the performance of this sector, it is widely expected that the recent natural calamities (Harvey, Irma, Maria and the earthquake in Mexico) will dent results of the sector participants in Q3.  The latest Earnings Preview too predicts that this widely diversified sector will cut a sorry figure in the quarter under review, with its bottom line contracting 15.5% owing to high costs.Markedly, one of the key components of the transportation sector are railroads. Though things are looking up for the same following improvement in the coal-related scenario and U.S. Presidential election last year, the natural disasters are likely to hurt earnings. These, in turn, have hurt operations at railroads by damaging important rail lines. Also, freight costs have skyrocketed following the natural disasters. With fuel costs on the rise, the bottom line of the same are likely to be hurt in Q3 due to the escalating costs induced by the hurricanes.Given this gloomy backdrop, investors interested in the transportation space will keenly await earnings reports of key railroads companies like CSX Corporation (CSX  -  Free Report) and Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP  -  Free Report) on Oct 17.According to our quantitative model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase its odds of an earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.CSX Corporation is not expected to report better-than-expected earnings per share in this quarter despite the improvement in coal revenues.The bullish sentiment pertaining to the commodity is reflected by the fact that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter coal revenues is $530 million, much higher than the $501 million expected in the second quarter of 2017.  In fact, this Jacksonville, FL-based company’s intermodal segment is also expected to perform well in the third quarter of 2017. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter intermodal revenues stands at $451 million, again higher than the $446 million expected in the second quarter of 2017. Despite the bullish top-line scenario, the bottom line is expected to be hurt by increased costs induced by the hurricanes. Also, the recent service issues encountered by the company may hurt results.In fact, our proven model too does not conclusively show that CSX is likely to beat earnings estimates in Q3, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of -0.88%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too.

Freight revenues from the grain and potash units should also be impressive in Q3. However, high costs are likely to hurt the bottom line of the Calgary, Canada-based company. Consequently, our proven model too does not show that Canadian Pacific is likely to outperform with respect to the bottom line in Q3, despite its Zacks Rank #3. This is because the company has an Earnings ESP of - 0.66%. This is because the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.31 per share is currently pegged at 2 cents above the Most Accurate estimate.In fact, our model did not predict an earnings beat earlier too.

Total operating revenues increased 9.1% year over year to $1,843.3 million and also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,826.8 million.Let’s see how things are shaping up this earnings season.Factors at PlayHigh labor costs are likely to hurt the company's fourth-quarter results, ditto the previous quarter.The company has provided a tepid outlook for the fourth quarter.J.B.

While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the metric stands at the lowest point of this guided range. Fourth-quarter operating income is estimated in the band of $145-$155 million.Moreover, the company’s high leverage ratio may further affect results in the quarter.However, volume growth at the company's primary division — intermodal — may buoy results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Further, the Tax Cut and Jobs Act is likely to aid J.B. Hunt. The company expects the tax overhaul to result in a one-time benefit for 2017. Effective tax rate in the final quarter of 2017 is estimated at 37.6%.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that J.B. Hunt is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

189,JBHT,"Benchmarks eked out modest gains on Thursday, buoyed by gains in bank and tech stocks. In particular, tech players posted their second straight gain on the heels of a five-day losing streak. Even though the technology sector faced gyrations to close out the year, it still remains the best performing sector in 2017, up a staggering 37%. Marginal uptick in energy shares due to an increase in both crude oil and natural gas prices also helped the broader markets end in the green.How the Benchmarks Fared?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) increased 65.52 points, or 0.3%, to 24,837.51. The blue-chip index notched its 71st record close in 2017. The 30-stock index is also inching closer to the 25,000 milestone after having crossed the 20,000, 21,000, 22,000, 23,000 and 24,000 levels this year.The S&P 500 Index (INX) went up 4.87 points, or 0.2%, to 2,687.54, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,949.24, gaining 0.1%. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are just below their all-time highs. In fact, all the three major bourses are on track to end the year with double-digit gains. Meanwhile, the Russell 2000 index of smaller-cap companies went up 4.99 points, or 0.3%, to 1,548.93.A total of 4.26 billion shares were traded on Thursday, lower than the last 20-session average of 6.6 billion shares. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.92-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.51-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues.Market volatility isn’t roaring back either, with 2017 being the calmest for stocks since 1964. The so-called “fear gauge”, CBOE Volatility Index traded at 9.98, substantially lower than its long-term average of 20. What Drove Banks Higher?Banks contributed towards much of the equity market’s gains. As bond yields perked up, bank stocks gained traction as it enables them to charge higher interest rates on loans. The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 2.43% from 2.41% late Wednesday.Long-awaited tax cuts also provided a big boost to banks. Jubilant Republicans has passed the tax overhaul bill for the first time in 30 years. The bill slashes corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%. Such long awaited tax cuts boosted big banks as they have been paying heavy taxes.Banks face a high tax burden, which makes them big gainers when tax rates go down. As per KBW estimates, JPMorgan Chase (JPM  -  Free Report), Wells Fargo & Co (WFC  -  Free Report) and Bank of America Corp (BAC  -  Free Report) will enjoy a 20% or more hike in profits if the corporate tax rate is cut to 20%. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.As widely expected, the Federal Reserve too raised short-term interest rates for the third time this year and projects three more hikes next year on a strengthening economy. Higher interest rates can boost bank profits as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities.Stocks That Made HeadlinesJ.B.

Earnings of $1.58 surpassed our earnings estimate by 12 cents while revenues of $15.75 billion edged past our estimated $15.48 billion. For the current fiscal 2017, the company continues to expect earnings per share in the range of $5.80–$6.10. The Zacks Consensus Estimate at the time of earnings release was pegged at $5.95.The major railroads – Union Pacific (UNP  -  Free Report)) and Kansas City Southern (KSU  -  Free Report) – beat on both the top and the bottom lines while Norfolk Southern Corp (NSC  -  Free Report) lagged on revenues. UNP and KSU surpassed our earnings estimate by 8 cents and 7 cents, respectively, and revenue estimates by $87 million and $33 million. On the other hand, earnings of $1.71 at NSC trumped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7 cents while revenues of $2.637 billion were marginally below our estimated $2.642 billion.Ryder Systems (R  -  Free Report), the leader in supply chain management and fleet management services, beat our earnings estimate by 7 cents and revenue estimate by $24 million (see: all the Industrials ETFs here).The two largest U.S. airlines – Delta Air Lines (DAL  -  Free Report) and United Continental (UAL  -  Free Report) – reported varied results. Earnings of $1.62 and revenues of $10.79 billion at Delta missed our estimates of $1.66 and $10.85 billion, respectively. At United Continental, earnings per share of $2.75 came above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.72 and revenues of $10 billion were ahead of our estimated $9.96 billion.Last but not the least, earnings for the leading trucking carrier – J.B. Hunt (JBHT  -  Free Report) – came in below the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4 cents and revenues were $6 million below our estimate.ETFs in FocusHowever, strong results failed to boost transport stocks as the sector saw 2.4% average decline (average price difference between a day before and after the earnings announcement of a stock) in response to earnings announcements. Given this, both transport ETFs, iShares Dow Jones Transportation Average Fund (IYT  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Transportation ETF (XTN  -  Free Report), saw rough trading over the past one month. IYT shed 3.7% while XTN was down 2.2%. Both funds have an unfavorable Zacks ETF Rank of 4 or ‘Sell’ rating with a High risk outlook.IYTThe fund tracks the Dow Jones Transportation Average Index, giving investors exposure to a small basket of 20 securities. The fund has a certain tilt toward large cap stocks at 55% while mid and small caps account for 28% and 18% share, respectively, in the basket. Though the product is heavily concentrated on the top firm – FedEx (FDX) – at 13.7%, the in-focus eight firms collectively make up for 46.7% of the portfolio. From a sector perspective, air freight & logistics takes the top spot with 29.8% of the portfolio while railroads, airlines and trucking round off to the next three spots with double-digit exposure each. The fund has accumulated nearly $842.7 million in AUM while sees solid trading volume of more than 342,000 shares a day. It charges 44 bps in annual fees (read: Transport ETF Hits New 52-Week High).XTNThis fund tracks the S&P Transportation Select Industry Index, holding 45 stocks in its basket. It is skewed toward small caps at 55% while the rest is split between mid and large caps. As a result, the in-focus firms account for over 2% share each. Further, about 36.4% of the portfolio is dominated by trucking, while airlines takes one-fourth share. Airfreight & logistics, and railroads also make up for a double-digit allocation each. With AUM of $176.5 million, the fund charges 35 bps in fees per year from investors and trades in a moderate volume of around 33,000 shares a day. Want key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?Zacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

196,JBHT,"The Tax Cut and Jobs Act is likely to boost the transportation sector and J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (JBHT  -  Free Report) is no exception. Evidently, shares of the company have outperformed the industry it belongs to in December 2017. The stock has gained 5.5% compared with the industry’s gain of 2.9%.J.B. Hunt 's growth by acquisition strategy raises optimism. To this end, the company had announced its decision to acquire Special Logistics Dedicated and its affiliated entities for $136 million in 2017. Post completion, the acquisition is expected to enhance the company's e-commerce delivery capabilities. Notably, the transaction will be accretive in 2018. Additionally, volume growth across the company’s primary division — intermodal — is also encouraging.The company’s efforts to reward shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases are also impressive. As of Sep 30, 2017, the company had roughly $521 million remaining under its total share buyback authorizations.The company recently provided an update on its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings, slated to be announced on Jan 18. It anticipates earnings per share (on a reported basis) between 77 cents and 82 cents in the final quarter. The projection is inclusive of a charge to the tune of 11 cents for a reserve on a cash advance for the purchase of new trailing equipment from a manufacturer that will not meet delivery. Additionally, it includes an increase in reserves to the tune of 10 cents pertaining to certain insurance and claims.J.B. Hunt further expects its bottom line to vary between 98 cents and $1.03 per share, excluding the above charges. Revenues in the quarter are predicted in the range of $1.9-$ 2.0 billion.Effective tax rate in the final quarter of 2017 is estimated to be 37.6%. Even though the tax overhaul, which became a law on Dec 22, is expected to have minimal effect on the company’s fourth-quarter operating income, it is expected to aid J.B. Hunt thereafter by significantly reducing its tax bill. This will leave more cash for J.B. Hunt to fund its capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases among others.In view of the above positives, we believe investors would do better to retain J.B. Hunt stock in their portfolio for now.Zacks Rank & Key PicksJ.B. Hunt carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).
