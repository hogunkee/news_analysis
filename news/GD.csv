2,GD,"The coalition of companies jockeying with Amazon.com (AMZN) for a lucrative Pentagon computing contract is far bigger than previously reported, signaling added heft behind efforts to keep the work from going exclusively to the world's largest cloud services provider.SAP America (SAP), General Dynamics' (GD) CSRA unit, Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among at least nine companies that have coordinated their opposition to the government awarding the contract to a single provider, according to emails obtained by Bloomberg News. The Amazon cloud services business leads the market and is widely perceived to be the front-runner.The most active members of the coalition trying to fend off an Amazon cloud win are Oracle (ORCL), Microsoft (MSFT) and International Business Machines (IBM), according to two people familiar with the matter. Other companies involved include Dell Technologies (DVMT) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), Bloomberg has reported.SAP and the others aren't considered top contenders for the contract. But the companies are banding together to fight the Pentagon's plans to award it to a single bidder. They're concerned it could disrupt their established business model for obtaining military contracts.The Pentagon announced a winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar cloud services contract in March.It has since paused the bidding process for the project. The reason is it would transition massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. The government has said it still plans to award the contract by September.Representatives for SAP, Red Hat, CSRA and VMware declined to comment.The interest is widespread among technology companies in pressing the Pentagon to change its procurement approach. For one, it indicates the importance of the lucrative contract. Providers are struggling to catch up to Amazon cloud. The same is true for firms that sell software and other technology to federal agencies.Companies have begun conversations about jointly bidding for the contract known as Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, sources say.The Pentagon has tapped Dana Deasy to be its new chief information officer to oversee the contract. Members of the coalition welcome the move, sources say.""Dana Deasy is a highly professional, seasoned, transformational CIO who will lead the DoD's technology efforts with distinction,"" Oracle's Senior Vice President Ken Glueck said in a statement.Deasy's comments before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in May pleased the coalition, sources say. While he didn't address the JEDI contract specifically, he talked about the importance of using multiple cloud providers.Deasy previously worked as global chief information officer for JPMorgan Chase (JPM) at a time when the company made major investments to transition to a public cloud. He held similar positions at the North American unit of General Motors (GM), Tyco International and Siemens' (SIEGY) North American operation.""Under Deasy's leadership, the department will gradually consolidate its disparate networks, data centers and cloud efforts to manage them at the enterprise level,"" Pentagon spokeswoman Heather Babb said in a statement Monday.To advance their agenda, the tech allies have been strategizing by email and phone. They've courted trade and mainstream media and lobbying lawmakers, defense officials and the White House, Bloomberg has reported.The competitive cloud coalition has notched some wins. The House committee in charge of federal spending approved a Defense Department funding bill this month. It would halt funding for the contract until the Pentagon submits a strategy to sustain competition and use multiple cloud-service providers.It is the third attempt by lawmakers to influence the process. The full House is scheduled to take up the spending measure this week.

3,GD,"Defense stocks fell Tuesday after President Donald Trump announced at his meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore that he would end military drills with South Korea and eventually would like to withdraw U.S. troops from the South.XNorth Korea historically has objected to the drills as an act of aggression. But leading up to the Trump-Kim summit, Pygonyang signaled it wouldn't make the drills a sticking point.South Korea was reportedly surprised by the concession and said it needed ""to find out the precise meaning or intentions"" of Trump's announcement. Seoul and the U.S. had scheduled their drills to start in August.Kim pledged to denuclearize North Korea, but the agreement signed in Singapore lacked key details likes timelines and a verification process.Trump said halting the joint military exercises would save money. He previously has complained about the amount of money the U.S. spends stationing troops in South Korea and Japan.Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan have deployed missile defense systems from defense stocks Raytheon (RTN) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) to counter the North Korean threat.After reporting Q1 earnings in April, Raytheon said it expects missile defense demand to remain strong, in the Asia region specifically, regardless of what happens in expected U.S.-North Korea talks.Still, Raytheon led defense stocks lower, tumbling 2.8% to 206.64 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares fell 1.3% to 315.13. Northrop Grumman (NOC) was down 1.5% to 339.36. Boeing (BA) edged 0.1% lower to 370.61, still in buy range after breaking out of a cup-with-handle-base with a 365.10 buy point. General Dynamics (GD) lost 1.6%.A top European defense official also warned that Europe should rely less on U.S. weapons technology.Trump has also been vocal about NATO depending too much on the U.S. for security without paying for the protection. Jorge Domecq, chief of the European Defense Agency, said Europe needs to ease its reliance on military hardware deals with the U.S. to achieve ""strategic autonomy,"" Defense News reported.Lockheed, which makes the F-35 for the U.S. military as well as for export, wants to have 30% of its revenue come from international customers. The U.K., Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway have bought the F-35, and Belgium is considering buying the fifth-generation jet.Poland and Sweden have recently bought Raytheon's Patriot missile defense systems as tensions rise with Russia.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsFather Of Stealth Ben Rich Found Success In The 'Hopeless Diamond'

5,GD,"Boeing (BA) said an aircraft completion center in China is nearly finished as it downplayed U.S.-China trade war fears, after easily beating first-quarter forecasts and raising its guidance Wednesday.In March, President Trump announced steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, and China retaliated with tariffs of its own on U.S. products, including some Boeing jets.""We're frankly encouraged by the continued dialogue,"" between the U.S. and China, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said during the company's first-quarter earnings call.He noted that Boeing has been engaged with Beijing for years, adding that executives are making a visit to China.He also said the company wasn't seeing any material effect ""right now"" from inflation on aluminum or other raw material costs.While fears of a trade war have since eased with China's counter-tariffs seen having a limited impact on Boeing, the country remains a key source of aviation growth and a potential vulnerability going forward.In the past three years, one out of four airplanes Boeing makes, including one in three 787 Dreamliners, was delivered to customers in China.And some 40% of Boeing's backlog, which represents about seven years of production, is for customers in the Asia-Pacific region, Boeing officials said in January.Meanwhile, Boeing is working to open its long-planned aircraft completion center for 737s sold to Chinese customers by the end of the year, Muilenburg said.Shares closed up 4.2% at 342.86 on the stock market today, after falling 2.9% Tuesday amid the broad market sell-off.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

Shares ended the week at 185.09. But Facebook fell 3.5% in the premarket.Facebook late Friday suspended Cambridge Analytica, which helped President Trump's election campaign. Reports said that was for not deleting data on some 50 million Facebook users. That sparked harsh criticism from U.S. and U.K. politicians and is latest black eye for CEO Mark Zuckerberg as he deals with criticism over his platform's huge size and how it operates.Meanwhile, the FANG internet giant hasn't been a market leader for months, unlike fellow FANGs Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon and, to a lesser extent, Alphabet.Its relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500 index, hasn't made headway since late July, trending down since start of November. You want to see a stock that is truly leading the market. Why else invest in a specific stock, with all that company risk, if it's not providing a return over the general market.

That's a far cry from Netflix's 66% and Amazon's 33% — but Alphabet's RS line has been performing better.Meanwhile, Facebook's growth story may be winding down. The social networking giant has acknowledged that users spent less time on the main Facebook site in the fourth quarter, and that's before new changes to the News Feed that will likely reduce engagement. User growth is slowing, with North America daily active users falling sequentially for the first time.At the same time, Facebook is ramping up spending on staff and other resources to curb fake news and prevent the platform from being exploited by Russia or others during political campaigns. That spending may be necessary, but it won't help profits.This week, the European Commission is expected to propose a 3% tax on digital revenue, including on online advertising, selling digital data and ""intermediary services"" in which platforms allow users to buy and sell goods and services to each other. The digital tax would hit Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter (TWTR), Apple (AAPL), Uber and others, mostly U.S. internet firms.Alphabet, Twitter, Amazon and Apple all fell 1% or so in the premarket.CACI bid some $7.2 billion, or $44 a share, for CSRA, consisting of $15 in cash plus 0.184 CACI share. CSRA had previously accepted a $40.75 all-cash offer from General Dynamics. CSRA said its board will evaluate the CACI offer.CACI shares were not yet active Monday morning, while CSRA rose 2.7% to 41.74.

14,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported first-quarter results above Wall Street estimates Tuesday but shares tumbled as investors were disappointed that the defense contractor didn't raise its cash-flow expectations.The F-35 maker raised its full-year EPS estimates to $15.80- $16.10, above consensus for $15.55, from a prior outlook of $15.20- $15.50, and raised its full-year revenue forecast to $50.35 billion-$51.85 billion, vs. Wall Street views for $50.96 billion, from its prior guidance of $50 billion-$51.5 billion.But cash flow was the only key metric it didn't raise, keeping it at $3 billion, and CFO Bruce Tanner warned pension contributions could result in ""negative cash from operations in the second quarter.""That weighed on hopes for bigger dividends on the same day that the 10-year Treasury yield topped 3% for the first time since 2014, meaning dividend-paying stocks are less attractive relative to debt.Get Free Access To IBD Digital Through April 29

The stock had been in a cup base with a 363.10 entry point.Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, said industrials were down broadly over concerns with potential commodity pricing pressure, also weighing on Lockheed's stock.Boeing (BA), which reports Wednesday, fell 2.9%. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD), fell 4.1% and 1.7%, respectively. Raytheon (RTN), which is on tap Thursday, tumbled 4.1%, falling out of buy range.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseLockheed reported a 49.4% increase in earnings to $4.02 per share and a 3.8% rise in revenue to $11.6 billion. Analysts expected a 14% increase in EPS to $3.41 with revenue up 2.2% to $11.303 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Aeronautics revenue, which includes the F-35, climbed 7% year-over-year to $278 million on increased volume of the F-35 as well as the F-16 and F-22 modernization programs.Missile systems sales rose 8% to $128 million on higher net sales of classified programs and increased volumes of the Long Range Stand Off (LRSO) missile and Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).Rotary and mission systems revenue, which includes Sikorsky helicopters, climbed 3.1% to $3.22 billion. Space revenue dipped 3.3% to $2.34 billion.Backlog climbed to $105 billion at the end of Q1, up from $100 billion at the end of Q4.Lockheed is ramping up production of the F-35 as the U.S. and its allies order the stealth fighter in greater quantities. But tensions with the Defense Department have been evident as its most expensive acquisition program ever continues to face scrutiny.The Defense Department recently ordered Lockheed Martin to find ways to reduce the current $1.1 trillion estimate to own and operate the F-35.The Pentagon also has stopped taking F-35 deliveries over a contract dispute on correcting production errors.During the company's call, Hewson said she expects ""resolution on this soon"" and said that Lockheed will still meet its delivery goal of over 90 F-35s this year.Lockheed CFO Bruce Tanner said the F-35 program revenue will grow at a faster rate than the corporation's top line throughout the end of the decade and possibly beyond that.Negotiations with the Pentagon for next production batch of 130 F-35s are ""progressing,"" according to Hewson and she expects closure ""in the near-term.""Meanwhile, overseas demand for Lockheed weapons, such as its THAAD missile-defense system, remains strong. The White House last week ordered government agencies to expedite and expand arms sales abroad.Defense contractors overall are enjoying an increase in military spending, which is also going to future weapons to stay ahead of adversaries.The Air Force last week awarded Lockheed a key hypersonic weapons contract as Russia and China push the race to develop the disruptive technology.The contract is worth up to $928 million over the life of the program, which seeks to build a weapon that could be launched from fighters and bombers.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: These Aerospace, Defense Giants With Earnings Due Are Near Buy ZonesDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

18,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported fourth-quarter results ahead of Wall Street expectations Monday and gave strong profit guidance.X Excluding a one-time $1.9 billion charge due to the new tax act, earnings jumped 32% to $4.30 per share while revenue rose 10% to $15.1 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of $4.06 a share on revenue of $14.75 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.Lockheed sees 2018 earnings of $15.20-$15.50 a share and revenue of $50 billion to $51.5 billion vs. analyst consensus for earnings of $14 a share on sales of $51.53 billion.Lockheed shares closed up 1.9% to a new high of 351.42 on the stock market today. Boeing (BA), which reports Wednesday, slipped 0.7% to 340.82.Aeronautics unit sales rose 11.8% to $6.04 billion on increased production of the F-35 and deliveries of the C-130 as profit margins widened by 20%. The F-35, the costliest procurement program in Defense Department history, is seeing faster rates of production, and Lockheed met its delivery target last year despite Pentagon warnings that the company would fall short.But the aircraft's performance after it comes off the assembly line has come under scrutiny. A recent report from the Pentagon's top weapons tester found that efforts to improve the F-35's reliability are ""stagnant,"" according to Bloomberg.But Lockheed later defended the program, saying that reliability of the F-35's weapons systems has been improving over successive production lots, with newer jets averaging more than 60% availability.Bloomberg also reported that Lockheed is asking the Pentagon for $212 million for restructuring costs for its acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft, claiming it will save taxpayers money.Missile and fire control unit sales jumped 30.5% to $2.29 billion on increased air and missile defense deliveries, but space systems unit sales fell 12% to $2.45 billion on fewer government satellite launches.When asked if some of the tax cut savings could be spent on R&D for efforts to develop a boost phase missile defense — shooting down a missile during the ascent phase — during the conference call, Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson said that spending on R&D ""would be right in line for our customers.""Missile defense was highlighted as a priority in Washington's National Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy and Hewson touted a recent test pairing the company's Aegis defense system with the F-35 to spot targets sooner. She also mentioned investments in hypersonics and directed energy R&D.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Rotary and mission systems sales climbed 14% to $4.35 billion. But Lockheed still expects a muted year for commercial helicopters. Chief Financial Officer Bruce Tanner said oil and gas will have to stay at $65 per barrel for longer before there will be ramp up in commercial sales.""We're not expecting large increase in commercial helicopters in 2018 and looking flat in 2019,"" he said during the company's conference call. ""But that could change pretty quickly based on oil and gas prices.""Lockheed also said it plans to invest $5 billion in its pension plans to pre-pay through 2021 to see a $1 billion benefit under a new accounting standard.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped fourth-quarter profit forecasts, though Raytheon and General Dynamics missed on revenue while Northrop beat.Northrop also lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.

19,GD,"Defense earnings are on tap this week after the Pentagon announced a shift in focus from fighting terrorism to near-peer threats but quarterly results and guidance will be dominated by recent tax cuts.X General Dynamics (GD) will kick off Q4 results on Wednesday with Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) on tap for Thursday and in an unusual move Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) will report the following week.""In general this quarter will be fairly noisy with tax reform, with companies coming out and providing information on how that will impact them going forward,"" said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones. ""There will be some charges (to earnings) and some noise that will be a little challenging to look through that to see what the outlook is for the rest of the year.""Last week, the Pentagon released the 2018 National Defense Strategy with a shift in focus to ""great power competition"" instead of terrorism, prioritizing high end weapons like Lockheed's F-35 fifth-generation fighter and the nuclear recapitalization program.""I think clearly the fundamentals still remain longer term very positive and .... the National Defense Strategy release last Friday points to helping build the political foundation for budget increases in highly specialized areas of investment"" like space and unmanned systems, said Ken Herbert, managing director at Canaccord Genuity.While the strategy lays out long-term spending priorities, the Defense Department still doesn't have a budget yet for 2018 and Congress continues to lurch through short-term budgets that carry over prior spending levels. Herbert expects ""timing around fiscal '18 budget will continue to be a headwind and negative overhang.""On Wednesday, General Dynamics reported adjusted EPS, excluding the impact of tax reform, up 32.3% to $2.50, beating analyst exceptions.  Revenue rose 8.1% to $8.3 billion, but fell short.Northrop reports early Thursday, and EPS is seen climbing 3.4% to $2.75 with revenue dipping 0.4% to $6.37 billion. Analysts would like to get answers about the failed deployment of Northrop's Zuma satellite, but so far the company has kept quiet about the launch earlier this month, citing the classified nature of the mission.Little is known about the Zuma satellite except that Northrop made it for a government customer and it was supposed to be launched into low Earth orbit. But sources told Bloomberg that the Falcon 9's second stage failed, with both the satellite and the second-stage booster falling into the ocean.Raytheon also reports early Thursday, and analysts see EPS up 7.4% to $2.02 with revenue climbing 9.6% to $6.83 billion. Missile defense sales are in the spotlight as international partners like Romania and Poland look to beef up defenses against Russia with new Raytheon-built Patriot systems.In general, ""international sales will be asked about a lot because that's been very strong,"" Canaccord's Herbert said, as the Trump administration has pushed for more foreign sales vs. prior administrations.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.While Lockheed is typically the first defense contractor to report, its results come out next week, on Jan. 29. EPS is seen jumping 25% to $4.06 with revenue up 7.3% to $14.75 billion.With international demand for Raytheon's missile-defense products rising, sales of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system will also be scrutinized.Windau also expects more commentary on F-35 production, as it ramps up to full tilt, as well as progress on cutting costs. Last week, the State Department gave Belgium approval to purchase 34 F-35s valued at $6.53 billion to replace its Lockheed F-16s.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

20,GD,"The Pentagon has picked Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) to advance to the next stage of a competition for new nuclear-armed cruise missiles that could be launched from bombers like Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21.XThe Long Range Standoff (LRSO) weapon will replace aging AGM-86B Air Launched Cruise Missiles made by Boeing (BA). Those missiles were initially fielded in the early 1980s.The LRSO is meant to hit targets from long ranges without putting bombers at risk of getting shot down. But critics have charged that the Pentagon doesn't need the LRSO as the B-21 is supposed to be stealthy enough to elude enemy air defenses.Lockheed and Raytheon each received $900 million contracts to develop the technologies for the LRSO and demonstrate the new weapon's reliability, the Air Force announced late Monday. The service will then pick one company to manufacture the LRSO, whose cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.The Air Force plans to start fielding the next-generation nuclear cruise missile in the late 2020s. Meanwhile, the B-21 is expected to enter service in 2025.""This weapon will modernize the air-based leg of the nuclear triad,"" said Secretary of the Air Force Heather Wilson in a statement about the LRSO. ""Deterrence works if our adversaries know that we can hold at risk things they value. This weapon will enhance our ability to do so, and we must modernize it cost-effectively.""Shares of Lockheed were flat on the stock market today, but still above buy range. Raytheon rose 0.1%, also above buying territory. Boeing ticked up 0.1%, and Northrop eased 0.6%.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly-traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? Leaderboard is having its best month of the year and the YTD distance is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500.Earlier this week, the Pentagon awarded Boeing and Northrop with similar early-stage development contract for new nuclear ballistic missiles to replace Boeing-made Minuteman IIIs.The Pentagon will then award a single, final contract for the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent in late fiscal 2020, with deployment seen in the late 2020s. That contract will be worth up to $85 billion, according to the Pentagon's Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. However, the Air Force has put the number around $62 billion.Those contracts will build on earlier deals to upgrade strategic bombers and submarines.In 2015, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. Development and procurement costs are expected run as much as $80 billion.The Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class nuclear missile submarines. The Columbia-class subs, which are being built by General Dynamics (GD), are expected to be deployed in the 2030s and carry an estimated acquisition cost of about $100 billion.RELATED:Here's How Lucrative A Nuclear Missile Deal May Be For Boeing, NorthropWhat Trump's Afghanistan Strategy Means For Defense StocksMissile Defense Stocks Boosted As Trump's Nuclear Offense Claim DebunkedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsThe Dow's Top Stock Finally Has A New Entry Point

21,GD,"The Pentagon is drafting its budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 — the first that will fully show the Trump administration's vision for military spending — and events in Afghanistan, the Korean Peninsula and the U.S. Navy may weigh on the White House's priorities for defense dollars.""The 2017 and 2018 budgets were mostly about just trying to recover some readiness, they didn't look at sustainment and new investment and capabilities,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS.President Trump is reportedly going to announce the deployment of 4,000 more troops as part of his long-awaited plan for Afghanistan when he address the nation tonight at 9 p.m. ET.Hunter said that isn't a major increase, so defense contractors in Afghanistan are unlikely to see a big spike in business. But the troop buildup also means Trump won't withdraw U.S. troops and produce a huge negative for companies.""If Trump had decided to scale back U.S. commitment and withdrawal, those engaged with Afghan security forces couldn't stay there,"" Hunter told IBD.Makers of ground vehicles, like General Dynamics (GD), could get a boost — as well as the companies that help maintain vehicles for the Afghan military.Sales of the low-cost A-29 Super Tucano aircraft, used by the fledgling Afghan Air Force for counterterrorism missions, could also get a boost, Hunter added.The plane's performance in Afghanistan could have implications for the U.S. arsenal too. The Air Force is looking at possibly buying up to 300 low-cost attack aircraft by 2022, to reduce wear and tear on more advanced fighters and cut operating expenses as missions continue in the Middle East.The Super Tucano, made jointly by privately held Sierra Nevada and Brazil's Embraer (ERJ), is participating in a U.S. Air Force experiment with light-attack aircraft, along with the Textron (TXT) Scorpion and AT-6 Wolverine and the AT-802L Longsword by L3 Technologies (LLL).U.S. and South Korea forces will conduct previously scheduled joint military exercises this week despite pressure from North Korea and China to cancel the event.The war games could prompt North Korea to ratchet up pressure again, after pulling back from its threats to launch missiles toward Guam.Hunter said missile defense spending would have to increase to meet the short-term demands of more intercepts in addition to longer-term R&D, noting that the Office of Management and Budget put out a memo last week that put missile defense at the top of its R&D priorities list.Raytheon (RTN) makes the Patriot system while Lockheed Martin (LMT) builds the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, which is currently deployed outside Seoul, and Boeing (BA) is the prime on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system used to protect the U.S.RELATED: As North Korea Threat Looms, Here's How U.S. Missile Defense Works Late Sunday, the USS John S.

23,GD,"Friday proved to be an unusual session as growth-style stocks and income-type utilities rallied nearly in lockstep amid a broad late-afternoon advance in the stock market today.XMeanwhile, members of the aerospace and defense industry group continue to have a hot start in 2018. IBD's Aerospace/Defense industry group has vaulted 6.7% year to date, vs. a less than 2% gain for the S&P 500, amid news reported by IBD that the Air Force is rushing to build a next-generation fighter jet.Lockheed Martin (LMT), which found nice support at the rising 50-day moving average during the fast slide in stocks in early February, gained 0.5% to 357.34. That extends the military jet and warfare systems giant's advance from a breakout past an eight-week flat base at 322.29 to nearly 11%.Lockheed pays a quarterly cash dividend of $2 per share, giving the stock an annualized yield of 2.3%. That's better than the 1.7% yield for the S&P 500.Meanwhile, at least 10 additional companies in the same industry group hold a Composite Rating of 90 or higher on a scale of 1 to 99, including Teledyne Tech (TDY), Heico (HEI), Curtiss-Wright (CW), Rockwell Collins (COL), Spirit Aerosystems (SPR), Huntington Ingalls (HII), General Dynamics (GD) and KLX (KLXI).You can compare all of the IBD Ratings of each of these stocks with peers in the same industry group by using Stock Checkup to speed your fundamental analysis. Focus on those with rising relative strength lines, which are painted in blue in all IBD charts. A fast-rising RS line means a stock is sharply outperforming the S&P 500.At 3 p.m. ET, the Dow utility average shot more than 2.2% higher, beating gains of 1.3% to 1.5% for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq composite. The Dow Jones industrial average gained nearly 0.6% as 12 of the 30 components rallied 1 point or more.The Dow utilities group is a big laggard so far in 2018, falling as much as 17% below its December peak of 778. Yet these dividend-rich defensive plays are getting relief from reports that members of the Federal Reserve's FOMC policy board are hinting at a continued ""go slow"" approach toward raising the cost of money.While a quarter-point hike in the short-term fed funds rate is likely in the bag during next month's meeting on interest rates, futures traders still see less than a 40% chance that, by year's end, the Fed would raise the fed funds rate by more than three times. The current target range is 1.25%-1.5%, and the majority of futures traders tracked by CME Group see the range rising to 2%-2.25%.That rate would still be much lower than the expected 12-month forward earnings yield of the S&P 500, which is around 5% to 5.5%, depending on which Wall Street investment strategist you trust.Meanwhile, investors bought back long-term bonds. The yield on the benchmark U.S. Treasury 10-year bond edged down to 2.88%. Earlier in the week, the yield hit as high as 2.95%, creeping closer to the January 2014 peak of 3.04%, a key psychological level for institutional investors.Going back to the military supplier group, Huntington Ingalls recently broke out of a three-month flat base with a 253.54 buy point. The 5% buy zone goes up to 266.22.Notice on the submarine and Navy class destroyer builder's daily chart that Huntington's relative strength line has ascended into new high ground, a bullish sign.KLX is finding buying support at the 50-day moving average for the second time since its breakout from a cup-shaped base at 54.50 on Oct. 3.The first and second pullbacks to the 50-day or 10-week line can offer a timely entry to establish a new position in a leading stock or to add a small amount of shares to a winning core position.Among the FAANG stocks, Google search engine operator Alphabet (GOOGL) looked poised to finish a second straight week up. The internet content titan is up just 0.5% to 1,115.40, but Friday's advance is the eighth in 10 sessions. The stock is also up more than 2.5% for the week.Like the Nasdaq itself, Alphabet has turned in an impressive rebound after tickling its 200-day moving average Feb. 9.See on a daily chart how the megacap tech ($775 billion in market value, which is share price times shares outstanding) bounced sharply off its intraday low on Feb. 9, then finished up big in whale-like volume. That's bullish.For now, Alphabet is in a new base, less than 7% below its all-time peak of 1,197. The recent correction of 17% from head to toe is too deep to be a potential flat base. The correction is also too narrow in time to serve as a cup or a cup with handle. So keep watching.Also keep an eye on Alphabet's proprietary ratings.The Relative Price Strength Rating is not great, but at 78 on IBD Stock Checkup it's decent for a mature large cap. The very best growth companies tend to show an RS Rating in the high 80s or more. However, Alphabet, for now, should be viewed as a potential new big cap leader.Alphabet's Composite Rating is grand at 98.Elsewhere, Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) rallied more than 6% to 17.82 following positive reports that South Korea in fact may allow certain types of transactions in digital currencies. However, as noted frequently in IBD's Stock Market Today columns, the closed end fund has a very long way to go before forming a legitimate new base and staging a potential new breakout point.Universal Display (OLED) got hammered again, falling 15% to 131 in massive volume. The expert in organic light-emitting diodes for TVs and smartphone displays reported stout earnings growth, up 69%, as revenue jumped 55% to $115.9 million.However, the former stock market leader had already triggered two key sell signals: 1) Universal slammed beneath its 50-day moving average in huge trade on Jan. 24-25; and 2) the stock triggered the golden rule of investing as it slid 8% below the most recent late-stage base buy point of 192.85.In other markets, the persistent rise in crude oil seems to confirm the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar as well as optimism over the global economy, not just OPEC's continued willingness to limit its production.WTI near-term futures rose 1.3% to $63.58 a barrel, marking a three-week high. The year-to-date high for WTI is $66.14, last seen in late January.

24,GD,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite continued to rebound, despite rising inflation pressures and Treasury yields, triggering a shift from market correction to confirmed uptrend. Cisco Systems (CSCO) reported strong earnings, along with Weibo (WB) and other China internets as well as several other top-rated tech stocks. Top-rated hotels were mixed after their reports. Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) hired Taco's chief to be its next CEO. Facebook (FB) showed signs of losing more young users to Snap (SNAP)-owned.X After plunging in the prior two weeks, the S&P 500 index, Dow Jones and Nasdaq composite surged in the latest week, shrugging off rising prices and the continued rise in Treasury yields. The market is back in an uptrend. Cisco hit a 17-year high on a bevy of good news. Shopify (SHOP), Hubspot (HUBS) and Weibo (WB) also had good results. But Arista Networks (ANET) and LogMeIn (LOGM) fell Friday on guidance.Cisco Systems (CSCO) announced a $25 billion stock buyback, topped earnings forecasts, reported its first revenue gain in eight quarters and guided March quarter views higher. Aside from the new $25 billion buyback, Cisco plans to use some of the $67 billion in repatriated cash for a dividend hike. Cisco would have around $30 billion, including domestic cash on hand, for acquisitions. Cisco shares rose to a 17-year high.Track Top Stocks And Market Trends With Free IBD NewslettersArista Networks handily beat Q4 earnings views with a 64% jump but revenue only edged estimates and its sales outlook for the March quarter and 2018 disappointed. Shares dived 19% Friday after a 200% run-up the past year. Management forecast a sequential revenue decline in the March quarter, with the mid-point of revenue guidance implying 37% growth to $459 million, just above estimates of $457 million. Analysts said Arista set the expectation for ""mid-20s"" revenue growth in 2018 which is below the Street's 27.5%. The guidance could reflect stiffer competition from Cisco.Shopify (SHOP) earned 15 cents a share in Q4, up from no profit a year earlier, vs. estimates of 5 cents. Revenue jumped 71% to $222.8 million, topping consensus estimates of $208 million. The e-commerce software firm forecast Q1 and 2018 revenue above expectations. Shares edged up Thursday after surging to a record high ahead of earnings. Shopify surged 15% through Thursday.RELATED:New America: Shopify Is Killing It By Making Businesses Win OnlineFacebook (FB) is losing younger users to Snap (SNAP)-owned Snapchat at an even faster pace than previously expected, said research firm eMarketer.

""They know how to build a next-generation 737, but how will they transition into a profitable 737 Max with 777 numbers coming down? More and more profitability is now depending on the 737 line.""On the defense side, more charges are a possibility.Last month, the Air Force said it doesn't expect Boeing to deliver the first of its new tankers until next year, over delays getting FAA airworthiness certifications and completing flight tests, despite assurances from Boeing that deliveries would start by the end of this year.Boeing has said the issues related to the KC-46 tanker are over. But Aboulafia won't rule out another surprise. ""It seems to be behind them, but who can say with that program.""Aboulafia will also be looking for more detail about the Qatar's $12 billion F-15 order as tensions heat up in the Persian Gulf, with President Trump accusing Doha of funding terrorist groups.The F-15 sales are crucial as Boeing seeks to extend production on the aircraft beyond 2019, after completing an order for Saudi Arabia.Analysts will also be eager for an update on Boeing's midmarket plane which analysts have dubbed the 797, in an effort to take back market share from Airbus and its popular A321neo.During the Paris Air Show, Mike Delaney, general manager of airplane developments at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the new plane's fuselage would have a ""hybrid"" cross-section, according to Reuters, but was light on details.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) will also report results Wednesday, and Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for Thursday.Last week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) raised its full-year guidance as increased F-35 sales helped lift Q2 earnings and revenue well above analyst estimates.RELATED: Boeing, Apple Could Build A Parallel Internet In Space

32,GD,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) and other defense contractors have key contracts in their sights in 2018 that could reshape the industry for years to come.The Air Force is looking for a new trainer plane to replace its aging fleet of Northrop T-38C Talons and will decide in July who receives about $16 billion to produce 350 aircraft.X A Lockheed Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries team is offering the T-50A, an upgraded version of the T-50 already in service in South Korea. Boeing is working with Saab to build a clean-sheet design. Italy's Leonardo is offering the T-100, but is a very long shot.The stakes are especially high for Boeing, which needs a new fighter contract as F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet production slows and demand shifts to Lockheed's next-generation F-35. If Boeing loses, it could be forced to make major job cuts at its St. Louis plant. Boeing showed off its offering recently.Lockheed is touting the proven effectiveness of the T-50A and says it can be ready on day one for the Air Force, which is looking to field the fighters as quickly as possible. On the other hand, Boeing's new design is seen as having ""more robust"" capabilities  and offers pilots extra flexibility in the cockpit.""Each team thinks they are the obvious right choice,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at CSIS. ""I think the possibly of a bid protest is high because the companies are so convinced they are right.""Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, gives the T-50A a slight advantage: ""They have no upfront costs and it's a highly cost based contract, a classic price shoot out.""The Navy is looking to field the first carrier-based drone for aerial refueling, and a contract award is expected in September. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.The competition is down to Lockheed, Boeing, and privately held General Atomics after Northrop Grumman announced it was dropping out of the race in October.Before dropping out of the contest, Northrop was seen as one of the front-runners as its X-47B prototype had been used in take off and landing demonstrations from aircraft carriers.Now, Lockheed is likely in the lead as its offering would be able to handle upgrades to strike and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, said Mark Bobbi and Derrick Maple, experts at IHS Markit. But if cost is the main concern then General Atomics is the likely winner.By the end of March, the Air Force expects to award a contract for hypersonic strike weapons that can fly five times the speed of sound and would be launched from fighters and bombers.Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN), and Orbital ATK (OA), which is being bought by Northrop, are bidding on the contract.Hypersonic weapons could be the most disruptive battlefield technology since stealth, combining speed, range and maneuverability to take unpredictable flight paths, making them nearly impossible to shoot down with today's technology.The contract will help push the Air Force to ""accelerate the development of hypersonic technologies"" a spokesman for the service said as China and Russia race to close the gap in technology.High-tempo operations in the Middle East and rising tensions in Europe have put a priority on fielding modernized ground vehicles. The Army plans to award two engineering and manufacturing development contracts by the end of 2018 for a new light tank.So far, bidders include General Dynamics (GD), BAE Systems and a team led by Science Applications (SAIC), according to Defense News.The Marine Corps is also expected to decide between BAE Systems and Science Applications for its Amphibious Combat Vehicle contract in 2018. The service plans to build 204 of the vehicles to replace its aging amphibious assault vehicle fleet.Key foreign contests will formally kick off in 2018, though awards will come later.By mid-2018, France and Germany plan to agree on a roadmap for jointly developing a next-generation fighter. But the new jet is unlikely to be available by 2025, so Germany is looking at Boeing's F-15 and Super Hornet as well as Lockheed's F-35 as possible stopgaps until then.India expects to open competition for a carrier-based fighter jet by the middle of the year. New Dehli is in dire need of new planes as its 900 fighters, mostly Russian-built aircraft, are nearing the end of their service lives.Finland is in the market for 64 jets to replace its Boeing F/A-18 Hornets and will ask for offers from Boeing and Lockheed early next year along with some European firms. But a contract award isn't expected until 2021.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN:Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Netflix (NFLX) skyrocketed on blowout subscriber growth and a bullish outlook. Celgene (CELG) will buy Juno Therapeutics (JUNO). Intel (INTC) surged on its earnings and outlook, while Texas Instruments (TXN) and some other top chips failed to impress with their quarterly financials, but Apple (AAPL) continued to lag amid a growing chorus of concerns regarding iPhone X sales and production. Airline stocks plunged as United Airlines (UAL) said it would expand rapidly, setting the stage for a renewed price war.X The S&P 500 index, Dow industrials and Nasdaq all rallied solidly to hit fresh record highs as earnings season heated up. The falling dollar, which has acted as a tailwind for U.S. multinationals' stocks and profits, rebounded from three-year lows Thursday as President Trump said he expects a stronger greenback. Netflix (NFLX) was a big earnings winner. Intel (INTC) also did while after Texas Instruments (TXN) and Lam Research (LRCX) were among several leading chip stocks to struggle on earnings. Airline stocks plunged on United Airlines (UAL) while Apple (AAPL) and iPhone-related stocks sold off as several analysts cited evidence of weaker iPhone X demand.Shares rocketed to record highs as Netflix (NFLX) added 8.33 million streaming subscribers worldwide, crushing its fourth-quarter target of 6.3 million. The Internet TV streaming giant ended 2017 with 117.58 million total streaming subscribers, with one analyst predicting 200 million Netflix subscribers in 2020. The gains came despite Netflix implementing price hikes to its service plans in the U.S. and Europe. Netflix credited hit original content such as TV series ""Stranger Things"" and ""The Crown"" and movies like ""Bright"" for its subscriber gains in the period. For the March quarter, Netflix is predicting it will add 6.35 million net new subscribers.Chipmakers Intel (INTC), Maxim Integrated Products (MXIM), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) beat their December-quarter targets, but got mixed reviews from investors.

Celgene's acquisition comes as it prepares to lose exclusivity for cancer drug Revlimid in 2022. Juno rivals Gilead Sciences (GILD) and Novartis (NVS) in making CAR-T drugs to treat blood cancers. Sanofi's deal follows two failed mergers in 2016 and 2017.Early Wednesday, Novartis (NVS) reported core earnings of $1.21 per share on $12.92 billion in sales, up a respective 6% and 2% on a constant-currency basis, and easily beating the consensus.

AbbVie (ABBV), on Friday, topped expectations with adjusted profit up 23% and sales climbing 14% to $7.74 billion in sales.United Airlines (UAL) sent airline stocks into a tailspin after the carrier told analysts that it planned to expand flight coverage through 2020. Investors fear the move, done in part to regain relevance in the smaller cities United once abandoned, risks more competition and cheaper fares, helping passengers but threatening profits. American Airlines (AAL), during its Q4 earnings call, signaled that it wouldn't change its profit and growth targets based on United's ambitions — for now. Southwest Airlines (LUV), JetBlue (JBLU) and Alaska Air (ALK) also reported.General Electric (GE) missed on earnings and disclosed an SEC probe, though core units did well and GE kept its 2018 outlook. Three industrial members of the Dow industrials, Caterpillar (CAT), 3M (MMM) and United Technologies (UTX), reported strong earnings and guidance. Insurer Travelers (TRV) and consumer products giant Procter & Gamble (PG) also beat on earnings views.

The tax on washing machines decreases and then expires after three years, while the duty on solar cells and modules phases out after four years. Solar technology providers Suniva and SolarWorld charged that China was providing unfair subsidies and financing to its solar producers. Whirlpool (WHR) complained that Korean makers were dumping washing machines in the U.S. at excessively low prices.Whirlpool, which also reported quarterly earnings, rallied 11%.

Raytheon and GD said orders and backlog were strong. All three defense firms surged to record highs. Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) report next week.Steel Dynamics (STLD) earnings rose 26%, topping views modestly, as sales climbed 22% to $2.34 billion. The No. 1-ranked company in IBD's Steel-Producers industry group said 2018 is shaping up to be a good year, thanks to more moderate inventory levels, improvement in global demand and pricing, and incremental investment driven by tax cuts. Specialty steel producer Allegheny Technologies (ATI) nearly doubled profit estimates. Revenue grew 14% to $910 million, fueled by its high-performance materials for jet engines. Freeport McMoRan (FCX) benefited from higher copper prices, boosting Q4 earnings by 104%, ahead of estimates. Revenue grew 15% to $5.0 billion. Negotiations with Indonesia about ownership of its massive Grasberg mine are progressing but haven't erased uncertainty about the company's outlook.Casino operators Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and Las Vegas Sands (LVS) both put up Q4 results that beat on the top and bottom line, helped by the rebound in Macau, the world's largest gaming market. Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson cited an acceleration in the mass gaming market in the Chinese administrative region, the only area of the nation where gambling is legal. But Wynn shares plunged Friday, erasing nearly all its weekly gains, on a report of allegations of serious sexual misconduct by CEO Steve Wynn.Ford Motor (F) saw EPS climb 30% to 39 cents as revenue grew 15% to $41.3 billion.

Student enrollments grew 43%. The China-based after-school education provider offered guided Q3 sales views higher, but shares tumbled, though they recouped some losses by the end of the week. TAL Education (TAL), meanwhile, surged nearly 18% on Thursday, retaking their 50-day, after Q3 EPS jumped 168% on 66% revenue growth to $433 million. TAL enrollments swelled 85%.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and E-Trade Financial (ETFC) beat on both their top and bottom lines.

""Even Emirates is under more pressure than it's accustomed to. But Dubai is at least a sizable local market; Abu Dhabi is much smaller.""One potential order to watch is a 20-plane deal for the A380 from Emirates, which Bloomberg reported is in talks with Airbus. But Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace consultant at Teal Group, said delivery time lines are key, as Emirates last year pushed back the delivery of 12 jets.""No one else wants this plane,"" he said.Low-cost Gulf carriers, however, are faring better than their larger peers, and Kaplan said Flydubai could order some narrowbody jets, noting that single-aisle demand has been stronger vs. twin-aisle overall.Meanwhile, Bombardier is bringing a C Series 300 for display, just weeks after Airbus took a majority stake in the struggling narrowbody business. Any new C Series orders would put pressure on Boeing as it considers building a middle-of-the-market plane.Boeing sees a ""pretty significant"" market opportunity and is ""really getting deep"" into further discussions with more than 50 customers, CFO Greg Smith told analysts at Baird's Global Industrial Conference Wednesday.Business jet orders could be big at the show as lower oil prices have helped boost private air travel,  said Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer for Tigress Financial. That could help General Dynamics' Gulfstream corporate-jet business.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.On the defense side, Lockheed, Boeing, Raytheon (RTN) and others will show off their wares, with the Pentagon putting Lockheed's F-22 and F-16 on display.Missile defense orders from the region are rising as tensions heat up with Iran. Last month, Lockheed said Saudi Arabia ""seems intent on moving quickly"" with its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense order.Regional conflicts have kept defense spending up, despite low oil prices, Aboulafia said, particularly for precision weapons, which are seeing heavy use.Aboulafia also wonders if the United Arab Emirates will order Eurofighter's Typhoon, Dassault's Rafale or Boeing's Super Hornet as a stopgap before it can get U.S. authorization to buy the more advanced F-35 from Lockheed in the next five years. Aircraft with intelligence and surveillance capabilities will also be in demand, he added.But all defense orders are government to government and need approval from the State Department and Congress.Shares of Boeing fell 1.1% in the stock market today.

41,GD,"It will cost more than a trillion dollars to improve America's nuclear forces, according to a new estimate, but analysts argue that the Pentagon can get by with less.XThe Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday put the price tag at $1.2 trillion dollars through 2046, just 6% of total defense spending over 30 years but 20% higher than its estimate three years ago. The bill includes about $800 billion to make incremental upgrades to existing weapons near the end of their usable life spans, and about $400 billion for modernization efforts like the new Northrop Grumman (NOC) B-21 bomber.The total figure is actually $1.7 trillion with inflation included, noted Tom Collina, director of policy at the Ploughshares Fund, which is focused on reducing nuclear weapons.In addition to the B-21, the Pentagon has already award initial contracts to other defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) for everything from nuclear-armed missiles to nuclear-armed submarines.The massive cost estimate for the nuclear force comes as the Defense Department faces other big-ticket priorities such as Lockheed's F-35 and pushing the Navy's fleet back above 300 ships.But the bill doesn't have to be that high for taxpayers and the CBO offered suggestions on how to lower costs. Here are some:America's nuclear force has for decades been based on the triad of land-, air- and sea-based weapons. But getting rid of the land-based ICBM leg, would save $120 billion though 2046. Of that, roughly $90 billion would come from canceling a replacement program. In August, the Air Force awarded Boeing and Northrop preliminary design phase contracts for it.Former Defense Secretary William Perry and retired Gen. James Cartwright, former vice chair of the Joint Chiefs, wrote a letter to President Trump on behalf of the Ploughshares Fund, arguing that ICBMs create instability and increase the possibility of accidental nuclear war.""Our ICBMs are in danger of being launched in the case of another false alarm (we have experienced three to date), thereby starting a civilization-ending nuclear war by accident.""But during his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Defense Secretary James Mattis backed the development of new ICBMs.Perry and Cartwright support the building of ""an appropriate number of new, nuclear-armed submarines as the most survivable leg of the deterrent"" and new bombers that also have conventional applications.Going without the new  Long Range Standoff weapon would save $28 billion through 2046. Last month, the Air Force also awarded Lockheed and Raytheon preliminary design phase contracts for the LRSO.While CBO warned the lack of cruise missiles ""would diminish the capability of U.S. nuclear forces, particularly for limited nuclear strikes,"" Collina said the LRSO creates more instability as Russia can't tell if the air-launched missiles are nuclear or conventional and could spark a nuclear response to a conventional weapon.""Have conventional weapons  do the job instead,"" he suggested. ""We have conventional cruise missiles that can take out air defenses. We don't have to use nuclear missiles.""IBD'S TAKE: Ready to invest but don't know where to start? An easy to follow routine from IBD can help you grow and protect your money over the long term.The Defense Department is currently reassessing its nuclear strategy as part of its Nuclear Posture Review, which will be sent to the White House by the end of the year.Collina noted that the U.S. can still maintain plenty of bang for fewer bucks.""The core of our power are conventional forces that can be deployed and project power around the world,"" he said. ""We can still be a nuclear power and have way fewer nuclear weapons than we have today.""Boeing shares rose 0.2% to 258.50 on the stock market today, still in buy range.

Under a fixed-cost contract with the Pentagon, Boeing is on the hook for any cost overruns, which now total $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes.The latest charges are due to changes to initial production aircraft as late testing continues, and not to ""new significant technical discoveries,"" said CEO Dennis Muilenberg on a conference call.He added that the tanker, which is based on a Boeing 767 airframe, has been performing well in flight tests, and described issues with the tanker's refueling boom as normal.The challenges that have been arising recently are related to getting the aircraft up to certification standards. And as the company puts the finishing touches on the tanker, it is concurrently producing them.""We still have some items to work though on how we do concurrency and how we do it efficiently,"" Muilenberg said.Early this year, Boeing CFO Greg Smith said the tanker had largely gotten past its development issues, leaving ""just factory work,"" though flight testing remained.Despite the KC-46's additional costs, management boosted Boeing's overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion, led by improved performance.The company also raised its full-year core EPS outlook to $9.90-$10.10 from a prior view of $9.80-$10.00, driven by a lower tax rate, though the midpoint is still below the consensus estimate of $10.06 and implied Q4 EPS is $2.62-$2.82, below views for $2.96.In Q3, core earnings per share dropped 22.5% to $2.72, but topped forecasts for $2.65, while revenue edged up 1.7% to $24.31 billion, above estimates for $24.06 billion, as Boeing said earlier commercial aircraft deliveries rose 7.4% to 202 during the quarter.Commercial aircraft revenue fell 1% to $14.98 billion. Defense, space and security revenue dropped 5% to $5.47 billion. Global services revenue grew 2% to $3.57 billion. Backlog slipped to $474 billion at the end of Q3 from $482 billion at the start of Q3.Shares sank 2.85% to 258.42 on the stock market today, putting Boeing back in the top of its buy range after breaking out from a 246.59 entry last month. European rival Airbus (EADSY) edged up 1.2%.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Boeing's defense unit also faces the risk of losing a chance to sell F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets to Canada amid a trade dispute over Bombardier's C Series jet. But Muilenberg dismissed the political tension, saying the relationship with the U.K, and Canada will outlast this trade issue.The Commerce Department's 300% tariff on the C Series, which Boeing complained was receiving illegal state aid, was also seen as a factor in Airbus taking a majority stake in the C Series program, potentially expanding Airbus' offerings in the narrowbody market and putting pressure on Boeing to launch a mid-market plane.On Wednesday, Boeing said the Airbus-Bombardier deal hasn't affected its strategy and reiterated that it is still reviewing a decision on a new plane.RELATED: Northrop Raises Outlook After Surprise Q3 Earnings Gain; General Dynamics MixedDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsHypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is Coming

43,GD,"Poland is a step closer to getting its Raytheon (RTN) Patriot missile system and President Trump affirmed commitment to NATO Thursday.""A memorandum was signed tonight that the U.S. government has agreed to sell Poland Patriot missiles in the most modern configuration,"" Poland's Defense Minister Antoni Macierewicz said Thursday, according to Reuters.Since March, Poland said it expected to sign a deal worth up to $7.6 billion to buy eight Patriot missile defense systems by the end of 2017 as it looks to counter Russian aggression in the region.Raytheon shares dipped 0.8% to 163.52 on the stock market today, still in range above its 157.69 buy point. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT), which makes the PAC-3 missiles for the system, retreated 0.5% to 281.05, but still in buy range after clearing out of a cup base with a 270 buy point.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) are also in buy range. Both Northrop and General Dynamics fell 0.5% and 0.85%, respectively.Raytheon's Patriot air-defense system has been in demand globally. Raytheon received a big order from Saudi Arabia in 2015 and South Korea and Japan plan to upgrade their Patriot systems.Poland's deal comes as Trump visited Warsaw ahead of the G-20 summit in Germany starting Friday. On Thursday Trump finally endorsed Article 5 of the NATO treaty, ensuring that the U.S. would come to the aid of any alliance member who comes under attack. He didn't do so in an earlier European trip, sparking worries about the White House's commitment.Trump also pushed for NATO countries to spend more on defense and praised Poland for spending the targeted 2% of its GDP on its military.RELATED: These 4 Defense Stocks Are In Buy Range After North Korea ICBM Test This Is The Big Winner In The U.S. Missile, Torpedo Sale To Taiwan

44,GD,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) said Wednesday that it would not submit a bid for the Navy's unmanned tanker competition, despite being seen as a major player in the contest.XWe ""made a decision not to bid MQ-25 based on the particular nature of that"" request for proposal, CEO Wes Bush said during the company's Q3 earnings call.The Navy released an official request for proposal for the MQ-25A earlier this month and now the competition is down to Lockheed Martin (LMT), Boeing (BA), and General Atomics. A final contact is expected next year. The Pentagon has earmarked $2.16 billion for the program through fiscal 2021, though the contract's total value would be larger.Northrop, whose Global Hawk helped earn the company prominence in drone technology, was expected to be a formidable bidder for the Navy drone, as its X-47B prototype had been used in Navy technology demonstrations, which even included takeoff and landing operations from an aircraft carrier.But the Navy has scaled back its drone program from its original inception as a strike and surveillance aircraft, with its mission now targeted for aerial refueling.Bush said the decision not to bid wasn't just about winning the contract but looking at the ability to meet all of the requirements. But ""broadly things are going really well"" for the company's unmanned systems, he said, adding that the MQ-4C Triton unmanned intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance drone is moving along.Northrop shares jumped 3.7% to close at a record high of 304.75 on the stock market today.Northrop's Q3 earnings rose 10% to $3.68 while sales rose 6% to $6.53 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.92 with revenue of $6.32 billion.Aerospace Systems unit sales rose 11% to $3.1 billion on higher F/A-18 Super Hornet and other manned aircraft sales, including a restricted manned aircraft, which is likely company's secretive B-21 bomber. Mission system sales rose 5% on higher sensor sales for the F-35.Northrop makes the F/A-18's aft/center fuselage section and vertical tails and is also a major subcontractor on Lockheed's F-35.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $12.90-$13.10 from a prior guidance of $12.10-$12.40. It now sees 2017 sales of $25.5 billion from a prior outlook of $25 billion. The new forecasts are bullish vs. consensus views for EPS of $12.91 on revenue of $12.59 billion.Management also said its acquisition of Orbital ATK (OA) for $9.2 billion will add to Northrop's earnings no later than first full year after the acquisition closes sometime in the first half of 2018.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? IBD's Leaderboard is showing a 60% increase over the S&P 500 so far this year.General Dynamics (GD) and Boeing also announced Q3 results Wednesday.General Dynamics saw a 7% increase in EPS to $2.52 but revenue dipped 1% to $7.58 billion. Analysts expected EPS of $2.43 on revenue of $7.43. Backlog was $63.9 billion, up 9.2%.Boeing's results beat Wall Street estimates but the company recorded another charge on its KC-46 tanker program for the Air Force.General Dynamics shares fell 2.3%, and Boeing lost 2.85%.Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled for Thursday.Lockheed Martin reported Q3 results that fell short of analyst expectations Tuesday but raised its full year EPS outlook.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingBoeing Beats Q3 Views But Raised Earnings Outlook Implies Weak Q4Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

47,GD,"Investors in Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and countless other companies are due for a wake-up call in coming months, and this is one instance where hitting the snooze button isn't a good idea.A set of new accounting rules that govern revenue recognition — said to be the biggest change in standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — will take effect next year, affecting either fiscal 2018 or 2019 for all U.S. companies.The accounting changes are under the radar of many investors, who may scramble to make sense of what's happening with the stocks, many of them blue chips like Microsoft, into which they've poured their money.Under the designation of FASB 606 — FASB is an acronym for the Financial Accounting Standards Board — the new rules will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. It's geared to help investors, but there could be near-term pain. Many companies will likely speed up revenue recognition and possibly make earnings more volatile from quarter to quarter.""We expect that (the new rules) will cause significant investor confusion over the next 12 months to the financial analysis of companies ranging from small companies up to the largest, including Microsoft,"" said a recent report from Citigroup.But the rules aim to address a big problem.While top-line growth is a critical metric for investors, revenue recognition has been a weak link in accounting standards. With the new rules, Wall Street analysts and investors should get a better feel for how a company is doing and whether business is deteriorating or booming.One goal is providing more transparency in sales backlogs, or revenue not yet recognized from contracts already signed. Some companies state backlogs, some don't. Now they'll have to put a number on it in many industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.In regulatory filings, companies also will be required to disclose more information on contracts. That should give investors and analysts more data on what risks or uncertainties companies face. Companies talk about things like pension costs in filings but don't provide the same transparency on revenue issues.Industries with the most ""deferred revenue"" — sales booked over time — will be most affected by FASB 606, says a Morgan Stanley report. Those include software, communications equipment, airlines, aerospace and defense.In industries that will be impacted most by the new rules, some analysts are talking about using more steady free cash flow as an alternative metric to earnings per share. The reason is free cash flow will be less impacted by the 606 rules.""I would expect to see more disclosures, certainly by the third quarter, on whether the standard is going to affect revenue recognition,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.Microsoft is expected to be one of the prominent early adopters of the new standard. It reports its 2017 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, and a few weeks later the company plans to restate earnings for the prior two years.Also on the list with Microsoft are a number of other Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).A wide swath of other firms in many industries are expected to be impacted. They include Amazon.com (AMZN), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), Electronic Arts (EA) and General Dynamics (GD). Others are First Solar (FLSR), Monsanto (MON) and T-Mobile US (TMUS)Companies that recognize more revenue upfront could have more earnings volatility. Surprises to the upside may be followed by sudden, equally surprising shortfalls. Companies prefer that a total contract value be recognized over time, which provides more flexibility in smoothing out earnings to meet consensus estimates.""New principle-based revenue rules will likely accelerate revenue recognition, while also introducing more volatility,"" said Snehaja Mogre, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""As the new standard will not impact actual cash flows, we expect investors to increase their reliance on cash flow metrics.""Many companies are still studying the new FASB 606 rules, but crunch time is coming. Expectations run high that many companies will finally declare whether the 606 standard is ""material"" or not to financial results on June- or September-quarter earnings calls.In Microsoft's case, the new standard is expected to impact Windows 10 revenue in particular. Microsoft is expected to book Windows 10 revenue when it bills hardware makers rather than over the life of a PC or device using the software. Microsoft in May briefed financial analysts, telling them that in fiscal 2016 revenue would have been about 7% higher —$6 billion or so — had it used the new revenue standard back then.While Microsoft will forecast earnings in July for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, it plans to update guidance in August using the new revenue recognition standard. When briefing analysts in May, Microsoft made the point that the FASB 606 rules will not impact free cash flow.""Net-net, investors could start paying more attention to cash flows given increasing revenue variability,"" Brent Bracelin, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a recent note to clients.While some companies will opt to restate earnings for prior years, most are expected to take a ""modified"" compliance route, applying the new rules on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward, adjusting results for new contracts, says Betsy Meter, an audit partner at KPMG.""It's industry-driven mainly,"" she said. Companies that delay, though, will be less likely to take Microsoft's approach and restate prior-year earnings, which gives investors more information.""For industries where there is a significant impact, a full retrospective approach will give them some history and visibility,"" Meter added.Some of the biggest names in tech, though, see little impact. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among tech companies that expect little impact from the new standard. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has not been heard from.In general, the rules are expected to affect companies with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue and contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks. And they will also affect companies that use third-party sales distribution channels.Revenue from Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers will be booked earlier, rather than when consumers actually buy the devices, says a Connor Group report. The new rules also will impact Amazon gift cards, says the report.Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over the term of contracts. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of an installment payment plan.Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) are among software companies still studying the impact of 606 rules. Workday (WDAY) has decided to  remove guidance for billings, a sales growth metric,  as it adopts the new accounting rules. It's unclear how many other companies may follow suit on billings.Companies with cloud-based, software-as-a-servicer (SaaS) business models that involve renewable subscriptions are expected to be less impacted than those that sell software installed on a customer's own in-house computers.Only about 7% of SaaS provider ServiceNow's (NOW) revenue comes from on-premise licenses, analysts say. Splunk (SPLK) and Ansys (ANSS), on the other hand, garner a large chunk of revenue from on-premise deals, says a William Blair report.While Microsoft will likely book Windows 10 revenue sooner, its online Office 365 sales will be less affected. Cloud-based software is rented via the internet.""SaaS models should see the least impact from the new standard, given that software is hosted and delivered over broadband connections vs. software installed on-premise,"" said Bracelin.Cisco Systems (CSCO), a big computer networking gear maker, could see its deferred revenue impacted, he says.Many software companies may be in the process of renegotiating contracts to ease the impact of rule 606, says KPMG's Meter.Some software makers, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have already transitioned business models to subscription licenses for cloud software. Under the 606 rules, only software that is continuously updated is eligible for revenue recognition over time, or ""ratably.""A lot of U.S. companies had hoped for further delays in carrying out the 606 rules, which have been in the works for more than a decade.""Companies know the time is upon them to get going,"" said Stallings at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""There's acceptance that this is going live on Jan. 1, 2018, for calendar-year companies.""RELATED:Workday Ends Billings Guidance In Accounting Shift, Stock Falls

48,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), and Raytheon (RTN) are among top defense companies reporting earnings this week as increasing global tensions have helped lift their stocks.XAnalysts expect the F-35 maker's earnings to fall 10% to $3.25 per share but revenue is seen rising 11% to $12.83 billion.F-35 deliveries are skewed to the back-half of the year, giving Lockheed a likely boost in Q3. The company is expected to deliver 66 of the fighters this year, up from 46 in 2016.Missile defense sales should also be a hot topic on the company's conference call for the maker of the THAAD antimissile system.""The pace of inquiries, the depth of the inquiries and intensity are increasing month by month,"" Timothy Cahill, the VP of Integrated Air & Missile Defense told reporters at the annual Association of the United States Army conference earlier this month.Cahill said Lockheed is getting interest from countries, especially in Europe, that didn't have a high priority on missile defense in the past.The U.S. is also focused on increasing missile defense at home. The Defense Department has asked Congress to shift $416 million into missile defense programs like Lockheed's Aegis systems.Lockheed closed Friday at 320, still in buy range from a 308.58 buy point cleared in late September.Northrop Grumman is out Wednesday. Analysts see EPS dipping 3% to $2.92 with revenue up 2.6% to $6.3 billion.The company will likely give updates on its $9.2 billion buyout of Orbital ATK (OA) announced during the quarter.The deal gives helps Northrop expand its missile defense capabilities and catch up to rivals in the market, because Orbital builds the interceptor boosters for Boeing's (BA) Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system used by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. It also builds target vehicles for tests.It could also help Northrop beat out Boeing to win the Air Force's Ground Based Strategic Deterrent contract to replace the aging Boeing Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system.But Northorp will likely stay quiet about its secretive B-21 bomber. At an Air Force Association breakfast last week, Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said the program is on track and ""marching to acquisitions timelines.""Boeing, General Dynamics (GD) and FLIR (FLIR) are also out Wednesday.Northrop and Boeing shares are just out of buying range, while FLIR is somewhat extended. But General Dynamics, at 213.86, is in a buy zone from a 206 entry.On Thursday, analysts see Raytheon reporting a 6% increase in EPS to $1.90 and a 5% boost in revenue to $6.33 billion.The company has been a big beneficiary of the growing demand for missile defense systems. Raytheon also builds the Patriot, which was purchased by Romania over the summer. A big Patriot contract with Poland has also been signed, while countries in the Middle East and Asia are lining up to buy or upgrade systems.Raytheon is well extended from a May breakout.RELATED: Hypersonic Weapons: The Biggest Warfighting Disrupter Since Stealth Is ComingTech, Industrial, Medical, Consumer Giants Top Investing Action PlanDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

51,GD,"Stock futures rose solidly Monday morning, suggesting a positive start to the week after a volatile, split market over the last several sessions. Techs were leading the way, but the Dow Jones industrial average may open at a record high.A U.S. Boeing (BA) F/A-18E Super Hornet on Sunday shot down a Syrian government bomber, a day ahead of the Paris Air Show. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) starts the week under heavy pressure even as Facebook, Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL) find key support. Markets are still digesting Amazon's $13.7 billion deal to buy Whole Foods Market (WFM), which may yet get a rival bid.Boeing and Apple are both members of the Dow Jones industrial average. Boeing is now the top-performing Dow stock in 2017, up 26%. Apple has fallen to third, up 23%, with McDonald's (MCD) now second.Futures for the Dow Jones industrial average and S&P 500 rose 0.35% above fair value. Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.65%.Stocks also were gaining overseas. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 0.6% and China's Shanghai composite 0.7%. In Europe, the major averages rose as Brexit talks were set to begin and after new French President Macron's centrist party decisively won parliamentary elections. The U.K.'s FTSE climbed 0.55%, Germany's Dax 0.85% and France's CAC-40 0.9%.X The Pentagon said Sunday that a U.S.-flown Boeing F/A-18E brought down a Syrian regime SU-22 bomber jet that was attacking anti-regime, American-allied fighters. It's the first time the U.S. has shot down a Syrian jet during its civil war.That comes a day ahead of the start of the Paris Air Show, where Boeing, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other makers of civilian and military aircraft will show off their wares and announce big orders. Lockheed Martin's F-35 stealth fighter is expected to display high-G maneuvers and fancy flying to wow that crowd.IBD'S TAKE: For more chart analysis of Facebook, Amazon and Google parent Alphabet, check out IBD's latest Stocks To Watch column.It's an important time for defense spending. European leaders are stepping up defense spending amid pressure from President Trump to live up to NATO commitments. Meanwhile, Trump has hinted at giving a new contract for more F/A-18 fighters, which are cheaper than the cutting-edge F-35.Boeing's Paris Air Show is likely to focus on orders for its new 737 Max 10 stretch passenger jet as well as any buzz about a new, midrange airliner to compete with Airbus (EADSY) and its A321neo jet.Boeing announced a SpiceJet order early Monday for 40 new 737 Max 10 planes, including 20 new orders and 20 converted from 737 Max 8 orders.Boeing shares are at record levels, now slightly extended from an 185.81 flat base entry after spending several weeks in buying zone. Boeing shares edged higher in premarket trading on the stock market today.Lockheed Martin is in buy range from 270 entry initially cleared on March 17 but only decisively cleared a month ago. Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) are all in buy zones as well.Apple has now flashed several sell signals over the past several sessions. Apple shares fell 4.5% last week in the heaviest weekly volume in two months and the heaviest weekly volume in a down week in 13 months. Apple is now 9% below its mid-March record high and is starting to lose sight of its 50-day moving average.Apple was up about 1% in premarket trade.Meanwhile, Alphabet, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet have all found support at the 50-day moving average. Amazon, an IBD Leaderboard stock briefly undercut that level on June 9, but has held above that level since then and never closed below that level. Facebook dropped below the 50-day several times over the prior six sessions, but always closed higher. Alphabet tested but never dropped below that key support line.The rebounds, which generally came on higher volume, offer a chance for follow-on buys or an initial positive. Keep in mind that the uptrend is under pressure, so investors should be cautious about many any purchase.As for Netflix (NFLX), the fourth member of the ""FANG"" internet group, that stock is hovering below its 50-day line, though it's showing a little better action than Apple.Whole Foods shot up 29% to 42.68 on Friday, above Amazon's 42-a-share offer. Some investors and analysts see a higher bid as possible, with pure-play grocers Kroger (KR) and private-equity backed Albertsons cited as possible suitors. But Wal-Mart (WMT) and Target (TGT) also suggested. Wal-Mart is the No. 1 grocer seller in the U.S., with Target also a big player.No doubt many grocery sellers' top executives and boards were mulling their next moves over the weekend.Shares of Kroger and other grocery sellers were big losers last week, amid concerns about the impact of an Amazon-Whole Foods deal and Kroger's big profit warning.RELATED:Why Lockheed's F-35 Could Stun Crowds At The Paris Air ShowParis Air Show Preview: This Will Be 'The Big Thing'Paris Air Show 2017: Latest Defense And Aerospace News And DealsThat's No Moon: Boeing, Apple Could Build This Disrupter In Space

As a result, going into Wednesday the fund's 19.38% year-to-date gain topped 90% of its large-cap growth peers tracked by Morningstar Inc., all of which averaged 14.77%, and the S&P 500's 10.03% gain.The $751 million fund got more good news on Friday. Its No. 8 holding Amazon (AMZN) was up nearly 3% in the afternoon while the broad market measured by the S&P 500 was down roughly 1%. The Amazon boost reflected the market's thumbs-up vote in favor of the internet giant's takeover of Whole Foods Market (WFM), which was announced in the morning. That put Amazon up 32% for the year. Investors appeared to believe that Amazon will be able to sweeten up Whole Foods' revenues and earnings.Thomson Reuters ranked the deal as Amazon's biggest of all time and the 11th biggest global retail deal ever.Already, the fund was outperforming 81% and 99% of its direct rivals over the past one and three years respectively. Lead manager Douglas Rao has been at the helm since June 1, 2013. Nick Schommer has been a manager since Jan. 12, 2016.The fund is growth oriented. And it is concentrated. True to its name, the fund limits its portfolio to its 40 best ideas. And, yes, that concentration can make the fund more volatile than its benchmark, the Russell 1000 Growth Index.For example, in the fourth quarter the fund lost 1.47% vs. a 0.27% loss for the Russell bogey and a 3.82% gain by the S&P 500. The fund was hurt in part by the market's rotation away from the secular growth stocks it likes, toward companies with potential for improving cyclical prospects, the managers explain in their recent semiannual report. Cyclicals in energy, materials and industrials, for instance, benefited from the Trump Bump — a surge in bets on companies that could gain from increased spending on U.S. infrastructure.The fund's top performers have trended higher through the market's indecisive seesaw between cyclical and secular growth stocks in recent months.Look again at the fund's top performers. As IBD's Gillian Rich reported Tuesday, Tesla was upgraded to a buy at Berenberg and had its price target raised to 464 from 193. Despite efforts by BMW, Kia and General Motors (GM), analyst Alexander Haissl said no other automakers are currently building electric vehicles for the mass market that can compete with Tesla's offerings. The Model 3 is expected to go into production this year. Haissl also said the company's free-cash-flow potential is superior.Tesla is in IBD's Automobile Manufacturers industry group, which ranks No. 2 among 197 groups. Tesla closed at record highs in six of the eight trading sessions through Wednesday. Trading around 380, the stock is extended, outside its buy range for investors looking for optimal entry points.Also, some yellow caution flags are flapping around the stock's earnings. After posting a third-quarter profit, the company resumed losses the next two quarters, and the narrowing of the losses from year-earlier periods has slowed. And recent earnings-estimate revisions have been downward.Activision is also extended, trading in the high 50s. The stock is a member of the IBD 50 list of stocks with strong relative price strength and fundamentals.Last month, Activision's first-quarter sales and earnings topped estimates. The company's Q2 revenue forecast topped expectations, but its EPS outlook was below analysts' views.CSX runs rail systems in 23 states, the District of Columbia and two Canadian provinces. Its services include intermodal and rail-to-truck transload processes. Unlike those of Tesla and Activision, shares of CSX have slipped back into a buy range above their 50.41 entry.EPS grew 21% and 38% the past two quarters after four quarters of declines. Energy shipments and a stronger economy have boosted the rail firm's revenue.IBD'S TAKE: CSX ranks No. 1 in IBD's Transportation-Rail industry group. It has a 25.8% annual pretax margin. See how its additional, easy-to-understand fundamental and technical data stack up against rivals' data at IBD's Stock Checkup.Among other holdings, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) is another member of the IBD 50. Trading around 468, it has slipped back within a buy range from a 453.06 entry on a long cup base.EPS grew between 22% and 36% in each of the past four quarters. The drugmaker's Eylea macular degeneration treatment has been driving its growth. But that's not the only piston in Regeneron's engine. Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges recently wrote to clients that Dupixent, an eczema treatment marketed by Regeneron and Sanofi (SNY), could easily outperform Wall Street models for the second quarter and for 2017 overall, IBD's Allison Gatlin has reported.Aerospace and defense stock General Dynamics (GD) is trading around 200, so it is still within buy range of a 194.10 buy point. EPS grew 7%, 9%, 9% and 19% the past four quarters.The company is positioned to benefit from President Trump's budget proposal, which would boost defense spending by 9.5% in fiscal 2018. And the company was one of several defense contractors — the others were Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Boeing (BA) — that signed memorandums of understanding with Saudi Arabia as part of last month's U.S.-Saudi Arabia arms deal.A merger between Janus Capital Group and U.K.-based Henderson Group closed May 30, creating Janus Henderson Group (JHG). Shareholders in what had been Janus funds should watch to see if the combined entity creates economies of scale that it can pass along in the form of lower mutual fund fees.Shareholders should also keep their eyes peeled for any manager departures from their funds. In some cases at other companies, veteran managers with ownership stakes cash out or leave. Some don't want to deal with culture clashes or fallout from corporate integration. Others are pushed out due to performance or cost cutting.The Janus-Henderson merger makes sense from a distribution viewpoint, since each asset manager has larger footprints in different geographic areas, according to Morningstar Inc.Both firms pared their fund lineups in the run-up to the merger. Janus merged two of its funds into other funds it ran (including Janus Twenty into Janus Henderson Forty) and one into a Henderson portfolio. It also closed one fund. Henderson made comparable moves. In addition, Janus Henderson is in the process of merging what had been two other Janus funds.RELATED:Janus Forty Managers Win With Bets On Proven Champs, Up-And-Comers And Calculated RisksHow To Turn A Glass Of Wine Into A $173,000 Bump In Your IRA

"
55,GD,"President Trump's budget proposal would significantly hike research funds to develop a sixth-generation fighter that follows Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. But overall, there were few major changes in weapons procurement compared to the Obama administration's plans.The budget proposal, which also includes big tax cuts and substantial long-term curbs on Medicaid and food stamps, is seen as dead on arrival in Congress, but it still represents an opening offer from the Oval Office.The Pentagon's budget would grow to $574.5 billion in fiscal 2018, which starts in October, up 9.5% from what Congress appropriated this fiscal year. On top of that is $65 billion for the war-fighting fund, or the Overseas Contingency Operations account.Some of the increase in the Defense Department's baseline budget comes from Trump's plan to grow Army personnel by 26,000 active-duty troops. But the $115 billion for weapons procurement would largely be unchanged vs. what the Obama administration had planned for fiscal 2018.Quantities of big-ticket items like the F-35, Boeing (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet and Boeing KC-46 tanker are the same, as well as the number of destroyers, submarines and other Navy ships.But the budget request is asking for $295 million for the Next-Generation Air Dominance Program, which would replace Boeing Super Hornets in the Navy and develop a follow-on to the F-35 in the Air Force. That's a massive increase from the prior projection of $13 million.Some $187 million also would be added to research for Lockheed's F-22, amounting to total funds of $610 million.The fiscal 2018 proposal also calls for $434 million in R&D funds for Air Force One, the aircraft that carries the president, but that amounts to a roughly $192 million reduction from the $626 million estimate for fiscal 2018.In the weeks after his election, Trump called the new Boeing Air Force One too expensive, and he has vowed to bring competition to the fighter-jet business and cut costs for the F-35, which he has said was ""way, way behind schedule and many billions of dollars above budget.""Research and development for Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber would get a boost to $2 billion from $1.3 billion last year.Tens of thousand of missiles, bombs and related gear from Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing are also in the budget plan, as the Pentagon seeks to replenish munitions stockpiles that have come down during the bombing campaign on ISIS targets.Lockheed Martin closed up 0.5% at 278.36 on the stock market today, holding above a 270 buy point. Boeing dipped 0.1% to 183.49, just below a 185.81 entry. Northrop rose 0.5% to 250.65, back above a 249.53 buy point. Raytheon edged up 0.2%, and General Dynamics (GD) climbed 0.8% to 199.32, with still in buy range.RELATED:5 Big Ways That Trump's Budget Doesn't Add UpHere's The Catch With The U.S.-Saudi Defense, Oil DealsSyria Attacks Light Up Dow Stock, Defense Names

56,GD,"Saudi Arabia has reportedly reached a deal to buy four Lockheed Martin (LMT) Littoral Combat Ships for $6 billion, as part of a $100 billion arms package that is expected to be finalized during President Trump's visit to the Middle East ally.The deal is expected to be announced Saturday, according to Bloomberg, when President Trump arrives in Riyadh. The ships had already been approved by the State Department in 2015 but the deal wasn't completed under President Obama.X A flurry of deals across the defense and energy sectors are expected during Trump's first presidential visit abroad.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of a massive $100 billion defense package as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner reportedly helped push the THAAD deal though by calling Lockheed's CEO Marillyn Hewson and asking her to lower the price for the Saudis, according to the New York Times.And a formal agreement for more Pac-3 Patriot missiles from Lockheed is expected as it has already been approved by Congress.Raytheon (RTN) is another big defense winner as Trump is expected to lift the Obama administration's hold on a $1 billion sale of  Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs.An order for 115 M1A2 General Dynamics (GD) tanks is expected to be finalized during the visit as well.Lockheed shares rose 2% to 272.76 on the stock market today, retaking a 270 buy point. Raytheon climbed 1.5%, still in buying territory. General Dynamics advanced 1.7%, also retaking its own 194.10 entry. Northrop Grumman (NOC) rallied 1.2% to 249.84, closing above a 249.53 entry for the first time, though volume is low.On the energy side, General Electric (GE), Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BHI) and Halliburton (HAL) are expected to announce deals with Saudi Aramco, Saudi Arabia's state run oil company, according to an earlier Bloomberg report.Senior executives from Boeing (BA), Exxon Mobil (XOM), Morgan Stanley (MS) and 42 other companies are expected in Riyadh.

57,GD,"More than $100 billion in arms deals to Saudi Arabia, including a Lockheed Martin (LMT) air-defense system, could be announced later this week as President Trump visits the kingdom in his first foreign trip since taking office.Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system, which costs roughly $1 billion, is expected to be part of the package, as well as software for command and control capabilities and satellite communications systems, also from Lockheed.Littoral Combat Ships are also expected to be in the mix. Lockheed makes one version, and a partnership between Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) makes another.A $11.5 billion deal for four ships was approved by the State Department in 2015, but isn't yet in the final contract stage, according to Reuters sources.Many of the weapons had been part of an arms deal negotiated during the Obama administration but had yet to get the green light.For example, Obama had stopped the $1 billion sale last year of Raytheon (RTN) Penetrator Warheads and Paveway laser-guided bombs due to concerns that the weapons would be used in Yemen.But Trump has been more supportive of arms sales to allies in the Middle East as the threat from Iran grows. On Thursday, the State Department approved the sale of Lockheed's Patriot PAC-3 missiles and Raytheon's GEM-T missiles to the United Arab Emirates. And in March, the State Department submitted a notice to Congress allowing sales of Lockheed F-16s to Bahrain.Lockheed shares edged up 0.4% to 272.36 on the stock market today. Lockheed is in buy range, above its 270 entry point. Raytheon shares were up 1% to 160.09, still above their entry point of 157.69. General Dynamics dipped 0.2% to 195.15, but remaining in buy range.Arms sales to Mideast allies have to be measured against Israel's capabilities, so that it retains weapons superiority in the region.In September, the Obama White House approved sales of Boeing (BA) and Lockheed fighter jets to Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait, after the U.S. agreed to a $38 billion military aid package for Israel.Trump leaves for Saudi Arabia on May 19 and will also visit the Vatican, Israel and Brussels.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From Abroad

60,GD,"ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. — The Army showed off its latest iteration of General Dynamics' (GD) Stryker vehicle Tuesday, now packed with more firepower than ever as tensions heat up with Russia.XThere are only 30,000 U.S. troops in Europe, down from the 300,000 at the height of the Cold War, and the U.S. doesn't have a lot of armor in Europe anymore, Lt. Col. Troy Meissel, deputy commanding officer of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, based in Germany, told IBD.The Strykers that his unit operates are armored troop carriers that aren't designed to slug it out with tanks. Meanwhile, Russia's invasions into Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014 have raised fears in Europe of more Russian aggression.So the more heavily armed Strykers now feature a 30-mm cannon, an upgrade from the 0.50-caliber machine gun. The cannon, which is remotely operated with an unmanned turret, can provide more stand-off range and shoots armor-piercing as well as high-explosive/incendiary rounds. A machine gun can also be mounted on the turret along with a Javelin anti-tank missile launcher.Meissel said the new weapons can hold off and slow down a surprise attack from Russian tanks, troop carriers and other lightly armored vehicles until U.S. tanks and other reinforcements can arrive.""We don't fight tanks or armored vehicles,"" he said. ""The goal is to survive those chance contacts.""General Dynamics shares rose 0.6% at 200.61 on the stock market today, retaking their 50-day average. They remain in buy range after breaking out in April, but the stock hasn't moved much over those months.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise as tensions heat up across the globe, and General Dynamics stock is in buy range. You can find other top stocks near buy range and deeper chart analysis in IBD's review screens. Delivery of the vehicle — nicknamed Dragoon after the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, which requested the vehicles — starts in January, with all 81 vehicles expected to be delivered by July 2018.As deployment nears, there are still issues that need to be worked out. For example, soldiers are concerned about reduced visibility due to the removal of hatches for the 30-mm cannon's turret.But Major Gen. David G. Bassett, the Army's program executive officer for ground combat systems, said the service is working through possible solutions.RELATED: Here's What The Army Can And Can't Destroy With This LaserWatch The Aircraft In The Air Force's Light-Attack ExperimentDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

62,GD,"There's plenty to like about the fundamentals of the aerospace and defense sector.XThe U.S. plans to increase combat operations in Afghanistan, while the battle against ISIS in Iraq and Syria continues. North Korea's nuclear program has placed greater urgency on missile defense technology. Passenger jet manufacturers and their suppliers enjoy a long backlog of orders for new-generation planes.Against that backdrop, it's little surprise that iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense (ITA) ETF is trading near record highs. The exchange traded fund has been in a long-term advance since a low in February 2016, and shares are finding support in a pullback to the 10-week moving average.The ETF owns 40 U.S. stocks, with the greatest portfolio weight in industry giants such as Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). Two other major fund holdings are walking to the altar after Rockwell Collins (COL) agreed to a $23 billion buyout from United Technologies (UTX) early this month.IBD'S TAKE: ETFs' prospects for future gains depend on the health of their holdings. You can check how holdings stack up at IBD's Stock Checkup.Boeing has been a winning stock this year, and shares surged 10% July 26 after a strong earnings report. The stock is now forming a new base. Textron (TXT) broke out of a base Monday to the highest price since June 2008. The company's businesses include Bell Helicopter, Cessna aircraft and combat vehicles.Defense spending rarely drops, which is one reason iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense has been a good long-term performer. The ETF's only down year in the last 10 was 2008, while the financial crisis unfolded. The fund's five-year total return is more than 20% and the 10-year return is about 11%, according to the iShares website.Shorter term, there are hurdles. President Trump is seeking to boost military spending, although Congress made a much smaller proposal and both plans are well beyond current spending caps.Commercial aviation has been a growth industry of its own, largely because many airlines have been busy ordering new jets with higher fuel efficiency and other operating advantages.Although risks in that segment appear to be minimal, a Canaccord Genuity analyst saw greater potential in defense stocks.""We believe there is more upside in the defense sector in the next two years than in the commercial aerospace sector ..., which we believe will be a tailwind for defense stocks into 2018,"" analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a report last month. ""Note that defense investment outlays, as of June, were up (about) 4% on a rolling-12-month basis. We continue to see substantial growth in the two primary military campaigns currently underway.""RELATED:President Trump, Republicans Still Face Defense Spending ShowdownBoeing Raises Its 20-Year China Demand Outlook To $1.1 TrillionUnited Technologies Will Buy Rockwell Collins For $23 Billion

63,GD,"Raytheon (RTN) said Thursday that heightened military operations in Syria are lifting the demand outlook for munitions, while more countries in Europe look to acquire its Patriot air-defense system.Shares of Raytheon got a boost after its Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.When asked during a conference call about prospects for a no-fly zone in Syria, Chairman and CEO Thomas Kennedy said the ""tempo in Syria is pretty up right now,"" and the company is ""seeing significant demand signals to provide solutions and keep up with replenishment requirements.""Meanwhile, Poland is in contract negotiations with the U.S. government for Raytheon's Patriot system, and the deal, once closed, will net the company more than $4 billion.Also during the call, an analyst suggested that Romania is one of two other European countries considering the Patriot. Kennedy acknowledged that other countries in Europe are interested but declined to name them, saying only, ""We are obviously working with the U.S. government to expedite those as fast as possible.""On Tuesday, Lockheed Martin (LMT) said it expects more missile defense orders from allies abroad.Shares of Raytheon were up 0.6% at 156.26 on the stock market today, paring gains and dipping back below its 157.69 buy point after clearing that threshold earlier in the day. Northrop Grumman (NOC) was up 0.1% at 248.40, also retreating from an entry point. General Dynamics (GD) added 0.1% to 195.03, still in a buy range, while Lockheed edged up 0.3%, also still in buy range.Raytheon's Q1 earnings from continuing operations jumped 21% to $1.173 a share, well above analyst views for $1.61 billion. Revenue rose 3.4% to $6 billion, also beating Wall Street views for $5.83 billion.Missile sales were up 2% to $1.76 billion. Sales of integrated defense systems, which include the Patriot, rose 5% to $1.4 billion, led by an early-warning radar. Sales of space and airborne systems climbed 8% to $1.6 billion, led by electronic warfare systems. Backlog at the end of the quarter was up 5.5% to $36.1 billion.Raytheon also lifted its guidance and now sees full-year EPS of $7.25 to $7.40, up from an earlier outlook of $7.20 to $7.35 but still largely below consensus of $7.40. It also expects full-year sales of $24.9 billion to $25.4 billion, up from a prior guidance of $24.8 billion to $25.3 billion and with the new midpoint above Wall Street views for $25.09 billion.While Raytheon's international bookings were up 14% in Q1, and international programs made up 41% of the backlog, it's also pursuing U.S. contracts and plans to compete for the Pentagon's Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) — an intercontinental ballistic missile program to replace Boeing's (BA) aging Minuteman missiles.Kennedy said Raytheon hasn't yet decided which contractor it will team up with for GBSD, which has an estimated cost of $62 billion over 30 years. The Air Force is expected to award preliminary contracts to bidders this year then narrow down to one prime contractor in 2020. Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop are also in the running for the GBSD program.RELATED: Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics Hit Buy Points On Strong EarningsHow Boeing's Air Force Tanker Woes Are Helping Its Commercial PlanesLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

64,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) kicks off a busy week of defense earnings Tuesday as tensions rise in the Middle East and Asia.Analysts see an 8% increase in earnings to $2.79 per share, and revenue is seen rising 8.4% to $1.24 billion as F-35 production continues to ramp up.Deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot began in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. Lockheed is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, highlighting the growing demand for air-defense systems.In the Middle East, the $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran. Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies.Shares of Lockheed are back in buy range after clearing a 270 entry several times since late February. Shares rose 1.2% to 276.33 in the stock market today.Raytheon (RTN) reports Thursday. Analysts expect a 12.6% jump in EPS to $1.62 and a 1.2% increase in revenue to $5.83 billion.The Tomahawk maker's stock saw a bump after its cruise missiles were launched at a Syrian air base earlier this month. Each Tomahawk cruise missile costs over $1.5 million.Raytheon's Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand. After land big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland.Shares are also back in buy range after clearing a 152.68 buy point initially last month.

67,GD,"Shares of General Dynamics (GD) popped to a record high and broke out into buy range after the defense giant offered a strong outlook over the coming years, lifting a sector that has offered cloudier forecasts for this year.Management on General Dynamics' earnings call said it was ""quite bullish on 2018 through 2020 in all segments."" The company forecast a 5.6% compound annual growth rate in revenue from 2016 through 2020, helped by an already-large backlog, which stood at $59.8 billion at the end of 2016.CFO Jason Aiken said on a conference call that GD sees ""notionally upward-directional budgets that underpin and support the defense programs across the board.""The bullish forecast from General Dynamics follows weaker ones from Raytheon (RTN), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Northrop Grumman (NOC) this past week, as the industry awaits more details on defense spending from President Trump, who campaigned on stronger national security and a more aggressive approach to combating ISIS.Shares of General Dynamics, which makes tanks, Navy ships and Gulfstream business jets, jumped 4.4% to 185.12 on the stock market today, breaking out of a flat base with a 180.19 buy point.

76,GD,"ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND, Md. — The Army's General Dynamics (GD)-made Stryker troop carrier could get a high-powered laser in the future to shoot down bomb-laden drones, as ISIS employs these so-called flying IEDs.To combat the growing unmanned air system (UAS) threat, the Army tested Boeing's (BA) Mobile High Energy Laser, a 5-kilowatt laser cannon, mounted on a Stryker, at Fort Sill, Okla., back in April.""I'm very optimistic about lasers for counter-UAS missions,"" Maj. Gen. David Bassett, the Army's acquisition executive for ground combat systems, told a group of reporters at a media day Tuesday.But before the Army can use lasers to zap enemy tanks and other vehicles, ""there are hard physics problems "" that need to be solved first, he added.For example, a laser beam spreads out as it travels, making it less powerful the farther away the target is from the laser's source.So for a laser to be effective against a large target, like a tank, it either needs to be more powerful than 5 kilowatts or remain on the target for perhaps hours, rendering the laser impractical in combat.IBD'S TAKE: Defense stocks have been on the rise as tensions heat up across the globe, and General Dynamics stock is in buy range. You can find other top stocks near buy range and deeper chart analysis in IBD's review screens. Right now, the Army is just starting to demonstrate laser capabilities, and Col.

77,GD,"AT&T (T) warned Tuesday that any states opting out of its FirstNet contract with the federal government must ensure that alternate public safety network providers — such as Verizon Communications (VZ) — have services totally ""interoperable"" with its FirstNet system.XSpeaking at a Goldman Sachs technology conference, AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said: ""There's a lot of complexity in terms of how someone else would come in and compete here. We like where we are in this process.""AT&T in late March won a contract to build out FirstNet, the federal government's nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. AT&T in June sent out its proposal to 50 states.About 20 states have agreed to use the FirstNet network AT&T is building. States have until year-end to decide whether to go with AT&T or another company.Verizon in August announced plans to build a network dedicated to public safety communications but will not receive federal funding like AT&T.Without mentioning Verizon directly, Stephenson said rival networks ""need to be fully interoperable with the AT&T core — fully interoperable,"" so that emergency personnel do not encounter problems.Verizon controls two-thirds of the market for emergency personnel, says an Oppenheimer report. ""We expect the company is aiming to maintain its market share"" by announcing a rival to FirstNet, said Tim Horan, an Oppenheimer analyst in the report.Stephenson, though, said AT&T is in a good position ""to take significant share"" in the ""municipalities and state first-responder communities.""AT&T is building a nationwide ground network, with backup generators and a dedicated security operations center as part of the FirstNet contract.Congress has set aside a $6.5 billion subsidy for the contract winner to design and build out the network. It's expected that AT&T will spend about $40 billion over the life of the deal to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.AT&T stock rose 1.45% to close at 36.26 in the stock market today. Shares in Verizon climbed 1.1% to 46.79.IBD'S TAKE:  AT&T stock is down nearly 15% in 2017 as it awaits approval of its Time Warner acquisition. Verizon and AT&T are sometimes popular with investors looking for high dividends, but there are other options, such as banks, industrials and real estate investment trusts (REITs).

78,GD,"America's strategy shift in Afghanistan from counter-insurgency to counterterrorism is good news for helicopter and drone makers as well as Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 program, according to analysts.XIn a speech late Monday, President Trump acknowledged his flip-flop from supporting a full withdrawal to approving a continued presence. While he announced no specifics about troop numbers or a timeline for the war in Afghanistan, he did say U.S. won't be ""nation-building again. We are killing terrorists.""This shift in focus will change the requirements for weapons systems needed in the war.""American troops will do a decapitation campaign similar to what is going on in Yemen,"" Phillip Lohaus, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said of Trump's policy. ""What that means is essentially more of a reliance on drone strikes and on raids and less of a reliance on troops as a stability presence.""While the stealth fighter isn't deployed in Afghanistan, Trump's seeming commitment to the war there could good long-term news for the F-35, which has high-end sensors that can act like a linchpin guiding other air and ground forces as well as drop bombs and support raids, Lohaus said.Trump's policy is also good for munition makers like Lockheed, Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA), whose Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) kit, which turns ""dumb"" bombs ""smart.""Lohaus also said to expect more major munition drops like the Massive Ordnance Air Blast, which was used earlier this year in Afghanistan.Lockheed shares closed up 1% at 304.80 on the stock market today, Boeing added 1.7%, and Raytheon gained 1.4%.Helicopters are used to ferry troops and supplies as well as provide air cover. But after 16 years in Afghanistan, some programs need an update.The Army is looking at replacements for its Lockheed Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook and its Bell OH-58 Kiowa.The Pentagon is expected to seek official proposals in 2019, followed by a contract award in 2020 with the total contract value of all four systems estimated at $100 billion.Trump could also increase the number of drone strikes, as he called out Pakistan for giving ""safe haven to agents of chaos, violence and terror.""President Obama had increased drone strikes on the Taliban and al-Qaida hideouts in Pakistan during his time in office. The classified drone program is mostly operated by the CIA and Trump did not specifically mention it in his speech Monday night.Northrop Grumman (NOC) makes the Global Hawk, which provides intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance information, and privately held General Atomics makes the Predator drone.Northrop shares rallies 1.9%. AeroVironment (AVAV), which makes smaller drones, jumped 5.1%.Lohaus said that the speech wasn't good news for ground vehicle makers as the focus on counterterrorism means the U.S. is unlikely to have a large footprint.""In the past, work focused on training and equipment,"" he said.

80,GD,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis is likely to face little opposition from the Democrats as President-elect Donald Trump's Defense Secretary nominee, and analysts expect his confirmation hearing Thursday to be more about Trump's policies and where Mattis stands.The hearing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET before the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will likely grill Mattis on Iran, major procurement programs and civilian control of the Defense Department.Senators could ask about the Pentagon's commitment to buy more than 2,400 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35s for the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps.On Wednesday, Trump blasted the high costs of the F-35 and said there would more competition on fighter jets, implying Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet could get more orders.Senate Armed Services Chairman Sen. John McCain has been critical of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, blasting the Air Force for failing to give more specific cost figures, and could bring it up with Mattis. The service has put development costs at $23.5 billion and per-plane costs at $564 million in 2016 dollars, but analysts have said the total acquisition costs are near $80 billion.Mattis could also be questioned on Trump's plan to expand the Navy and the often-criticized littoral combat ship, two types of which are being built by Lockheed and an Austal-General Dynamics (GD) team.

Trump has said he wants to tear up the nuclear agreement, and this is where he and Mattis might see eye to eye. At a CSIS presentation last year, Mattis said Iran ""is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East.""Other possible questions include Mattis' position on Trump's remarks that Japan should become a nuclear power and that the U.S. should pull support from NATO.Civilian control of the military will be another big topic at the hearing. The cabinet position is a civilian role, and Mattis would need Congress to waive the requirement to be retired from the military for at least seven years. Mattis has only been out since 2013.Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., said earlier she would vote against a wavier for Mattis.Democrats will be ""looking for assurance that Mattis will respect civilian control of the military and understands his new role as the head civilian in the department and not as an officer,"" Cancian said.RELATED: After Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'Air Force Lays Out Big, Early Decisions For Trump's Administration

81,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) pointed out Friday that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create 1,800 jobs in Texas and thousands more across U.S. suppliers, as production on the stealth fighter hits full speed in the next few years.Earlier, CEO Marillyn Hewson met with President-elect Donald Trump, following his latest complaints about the $400 billion F-35 program's costs.After the meeting, Lockheed said it is near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the cost, echoing comments from the Pentagon's program office last month that the cost would likely come down ""6%-7%."" for the tenth batch of fighters.In December, Hewson met with Trump at the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida after Trump tweeted that the F-35's costs were ""out of control"" and said he asked Boeing (BA) to price out a comparable F/A-18 Super Hornet.Trump on Wednesday called out the F-35 program again, saying ""we're going to have some competition, and it's going to be a beautiful thing.""Lockheed shares climbed 0.8% to 254.57 on the stock market today but are below their 50-day moving average after falling for the prior four sessions.

83,GD,"Missile defense providers Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) rallied to new record highs Wednesday after President Trump vowed to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea amid reports that its nuclear weapon and ballistic missile programs are advancing more quickly than expected.XTim Cahill, the vice president of Lockheed's Air and Missile Defense business, told Reuters on Tuesday that interest in its missile defense systems has increased in the last 12 to 18 months.Last month, a Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery in Alaska intercepted a test missile launched from an Air Force cargo plane near Hawaii. The THAAD system is also deployed in South Korea — to the objection of China, which complains that the system's radar could be used for offensive purposes.Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan are having Raytheon upgrade their Patriot systems. NATO member Poland signed a memorandum of understanding to buy Patriot systems after Trump visited that country in July, and the State Department approved the sale of seven Patriot Configuration 3+ defense systems for another NATO partner, Romania.Shares of Lockheed climbed 1.6% to 304.82 on the stock market today, Raytheon jumped 2.3% to 178.75.

It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017In January, Trump signed an executive order for the Pentagon to start a Nuclear Posture Review, but a purchasing plan to modernize the system was started by the Obama administration and isn't expected to be completed until the 2020s.The Pentagon also hasn't awarded contracts yet for new ballistic missiles and nuclear-capable cruise missiles, though they could come this fiscal year. Boeing (BA), Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are among the companies vying for the contracts. Deployment of the new ballistic missiles is expected in the late 2020s, and the Air Force plans to start fielding the cruise missiles by 2030.Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, and the Navy has a program underway to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles. But the B-21 won't enter service until 2025, and the Columbia-class subs aren't expected until the 2030s.RELATED:What Lockheed's Secretive Skunk Works Unit Sees For The 6th-Gen.

Amazon.com (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Dow stock McDonald's (MCD) hit record highs on earnings, while Intel (INTC) and Starbucks (SBUX) tumbled, with hundreds of other companies reporting. President Trump's big tax-cut plan, which had lifted markets in anticipation, didn't move the needle when its outline was finally released.The major market averages jumped Monday and Tuesday after Emmanuel Macron led the first round of voting in the French presidential election, with polls suggesting he will easily defeat nationalist Marine Le Pen in the early May runoff. Stocks largely consolidated gains the rest of the week, though individual stocks and sectors were active amid a flurry of earnings. Internet, chips, restaurants and casinos were leaders, while Baidu (BIDU), Intel and Starbucks showed that even leading groups had losers. But the Nasdaq composite hit record highs during the week, climbing 2.3%. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.9%, while the S&P 500 index was up 1.5%, just below all-time bests.The e-commerce giant said adjusted income rose 38% year over year to $1.48 a share, beating the consensus Q1 estimate of $1.12.

Revenue at Google's ""other"" non-advertising business — which includes its cloud computing unit, Pixel smartphones and the Play store — rose 49%, to $3.01 billion. Mobile advertising growth was a bright spot, although Google's rising traffic-acquisition costs are a concern.

Starbucks matched profit expectations, but missed on sales amid worries about stalling growth. Starbucks shares undercut a recent buy point intraday Friday, but closed above that level.Software leader Microsoft (MSFT) delivered earnings per share above views for its fiscal third quarter, but sales came in a tad short. Its sales guidance for the June quarter also was below analyst estimates. Microsoft earned 73 cents a share excluding items, up 18% year over year, on adjusted revenue of $23.56 billion, up 6%, in the March quarter. Analysts expected 70 cents and $23.62 billion. For the current quarter, Microsoft guided to sales of $24.15 billion, up 7%, but Wall Street had been modeling for $24.51 billion.Intel earnings topped, but the chip giant's sales fell shy amid weakness in its data center market, sending shares gapping down 3.5% Friday. Macom Technology Solutions (MTSI), Mellanox Technologies (MLNX), KLA-Tencor (KLAC) and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) were chip plays that retreated.

All four defense stocks were in buy range at some point in the week, but by Friday's close all were slightly below entry areas.Core Boeing (BA) earnings jumped 16% to $2.01, beating views, but revenue fell 7% as defense revenue fell 18%. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million. The aerospace giant raised its full year EPS outlook, but the midpoint still fell below analyst views.

Las Vegas Sands (LVS) EPS rose 47% to 66 cents, topping, on 15% revenue growth, meeting views. MGM Resorts (MGM) topped handily on both the top and bottom lines, helped by the takeover of the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa and the MGM National Harbor opening. Wynn Resorts hit a two-year high, and MGM rose to its best since 2008, with shares in buy range. Sands advanced within a consolidation.Exxon Mobil (XOM) reported mixed first-quarter results but said it had no plans to adjust its capital expenditure guidance as the oil major has identified and captured capital efficiencies. Exxon warned that it still needed to be cautious on the rebalancing of the oil market. Chevron (CVX) swung to a profit in Q1 and revenue beat Wall Street estimates as overall production rose. Management said if oil remains around $50 a barrel then future spending would be near the low end of its capex forecast. U.S. oil prices are modestly below $50 a barrel as Baker Hughes announced the U.S. oil rigs in operation rose for a 15th straight week, foreshadowing further production gains.T-Mobile US (TMUS) topped Q1 earnings estimates and continued its streak of grabbing the most new subscribers among wireless operators. T-Mobile added 798,000 postpaid phone subscribers vs. 877,000 in the year-earlier period; that topped estimates of 725,000. T-Mobile shares rose to a new high, in buy range. AT&T (T) is expected to ramp up advertising for bundled wireless and pay TV offers after reporting in-line EPS and revenue that fell more than expected. AT&T lost 348,000 wireless postpaid subscribers, more than expected. Subscriber growth at DirecTV Now's streaming service helped AT&T offset surprising weakness at DirecTV's traditional pay TV business. But AT&T shares fell to 2017 low.Separately, cable giant Comcast (CMCSA) rose to a new high on strength in its movie business and broadband-customer gains.Recall costs and slowing U.S. sales hurt Ford (F) earnings, which fell but still beat Q1 views.

The results come amid concerns about slowing auto sales, rising inventories and falling used-car prices.Dow Jones industrial average equipment-maker Caterpillar (CAT) earned $1.28 a share in Q1, more than doubling estimates, and raised its 2017 revenue range by $2 billion to $39-$41 billion, vs. estimates of $38.3 billion. Caterpillar's good news comes despite lack of progress on President Trump's infrastructure program or border wall, two initiatives that have made Caterpillar a Trump stock. Ahead of earnings, Caterpillar finally broke a 51-month streak of falling retail sales, with a 1% gain that was driven by construction equipment sales in the Asia-Pacific region. Caterpillar shares soared into a buy zone.Biotechs and drugmakers reported en masse Thursday with AbbVie (ABBV), Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) and Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) delivering across-the-board beats, pumping their stocks up that day. AstraZeneca (AZN) topped on earnings, but sales slid 12%, though adjusted profits grew 4% and topped by 17 cents. Top two biotechs, Amgen (AMGN) and Celgene (CELG), both reported lagging sales.

The catalyst was an especially strong earnings report from Anthem (ANTM), though investors may have judged that TrumpCare remains doomed. Humana (HUM) previewed its earnings and raised guidance. Centene (CNC) topped estimates and CEO Michael Neidorff said he expects the Medicaid-heavy insurer to thrive on any reform that can be passed by Congress, noting that ""20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid.""PulteGroup (PHM) topped earnings estimates, but revenue fell short. Meanwhile, President Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Canadian softwood imports, which could raise construction costs by $1,200 per home. New-home sales rose in March to the second-fastest rate of the current business cycle. Pulte tumbled, but did not outright close below a prior buy point. D.R.

""But around the edges of that, things like systems installation, wiring installation, the details that go into concurrently designing and building and how to do that most efficiently.""Lessons from the KC-46, which saw $120 million in extra costs in Q1, come as Boeing considers building a brand-new midrange plane dubbed the 797. Boeing has been under pressure to develop a new twin-aisle jet to grab market share back from Airbus and its A321neo jet.As a stopgap measure before the midrange jet launches, Boeing plans to extend its largest 737 Max to limit further losses to Airbus. The so-called 737 Max 10 could be unveiled at the Paris Air Show in June, sources told Reuters.Muilenburg didn't say Boeing's experience with the KC-46 would feed directly into the 797 and 737 Max 10 and declined to offer any details about them, such as the price tag, despite reports of carriers wanting a new plane at around $70 million-$75 million. But he did say Boeing is having productive conversations about the business case for each option.""Our primary focus is engaging with customers and understanding their future needs,"" Muilenburg said.Boeing shares were down 1% to 181.71 on the stock market today, pulling back further from a 185.81 buy point, as Q1 revenue missed forecasts. Rival Airbus (EADSY) dipped 0.6% despite securing a $6 billion deal for 20 A350-900 widebody jets from China Southern Airlines.Boeing's core EPS jumped 16% to $2.01, beating analyst views for $1.95. Revenue fell 7% to $21 billion, under views for $21.35 billion. Commercial revenue dipped 1% to $14.3 billion, as commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Defense revenue declined 18% to $6.5 billion.Total company backlog was $480 billion, up from $473 billion at the start of the quarter. Free cash flow soared to $1.63 billion from $527 million a year ago.Boeing raised its full-year adjusted EPS guidance to $9.20-$9.40, with the midpoint still below Wall Street views for $9.35, from an earlier outlook of $9.10-$9.30, due to a lower-than-expected tax rate.Muilenburg reiterated the company's stance on supporting tax reform and simplifying the tax code hours after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that President Trump's tax cut, with a 15% corporate tax rate, will be ""the biggest in history.""Muilenburg, who seems to have the president's ear on key issues, said Boeing has seen regulation improvements from the streamlining of defense contracting to improvements in the time it takes to get approval for foreign sales.On the defense side, Boeing has been pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to stay relevant in the defense air frame space as sales of its F-15 wind down and is in the race against Lockheed Martin (LMT) for the Air Force's T-X trainer contract.On Tuesday, Lockheed reported mixed Q1 results, and the F-35 maker lowered its full-year earnings outlook but slightly raised its revenue view. Raytheon (RTN) is scheduled to report Thursday.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD), which both topped earnings estimates Wednesday, were little changed and up 0.9%, respectively. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes jet engines, climbed 1.2% on strong Q1 results.Lockheed shares edged up 0.1% to 270.33 after falling 2.2% to 270.02 on Tuesday.

91,GD,"Dow Jones industrial component Boeing (BA) is expected to report bigger profits, but revenue is seen falling for a third straight quarter when the aerospace giant reports Q1 results Wednesday.Earnings are seen climbing 11.5% to $1.94 while revenue slips 5.9% to $21.3 billion, marking the fourth top-line drop in the last six quarters.While announcements for new orders grab headlines and point to demand, it's actual deliveries that put money in the coffers each quarter. Earlier this month, Boeing reported Q1 commercial aircraft deliveries fell to 169 from 176 a year ago. Deliveries of 737s dropped to 113 from 121 in 2016, and 777 deliveries dipped to 21 from 23. But the 787 Dreamliner saw an increase of two to 32.Shares rose 0.8% to 183.51 on the stock market today. Boeing is closing in on a 185.81 entry from a flat base and has been finding support at its 50-day line recently. But the stock had already broken out in January and October, and investors should be cautious about late-stage bases.Boeing already announced 198 net orders for Q1, vs. 121 in the year ago quarter, roughly around the 218 Q1 average from 2012-2016, Canaccord Genuity analyst Ken Herbert wrote in a client note.The aerospace giant's ""stock is not as correlated with order activity as it has been, so we do not believe near-term order activity (or lack of) will be significant for the stock,"" Herbert wrote.Still, Boeing has lost the order race to rival Airbus (EADSY) for the last four years and has cut over 1,300 engineering jobs since January 2016.On Friday, Boeing laid off ""hundreds"" of engineering employees at its Washington state factory after offering a round of voluntary layoffs in January, and more engineering cuts could be coming depending on the ""business environment"" and voluntary attrition.Boeing could give an update on a possible new clean-sheet design for a twin-aisle midrange jet to grab market share back from rival Airbus and its A321neo jet.On the defense side, Herbert sees revenue down 8% but believes sentiment on the stock has ""improved since the election and the initial negative headlines around pricing on Air Force One,"" which President Trump had earlier blasted for being too expensive.Meanwhile, Trump has been critical of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 over its high cost and said in February he was ""looking seriously at a big order"" of Boeing's Super Hornets.Boeing is pushing to build an upgraded F/A-18 Super Hornet to be more competitive vs. more advanced fifth generation fighters like the F-35.Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD) also report on Wednesday, and Raytheon's (RTN) results are slated for Thursday.RELATED: Lockheed Sees More F-35, Missile Defense Orders From AbroadDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

92,GD,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and other top Pentagon contractors will benefit from a huge bump in military spending under the $1.3 trillion fiscal 2018 budget that President Trump signed Friday, just hours after threatening to veto it.Lawmakers have earmarked $654.6 billion for the Pentagon, an increase of $61.1 billion from the 2017 budget, as global tensions increase in North Korea, Russia, China and the Middle East.The House passed the legislation late Wednesday, and the Senate passed it in the early morning hours on Friday. But Trump tweeted later today that the budget didn't fully fund a border wall and lacked a resolution for the DACA program, which he moved to end last year. He signed it anyway, citing national security priorities.Missile defense will get $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.3 billion from the fiscal 2017 budget and more than the $9.5 billion the Missile Defense Agency requested. The figure includes the $2 billion appropriated in December as part of a special supplemental budget deal.The MDA will get $393 million to speed up Boeing's modernization of the kill vehicle in 20 Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System interceptors in Fort Greely, Alaska.Under the proposed budget, Congress approved 24 new Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets, 10 more than the Navy requested.There are also funds for three more Boeing KC-46 tankers, on top of the 15 the Air Force requested. The over-budget and behind schedule tanker has come under fire the past year. Boeing has booked $2.9 billion before taxes, or $1.9 billion after taxes, in charges for cost overruns associated with the tanker, which is based on a 767 airframe.The Army will get $577 million for 17 Boeing AH-64E Apache helicopters, and the Navy will get $501 million for three more Boeing P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft.Boeing shares closed up 0.4% on the stock market today, paring intraday gains sharply after sinking 5.2% Thursday as concerns about a trade war with China hurt prospects for the company's commercial aircraft business.Congress approved $2.9 billion for 20 more F-35s, bringing the total for this fiscal year to 90 planes.The Navy will get eight more of the carrier variant of the fifth-generation jet and the Marines will get four more short take off/vertical landing F-35s as well as two carrier versions. The Air Force didn't get its entire wish list, but will get 56 F-35s in total, just four shy of its 60 request.Northrop is a major subcontractor on the F-35, and United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney unit makes the engine.The proposed budget now includes $165 million for more Lockheed Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptors along with $178 million for Raytheon (RTN) SM -3 interceptors and $137 million for another test of Raytheon's SM-3 Block IIA missile. Both interceptors are for use in Lockheed's Aegis Ashore system.The bill also included 12 more Lockheed C-130J Super Hercules planes for the Air National Guard and the Army National Guard got $108 million for eight Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters.Lockheed rose 2.8%, Northrop gained 2.1%, while United Tech fell 1.4%.Along with the increase in F-35s, Congress approved $84 million for six more Northrop MQ-8 Fire Scout unmanned helicopters.The Navy will get $23.8 billion for shipbuilding, up by $2.6 billion from 2017. The service expects to buy an aircraft carrier from Northrop spin-off Huntington Ingalls Industries' (HII) Newport News Shipbuilding.Newport News and General Dynamics (GD) Electric Boat will also get more funding for two Virginia-class submarines.The bill also includes money for three littoral combat ships and two destroyers.Shares of General Dynamics edged up 0.2%, and Huntington Ingalls added 1.9%.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Consider These 3 Defense Giants For Your Stock ArsenalDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsBest Growth Stocks To Buy And Watch: See Updates To IBD Stock ListsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

Elsewhere in the space, aerospace and defense stocks with more commercial exposure are holding up and trading near highs while those with more military exposure are still struggling.Like Boeing (BA), Hexcel Corp (HXL) is also in buy range, while Textron (TXT) and Flir Systems (FLIR) are slightly extended from buy range and Heico (HEI) is well extended from its last proper base, but near an add-on entry.Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD) are each 12% below their highs. Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Raytheon (RTN) are 9% and 8% off their highs, respectively.Boeing stock rose 2% Friday. The low-volume breakout puts the 2017's top-performing Dow Jones component above a handle buy point of 348.67. But investors may want to focus on the conventional entry of 371.70, ten cents above the stock's all-time high.

95,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN) and other defense stocks rallied as President Trump's plan to leave the Iran nuclear deal turned up the heat on already-rising tensions in the Middle East.XIran blasted Trump's decision, though President Hassan Rouhani also said Tehran will remain in the nuclear deal without the U.S.Syrian state-run media reported Tuesday afternoon that Israel allegedly fired missiles on Iran-linked sites near Damascus, adding to the uncertainty in the region.And Saudi Arabia said Wednesday that its air defenses shot down two more ballistic missiles over Riyadh that were fired by Houthi rebels in Yemen.""If we go back a couple of weeks they were underperforming,"" said Jeff Windau, senior equity analyst at Edward Jones, told IBD after Trump's announcement. ""This probably swings the pendulum in the other direction. There are more concerns of something escalating over there in the next several months as the sanctions start to get implemented.""If talks to keep the nuclear deal alive fail by year's end, and the U.S. reimposes the sanctions that were in place before the deal, then the situation grows more ominous, warned Bob McNally, president of the Rapidan Group energy consulting firm.""The next scenario is that Iran walks away from the deal, and that risks a military conflict,"" he said in an interview Tuesday.Lockheed shares rose 0.6% on the stock market today, after closing up 2% Tuesday.

"" The plan that we outlined for you, the production rate that we've put in place is not dependent on the Iranian orders.

98,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects more international orders for its F-35 fighter aircraft and the company's missile-defense system, as global tensions spur demand for U.S. military hardware.But the defense giant's stock retreated to its buy point following Lockheed's first-quarter sales miss and weak earnings guidance.During Lockheed's conference call Tuesday, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that 50% of F-35 orders over the next five years will be from international customers as Lockheed sees interest from countries outside the current program of record.Partner countries on the F-35 include the U.K., Italy, the Netherlands, Japan, Turkey, Australia and Israel, among others. Last year, Lockheed said it was in talks with Spain, Belgium and Switzerland about selling them the F-35.Meanwhile, North Korea's recent missile tests are speeding up deployment of Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system to South Korea, and the company expects interest in THAAD from Middle Eastern customers.Raytheon's (RTN) Patriot air-defense system has also been in demand in the Mideast and Asia. After the company landed big orders from Saudi Arabia in 2015, South Korea and Japan now plan to upgrade their Patriot systems, and a contract topping $7 billion is expected soon from Poland. Lockheed makes the PAC-3 missile for the Patriot system.Lockheed has set a goal to expand its foreign sales to 30% of total revenue in the next few years, and the Trump administration has been supportive of sales to allies. A $5 billion sale of 19 Lockheed F-16 fighter jets to Bahrain was recently cleared, as U.S. allies in the region face intensifying friction with Iran.Hewson said Tuesday that Lockheed is continuing to look at opportunities to sell the F-16 abroad, especially to India, which could be a bigger buy than the Bahrain order. Shares of Lockheed fell 2.2% to 270.02 on the stock market today, trading just above and below a 270 buy point for much of the session, on mixed quarterly results and weak guidance.Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major F-35 subcontractor and reports Wednesday, lost 0.4% to 248.13, just below a 249.53 buy pointutx. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines and also reports Wednesday, rose 0.5%.Lockheed reported adjusted EPS of $3, with revenue up 6.7% to $11.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.79 on revenue of $11.23 billion. Aeronautics sales, which include the F-35, jumped 8% to $4.1 billion. Rotary and Mission Systems sales, which include Sikorsky, edged up 2% to $3.1 billion. Missile sales rose to $1.49 billion while Space division sales climbed 12% to $2.36 billion.The company now sees full-year EPS of $12.15 to $12.45, below the Wall Street consensus for $12.64 and down from an earlier outlook of $12.25-$12.55, and sees sales of $49.5 billion-$50.7 billion, with the midpoint slightly below consensus for $50.18 billion and up from an earlier outlook of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion.In addition to foreign orders, Lockheed expects to reach a deal with the Pentagon for an 11th batch of F-35s, with a finalized contract expected in Q3.Lockheed started deliveries from the ninth F-35 production lot in Q1, after a $6.1 billion contract for 57 planes was signed in November. An $8.2 billion contract for the 10th batch, which covers 90 F-35s, was signed in February, though deliveries aren't expected until next year. The company is planning to transition to full-rate production in 2019.But as Lockheed looks to ramp up production, there are questions as to whether it will be able to meet its delivery goal of 66 jets this year. The Pentagon's Defense Contract Management Agency told Bloomberg that Lockheed will likely only deliver 57 F-35s this year, as it's failed to meet its contract requirements since 2014. But Lockheed insists that it will meet its target of 66.Lockheed is also working to push costs of the F-35A, the basic model ordered by the Air Force and most international partners, to under $80 million per plane in 2019 or 2020, down from $95 million currently. But Tanner said the lower cost won't negatively impact profit margins.But testing delays with the F-35 could add over $1 billion to the cost of the stealth fighter as well as postpone the Navy's timeline for declaring its version of the jet combat ready next year, according to a Government Accountability Office report out Monday. But the Pentagon offered lower estimates for cost growth and denied that there will be any impact on the Navy's or international partners' schedules to declare their variants combat ready.Lockheed is still bullish on its Sikorsky division, even though it didn't deliver a single commercial helicopter in Q1. Still, the company expects to finish the year delivering over 180 helicopters, in line with 2016 deliveries.In addition to Northrop, Boeing (BA) and General Dynamics (GD) will report Wednesday, and Raytheon is scheduled for Thursday.RELATED: Dow's Boeing Nears Buy Point Ahead Of Q1 Results, But Revenue To DropLockheed's F-35, F-22 May Soon Face Their Moment Of Truth

100,GD,"The S&P 500 index, Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq tumbled during the week as Alphabet (GOOGL), Caterpillar (CAT) and 3M (MMM) earnings and a 3% Treasury yield spooked investors.

The 10-year Treasury hit 3% for the first time in four years, hitting 3.02% during the week before pulling back to 2.96%. Short-term yields continued to rise faster than long-term rates, squeezing the yield spread. Alphabet (GOOGL) expenses and ongoing chip weakness also hit stocks. But Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Boeing (BA) and Visa (V) rallied on strong results. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) initially hit buy points Friday, but pulled back.Amazon's first-quarter earnings skyrocketed, more doubling the EPS estimate.

Fellow Dow Jones stock United Technologies (UTX) reported stronger-than-expected Q1 earnings and sales. The industrial giant also raised its full-year adjusted EPS and sales forecast.Lockheed Martin (LMT) topped first-quarter estimates and the defense contractor raised EPS and revenue targets. But the F-35 maker didn't raise its cash-flow expectation. Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported Q1 earnings above estimates, but Northrop said it didn't submit a bid for the Air Force's GPS III contract, leaving Lockheed as the likely lone bidder. Raytheon (RTN) raised its full-year earnings forecast above consensus as its Q1 earnings and revenue topped estimates. General Dynamics (GD) beat on earnings and met revenue views. Shares of all four defense contractors sold off sharply for the week.The software kingpin earned 95 cents a share, up 36% year over year, on sales of $26.8 billion, up 16%, in its fiscal third quarter. Analysts expected 85 cents and $25.71 billion. Microsoft (MSFT) has been shifting its business from desktop PC software to cloud-computing infrastructure and applications, such as Office 365 and Azure. Microsoft's commercial cloud revenue rose 58% in fiscal Q3. The software giant initially reclaimed a recent buy point on Friday, but pared gains.Intel (INTC) earnings rose 32% as sales grew 9% to $16.1 billion, both well above analyst views. The chip giant guided higher for current quarter sales, indicating a third-straight quarter of top-line growth. Shares initially jumped to a 17-year high Friday but reversed to close slightly lower. Texas Instruments (TXN), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), STMicroelectronics (STM) and Xilinx (XLNX) got boosts from upbeat earnings reports. But chip-gear maker Teradyne (TER) tumbled after warning of weak demand for equipment to test mobile devices. Western Digital (WDC), which makes disk drives and memory chips, tumbled Friday despite beating fiscal Q3 views. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index fought for support at its 200-day moving average.Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) reported Q1 earnings and revenue that topped views but a sharp rise in capital spending, margin pressure and higher traffic acquisition costs sparked a sell-off in the internet search giant. Capex jumped to $7.3 billion from $2.5 billion in the year-ago period, including $2.4 billion for a real estate purchase in Manhattan. Traffic costs — or what Google pays partner websites to generate advertising revenue — jumped 36% to $6.288 billion. Google has hiked spending on YouTube and video content, cloud computing, smart home consumer appliances and artificial intelligence projects.PayPal (PYPL) topped earnings and revenue expectations as total payment volume rose 27% to $132 billion year over year, vs. estimates of $128 billion.

Ford will not invest in traditional sedans for North America going forward, and will almost phase out passenger cars by 2020, as consumers migrate to SUVs and light trucks. GM still sees small cars as an opportunity at home and abroad, even as it too shifts focus to larger and more profitable vehicles.Casino operator Las Vegas Sands (LVS) topped first-quarter results estimates, helped by strong demand in global gaming hub Macau and in Singapore. Macau also helped Q1 results for Wynn Resorts (WYNN), but its overall and Macau sales disappointed some analysts. Wynn Resorts also approved a dividend increase. The earnings report from Wynn was the first since Steve Wynn resigned as CEO and sold his stake following allegations of sexual misconduct. MGM Resorts (MGM) narrowly beat, but the stock tumbled on declining traffic at its U.S. locations. MGM is more U.S.-focused than Sands or Wynn.Amgen (AMGN) and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (ALXN) broadly topped Q1 views, though Amgen's sales and adjusted profit outlook for 2018 were a bit soft at the midpoints. Sales of Alexion's blockbuster Soliris missed some estimates, but shares popped on a promising study for new drug ALXN1210. Biogen (BIIB) sales lagged on sluggish Spinraza and multiple sclerosis drug revenue. Prothena (PRTA) tanked 69% on Monday after it scrapped a rare disease drug on a failed Phase 2 study.

Total student enrollments rose 7.7% year over year to about 861,400. IBD 50 stock TAL Education's (TAL) EPS jumped to 14 cents a share as revenue soared 59% to $504 million.

Homebuilder stocks were generally muted due to rising interest rates. But D.R. Horton (DHI), the biggest U.S. builder, on Thursday bested views with a 52% EPS surge as revenue swelled 17% to $3.795 billion. Homebuilder stocks rallied for solid gains, helped by cooling Treasury yields. New-home sales rose in March to an annualized sales pace of 694,000 units, a four-month high. Meanwhile existing-home prices rose 6.8% in February vs. a year earlier.China search-engine leader Baidu (BIDU) reported a Q1 profit that blew past estimates, lifting shares. Baidu still owns a majority of iQiyi (IQ), which held its IPO in March. Video streaming website iQiyi accounts for roughly 20% of the parent's revenue. Shares in iQiyi fell after it released earnings in tandem with Baidu.Visa (V) reported a 29% EPS gain on a 13% revenue rise, both beating fiscal Q2 views. The credit- and debit-card giant raised its full-year revenue outlook. Shares leapt 4.8% on Thursday.3M (MMM) met EPS views as revenue rose 8% to $8.278 billion, just above consensus. But the Dow Jones giant slashed its full-year EPS target. 3M stock plunged.Caterpillar (CAT) reported strong Q1 earnings and sales, but shares of the heavy construction and equipment maker reversed sharply lower Tuesday after warning that operating margins hit a ""high watermark"" for the year.ServiceNow (NOW) reported Q1 profit and revenue above estimates.

Shares fell 4.7% for the week. E-Trade Financial (ETFC) continues to rise after last week's strong results.First Solar (FSLR) hit a six-year high after Q1 earnings topped expectations due to the sale of several solar projects, as it expanded U.S. production.Proofpoint (PFPT), a cybersecurity firm, topped adjusted first-quarter earnings and revenue views, but guided low on Q2 profit. Shares fell 5.2% Friday. In Q1, advanced protection solutions nearly doubled to make up 20% of new and add-on bookings, up from 15% in the prior quarter.

109,GD,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, who has been tapped as defense secretary, said Thursday that Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 stealth fighter is key for the U.S. and its allies and supports having human pilots fly Northrop Grumman's (NOC) forthcoming B-21 bomber.The F-35 — which has an acquisition price tag of about $400 billion for more than 2,400 planes — has come under sustained criticism from President-elect Donald Trump, who again blasted the program Wednesday for being behind schedule and over budget. He also suggested the F-35 would face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.The F-35 ""is critical for our own air superiority in the future because of stealth characteristics and some of the electronics capability that's inherent in the airplane,"" Mattis said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee.Trump has ""in no way shown any lack of support"" for the F-35, he added, but just wants ""bang for his buck.""Top U.S. allies like the U.K., Israel, Italy and Australia are also partners on the F-35 program (which is in production) or are buyers.""Many of our allies have bet their air superiority on their F-35 program, and it bonds us closely together with them,"" Mattis said earlier.When asked about the B-21 Raider, he paused and said he supports a manned bomber. That program, which is in early development, has been criticized by Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain for not being more transparent on its total acquisition costs, which analysts have put at $50 billion to $80 billion.Northrop's B-21 isn't currently being designed to be unmanned but that capability would be a consideration in the future, the Air Force said last year.Shares of Lockheed closed down 1% at 252.62 on the stock market today. Northrop, which is also a major F-35 subcontractor, fell 1% as well to finish at 229.15, and Boeing slipped 0.7% to 158.29.Mattis also voiced support for the recapitalization of U.S. nuclear assets, including the Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarine, which will replace Ohio-class ""boomers,"" as well as development of new ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles.General Dynamics (GD) is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class subs, which are in the design phase. Lockheed, Northrop, Boeing and Raytheon (RTN) are expected to bid on the ICBM contract.But Mattis said he needs to look at the deterrence capabilities of the Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missile meant to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. That program's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion.In prepared remarks ahead of the hearing, he also said he would review the Littoral Combat Ship program.Last month, McCain criticized the Navy for spending $12.4 billion on 26 ships. The cost per LCS has nearly doubled to $478 million, and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Lockheed and separate team made up of Australia's Austal and General Dynamics are building different versions of the LCS.Shares of General Dynamics ended 0.3% lower at 176.52, though Mattis has said he would recuse himself from matters related to GD for one year. He also said he would resign from GD's board and divest his GD stock.Meanwhile, the Senate Armed Services Committee voted 24-3 in favor of waiving the requirement for a Pentagon chief to be retired from the military for at least seven years. Mattis has only been out since 2013.

113,GD,"The best sector mutual funds last year thrived in several areas, and the number of funds winning IBD Mutual Funds 2018 Awards jumped to 32 from the previous year's 13.This year the best sector mutual funds represented technology, defense and aerospace, media and telecom, health care and retail. Each of the top-performing sector funds not only surpassed the S&P 500 in the past one, three, five and 10 years, but was also the top fund in its sector ranked by 10-year performance.According to Morningstar, a sector mutual fund invests solely in a general industry — such as technology — or in a more specific industry, like an internet company. But there can be a great deal of overlap among the sectors. For example, Amazon.com featured heavily in three of the five featured sector funds — technology, retail and media — while other FANG stocks held prominent roles as well.The components and weighting within the fund dictate its performance compared with the S&P 500.Technology stocks were among the year's best performers, as institutions flocked to the leading names — like the FANG stocks — in the sector.T. Rowe Global Technology (PRGTX) was the top fund within the U.S. technology sector, coming in with a 47.04% return in 2017, more than doubling the S&P 500's 21.83% return and also trouncing the tech-heavy Nasdaq's 28.2% return. The fund targets potential winners within specific technological themes, like cloud computing.Holdings that drove 2017's outperformance include Big Cap 20 member Salesforce.com (CRM) and FANG stocks Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN) — a position which has since been sold. The fund also saw big gains from Chinese stock leaders Tencent (TCEHY) and Alibaba (BABA).Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAs of Dec. 31, the fund had nearly 35% of its assets in its top five holdings, which are exhibiting strong fundamental and technical action.New top holdings include dynamic electric automaker Tesla (TSLA) and Broadcom (AVGO). Shares of Tesla moved up 46% in 2017, but have been mostly stagnant since September 2017. Since then, the stock has been trading sideways in a range from 290 to about 360.Meanwhile, Apple-supplier Broadcom fell victim to slowing iPhone sales, as the stock fell 21% from its highs in early February. The stock is consolidating at its 50- and 200-day moving average lines.The defense industry saw strong gains in 2017, as President Trump boosted military spending.  Blue chip stock and defense leader Boeing (BA) paced the advancers with a gain of nearly 90%.Fidelity Select Defense & Aerospace (FSDAX) jumped 34.21% in 2017. Its top holdings include Dow Jones Industrials name Boeing, Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).While Boeing and Northrop — up 32% in 2017 — are extended from recent buy points, General Dynamics hasn't had the same torrid advanced and is near a 229.64 flat-base entry.Social media has become a major segment of the media & telecom sector and no company has a larger social media impact than Facebook (FB).T. Rowe Media & Telecommunications (PRMTX) rose 32.99% in 2017. According to Morningstar, the fund is a bit different from the other sector funds in the communications category. While the fund has several communication tower names like American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), it also looks for high-growth companies that are disrupting the industry, like Amazon.The two tower companies had gains of 35% and 28%, respectively, in 2017. As such, the fund's performance was driven by its top three holdings: Amazon.com, Alibaba and Facebook.In a sector not typically known for large advances, health care fund Delaware Healthcare (DLHIX) put in a strong performance in 2017 with a 32.32% rise.The $512 million fund's performance was driven by its position in Germany-based MorphoSys — which advanced nearly 60% — and is involved in the development and research of antibodies. The foreign biotech is also the fund's biggest position as of the end of January at over 7%.Its top U.S.-based position is ethical drugmaker Eli Lilly (LLY), but that didn't spark the fund's 2017 performance, as the stock only rose about 15% last year.Retailers continue to struggle with the Amazon Effect, creating winners and losers within the sector. The obvious retail winner in 2017 was e-commerce giant Amazon.In 2017, Fidelity Select Retail (FSRPX) delivered a 25.82% return due to its long-term investment in the industry leader Amazon.A whopping 40% of the $2.3 billion fund's portfolio is tied to e-commerce giant Amazon (23%) and Home Depot (HD) (17%). Both stocks were paramount to the fund's return in 2017 and will again in 2018 if their positions remain that big.The Fidelity Select Retail fund has owned Amazon since August 2005 — according to Morningstar — while Home Depot was first purchased in August 2008. Last year, Amazon ran up 56%, accounting for a large portion of the fund's annual gains. The stock is trading near its highs and nearly 30% above its most recent buy point — a flat base's 1,213.51 entry.In the meantime, the home improvement retailer had a solid 41% advance in 2017. The retailer was driven higher by solid consumer spending and a strong housing cycle.

115,GD,"Boeing (BA) emphasized the importance of trade with China for aerospace industry jobs in the U.S. as President Donald Trump pushes for more protectionist policies.CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on a conference call Wednesday that a ""healthy trade relationship between the U.S. and China is still important.""China is emerging as a key aerospace market as the country's rising middle class boosts demand for travel. In September, Boeing estimated China would need 6,810 airplanes, valued at $1 trillion, over the next 20 years.To stay competitive Muilenburg said the planned 737 completion plant in Zhoushan is ""an important part of the partnership equation.""""That finishing center is a location where we can add value in China, but every airplane that goes there is built in the U.S.,"" he said. ""It's a great example of how growth in China creates growth in U.S. manufacturing jobs.""Muilenburg was bullish on Trump's focus on the American workforce and tax reforms and regulations for the aerospace sector, but Citron Research warned earlier this month that Trump is a big threat to the industry as he looks to lower military aircraft costs.But strong Q4 results sent Boeing shares up 4.2% to 167.36, hitting record highs on the stock market today, continuing to break out after just clearing a 160.17 buy point on Monday. European rival Airbus (EADSY) fell 0.8%.Adjusted Q4 earnings jumped 54% to $2.47 a share, marking its fastest growth in more than three years, as revenue dipped 1% to $23.29 billion, better than forecasts for $23.19 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue rose 1% to $16.24 billion, as Q4 deliveries edged up 1.6% to 185. Defense, space and security revenue fell 12% to $6.86 billion. Total backlog was $473 billion at the end of Q4, up from $462 billion at the beginning of Q4.Full-year 2017 EPS of $9.10-$9.30, below Wall Street views for $9.31, on revenue of $90.5 billion-$92.5 billion, below consensus views for $93.09 billion. Operating cash flow is seen increasing to $10.75 billion next year from $10.5 billion in 2016, as the 787 program has finally turned cash-flow positive, boosting prospects for more stock buybacks and dividend hikes.Boeing's commercial division has been pressured by Airbus in recent years and its hot-selling A321neo. Boeing plans to roll out a stretched version of the latest 737 Max to hold on to market share before launching a new fell 0.6%.Boeing's 737 Max 10X plane will carry 190-230 people and could launch in 2020, according to reports earlier this month. Management said in October that the new midsize plane could be delivered by 2024-2025.On the defense side, Boeing had come under fire from Trump over the high costs of its Air Force One replacement program. But Muilenburg met with Trump and said the company could build a new Air Force One for under $4 billion.But Trump also tweeted last month that he asked Boeing to price out a F/A-18 Super Hornet ""comparable"" to the F-35. But Pentagon officials said they need the new Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 for stealth and other fifth-generation capabilities that the Super Hornet lacks.Shares of Lockheed, which reported Q4 results above analyst views on Tuesday but gave weak 2017 EPS guidance, dipped 1.1% Wednesday.Also Wednesday, Textron (TXT) said Q4 earnings fell 3.7% to 78 cents per share, falling short of views 87 cents. Revenue was down 2.5% to $3.83 billion, under views for $3.9 billion.

117,GD,"AT&T (T) did the expected Thursday and won the contract to build out FirstNet, the federal government's nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross made the announcement Thursday morning in Washington. Details of the agreement had yet to be ironed out, but AT&T will be the primary contractor responsible for adding towers and antennas to build out the vast network. AT&T said its ""team"" to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions (MSI), General Dynamics (GD), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government.Congress has set aside $6.5 billion for the contract winner to design and build out the network. It's expected that AT&T will spend about $40 billion over the life of the deal to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network.As part of the contract, though, AT&T will gain access to a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the life of the 25-year contract. While the FirstNet public safety network would be prioritized for emergency responders, the winning bidder would also be able to use the spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services, considered highly valuable.IBD'S TAKE: Shares in AT&T, which in October agreed to buy media giant Time Warner (TWX), are down about 2% in 2017. Rising interest rates are negative for high-dividend paying stocks, such as AT&T and Dow component Verizon Communications (VZ). Research other options at The Income Investor.AT&T beat out Rivada Networks, a consortium that includes wireless network makers Nokia (NOK) and Ericsson (ERICY) as well as chipmaker Intel (INTC), and Harris (HRS).Analysts say FirstNet's buildout should boost cell tower operators such as American Tower (AMT) and SBA Communications (SBAC).Shares of AT&T were up 0.8% to close at 41.76 on the stock market today.RELATED:Cell Tower Stocks Claw Back On Verizon-AT&T Unlimited-Data WarComcast, Charter Morphing Into Broadband-First Providers

118,GD,"The Trump administration is set to unveil a budget proposal in the coming week that will offer additional details about defense spending, making Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), United Technologies (UTX), General Dynamics (GD) and Dow Jones industrial average component Boeing (BA) stocks to watch.The budget plan, which could be released Thursday, follows a broad outline last month that called for a $54 billion hike in defense spending but didn't specify what programs would benefit. It also didn't say how dollars would be split between new weapons, which would help the Lockheed Martins of the world, and personnel costs like uniforms, medical care and housing.During his campaign, Trump called for adding 78 ships to the Navy, at least 100 aircraft to the Air Force, and tens of thousands of troops to the Army and Marines. He has also backed efforts to recapitalize the U.S. nuclear arsenal, as Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop, Raytheon (RTN) and other defense contractors turn their sights to nuclear missile contracts that could be worth more than $90 billion.Lockheed Martin — which makes the F-35 stealth fighter jet, Sikorsky helicopters, missiles, and the littoral combat ship — has been trying to clear a cup base with a 270 buy point. Shares ended Friday at 268.66.The Pentagon's top supplier has taken some flak recently. Trump has said he wants to introduce competition into the business of building fighter jets, saying costs for the F-35 were ""out of control"" and that he wanted Boeing to ""price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet."" But such a shift would require a new competition and wouldn't show up in the upcoming budget. Meanwhile, Lockheed has been cutting costs on the F-35, with the latest production contract factoring in unit cost reductions of 7%-8%.

121,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) expects a surge in F-35 deliveries this year but gave weak earnings guidance as the defense giant comes under intense pressure from the White House to cut costs on the massive program.The Pentagon's top contractor expects to deliver 66 of the stealth jets in 2017, up 43% from the 46 delivered last year, though that fell short of its goal for 53.But Lockheed sees 2017 EPS of $12.25-$12.55, below consensus views for $12.87, on revenue of $49.4 billion-$50.6 billion, with the midpoint above the Wall Street estimate of $49.59 billion.The $400 billion F-35 program is becoming an increasing critical part of Lockheed's business as production, and deliveries, ramp up. In 2015, the company delivered 45, up from 36 in 2014.Lockheed shares closed down 1.8% at 252.91 on the stock market today, halving earlier losses. United Technologies (UTX), which makes the F-35's engines, rose 1.15%, and Northrop Grumman (NOC), a major F-35 subcontractor, added 0.4%.IBD'S TAKE: President Donald Trump is seen as risky for the aerospace industry as Hillary Clinton was to drug manufacturers, according to a report from Citron Research.In Q4, Lockheed's aeronautics revenue, which includes F-35 sales, jumped 23% to $5.41 billion. That helped lift total Q4 sales 19% to $13.75 billion, better than views for $13.03 billion.Missiles and fire control revenue fell 10.8% to $1.76 billion. Rotary and mission systems revenue jumped 36.8% to $3.81 billion, helped by the Sikorsky acquisition. Space systems revenue climbed 16.7% to $2.78 billion.Adjusted EPS climbed 24% to $3.25, easily topping forecasts for $3.05.President Donald Trump has complained about the $400 billion F-35 program's costs and suggested it could face competition from Boeing's (BA) F/A-18 Super Hornet.But earlier this month Lockheed CEO Marillyn Hewson assured Trump that an upcoming contract for the next batch of F-35 fighters will create 1,800 jobs in Texas and thousands more across U.S. suppliers.Lockheed said it was near a deal for 90 additional F-35s that will ""significantly"" reduce the cost of the fighter.Hewson, along with other manufacturing company executives, met Monday with Trump, who vowed to slash income taxes and regulations and said companies that send operations aboard will get slapped with a border tax on items coming back to the U.S.Boeing also has come under fire from Trump over the costs of its new Air Force One program. The aerospace giant will announce quarterly results Wednesday.Raytheon (RTN) and Northrop Grumman are on tap to report Thursday and General Dymamics (GD) is scheduled for Friday.RELATED: Navy: Lockheed F-35 'On A Completely Different Level' Vs.

124,GD,"President Trump's budget request calls for a $54 billion increase in defense spending and will give the Defense Department latitude on where the extra money goes, according to a Reuters report, after earlier worries that the White House budget chief would be stingy with the Pentagon.OMB Director Mick Mulvaney was a fiscal hawk and sequester backer when he was in the House of Representatives, and the White House's budget proposal seeks offsetting budget cuts equal to the Defense Department boost in other areas of discretionary spending.But the proposal has more money allotted for ships and military aircraft to have ""a more robust presence in key international waterways and chokepoints,"" an official told Reuters.Lockheed Martin (LMT) shares rose 1.3% to 269.39 on the stock market today, nearing a 270 buy point from a cup base. Northrop Grumman (NOC) advanced 1.45% to 248.60, on its way to a 253.90 entry. Raytheon (RTN) picked up 0.9% to 154.82, still in buy range after breaking out last week. Boeing (BA) climbed 1.1%.General Dynamics (GD) advanced 0.4% and Huntington Ingalls (HII) 0.5%.IBD'S TAKE: Even if Trump ramps up defense spending analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.The increases in defense spending will be funded by cuts to the State Department, Environmental Protection Agency and other non-military agencies, according to the Reuters report, but won't include cuts from Social Security or Medicare, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Fox News Sunday.Additional specifics weren't available, though Trump could reveal some Tuesday night during his address to a joint session of Congress.During his campaign, he promised to increase the Navy's fleet by 78 ships to at least 350, and add at least 100 combat fighters to the Air Force. He also vowed to boost the Army's ranks by 60,000 and the Marine Corps' by 12,000.But it remains to be seen how the White House plans to balance increases in weapons procurement, which would send more money to the big defense contractors, with increases in personnel spending, which requires putting money in housing, chow halls, uniforms and medical care.The additional dollar on warplanes would come after Trump blasted high military aircraft costs and vowed to get a better deal on Lockheed's F-35 and suggested buying updated Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.RELATED:Trump: ObamaCare Repeal Before Tax Cuts, Vows 'Big' Infrastructure BoostTrump Silent On Ex-Im Bank, Hints At 'Big' Boeing Super Hornet OrderInfrastructure Stocks Jump As President Trump Vows To Spend 'Big'

"
126,GD,"Overall prospects are good for the defense industry in 2017 as President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to buy more warships and fighter jets, but analysts warn that a massive buildup on the scale of what was seen under President Ronald Reagan is unlikely.During his campaign, Trump said he would eliminate the ""sequester"" budget constraints on the Pentagon and increase spending. But after the election, Trump named Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a fiscal hawk and sequester backer, as the director of the Office of Management and Budget.""I'm very tempered in the kind of new money I would expect to see in any so-called buildup,"" and the defense industry should ""restrain expectations,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a national security analyst at the American Enterprise Institute.And despite Trump's aggressive campaign talk on defense, he has signaled reluctance to pay up, blasting the costs of Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program and Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. After his Twitter (TWTR) rants, top defense stocks gave up their postelection gains and haven't recovered.Wall Street expects Q4 numbers to show that growth at Lockheed, Northrop Grumman and Raytheon picked up in 2016, but it sees a slowdown in 2017, though that could change when the White House's plans become clearer.Analysts and investors will get their first look at Trump's spending priorities when he submits a defense supplemental budget request within his first 100 days. In the spring, the fiscal 2018 budget proposal comes out. And later in the year, the administration will lay out the Pentagon's next five-year plan.Trump has said he wants to grow the Army by 60,000 soldiers and the Marine Corps by 12,000 Marines as well as boost the Navy's fleet by 78 to 350 ships and add at least 100 combat aircraft at the Air Force.More troops mean the Pentagon will spend more on pay, health care, chow halls and housing. Those costs could crowd out demand for big-budget ground weapons, like a new armored vehicle to replace the Army's Bradley fighting vehicles and Abrams tanks, meaning limited upside for defense contractors hoping for lucrative deals.But targeting a certain fleet size means more Navy ships have to be ordered.Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, sees Trump adding more next-generation attack submarines, noting that the Virginia-class sub is already in serial production and should avoid Trump's ire.""They don't have the same problems that have been the subject of those tweets,"" Cancian told IBD. ""Those were programs that have had or have the prospects of significant cost increases.""But new Columbia-class ballistic-missile submarines could come under fire eventually, as their overall costs become more apparent, he added.General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII) are building the Virginia-class subs, while GD is the prime contractor for the Columbia-class ""boomers,"" which are in the design phase.IBD'S TAKE: The defense industry isn't the only one falling prey to Trump's tweet storms. Trump attacked General Motors for sending Mexican-made cars to U.S. dealers and threatened to levy big import taxes on cars built outside the U.S.Trump has also been a proponent of strengthening America's nuclear arsenal, tweeting last month that the U.S. ""must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability"" and called for an arms race as Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly looks for missiles that can evade countermeasures.So the ballistic-missile subs, along with Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 Raider, could be safe from attack, according to Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS Markit.Meanwhile, the Air Force's request for intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman system as well as Long-Range Standoff (LRSO) nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles will also likely be funded.""Those are probably the two programs that are on the edge, and my guess is that (Trump) would buy both of those, whereas a Democratic administration might not have,"" Cancian said.The estimated cost of the ICBM program is $62 billion over 30 years, but reports say the Air Force's estimate is billions of dollars short. The LRSO plan's cost has been estimated at $20 billion to $30 billion. Boeing, Raytheon, Northrop and Lockheed are expected to bid on the two programs, and initial contracts are expected to be awarded this year.Another Air Force priority is the F-35, and Trump's pledge to give the Air Force 100 more combat aircraft could help the program, despite his suggestion that Lockheed's orders may be reduced in favor of more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets.The Air Force is getting more than 70% of the Pentagon's total procurement of 2,443 F-35s, and it doesn't currently fly the Super Hornet, making it an unlikely addition to the service's fleet.The F-35 is also in production, and costs are already falling as output increases. IHS Markit's Bobbi said Trump will still likely fund the F-35 program after getting further price reductions.And flying under the radar is the Air Force's $16 billion T-X program for 350 trainer aircraft, which Boeing, Lockheed, Northrop and Raytheon are seeking. Bobbi said Trump ""has bigger fish to fry.""Israel is also buying the F-35 and recently increased its order amid a wider rebound in international defense spending as regional tensions in the Middle East, Asia and Europe intensify.Despite funding pressure from lower oil prices, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states will invest in more weapons systems as Iran is expected to update its arsenal. Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain already have F-15s and Super Hornets on order from Lockheed and Boeing.Cancian sees Japan and South Korea buying more missile defense systems from the U.S. as China adds military hardware to its man-made islands in the South China Seas and North Korea tests more nuclear warheads and missiles. South Korea plans to deploy Lockheed's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense anti-missile system later this year, and Japan is considering it as well.IHS Jane's expects defense investment in the Baltic states to double over the next two years and Western European spending to ""strengthen over the next decade"" on Trump's threats to pull out of NATO unless other members contributed more.""Defense spending returned to a healthy rate of growth in 2016, kicking off what we expect to be a decade of stronger global defense spending,"" said Fenella McGerty, principal analyst at IHS Jane's, in a release. ""Defense spending should recover to pre-financial-crisis levels by 2018.""RELATED: Battle Stations!

127,GD,"Ever since the U.S. presidential election, Ed Dahlberg has pretty much had a smile on his face.Dahlberg brokers the sale of private jets, and already he's seeing interest pick up and used-aircraft prices starting to firm up. The sale of a single-engine turboprop aircraft that he recently handled went for about 5% more than anticipated.""My phone is ringing off the hook"" from people interested in buying used jets, said Dahlberg, president of Emerald Aviation Inc. in Manassas, Va. ""Just the business climate feels like it's getting better.""The era of Donald Trump, a man long associated with conspicuous consumption, figures to be good to a whole range of luxury-goods industries. But perhaps nowhere is that excitement greater than in the private-aircraft business.Not only is Trump, whose personal Boeing 757 became an iconic campaign image, seen as someone who'll be an advocate for the industry but he replaces a president who so often criticized private-air travel that he turned it into a taboo symbol of inequality and helped prolong a sales slump of almost a decade.""You'll see more people not being gun shy or embarrassed or apologetic for operating a corporate jet,"" said Steve Varsano, founder of broker The Jet Business.Demand for private jets is far from the heady days of more than 1,000 deliveries in 2007 and 2008, before the recession hit. In 2016, manufacturers were set to ship 655 jets, according to a JPMorgan Chase estimate, lower than 689 in both 2014 and 2015 after an oil boom that had boosted sales among drillers went bust. Used jet prices have tumbled 12% since November 2015, the bank said.It's far too early to see any sales pickup, of course, and the industry buzz of a comeback is just that at the moment. But investors are encouraged. Shares of private jet manufacturers have soared on Trump's victory. Since Nov. 9, Textron (TXT) gained 19%, General Dynamics (GD) rose 12% and Bombardier Inc. jumped 22%. Aircraft sales amount to about 30% of their revenue.""The Trump win looks positive for (business) jet demand given the postelection stock surge, economic stimulus from an expected lower tax rate and less regulation, and shift away from Obama's anti-(business) jet rhetoric,"" Cai Von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen and Co., wrote in a report earlier this month.Alain Bellemare, chief executive officer of Canadian plane maker Bombardier, said in an interview that in Trump he sees ""somebody understanding the value of business aircraft and what it creates.""""Anybody who is pro-business, pro-growth, who will foster investment in infrastructure — it's all good for our business,"" he said. ""So I hear the tone now and I'm optimistic.""Most of the manufacturing jobs to produce corporate jets are in North America, Bellemare said. That fits in with Trump's theme of keeping factory workers in the U.S. Both Bombardier and Textron's Cessna unit make aircraft in Wichita, Kan. Gulfstream, the corporate jet unit of General Dynamics, has its factories in Savannah, Ga. Even Brazilian jet producer Embraer (ERJ) manufactures planes in Melbourne, Fla.Trade groups have long argued that private aircraft are business tools that help executives save time and make multicity visits they otherwise couldn't with commercial flights. For security, some companies mandate their top officers fly on the corporate plane.That message was lost when auto executives flew to Washington in their private planes to request bailout money in November 2008, sparking a backlash as the economy careened into recession. A call from a Treasury Department official in 2009 persuaded Citigroup (C), which was getting U.S. government rescue funds, to drop plans to take delivery of a $50 million Falcon 7X aircraft manufactured by Dassault Aviation (DASTY).In a 2011 press conference, Obama called out private jet owners six times to bash a tax break that allows corporate planes to be depreciated over five years instead of seven years for commercial airliners. The National Business Aviation Association sent the president a letter expressing ""disappointment with the way you mischaracterized and disparaged business aviation.""But that was then, as broker Dahlberg sees it.""I've noticed that while there's still a huge amount of inventory, people just don't keep dropping the price every week,"" he said. ""You can really feel the floor in the market right now.""

131,GD,"Boeing (BA) topped Q4 estimates Wednesday and offered upbeat guidance for the coming year as recent tax cuts unlock more investment, which could go toward developing a new passenger jet.X The aerospace giant expects to spend $3.7 billion on research and development in 2018, up from $3.2 billion last year, with capital investment expected to climb to $2.2 billion from $1.7 billion.On a conference call with analysts, CEO Dennis Muilenburg said tax reforms would increase Boeing's ability to invest in innovation as well as the underlying production and supply chain, ""solidifying the business case"" of the new midmarket plane.""If we launch, it would give us additional confidence,"" he added.But the company wouldn't say if it would make a decision on the new plane this year, saying it had a lot of time to do its research and the tax cut didn't change its project time frame of 2024-2025 to start deliveries if it decides to launch a new plane.Muilenburg also said that the decision on the new plane wasn't impacted by talks to acquire a major stake in Brazilian planemaker Embraer (ERJ). But sources earlier told Bloomberg that Boeing would get Embraer engineers' expertise to help jump-start the new midmarket plane.Boeing also said it would use tax savings for training and workplace investments, but it has no plans to increase hiring to make up for rounds of layoffs in recent years.Shares surged 4.9% to 354.27 on the stock market today, hitting a new all-time high. That gave a huge boost to the price-weighted Dow Jones industrial average.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.Boeing sees full year EPS of $13.80-$14, above consensus views for $12.07, on revenue of $96 billion-$98 billion, above consensus for $94.8 billion, reflecting commercial deliveries of 810-815 planes (up from 763 in 2017). Operating cash flow is expected to increase to $15 billion from $13.3 billion in 2017.During the company's conference call officials said that the outlook could be updated as the impact of tax reform is fully understood.For Q4, Boeing reported adjusted EPS of $4.80, including a $1.74 per-share benefit from tax cuts. That beat analysts' views for $2.91. Revenue climbed 9% to $25.37 billion, beating views for $24.83 billion.Commercial aircraft revenue grew 8% to $15.47 billion. Earlier, Boeing said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Net orders for 414 commercial planes were booked in Q4, with the backlog at more than 5,800 airplanes valued at $421 billion. The defense backlog was $50 billion, of which 40% represents orders from international customers. Total company backlog rose to $488 billion from $474 billion at the beginning of the quarter.Defense, space and security revenue rose 5% to $5.54 billion. Global services revenue jumped 14% to $4 billion.Boeing didn't record a charge with the troublesome KC-46 tanker for the Air Force this quarter, after racking up $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes in charges on the modified 767.Last week Gen. Carlton Everhart, the head of Air Mobility Command, told the Air Force Times that Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration could get final FAA certification for the KC-46 in the next 60-70 days.Defense contractors have had a positive earnings season overall. Lockheed Martin (LMT) beat earnings and revenue forecasts Monday and issued strong full-year guidance.Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and General Dynamics (GD) topped Q4 profit forecasts, though Raytheon and GD missed on revenue while Northrop beat and gave strong 2018 guidance.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Defense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry News

132,GD,"Boeing (BA) earnings and revenue are seen rising, and the aerospace giant could announce even bigger shareholder returns when it releases fourth-quarter results Wednesday.X Analysts expect per-share profit to climb 18% to $2.91, with revenue up 6.6% to $24.83 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research. Boeing has already said Q4 commercial aircraft deliveries rose to 209 from 185 a year ago as production rates on the 737 and 787 ramp up.Boeing's improving operational efficiency has lifted cash flow, and in October management raised its overall 2017 cash flow guidance to $12.5 billion from $12.25 billion.That has raised hopes for bigger shareholder returns, and investors were rewarded in December, when Boeing announced an $18 billion repurchase program and raised its dividend 20% to $1.71.Since then, the White House and Congress have enacted a steep cut in the corporate tax rate, providing companies with even more cash to potentially return to shareholders. Last week, Northrop Grumman (NOC) lifted its dividend and gave strong 2018 guidance.Boeing shares closed down 0.7% at 340.82 on the stock market today and are 3% off a record high set less than two weeks ago.IBD'S TAKE: Buying or holding a stock can be risky heading into an earnings report. Here's an earnings options strategy that can help you cash in on post-earnings stock gains, while minimizing the risk from a weak quarter.During the conference call with analysts, Boeing could give an update on takeover talks with Brazil's Embraer (ERJ) as it looks to stay competitive in the narrow-body market after Airbus (EADSY) took a majority stake in Bombardier's (BDRBF) struggling C-Series jets.Brazilian officials have come out against a Boeing takeover of Embraer as the company's defense unit is seen as a major sticking point in negotiations, and they suggested a joint venture. But Boeing is reportedly only interested in taking full control.And in a surprise turn of events, the U.S. International Trade Commission unanimously ruled against Boeing Friday in a trading dispute with Bombardier, blocking a Commerce Department decision to levy import duties of nearly 300% on C-Series jets. But the verdict can still be appealed by Boeing.Boeing could also give more details about a possible new mid-market jet that analysts have dubbed the ""797."" Last week, United Airlines (UAL) said it was waiting for more information about a new jet before it considered  other possibilities to replace its 757 and 767 planes as airlines look to open routes to smaller cities.Meanwhile, Boeing's KC-46 tanker for the Air Force has been a major headache for Boeing and has racked up charges of $2.9 billion before taxes and $1.9 billion after taxes on the modified 767. Boeing originally planned to deliver the first tankers by the end of 2017, but now the first one won't be delivered until the spring.Last week Gen.

133,GD,"First, President-elect Donald Trump took aim at Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement program, then he targeted Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 and suggested that the Pentagon might buy more Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornets instead.So what Pentagon program could be next to get the Trump treatment?Trump has said he would build up the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from its current 272, but the ramp-up would come at a high cost.Lockheed could be in Trump's crosshairs again. It is building the littoral combat ship, while a separate team made up of Australia's Austal and General Dynamics (GD) is building a different version of the LCS. The ships are designed to operate in coastal — or littoral — waters.The program is already coming under scrutiny, and earlier this month Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain blasted the Navy for spending $12.4 billion on 26 ships. The cost per ship has nearly doubled to $478 million, and key capabilities like mine countermeasures have been delayed.Trump must decide if the Navy will purchase 12 more of the ships for a total cost of $14 billion.Lockheed shares fell 0.5% at 249.56 on the stock market today. General Dynamics dipped 0.9%.Huntington Ingalls (HII) is currently building the USS John F. Kennedy, a second Ford-class aircraft carrier, with a projected cost of $11.35 billion.Among a list of options, the Congressional Budget Office said in a report earlier this month that the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers after the current ship is completedCanceling just one carrier would free up funds to buy less-expensive, smaller ships to achieve Trump's goal of boosting the size of the fleet.Huntington Ingalls shares were off 0.7%.Trump wants to build up America's nuclear arsenal, but that won't come cheaply either.The cost of Northrop Grumman's (NOC) B-21 bomber, which will replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, is a big question mark as the Air Force has declined to give specific figures, saying U.S. adversaries would be able to infer its capabilities.McCain has been critical of that approach, arguing that taxpayers deserve to know how much they are spending on the plane.The Air Force has put the development cost for the long range strike bomber at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars. Analysts estimate the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.Northrop shares edged 0.6% lower to 231.92.America's nuclear missiles are nearing the end of their life spans and need to be replaced.Over the summer, the Air Force released its requests for proposals for intercontinental ballistic missiles to replace Boeing's Minuteman system.The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" according to a Bloomberg report.The Air Force also needs Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace its Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. The program will likely come at a cost of $20 billion to $30 billion.RELATED: Here's Where Lockheed Could Lose F-35 Orders To Boeing F/A-18sAfter Trump's F-35 Blast, Here's The 'Good, The Bad And The Ugly'

The Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent's estimated cost is $62 billion over 30 years, but a report from the Pentagon's office of independent cost assessment said the Air Force's estimate is too low by ""billions of dollars,"" sources told Bloomberg.The Air Force is also seeking Long-Range Standoff nuclear cruise missiles to replace Boeing AGM-86B Air-Launched Cruise Missiles. That program's cost has been estimated at $20 billion-$30 billion.Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC), Raytheon (RTN) and Boeing (BA) are expected to bid on the two contracts, and initial contracts could be awarded next year.The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Last year, Northrop was awarded a contract to build the B-21 bomber that replaces the Cold War-era Boeing B-52s. The Air Force has put the development-phase cost for the B-21 at $23.5 billion, but analysts have estimated the total acquisition cost at up to $80 billion.The Navy's program to replace its Ohio-class submarines, which can launch nuclear missiles, will cost the service $100 billion.Lockheed shares closed down 1.3% on the stock market today. Northrop dipped 0.3%, Raytheon ended flat, and Boeing gained 0.2%. General Dynamics (GD) and Huntington Ingalls (HII), which build submarines, finished up 0.4% and down 0.5%, respectively.Trump's affirmation of U.S. nuclear capabilities comes a year after appearing to be stumped by a question on his priorities for the triad and follows recent criticism on the cost of Lockheed's $400 billion F-35 program and Boeing's Air Force One replacement planes.Late Thursday, Trump tweeted that he has asked Boeing to price out F/A-18 Super Hornets, citing the cost of Lockheed's F-35.
"
136,GD,"President Donald Trump said Monday that Lockheed Martin (LMT) has done a ""great job,"" agreeing to slash the F-35 fighter jet program's cost by $600 million.""I appreciate Lockheed Martin for being so responsive,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.The cost cuts will be for the next order of F-35 jets, Trump said, claiming that billions of dollars will be saved in contracts over time. Lockheed had already pledged to slash F-35 costs after years of delays and price overruns. It's unclear if Trump's touted savings are in line with Lockheed's pre-existing plans.Trump had harshly criticized the cost of the Lockheed F-35 and the Boeing (BA) contract for new Air Force One jets in a series of tweets and public comments since he was elected.On Friday, Defense Secretary James Mattis ordered a review of the F-35 and Air Force One contracts.Lockheed Martin fell 0.4% to 252.83 on the stock market today, as the major averages sold off.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.2%, while the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average moved up 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively.Among the Dow Jones industrials, General Electric (GE) reversed from early gains to fall 0.3% amid the company's better-than-expected earnings guidance.Elsewhere in the Dow, Apple (AAPL) gave up its 176.34 flat-base entry with a 0.9% decline in early morning trade. Shares have struggled to maintain altitude amid iPhone X demand concerns and the relative strength line has declined accordingly.IBD 50 leader Alibaba reclaimed its 191.85 cup-shaped base entry Tuesday and looked to extend its gain Wednesday with a 2.7% advance. The stock briefly topped the buy point on Jan. 9 before retreating back to its 50-day line where it found significant support.Rival JD.com (JD) was breaking out above a 47.50 cup-with-handle entry with an over-5% advance.Among companies reporting earnings, Texas Instruments (TXN) plunged over 5% after announcing a surprise tax charge in its Q4 earnings release. The stock is still well-extended from its most recent base — an 84.34 cup-with-handle entry — and about 9% above its 50-day line where it last found support in early December.Selling off in the wake of the earnings release were a number of leading chip names, like Lam Research (LRCX) and Applied Materials (AMAT). Lam fell about 1%, as it trades just off a potential 219.80 cup-shaped base buy point. While the relative strength line remains off its old highs, it has been drastically improving over the stock's recent six-day win streak.Applied Materials fell 1.6% and is also shaping a cup-shaped base that has a 60.99 entry.Meanwhile, defense leader General Dynamics (GD) reversed from heavy losses to advance over 3% and breakout after its Q4 revenue came in light vs. estimates.

140,GD,"Retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for defense secretary, may have to recuse himself for at least a year from decisions involving General Dynamics (GD) — the fifth-biggest U.S. defense supplier with $10 billion in contracts last year — after serving on its board.That would take Mattis out of the loop on billion-dollar decisions across the military services. For one, the Pentagon may buy ground-warfare vehicles from General Dynamics for the 65,000 Army troops Trump has promised to add. The company also may benefit from Trump's pledge to expand the Navy to 350 vessels by supplying its Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and Virginia-class nuclear submarines.Most immediately, General Dynamics is the lead contractor to build 12 of the new nuclear missile submarines to replace the aging Ohio class — the Navy's top-priority program. Unless current Secretary Ash Carter acts before departing, Mattis and his deputies may inherit a decision on letting the program enter full-scale development. They would also oversee a planned major increase in its funding in the fiscal 2018-2022 plan. A new draft Navy estimate sees procurement spending increasing to $2.8 billion in fiscal 2019 from $773 million this year.""Mattis will have to recuse himself for at least one year from any contracting issues dealing with the company"" under government ethics regulations in addition to shedding his General Dynamics holdings, Richard Painter, who was chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, said in an interview.As a General Dynamics director since August 2013, Mattis has received at least $276,000 in fees plus equity awards valued at more than $1.03 million as of Tuesday's close in New York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About half of those awards are scheduled to vest in the coming years only if Mattis stays on the board.The company's proxy filing didn't specify what happens to unvested awards given to directors who leave for a job in government. Lucy Ryan, a company spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the filing.The Trump transition office didn't respond to an e-mailed request for comment about how Mattis intends to handle potential conflicts of interest. Mattis, who retired after a 41-year career in the Marines, has yet to fill out the standard government financial disclosure statement and questionnaire required by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will hold the confirmation hearing on his nomination, so the full extent of his assets and holdings aren't known.Questions raised by Mattis's participation on the General Dynamics board ""are precisely the kinds of issues the committee must examine during the confirmation process,"" said Chip Unruh, a spokesman for Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the committee's top Democrat.While Mattis would be likely to adjust the Pentagon's budget proposal for fiscal 2018, which is already being crafted, he may have to step back from decisions such as policies and contracts directly affecting Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics.""We think he should recuse himself from decisions regarding General Dynamics for at least two years,"" said Mandy Smithberger, a director with the Project on Government Oversight, a defense watchdog organization. ""'Draining the swamp' has to start with the Pentagon,"" said Smithberger, invoking a Trump campaign slogan.Decisions on how Cabinet officials avoid or resolve potential conflicts of interest are reviewed and enforced by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, which can spell out requirements to divest assets, to refrain from making decisions that pose a conflict -- or both -- to meet requirements of regulations and law.A guidebook issued to nominees by the ethics office says ""the ethics rules prohibit you from participating as a government official in any particular matter involving specific parties if you have a 'covered relationship' with a party to the matter (or with the representative of a party), whenever a reasonable person would question your impartiality.""A ""covered relationship"" includes ""any organization in which you held a position in the past year or are currently serving as an 'active member,'"" according to the guide.Mattis is a respected figure on Capitol Hill, especially in the Senate Armed Services Committee, which will review the agreement he reaches with the ethics office, the White House and the Defense Department before voting on his nomination. Congress also will have to pass legislation exempting Mattis from a ban on serving as defense secretary within seven years of leaving the military.Under President Barack Obama, some administration officials have been permitted to retain their stock and benefits packages — even the use of corporate offices and travel services — while pledging in ethics agreements to recuse themselves from matters involving their prior employers.Top Pentagon officials often have followed stricter standards when holdings in defense industries are involved.When Deborah Lee James became secretary of the Air Force in 2013, she divested all her stock in defense contractor Science Applications International Corp., her prior employer. She took a pro-rated $150,000 payout on her unvested stock and forfeited the remainder. She pledged to avoid matters involving the company for two years, according to her ethics agreement.The last time a defense official's nomination was slowed over ethics questions was in 2009 with William J. Lynn's nomination to be the new Obama administration's deputy defense secretary. The Raytheon (RTN) executive was a registered lobbyist.Under pressure from Armed Services Committee member Ariz. Sen. John McCain, who's now chairman, Lynn agreed he wouldn't ask to participate in any decision involving six Raytheon programs on which he had served as lobbyist. He also agreed to divest restricted Raytheon stock valued at as much as $500,000 that didn't vest until late 2009 or 2010.""These kinds of situations are not uncommon for nominees at the most senior levels of the Department of Defense,"" said Dustin Walker, a spokesman for McCain. ""That is why the Armed Services Committee has policies in place to address them in the confirmation process.""

147,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) became the latest company to come under attack by President-elect Donald Trump, who criticized the defense giant's F-35 stealth fighter program for having ""out of control"" costs.It came a week after he vowed to cancel Boeing's (BA) Air Force One replacement planes, citing the cost.The cost to develop and build the F-35 is about $400 billion, and the program is perennially under fire for cost overruns and delays. The Pentagon is buying more than 2,400 F-35s for the Air Fore, Navy and Marine Corps, and U.S. allies will buy hundreds more.In a tweet Monday, Trump was hammered to program for escalating expenses.The F-35 program and cost is out of control. Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th.— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 12, 2016In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Trump reiterated his attack on Boeing and said the F-35's cost is ""out of control.""""We welcome the opportunity to address any questions the president-elect has about the program,"" said Jeff Babione, Lockheed's F-35 general manager, on Monday.He added that the company has reduced the price by more than 70% and predicted it will reach $85 million per plane by 2019-2020. In addition to the acquisition cost, Lockheed is also working on reducing the F-35's operating and sustainment costs, he said.Shares of Lockheed fell 2.4% to 253.23 on the stock market today, but rebounding from a low of 245.50 and closing above their 50-day average. Northrop Grumman (NOC), which is a major subcontractor on the F-35, retreated 2.7%, closing near session highs but just below its 50-day line. United Technologies (UTX), whose Pratt & Whitney unit makes the F-35's engines, reversed earlier losses to edge up 0.6% at 110.40, still in range from a buy point of 109.52 Boeing seesawed between gains and losses and ended 0.4% higher.Last Wednesday, Cowen & Co. warned that while Trump's Air Force One criticism likely won't hurt Boeing much, his habit of using Twitter (TWTR) as a bully pulpit could pose a bigger risk for Lockheed and Northrop.""This is in line with his campaign comment that he wants to boost defense spending but feels DoD could 'buy smarter,' "" Cowen said.

148,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT), Raytheon (RTN), General Dynamics (GD) and other defense stocks enjoyed a furious rally last week after the presidential election. Donald Trump had vowed to beef up military spending on the campaign trail, while lower corporate tax rates could also be a boon.Defense shares are holding steady or pulling back modestly in lighter volume. But that could offer new buying opportunities for investors. Keep in mind that new defense spending may not materialize. And if Pentagon spending does increase, that doesn't mean all defense firms, or stocks, will be winners.Lockheed Martin fell 7 cents to 263.28 on the stock market today after falling 1% to 263.35 Wednesday. Lockheed reversed from an all-time intraday high of 269.74 Tuesday.The defense giant, maker of the F-35 stealth fighter jet, closed at 267.24 on Monday, just above a 267.03 buy point in a cup-without-handle base. Such patterns can work, but the odds are less than cup bases with a handle. Handles offer an opportunity to shake out weak holders, so when the stock clears the pivot, big institutions have to bid up prices to get holders to part with their shares.Lockheed could be forming a handle, but that would need a few more days to develop. Until then, the 267.03 entry point holds.L3 Communications (LLL), like Lockheed, raced up to hit a buy point on Monday, though it didn't close above that 154.18 level. L3 fell 0.3% to 149.97 Thursday, its third straight modest decline. Like Lockheed, it could be working on a handle, but it's not ready yet.The maker of military communications and surveillance gear plunged 7.4% on Oct. 27 after its latest earnings report. Shares continued to slide to a low of 132.38 on Nov. 3, below the 200-day line. But L3 raced straight back up, spiking 12% last week.IBD'S TAKE: Bank stocks have been huge winners since the presidential election. They too are pulling back. But bank stock charts still look great.Raytheon fell 0.8% to 144.96, its third straight modest loss. It's still in buy range from a 143.49 entry point.Raytheon broke out on Nov. 9, after the presidential election, hitting a record 152.58 intraday before settling at a 7.5% gain to 146.71.Northrop Grumman dipped 0.3% to 244.66 Thursday after modest losses in the prior two sessions.Northrop broke past a 224.22 buy point on Oct. 27, following its earnings report. Shares then traded in a tight range before exploding following Trump's win, pushing the stock out of buy range. After a stock is more than 5% extended from the pivot, investors should avoid chasing it. But Northrop could pull back into range, which extends up to 235.43.General Dynamics edged down 0.1% to 165.63, its third straight modest decline. It's still slightly extended from buy range.General Dynamics gapped higher on Nov. 9, blasting above a 157.07 pivot from a short consolidation. The chase zone reaches to 164.92, so keep an eye on further pullbacks.Boeing (BA) fell 0.8% to 145.33, moving further into buying range after dipping barely into a proper entry zone on Wednesday. Boeing has a 139.55 buy point in a flat base, in range up to 146.53. Boeing cleared the entry point on Oct. 26 following Q3 earnings.Boeing remains focused mostly on civilian aircraft, but it's still a big Pentagon contractor.Here is a weekly chart:RELATED:Raytheon Launched Into Buy Range On Trump Win, Defense Stocks RallyLockheed, Northrop Price Targets HikedTrump Wants To Beef Up Military, But Funding Could Be The Enemy

U.S. diversified stock mutual funds jumped on board, advancing 1.70% on average, the 14th monthly gain in the past 15 months.XThe broad market got a lift from such leading stocks and Dow Jones Industrial stocks as Caterpillar (CAT), Apple (AAPL), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), 3M (MMM) and Intel (INTC).The October gain by U.S. diversified stock funds was due largely to ongoing global economic growth, increased odds of corporate tax reform with a possible lowering of the corporate tax rate, and increased likelihood of the Federal Reserve raising its short-term interest rate in the near term, said Jonathan Edwards, a manager of Invesco Value Opportunities Fund (VVOAX). The $839 million fund's 1.64% gain in October topped 69% of its large-cap value rivals tracked by Morningstar Direct.In addition, for the most part corporate earnings have been OK, said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. He added that a few individual companies logged disappointments, which helped mute investor sentiment. Sentiment was further dampened by infighting among Republican leadership. That reminded investors that corporate tax reform is not a sure thing, Samana said.With a 3.41% October gain, large-cap growth funds outpaced other U.S. diversified stock fund categories last month. Multi-cap growth funds averaged a 3.08% gain.Douglas Roman, manager of $92 million PNC Multi-Factor Large Cap Growth Fund (PEWAX), attributed outperformance by large-cap stock funds to strong economies in the U.S. and abroad. Large-cap companies are more likely to sell goods and services abroad as well as in the U.S. The PNC fund's 3.98% October gain outpaced 78% of its large-cap growth competitors.U.S. multinationals in particular got a tailwind from the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar vs. the euro, especially later in October, which helped U.S. exports, Roman said.Reflecting widespread global economic growth, world equity mutual funds rose 1.83% last month, topping the showing by U.S. diversified stock funds.India region funds led the way for foreign stock funds, jumping 5.89% last month.Global science and technology funds led the major sectors, rising 5.49% last month.General domestic taxable bond funds gained 0.29% on average in October. Loan participation funds' 0.56% return led all taxables in the month. Muni bond funds were about flat in October.The stock market got an additional lift from the hunt for a new chairperson of the Federal Reserve — who in November turned out to be current Fed Governor Jerome Powell. In October, investors appeared to welcome the prospect that the apparent leading contenders would keep the central bank on its current path of raising rates, said Charles Shriver, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2.3 billion Personal Strategy Balanced (TRPBX) and $295 million Global Allocation (RPGAX) funds. Balanced beat 87% of its allocation peer group in October. Global Allocation topped 62% of its direct rivals.Going forward, T. Rowe Price's Shriver likes foreign stocks in general more than U.S. equities. ""Fundamentals are positive, but valuations give us a little pause. We are underweight in areas whose valuations are a little more rich,"" he said.Among foreign stocks, ""Japan is an area where we see the cheapest valuations among developed markets.""IBD'S TAKE: Tokyo-based bank holding company Mitsubishi Ufj Financial Group was a top holding as of June 30 of $6.7 billion Matthews Asia Dividend Investor Fund (MAPIX), which is a diversified Pacific/Asia fund and an IBD 2017 Best Mutual Fund Awards winner. The stock edged up 4.4% last month. Earnings per share rose 20%, 44% and 55% the past three months after having declined for five stanzas in a row.On the other hand, lower U.S. corporate tax rates would benefit U.S. stocks, said Invesco's Edwards. ""That favors economically sensitive stocks as well as financials,"" he said.Holdings he likes for those reasons include LPL Financial (LPLA). ""They are one of the largest independent financial advisory firms,"" Edwards said. ""One hundred percent of their profits are from the U.S., so they would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate. And a significant part of their earnings are from interest on customers' cash balances. As interest rates go up, they would earn more on those balances.""He also cites SVB Financial Group (SIVB). ""They're a regional bank (mostly) in California, focused on the technology sector,"" he said. ""A lot of their loans are floating rate. As (the Fed raises) short-term rates, it would increase their net interest margin."" And the large portion of their profit that is based on U.S. revenue would benefit from a lower corporate tax rate.PNC's Roman is overweight in industrials, financials and consumer discretionary. He likes industrials because of the prospects for aerospace and defense firms. Financials should benefit from rate hikes. And he likes the diversity of consumer discretionary. ""From homebuilders to dollar stores, there's always some opportunities,"" he said.As of Sept. 30, among his top holdings were aerospace giant Boeing (BA) and defense contractors Northrop Grumman (NOC) and General Dynamics (GD).He likes auto parts, travel and home furnishings. Auto-parts maker Delphi Automotive (DLPH) was another holding. Smaller holdings included Wyndham Worldwide (WYN).RELATED:You Need This Much Retirement Income At Your Age And Income

153,GD,"Defense contractors and investors are celebrating Donald Trump's plan to boost weapons spending, but Pentagon budgeting experts say he's counting on savings that won't come true -- the old Washington saw of rooting out waste, fraud and abuse.""It's a fantasy,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said of the president-elect's campaign pledge to finance a more robust military partly by slashing bureaucracy and duplication at the Pentagon. Eaglen has briefed Trump's advisers.""I tried several times to disabuse them of the notion that this could ever pay for even a fraction of Trump's buildup costs,"" she said.As a candidate, Trump called for defense initiatives that analysts such as Eaglen say would add $55 billion to $80 billion annually to a spending request that totals $583 billion this year. Trump envisions a Navy with dozens more ships than the service has sought and an Army as big as the one President George W. Bush sent into Iraq and Afghanistan for full-scale invasions.Encouraged by those prospects, the S&P Aerospace & Defense index climbed 3.9% on Wednesday, outperforming the broader S&P 500, to the highest level since 1989. It was led by Raytheon (RTN), L-3 Communications Holdings (LLL), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and General Dynamics (GD). The index climbed an additional 2% Thursday.Fulfilling campaign promises is only part of the defense spending challenge facing the new president.There's an immediate issue: delivering on Trump's pledge to remove caps under the 2011 Budget Control Act that would constrain Pentagon spending over the next four years. President Barack Obama, backed by Democratic lawmakers, has resisted eliminating the defense caps unless those on domestic spending are eased as well.Howard Rubel, a defense analyst with Jefferies Inc., said in a note that ""the election appears to embolden fiscal conservatives and military hawks. The prospects for eliminating"" the caps ""jumps substantially. The problem is that domestic safety net-type spending may suffer"" and ""addressing the deficit may be an afterthought.""The caps, which have been temporarily modified three times, are due to return in fiscal 2018, the first budget of the new administration. Through 2021, the caps would force about $106.6 billion in Pentagon cuts if no agreement is reached and the automatic cuts known as sequestration kick in, including about $33 billion in fiscal 2018.Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, who is Trump's top defense adviser and is said to be a leading candidate for defense secretary, told Defense News last month that ""it is painful for me as a budget"" hawk ""to acknowledge that we can't stay at a sequester-like level. We are just not going to be able to do that.""Trump also faces pending weapons decisions such as whether to increase purchases of Lockheed's F-35, the Pentagon's costliest weapons system, to 70 in the fiscal 2018 budget from the 63 requested this year.And then there are long-term funding questions that require advanced planning, including how to cope with what the military calls a ""bow wave"" of spending after 2021. That includes the planned modernization of all three legs of the air-land-sea triad of nuclear arms, which Trump has endorsed.Trump's broad aspirations are clear. In April he said his ""administration will lead a free world that is properly armed and funded, and funded beautifully.""Among his promises were to increase the Army to 540,000 soldiers from about 475,000 today, reversing Obama's downsizing that would reduce the force to 450,000 in the next fiscal year. Trump also has vowed to ""build a Navy approaching 350 surface ships and submarines,"" up from about 272 today and the service's goal of 308 ships.For now, at least, the familiar -- and elusive -- Washington refrain of cutting ""waste, fraud and abuse,"" as President Ronald Reagan put it in the 1980s, remains the centerpiece of Trump's financing plan.His campaign website site used a variation on the Reagan theme, saying he would ""pay for this necessary rebuilding of our national defense by conducting a full audit of the Pentagon, eliminating incorrect payments, reducing duplicative bureaucracy, collecting unpaid taxes, and ending unwanted and unauthorized federal programs.""Eaglen, who has worked for Republican lawmakers and served in the Pentagon under Bush, said those are goals that should always be pursued but ""cannot yield $55 to $60 billion per year in new money to reinvest -- period.""""Some of Trump's ideas for a larger Navy, etc. will take a lot more money up front than any reform agenda"" can generate, Michael O'Hanlon, a defense and foreign policy fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail. ""Unambiguously, what he wants to do will take more money,"" said O'Hanlon, author of ""The $650 Billion Bargain: The Case For Modest Growth in America's Defense Budget.""Other passages in the Trump campaign statement ""seem to indicate he would raise revenues or cut other parts of government to pay for defense,"" Todd Harrison, a defense analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in an e-mail. ""That is much more realistic, but the devil is in the details and no details are provided.""But ""the idea that auditing the Pentagon is going to uncover billions of dollars of waste is a myth,"" he said.Dov Zakheim, who was Pentagon comptroller under Bush, said that while an audit ""will not save money per se,"" it can focus attention on needless bureaucracy.""Some 70,000 positions have been added since 1990,"" Zakheim said. ""Has DoD become more efficient as a result? I don't think so.""

157,GD,"The Navy is pushing for a multiship order of aircraft carriers to help reduce costs, but a debate remains over the need for such large warships as adversaries develop sophisticated weapons that put them at greater risk.XNavy Secretary Richard Spencer told the Wall Street Journal that shipbuilders suggested buying two aircraft carriers at a time when he asked industry how the service could reduce costs.Huntington Ingalls (HII), which was spun off from Northrop Grumman (NOC) in 2011, is the only prime contractor for aircraft carriers.""If we can tighten up our government-supplied equipment and have a very efficient hull build, we are starting to get savings that are very meaningful,"" Spencer said, though he didn't say how much could be saved.But critics are increasingly questioning the need for carriers, now that adversaries have weapons that could reduce their effectiveness.For example, China's DF-21D and longer-range DF-26 anti-ship ballistic missiles have been dubbed ""carrier killers."" Russia's Oscar II-class submarines are designed to counter carriers.The emergence of such weapons comes amid spiraling costs for carriers, which can now cost up to $13 billion each and may have to operate farther away from battles, stretching the effective range of the aircraft they carry.But Spencer told the Journal that the Navy still views carriers as a key element and has the technology to protect them.Currently, Congress only approves the purchase of one carrier at a time, but the Pentagon is pushing for other bulk orders to save money.Top defense officials are seeking a 440-plane order of Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 in the hopes that such a ""block buy"" will save up to $2 billion.Shares of Huntington Ingalls were down 8 cents at 234.81 on the stock market today. Lockheed shares rose 0.4% to 316.89, still in buy range after breaking out of a flat base with a 308.58 entry point last month. Northrop rose 0.2%, above buy range. General Dynamics (GD), which also makes Navy warships, advanced 0.7% and is still in buying territory.IBD'S TAKE: With thousands of publicly traded companies to choose from, how can you quickly find the best stocks to buy right now? A good starting point is to regularly review screens that highlight the top-rated equities.The debate over the aircraft carrier's long-term effectiveness comes as President Trump wants to expand the Navy's fleet to 350 ships from 275 today.Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said the Navy could save $21 billion from 2018 through 2026 if it stopped building new aircraft carriers. The money could be used to buy less-expensive, smaller ships.RELATED: President Trump, Republicans Still Face Defense Spending ShowdownDefense And Aerospace Stocks To Watch And Industry NewsStocks To Buy And Watch: Top IPOs, Big And Small Caps, Growth StocksLooking For The Best Stocks To Buy And Watch?

T-Mobile added 595,000 postpaid phone subscribers in the September quarter, while Sprint added 279,000.  AT&T (T) lost 97,000 as it reported flat profit and a 3% revenue drop. AT&T says it expects the $85 billion purchase of Time Warner (TWX) to close by year end. Some analysts say the sell-off in AT&T was related to equity dilution expected from the TWX deal. AT&T is issuing stock to finance half of the deal.

159,GD,"Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) could be big winners in Vietnam, as the U.S. fully lifts its arms embargo against its one-time enemy 41 years after the close of the Vietnam War. The country has been on an arms-buying spree amid tensions over China’s expansion in the South China Sea, and it is looking to reduce its reliance on Russian weapons in favor of U.S. and European alternatives. Vietnam is the world’s No. 8 arms importer, with sales jumping nearly 700% since 2005, Reuters reported, citing data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.Vietnam's military needs maritime patrol aircraft, such as used P-3Cs from Lockheed, as well as aerial refueling tankers like Boeing's new KC-46 -- which is facing cost overruns and development delays -- or Airbus' (EADSY) A330 MRTT, said Mark Bobbi, an aerospace, defense and security analyst at consultancy IHS.Other requirements include fighter jets, such as Lockheed's F-16 or Boeing's F/A-18 Super Hornet. Vietnam could also be interested in helicopters from Boeing and Lockheed’s Sikorsky division, in addition to precision-guidance munitions from Raytheon and Boeing.Hanoi is likewise interested in the littoral combat ship (LCS) but first needs to put its air capabilities in order, Bobbi said. The ship is smaller than most U.S. Navy vessels and is designed for missions close to shore. Lockheed and General Dynamics (GD) make separate versions of the LCS.All that represents a tall order for Vietnam, but Bobbi said the country's dynamic, high-growth economy should allow the military to pay for a major upgrade.""The question of affordability is not as big a deal in respect to Vietnam vs. other countries, again because of their strong growth,"" he said.Hanoi could make its first orders before the end of the year. While President Obama signed an order lifting the arms embargo, the White House must notify Congress of sales of certain weapons. Even then, Bobbi sees few opponents in Congress to approving such deals.The announcement came as Obama starts a three-day visit to Vietnam, with the move seen as the latest U.S. effort to try to contain China's advances in the South China Sea. But Obama denied China was a factor.“The decision to lift the ban was not based on China or any other considerations,” Obama said at a press conference in Hanoi. ""We’re going to continue to engage in the case-by-case evaluation of these sales. But what we do not have is a ban that is based on an ideological division between our two sides.""Meanwhile, demand from Asia more generally could help offset a slowdown in orders from Middle Eastern customers as oil prices remain depressed. U.S. defense contractors have targeted foreign sales after the Pentagon began reducing troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Lockheed wants foreign sales to account for 25% to 30% of total sales in coming years.On the commercial side, Boeing finalized an $11.3 billion order from VietJet Air on Monday. The carrier ordered 100 of Boeing's 737 Max 200 single-aisle airplanes, the largest order for a Vietnamese passenger carrier and one that will double VietJet’s fleet to over 200 planes. Deliveries are scheduled between 2019 and 2023.Obama also announced an agreement between General Electric's (GE) (GE) wind-energy unit and Vietnam to develop 1,000 megawatts of electricity.Boeing shares rose 0.15% on the stock market today. Lockheed dipped 0.2%, Raytheon edged 0.4% lower, General Dynamics lost 1.6%, and GE eased 0.2%.

166,GD,"Lockheed Martin’s (LMT) first-quarter revenue is seen rising, but international sales could take a hit on lower oil prices, and its new Sikorsky helicopter division may underperform.On Tuesday, the maker of the F-35 and F-16 fighter jets kicks off a busy week for defense contractors, with Northrop Grumman (NOC), General Dynamics (GD) and Raytheon (RTN) also on tap. Boeing (BA), which has substantial defense operations, reports Wednesday.Analysts see Lockheed reporting a 5.5% drop in EPS to $2.59, following a 5% drop in Q4. Revenue is seen rising 12.4% to $11.36 billion, helped by recent acquisitions.All eyes will be on the Sikorsky unit that Lockheed bought from United Technologies (UTX) last year. In a February SEC filing, Lockheed said that the business ""may underperform relative to our expectations” and that demand for helicopters and other products from the unit could be “adversely affected by global economic conditions, including oil and gas trends that are outside of its control.”At Lockheed's annual media day in March, CEO Marillyn Hewson said that the company is taking a more cautious tone on international sales to the Middle East and others dependent on oil prices. In the Q4 earnings conference call, Hewson said that plunging oil prices haven’t affected weapon sales to the Middle East and that countries heavily dependent on oil exports are cutting back in other areas.Lockheed may also give an update on the progress of getting a deal with the Pentagon on lots nine and ten for the F-35.On Friday, a Lockheed spokesperson told the Washington Post that the company would lay off ""less than 200"" workers in its IT division. The cuts come after the company said in November that it would lay off 500 employees as it divests the unit as part of its deal with Leidos (LDOS) to focus on its aircraft and weapons units.Lockheed shares rose fractionally on the stock market Friday, up 0.3% to 226.81. The stock has been moving sideways for the past two weeks, less than 1% below a 228.01 buy point in a consolidation going back to late November.Northrop Grumman results are on tap for Wednesday. The Global Hawk maker’s EPS is seen climbing 3.3% to $2.49, but revenue is expected to dip 0.5% to $5.93 billion. Congress is pushing the Pentagon to buy even more of Northrop’s B-21 bombers. Northrop Grumman shares broke to a new high in weak volume late last month but remain in buy range.General Dynamics will also announce results Wednesday. Analysts see EPS edged up 0.9% to $1.26 and revenue down 1.2% to $7.69 billion. General Dynamics stock rose fractionally Friday but has been trading below its 200-day line since early December.Raytheon rounds out the week on Thursday.  Analysts expect the maker of the Tomahawk cruise missile to report a 23% drop in EPS to $1.38 but revenue is seen climbing 3.2% to $5.46 billion. Shares are trading about 3% below their Dec. 17 peak of 129.99.

167,GD,"Headlines haven't been kind to Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35. ""America's Most Expensive Fighter Jet is Also Its Worst,"" Maxim wrote. ""Report: The F-35’s Pilot Eject System Could KILL You And Definitely Will Maim You,"" according to the Daily Caller. ""The Pentagon's Official F-35 Bug List is Terrifying,"" said ExtremeTech.Government reports of the $400 billion program have also been scathing. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain is a major critic, and Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said he'd consider dropping the program if he gets elected.But a Marine pilot who has been flying the F-35 for nearly four years feels differently, even if some bugs still need to be worked out.""I love the airplane, and it's great to be flying something that's newer,"" Maj. Brendan Walsh told IBD.He previously flew F/A-18C Hornets, which debuted in the 1980s, but he's now flying a so-called fifth-generation fighter with stealth technology.""Even in today's battlefield and even with what some people call immaturities on the F-35, I would hands down rather be in an F-35 than an F-18 in just about any situation,"" Walsh said.The Marine Corps declared the F-35B variant combat ready in July, and Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 121, the ""Green Knights,"" became the first squadron to become operational with an F-35.Since then, the Marines have been preparing for the F-35's first deployment to Iwakuni, Japan, next year.A short, expeditionary runway comprised of metal sheets was used at a Marine Corps base in Twentynine Palms, Calif., to practice short take-offs and vertical landings (STOVL).""The STOVL is awesome,"" said Walsh, who is the operations officer for the Green Knights. ""We can deploy fifth-generation platforms in decentralized areas that make it hard for the enemy to target.""The F-35 has come a long way since Walsh started flying it four years ago. For example, it now takes Walsh eight minutes to hit the runway for take-off, comparable to the F/A-18, and down from two hours when he first started flying the new jet.He is also impressed with the F-35's stealth, among other features, and is confident that even more advanced capabilities will come later.""The radar has performed well, the surveillance systems and electronic surveillance systems have performed very well, even in this configuration of the airplane, and they are only going to get better,"" Walsh said.But while Walsh prefers the F-35 over his old jet, a dogfight in the new aircraft could be problematic.Last year, the military blog War Is Boring reported that an older General Dynamics (GD) F-16 outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air-combat test, setting off a firestorm of criticism.But the Pentagon has since said the F-35 wasn’t equipped with its full array of avionics, helmet mounted display or compete stealth coatings. It also is trying to downplay dogfighting, saying that's not the F-35's main mission.Another fifth-generation stealth fighter, Lockheed's F-22 Raptor, was designated primarily as an air superiority fighter. But it was canceled less than halfway into its production run as costs soared, leaving the Air Force with only 187 operational planes.The F-35, which will have three versions for the Air Force, Navy and Marines, is seen as a multirole fighter, with production expected to hit 2,443 for the U.S. services and more than 900 for international customers.Meanwhile, China has been developing the J-31 fighter, which is believed to be made from stolen F-35 plans, and a new long-range air-to-air missile. Russia also has been expanding its radar and weapons capabilities.But given its advanced features, Walsh doesn't see the F-35 doing much turning and burning against other fighters. “If you’re in a dogfight in this airplane, you did something wrong, because you should have killed everyone way before you got there.""Still, he said, there have been “better performances recently” in dogfighting match-ups, based on what he's heard from operational testers, and those tests are still ongoing.Other issues continue to hang over the F-35 program. Last month, at a House Appropriations Committee hearing, Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert Neller said that he has “concerns about where the software was"" and wanted Lockheed to hurry up with fixes.The Pentagon's chief weapons tester has pointed out glitches in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues.Walsh's squadron tested the troublesome system, considered the ""brains"" of the F-35, in December, and it set up the complex server in a remote area in Twentynine Palms.""I have full confidence that we can deploy the server and go somewhere if we have to,"" Walsh said. ""I had no issues with it from a pilot's point of view, getting into the system and signing for the aircraft and screening it as appropriate for flight.""An evaluation of the ejection system also found that it's possible lightweight pilots could break their necks while ejecting. A fix is in the works, and Deputy Defense Secretary Bob Work recently said he is confident ejection issues with lightweight pilots will be resolved. Also, until a software upgrade next year, the F-35 can't fire its 25 mm cannon.But the evaluation of one warfighter who would fly the F-35 into combat is clear: ""I feel way more survivable and way more lethal in the majority of mission sets in this airplane than with anything the Marine Corps has in the air right now,"" Walsh said.

From a technical perspective the markets continue to hover in highly overbought territory - if you look closely at the indexes you will see that there is a technical weakening occurring across the broad number of issues despite prices mostly going sideways in April. We can credit the efforts by the FED as we headed into tax season and the April FOMC meeting – especially coming off a disastrous beginning to the 2016 year...now while the 1Q may have been a bit overdone to the downside - this 'forced' rally has clearly taken us well beyond on the upside as well.....which is why we keep struggling at 2100 on the S&P.After yesterday's key earnings disappointments and continued weaker eco data - a Hawkish FOMC speech will be the catalyst the mkt needs to back off.....how can anyone really expect the mkt to surge higher on a hawkish speech in light of all the negative data points? So clearly then, a Dovish speech will cause the algo's to hit the BUY button - sending the mkts higher - but will it change the psychology.....because in the end - a dovish speech at this point in the game (7 yrs) should not be taken as a positive at all...... Tomorrow brings us 1Q GDP and the estimates are all over the place - with some suggesting a negative print while the majority see a barely positive print. Either way - it is NOT suggestive of a strong, robust economy just yet.As noted - yesterday's Durable Goods report was a fairly large disappointment - now while it was positive - it was below expectations while Durable Goods EX transports missed miserably - coming in at -0.2% vs the expected +0.5%.Today's eco data includes Mortgage Apps - reported at -4.1%, Pending Home Sales exp at +0.5% and the big decision at 2 pm. Earnings include BHI, BA, GD, GT, IPP, GCI to name a few...but expect that much of the conversation will be all about Apple.....as nearly every station will be tearing the results apart as they try to connect the dots around the world..... Apple is currently trading down 8 pts or 7.5% at $96.50....it has clearly broken all major support and will have to work hard to hold the line.....US futures are now down 5 pts - while we still remain in the 2080/2100 trading range....now while individual names will get clobbered today.....and the Nasdaq may come under more pressure - both the Dow and the S&P will be less affected. It does not feel like a disaster is looming at all....but as the day progresses - and the speculation builds over what Janet will do - watch as the mkts react.....if they hold steady then expect speech B.....which is exactly what I expect we will hear. That being said - buyers will defend the position - because in the end - has anything really changed? ...None of the headlines are really new.....most of what we are seeing have been the expectations all along.....and we continue to live in La, La land.....Overnight in Asia - mkts all lower - but there was not the Apple implosion that so many expected.....the word is that investors there are much more interested in the comments by the FED as well as the BoJ and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand due out tomorrow. Japan -0.36%, Hong Kong -0.21%, China -0.37% and ASX -0.63%.European mkts are bucking the trend...all in slightly positive territory - seemingly unfazed by the Apple earnings at all.....Banks rallying on the back of some positive forward guidance coming from Barclays. Oil moving higher +1.7% - has now broken thru resistance at $44.23/barrel - paving the way for a surge to the psychological $50 number.

177,GD,"After acting like it yearned for a Hillary Clinton victory in the weeks leading up to the election, the stock market appeared to relish Donald Trump's presidential victory. And investors boosted sectors and some stocks that could benefit from Trump presidential priorities. Are these also plays you should consider?Energy, health care, financial services and infrastructure appear to be key sectors positioned to post gains under a Trump administration, Bob Doll, chief equity strategist for Nuveen Asset Management, told investors in an election post-mortem report.

178,GD,"Stocks retreated on Tuesday during a session dominated by heavy selling in the homebuilding sector. The action indicated a continued shift in stock sector strategy among institutional players as interest rates look set to rise a little more by the end of the year.Gold mining, metal ore and coal shares rebounded some. In the government bond markets, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held firm at 1.765%, virtually flat vs. Monday, according to real-time data provided by Tradeweb. That's up from a low of 1.37% seen in early July.The Nasdaq composite fell 0.5%, while the S&P 500 sank 0.4% and the Dow Jones industrials eased 0.3%. Small caps got hurt more as the Russell 2000 dropped more than 0.8%. The S&P SmallCap 600 fell 1%.Sherwin-Williams (SHW) gapped down more than 10% to 247.59 as volume ballooned to nearly 6 million shares, easily the heaviest turnover so far this year. The paint giant posted a 7% rise in earnings per share to $4.23 a share, the smallest increase in 11 quarters and missing the Thomson Reuters consensus view of $4.32.In March, Sherwin announced a $13 billion all-cash deal to buy rival Valspar (VAL).Sherwin shares have struggled since its July breakout past a 309.10 buy point failed to make much headway. On July 21, shares, gapped down hard on second-quarter results, falling more than 7% from the proper entry and triggering a sell signal. The stock also undercut the 50-day moving average, a sign of weakness.Air conditioning, wood product and building product companies also led the market's downside. Ship transport, apparel manufacturing, restaurant, medical research equipment and medical software stocks also sold off.On the upside, defense stocks rallied on the back of positive results from fighter jet and battle systems supplier Lockheed Martin (LMT). Shares bolted more than 7% to 249.26 and crossed back above the key 50-day moving average in turnover that expanded 33% above average.Lockheed reported a remarkable 30% rise in Q3 profit $3.61 a share, thumping Wall Street's consensus forecast of $2.88, as sales increased 15%, marking the third quarter in a row of double-digit top-line growth. In the third quarter of 2015, earnings were flat. After-tax margin improved to 9.4%, up 190 basis points vs. a year ago.Lockheed is now trading just 6% below a 266.93 all-time high, increasing the possibility for a new base to form.Industry peer Raytheon (RTN) rose more than 2% to 139.75, hopping back its 50-day line. The missile maker is slated to report Q3 results on Thursday. The Street sees earnings up 12% to $1.66 a share, following profit gains in two of the three prior quarters.Boeing (BA) rallied more than 1% to 139.02 in volume surging 65% above typical levels and reached its highest price level since July 27. That gain placed the Dow 30 component within arm's reach of a potential breakout from a 139.55 early buy point.Boeing has been forming a first-stage base since late February of 2015. As seen on its IBD chart, the relative strength line (painted in blue) has climbed sharply in recent weeks, meaning that it's outpacing the S&P 500. The aircraft giant is slated to post Q3 results on Wednesday; the Street sees earnings rising 6% to $2.62 a share despite an 8.5% dip in revenue to $23.64 billion.General Dynamics (GD) rose nearly 0.8% to 152.59 in fast turnover to climb back barely above its 50-day moving average. The stock is within buy range, less than 4% above a 147.26 shallow saucer entry point. The saucer could also be interpreted as the long handle of a gigantic saucer base. In either case, the buy point remains the same.Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL) gained 0.5% to 118.25 in the regular session but fell nearly 3% to around 114.75 in after-hours trade following mixed fiscal Q4 results. Earnings barely edged Wall Street views by 2 cents but still fell nearly 15% to $1.67 a share as revenue of $46.9 billion practically met the consensus forecast and slipped 9%.The results marked a third quarter in a row of slumping profits. However, CEO Tim Cook noted in a news release that Apple's service business revenue saw a 24% jump to an all-time record.Apple CFO Luca Maestri noted that the company returned $9.3 billion to shareholders through cash dividends and share buybacks during the quarter. Apple also declared a quarterly cash payout of 57 cents a share, payable Nov. 10 to holders of record on Nov. 7. The quarterly payout was unchanged, leaving the annualized yield as of Tuesday's closing price at 1.9% vs. 2.09% for the S&P 500 as of Monday's closing price.Apple has recently triggered a second buy point at 116.28, 10 cents above a recent new handle on a long cup pattern. The new handle began forming on Sept. 19. On Sept. 14, Apple staged a fresh breakout from a bottoming-style base with a strong gain past 110.33.RELATED:Lockheed Martin Soars On Bullish OutlookWhen Did Apple Break Out?Why Are Many Stocks Forming Bottoming Base Patterns These Days?Apple Delivers Mixed Fourth Quarter, But Guides Q1 Sales Higher

182,GD,"The stock market closed lower as the Dow Jones industrial average snapped its nine-session winning streak.The Dow fell 0.2%. It was the longest win streak since a July-August stretch. The S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Nasdaq composite 0.5%. Weakness in solar energy, some software, fiber optics and smaller retailers contributed to the Nasdaq's drop.XVolume was lower from Wednesday's totals, according to early figures.The day's breakouts included several industrial giants, although weak volume made some questionable.General Dynamics (GD) edged past the 206 entry of a flat base, but the price gain of less than 1% and light volume made the move to new highs suspicious.Union Pacific (UNP) cleared the 115.25 buy point of a 21-week base. Volume was about one-third less than average, and the the past couple of breakouts have not engendered big price gains for the rail company.Honeywell (HON) broke out of a flat base, rising past its 140.31 buy point. Volume was more than 50% higher than usual, a robust increase.Meanwhile, a buyout in the building materials industry caused ripple effects in that sector.Ireland-based CRH (CRH) agreed to acquire privately-held Ash Grove Cement in a $3.5 billion deal. The news seemed to fan hopes for more mergers in the field.U.S. Concrete (USCR) rose more than 1% in above-average volume. Interface (TILE) broke out past a 21.15 buy point but volume was unimpressive for the flooring tile company.The most notable loser in big volume was Nvidia (NVDA). Shares gapped down in active trading, but the stock held above its 174.66 buy point from last week's breakout. The chip company's stock faces a difficult task of advancing from a late-stage base, but outstanding companies with superior fundamentals like Nvidia sometimes can make longer advances than normal.Nvidia slid after a report that Tesla (TSLA) is working with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) on new chips for autonomous driving, an area in which Nvidia does business.RELATED:Nvidia Stock Shaken On Report Tesla Is Developing Chips With AMDBig Cement Deal Sparks Group As Top Stock Breaks Out

185,GD,"Honeywell (HON) fell sharply Friday after the aerospace and building systems industrial giant cut profit and sales forecasts, citing weaker business jet and general aviation shipments.Honeywell warned late Thursday that it sees full-year earnings per share of $6.60-$6.64, down from its prior forecast of $6.60-$6.70. It now sees core organic sales down 1%-2% vs. the prior target for a 1% decline.Slumps in emerging markets and the oil industry have crimped demand for business aircraft and helicopters, CEO Dave Cote said on a Friday morning conference call. Aerospace sales fell 6% to $3.6 billion in Q3, with Honeywell expecting weakness continuing into 2017.Demand for hand-held scanners from logistics firms also hasn't been strong, Honeywell said.Honeywell plunged 7.5% to close at 106.94 Friday, crashing below its 200-day moving average and hitting a seven-month low of 105.25 intraday.IBD'S TAKE: There's aerospace and then there's space.

But there are several sectors and specific industry groups that are faring well, with Dow components Boeing (BA), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) in or near buy zones.IBD'S TAKE: Don't rely on market pundits telling you where they think the market is heading next year. Listen to what the market is saying right by following the major market averages and leading stocks. Read IBD's Stock Market Today columns throughout the market day, and the end-of-day The Big Picture (open access through Oct. 8) for timely analysis.Facebook had been trading tightly in a flat base just below a buy point. But shares fell 4.5% to 162.87 on Monday in heavy volume, tumbling below their 50-day moving average and undercutting the low of their current consolidation. Tesla extended its post-breakout reversal to more than 7% below its 370.10 entry — and through its 50-day to boot — making that buy point invalid. Nvidia round-tripped a 9.5% gain from a buy point, sinking 4.5% to 171, below the 174.66 entry. Apple fell 0.9% to 150.55, following a 5% sell-off last week.Facebook, Tesla and Apple shares did rise a fraction in premarket trading Tuesday. Nvidia climbed nearly 3% after announcing late Monday that it will supply AI-focused chips to several Chinese cloud-computing and server firms.Oil and gas groups and stocks continue to rack up big and steady gains, as crude oil prices have rebounded to their best levels since April.Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) and Valero (VLO) have cleared buy points, while BP (BP) and the Dow's Chevron are close.The key question for these stocks and the broader sector is whether oil and other energy prices keep rising — and when and how quickly shale operators ramp up their production.U.S. crude futures dipped 0.4% in premarket trading to $52 a barrel.Despite Tesla's recent reversal, the broad transportation sector is healthy, from shipping giants FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS) to General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) to trucking firms J.B. Hunt Transport (JBHT) and Old Dominion Freight Line (ODFL) to auto- and truck-parts firms such as Dana (DCN) and Lear (LEA) to RV makers Winnebago (WGO) and Thor Industries (THO).Focusing on single-industry success stories, IBD's Aerospace/Defense group is faring well.

190,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) stock fell below its 50-day line Tuesday, continuing a week-long slide as its Leidos exchange price finalized, and as several defense stocks faced key technical tests.Lockheed shares fell 1.75% to 249.75 on the stock market today, dropping below the 50-day moving average after finding support at that level over the past six months. Shares are still above a 245.47 buy point from a base-on-base pattern cleared at the end of June, but Tuesday's heavy-volume slide through the 50-day line raises concerns.The defense contractor closed its $4.6 billion deal to sell its IT business to Leidos (LDOS), making Leidos the largest IT provider for the federal government. The deal was announced in January, but the companies faced regulatory issues.Leidos shares dipped 0.7% to 40.08 Tuesday.However, Lockheed has been making gains in its aerospace and missile sectors.Earlier this month, the Air Force declared its version of Lockheed's F-35 fighter ready for combat. The service eventually plans to procure 1,763 F-35As. In July 2015, the F-35B variant was declared combat-ready by the Marines and was set for deployment to Japan in 2017. The Navy's version, the F-35C, is expected to be combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.Lockheed and rivals Northrop Grumman (NOC) and Boeing (BA) are among potential contractors for the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) intercontinental ballistic missile system to replace Boeing's aging Minuteman missiles.Northrop shares were down 1.7% to 214.50. The stock has been trading up and down from its 50-day line in recent weeks, but fell Tuesday to its lowest level since June 28. Northrop is below a 218.94 buy point after breaking out of a flat base in June.IBD'S TAKE: Lockheed, Northrop and other defense giants have come out of bases and moved into or near buy range. Learn how to read the different types of bases and other chart patterns at IBD University. In October, Northrop won a contract to build new strategic bombers to replace Cold War-era Boeing B-52s, beating a Boeing-Lockheed team. The bomber deal is estimated to be worth $50 billion-$80 billion.Boeing hasn't fared as well as its peers in the aerospace and defense sector, as slowing demand for commercial planes has weighed on the stock.But Boeing is busy on the defense side, not just with the missile deal, but also by submitting a bid for the Air Force's new $8 billion-$10 billion T-X trainer program to replace the Air Force's 500 Northrop T-38 jets. Northrop, Lockheed and Raytheon (RTN) are also submitting bids.Boeing is also eyeing rotor contracts as the Army looks to replace its Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk, Boeing AH-64 Apache and CH-47 Chinook, and Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters.Boeing shares fell 0.6% to 134.14 Tuesday, well off their February 2015 peak but modestly above the 50-day and 200-day lines.Raytheon broke out of a flat base in April and has been trading above its buy range since late July. Shares were off 1% to 141.18 but are near highs and holding above their 50-day line.General Dynamics (GD), once considered a laggard in the group, hit a new high of 153.80 on Aug. 15.

It was Apple's second straight declines in earnings, revenue and iPhone sales -- but they were still better than expected.

But it's only rated No. 4 in IBD's Retail-Internet group. To see who's No. 1, go to IBD Stock Checkup. Facebook reported Q2 revenue of $6.43 billion, up 59% and maintaining a streak of double-digit growth going back more than four years. EPS jumped 94% to 97 cents, shattering consensus for 82 cents. It was the fourth straight quarter of accelerating earnings growth. Facebook stock rose 2.4% to 123.94, hitting a record high and still within range of a 121.18 buy point.Twitter (TWTR) reported Q2 EPS that topped views. But revenue fell short, and Q3 revenue guidance also missed estimates. Twitter stock fell 9.4% but closed the week above its 50-day line.Bouncing back from a Q1 miss, Alphabet reported Q2 EPS and revenue that blew past expectations. The Google parent's earnings minus items rose 20% to $8.42 a share. Total revenue climbed 21% to $21.5 billion. Despite Google's size, it's still delivering growth, says Mark Mahaney, analyst at RBC Capital.

193,GD,"As the Air Force readies 60-year-old B-52 bombers to prosecute the war against the Islamic State, a separate air war is looming over Congress amid opposition to the Pentagon's acquisition strategy for the B-21 bomber, which is supposed to replace the aging aircraft.Six years after an earlier attempt to update the bomber fleet was canceled due to high costs, the Defense Department awarded Northrop Grumman (NOC) the B-21 contract in October. Work was held up by a protest from the losing Boeing (BA)-Lockheed Martin (LMT) team, but the Government Accountability Office rejected it last month.Now the B-21, which could cost $50 billion-$80 billion, is taking flak from lawmakers over the Pentagon's use of a contract that leaves taxpayers on the hook for any cost overruns for the initial phase.“I remain seriously concerned about the acquisition strategy for the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber, especially the use of a cost-plus contract for the development of this aircraft,” said Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, at a hearing earlier this month.When asked if he would use the defense authorization bill to block the contract, a McCain spokeswoman said the senator would ""consider his legislative options.""Cost-plus contracts have been used for programs -- like Lockheed's F-22 and F-35 as well as Northrop's B-2 -- that are now known for sky-high price tags. Production on the F-22 and B-2 ended early, due in part to ballooning costs.Despite McCain's concerns, the Air Force is moving ahead with its latest stealth weapon. Lt. Gen. Arnold Bunch, military deputy in Air Force acquisition, said last week that the service decided to use a cost-plus contract for development because of risks associated with building a completely new airframe.The options for the first five production lots, which include 21 aircraft, are fixed price, meaning the contractor absorbs additional costs.But Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said there are also risks with using fixed-price contracts.General Dynamics’ (GD) F-111 attack aircraft, Boeing's C-17 transport aircraft, and Lockheed's C-5 transport plane were all fixed-price contracts that went well over budget, he said. The government then has no choice but to help out the industrial base or risk a ripple of bankruptcies from various suppliers, he added, drawing a comparison to the auto bailout.""Almost without an expectation, the government has had to pay extra,"" Hunter said of planes bought at fixed prices. ""The government has the decision to cancel the program and get nothing, or pay more to actually get the airplane.""Critics of the cost-plus contract point to Boeing's KC-46 refueling tanker, which is under a fixed-price contract. The aerospace giant has assumed over $800 million in after-tax charges on the plane due to higher-than-estimated engineering and manufacturing costs.But the Air Force's Bunch cautioned against comparing the B-21 with the tanker, pointing out that the KC-46 is a derivative of a commercial plane, Boeing's 767, and has potential for foreign sales. The B-21 has no commercial version and no prospects at this time for international sales to allies, he said.And while the B-21 will use mature technology, there are still risks from integrating the technology into a new plane, Bunch added.McCain also has issues with the Air Force not disclosing the full price of the bomber, though it puts the development cost at $23.5 billion and the per-plane cost at $564 million in 2016 dollars.""Why would you not want to tell the American people how you are going to spend their dollars?"" he asked March 8.The Air Force countered by saying it doesn't want enemies inferring the plane's capabilities based on price.But the B-21 isn't so secret that the Air Force can't disclose the identities of top subcontractors, who can help build more political support among lawmakers seeking Pentagon spending for their states and districts.They include United Technologies’ (UTX) Pratt & Whitney, BAE Systems and Rockwell Collins (COL).Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., a member of the Senate’s Appropriations Committee, said last week that he was pleased that the engines would be built at a factory in his home state, and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., who is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, echoed his sentiments.McCain's House counterpart, Rep. Mac Thornberry, R-Texas, told reporters earlier this month that he would like to see more mature technology on big-ticket programs, lowering the risk and need for cost-plus contracts. But he didn't voice a stance on the B-21 contract.Air Force Secretary Deborah James said the service will continue to “communicate” with Congress about the contract, as the B-21 “is a capability we need for the country.” The Air Force estimates an initial operational capability in the mid-2020s.While the B-2 is a stealth plane, it still lights up radars on Capitol Hill and in the Pentagon, as it looms over the latest bomber contract. Considered a poster child for Pentagon overspending, only 21 B-2s were built at a cost of more than $2 billion each.But James said she's learned from the B-2's failures, and the Air Force is taking a different approach with the B-21 this time.“The B-2 remained in the shadows for too long,"" she said. ""Too many details remained classified too long.""

194,GD,"Fourth-quarter earnings for General Dynamics (GD) topped views, though sales missed, and the defense contractor vowed to use available cash for buybacks and dividends.Earnings per share rose 9.6% from a year earlier to $2.40, topping views by 2 cents.

The spending commitments will swell budgets that had already begun to revive amid heightened tensions with Russia following last year's annexation of Crimea, with Britain committing in August to spending 2% of GDP on defense.""Over the 2015-2019 period, an extra $50 billion will be added to Western European defense spending as a result of changes implemented this year,"" said Fenella McGerty, senior analyst for defense budgets at IHS Jane's.There'll be an $11 billion uplift this year, she said, driven by adjustments in France, Germany and the U.K. that began with the Jan. 7 assault on the Paris offices of French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.The most immediate response to this month's attacks saw France join air strikes against ISIS positions in Syria, with bombing sorties led by Dassault's Rafales, further burnishing the combat credentials of a warplane that's enjoyed a string of overseas order successes after deployment in Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq, Mali and the Central African Republic since 2007.Britain may follow suit, extending its anti-ISIS campaign from Iraq to Syria.Britain will take all 138 Lockheed Martin (LMT) F-35 fighters initially ordered and triple the pace of deliveries to 2023, allowing deployment of two new aircraft carriers with a full roster of planes.Britain Prime Minister David Cameron reiterated a commitment to an Anglo-French venture for the development of military drones.U.S. companies stand to benefit from Europe's rearmament, with two of three major new spending commitments announced by Cameron involving trans-Atlantic deals. Boeing (BA) won a contract for nine P8 torpedo-fitted maritime patrol aircraft.Also, 600 Scout armored vehicles built by General Dynamics (GD) will form the core of new ""Strike Brigades"" due by 2025.IBD's Paul Whitfield contributed to this article.

228,GD,"Northrop Grumman (NOC) reported strong third-quarter results and raised its full year earnings outlook Wednesday, a day after winning a lucrative bomber contract from the Air Force over Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT). Fellow defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) also topped earnings views.Northrop Grumman's Q3 earnings per diluted share jumped 22% to $2.75. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting $2.19. Revenue was flat at $5.98 billion, above views for $5.86 billion.Northrop raised its full-year EPS outlook to $9.70 to $9.80, up from prior guidance of $9.55 to $9.70. Northrop also raised the low end of its 2016 revenue guidance.Shares jumped 5.5% to close at 190.50 on the stock market today. The stock has several record highs in recent sessions.The company was flying high after hours Tuesday after beating out a Boeing-Lockheed Martin team for the Air Force's long-range strike bomber contract.Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James said the bomber award decision was the ""best value for our nation.""Northrop has a long history of developing bombers and was the builder of the B-2.During the company's conference call, CEO Wes Bush said the company will deliver a ""highly capable and affordable bomber"" to the Air Force but declined to talk further about the program due to its classified nature.Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia told IBD that Northrop's win is ""a pretty impressive achievement.""""If you look at the differences in size, market power and overall clout of the two competitors, you can't help but be a little but surprised,"" he said of smaller Northrop's win.Boeing's Next Move?But Boeing will likely protest the contract award in the coming weeks.Or Boeing could buy Northrop to stay relevant in the defense airframe space.Boeing still could win the bid for the Air Force's T-38 trainer plane, but it faces stiff competition from four other bidders, and the contract is relatively small at only $12 billion.""It seems like Boeing will have to make a very tough choice,"" Aboulafia said. ""Exit the U.S. combat aircraft business, or they can put in a bid for Northrop.""Aboulafia said the bid could play out over the next three to four years.Last week, Boeing's CEO Dennis Muilenburg said on the company's conference call that the aerospace giant's defense business ""overall is a healthy portfolio"" and that he ""likes the program structures we have.""Boeing shares edged down 0.4% to close at 147.88.The new B-3 bomber will replace Boeing's B-52s, which have been in operation since the 1950s. The Air Force plans to buy 80 to 100 of the new planes, and the contract could be worth $50 billion to $80 billion. The first planes are slated to enter service around 2025.General Dynamics also reported results Wednesday. The defense firm's Q3 EPS climbed 11.2% to $2.28, beating views by 15 cents. Revenue rose 3.1% to $7.99 billion.General Dynamics closed up 1.6% to 150.78.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter @IBD_sGRich.

This figure excludes additional exposure via leasing firms or in the form of orders from undisclosed customers.RBC calculates that 36% of Airbus' backlog is exposed to non-Chinese or Middle East emerging markets, including airlines based in Indonesia, Columbia, Malaysia and Turkey.

269,GD,"Fath is more concerned with the longer term. The broad market's rally of nearly 6-1/2 years has made it increasingly hard for him to find attractively valued growth stocks.
"
270,GD,"The late-summer volatility has made it harder to find gainers.
"
271,GD,"Fath, who is about to celebrate his 45th birthday, talked with IBD from his office in Baltimore about why his mutual fund is performing so much better this year than last year and about how he is searching for new market leaders.
"
272,GD,"IBD: When you took charge of this fund, you cut the size of the overall portfolio and of its top 10 names. You initially trimmed to 100, down from 118, and more recently you're at 106 as of July 31. Is your initial retooling complete?
"
273,GD,"Fath: I'm where I want to be. The tail end of the fund is half what it used to be. It's 10% of the fund now. The top 10 decreased a little bit. The middle is bigger.
"
274,GD,"IBD: How does each segment differ?
"
275,GD,"Fath: I describe my philosophy as an upside-down pyramid. The top slice is secular-growth names. That typically makes up 50% to 60% of the portfolio. Those are innovative disrupters that are the most dynamic growth companies.
"
276,GD,"The middle section would be more cyclical opportunities. These would typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio. They're likely to be more opportunistic and have shorter holding periods in the fund than the average holding.
"
277,GD,"The last section would be what I generally characterize as special situations. These are in three primary areas:
"
278,GD,"First, stocks transitioning from value to growth.
"
279,GD,"Second, companies underway in a lasting industry structural change, like what has been going on the last several years in the U.S. airline sector.
"
280,GD,"Third, roll-ups, where strong management teams that are good capital allocators are applying discipline and efficiency in fragmented industries through acquisition.
"
281,GD,"This bucket will typically be 20% to 25% of the portfolio.
"
282,GD,"The top 10 or 20 names are generally the most compelling secular ideas. The tail of my portfolio has the smallest holdings and are typically my farm team — earlier-stage growth names and private companies that I own.
"
283,GD,"IBD: Give me some examples of special situations, please.
"
284,GD,"Fath: Gilead Sciences (GILD) went through the value-to-growth transition when it bought Pharmasset and got into (treating) hep C in addition to its core HIV business.
"
285,GD,"Airlines are in the industry structural change category, and I own American Airlines (AAL) and United Continental (UAL).
"
286,GD,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) is in the roll-up category, bringing capital allocation discipline to the pharma industry through an assertive allocation strategy.
"
287,GD,"IBD: Name examples from your secular bucket, please.
"
288,GD,"Fath:Amazon (AMZN) would be the poster child. Tesla (TSLA) is a bit more extreme. It's an on-the-come story. Other names include Priceline (PCLN), MasterCard (MA) and Visa (V).
"
289,GD,"IBD: And name some from your cyclical bucket, please.
"
290,GD,"Fath: Stuff in financials like TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and Morgan Stanley (MS) to a degree, but it is also a shifting business model, looking more like a value-to-growth shift.
"
291,GD,"In industrials, I hold names like FedEx (FDX), Canadian Pacific Railway (CP) and Flowserve (FLS), an energy industrial for the most part.
"
292,GD,"IBD: Why has fund performance zoomed up this year — at least until the broad sell-off?
"
293,GD,"Fath: It was a drag last year when secular-growth names sold off. A lot of that was due to people wanting to see more transparency in big names. They wanted to see Amazon break out its core e-commerce business and Amazon Web Services. That company is becoming more disciplined on expenses and costs.
"
294,GD,"And we're starting to see that in Google (GOOGL).
"
295,GD,"This year I've taken up the health care weighting significantly. And I've taken down energy. Both moves paid off.
"
296,GD,"I have a number of biotech and managed care and big-pharma names. That's played well. There's been some M&A activity in that space.
"
297,GD,"IBD: So you have a bigger bet on growth this year, and that has paid off?
"
298,GD,"Fath: The slowdown in growth happened prior to the sell-off in 2014.
"
299,GD,"I was positioned for a cyclical recovery, but that didn't play out. It's been the reverse in 2015.
"
300,GD,"We've been in a slow-growth environment. And the world has been thrown off by exogenous shocks like Greece and China, which is devaluing its currency.
"
301,GD,"Those external factors help make growth more valuable. That bids up the valuations of companies that are delivering growth.
"
302,GD,"But you've got to be disciplined about position sizes.
"
303,GD,"Google, Priceline — their outlooks look good. They've gone through heavy investment cycles.
"
304,GD,"Google has a new CFO, Ruth Porat, who came from Morgan Stanley. They're creating a new holding company called Alphabet, which will give more visibility to profitability of the core company going forward. People wanted more transparency there, and Google is starting to provide it.
"
305,GD,"IBD: Let's talk about some of your interesting names, as of your latest disclosure. Do you share the concerns that some people have about Apple (AAPL)?
"
306,GD,"Fath: It's done well. But I've been underweight. The stock peaked around 130. It's been sort of trading sideways. I'm guarded.
"
307,GD,"The most constructive part is its valuation and capital structure.
"
308,GD,"The worry has been about the company after this iPhone cycle.
"
309,GD,"They've done well with iPhone. Now the issue is its replacement cycle. What we underestimated is how impactful the replacement cycle would be.
"
310,GD,"I remain concerned about their ability to innovate, and does that drive enough of a replacement? They've done so well. Can they grow (as fast) off this base? It's hard to drive a higher multiple.
"
311,GD,"We'll see where it will go. The watch doesn't look like it will be a success — or at least not move the needle enough. I do own it. I don't have it overweight.
"
312,GD,"IBD: Why should anyone like Facebook (FB), whose earnings per share growth has slowed a lot for two quarters?
"
313,GD,"Fath: They've done everything right. Right now things are in transition in mobile. As they get a big base (of users), revenue growth is slowing as they invest in new initiatives. And they want a lot of users before they turn on the monetization engine.
"
314,GD,"They have 300 million users on Instagram, a lot on WhatsApp. They have 1.5 billion users on Facebook. They'll monetize over time, so profit will reaccelerate.
"
315,GD,"IBD: What's your thesis for Facebook's Oculus, which is buying Israel's Pebbles Interfaces, which specializes in depth-sensing tools that can track hand movement?
"
316,GD,"Fath: Oculus is a virtual reality play. It's interesting, but not a needle mover, but it's on the come. It's a green banana. It still needs to ripen. It shows (Mark) Zuckerberg is thinking multidecades.
"
317,GD,"IBD: What's your Visa thesis?
"
318,GD,"Fath: It ties in with durability of growth because it is at the center of online payments, the movement from cash and checks to digital and disruption.
"
319,GD,"In the U.S., cards still use magnetic swipes, but they are moving to chips with a PIN. All cards will be reissued with chips imbedded. That makes it much harder to steal card information.
"
320,GD,"A lot of retailers have been reluctant to make this change because they'd have to change their payment hardware at the register. But they're finally starting to change.
"
321,GD,"Visa Europe is another potential driver for Visa. Visa's takeover looks like it's coming to fruition. Maybe there will be an announcement in October.
"
322,GD,"IBD: You've built your stake in Celgene (CELG) for at least four quarters. What do you like?
"
323,GD,"Fath: The biotechs I want to own are going after big markets.
"
324,GD,"Over time, Celgene has built an arsenal where they can go after multiple things. Revlimid has been an anchor to what they do. But they've acquired companies and build their own franchise.
"
325,GD,"Now they've got Otezla, an immunology drug, for psoriasis (and psoriatic arthritis).
"
326,GD,"They've also got a cancer drug, Pomalyst, and chemotherapy treatment, Abraxane (acquired through Abraxis).
"
327,GD,"Another drug they acquired is GD-301 for treatment of Crohn's disease. Early trials are promising.
"
328,GD,"There's a patent cliff ahead for Revlimid. They'll protect it as long as possible.
"
329,GD,"And there's their recent acquisition of Receptos, which was viewed as a pretty reasonable price relative to some other deals. It's attacked multiple indications, but the most promising appears to be in gastrointestinal (disorders like) colitis and Crohn's.
"
330,GD,"IBD: Why have you been trimming your stake in Gilead Sciences?
"
331,GD,"Fath: They're a victim of their own success. They turned what was a chronic disease into an acute disease that is treatable.
"
332,GD,"Their treatment for hepatitis C is a monster drug. But its cure rate is almost 100% in eight to 12 weeks. Once someone is cured, they've got to find new patients.
"
333,GD,"IBD: You've also pared your stake in Regeneron (REGN). What's your outlook?
"
334,GD,"Fath: I probably shouldn't have trimmed. They've got a good core franchise in Eylea, which is used for treating wet age-related macular degeneration in the eye. Now it's also used for diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion.
"
335,GD,"They've got a powerful pipeline.
"
336,GD,"IBD: You've pared Starbucks (SBUX). What are your concerns?
"
337,GD,"Fath: I still feel good about their core story. Our trims are just position-size management.
"
338,GD,"They have a lot of presence, not just in the U.S., but globally. They've introduced nice food with their purchase of La Boulange. They're driving new traffic in the afternoon and evenings. They've got a good China story. Their menu is being broadened.
"
339,GD,"Their next big thing is moving bodies through the line. They're rolling out a mobile order-and-pay system, where you pay through your cellphone and dictate the delivery time. Then you walk into the store and your coffee is ready.Best Mutual Funds 2015: August Performance ReportSophomore slump? Not for Joe Fath. He took the helm of $47 billion T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund a year and a half ago — on Jan. 16, 2014. In that first calendar year in charge, his fund's 8.83% gain topped only 35% of its large-cap growth rival mutual funds tracked by Morningstar Inc.This year — in which the broad market has imitated a bucking bronco — his fund has climbed 5.93% as of Aug. 31 , outperforming a whopping 96% of its peer investors.Fath is more concerned with the longer term.

354,GD,"Lockheed Martin's (LMT) F-35 could be deemed ready for combat in the coming weeks, a major milestone for the $400 billion program after a series of development issues, as the Pentagon readies its largest order yet of the stealth fighter.The Marine Corps will carry out a final operational readiness inspection (ORI) in mid-July before declaring the first squadron of 10 F-35B fighter jets ready for initial combat use, said spokesman Maj. Paul Greenberg. The tests take about a week.""If the ORI is completed in July, and we are confident that the aircraft are ready for worldwide deployment, then we'll declare IOC (initial operational capability) in July,"" said Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, deputy commandant for Marine Corps aviation, in a statement to IBD.""If that doesn't happen until August, then it will be August. Bottom line is that we won't rush this; we are doing this the right way.""Once declared ready, the F-35's first deployment is slated for Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017. IOC for the Air Force's F-35 variant is expected in 2016, and the Navy's version is seen combat-ready between 2018 and 2019.The Pentagon plans to buy 2,443 F-35s to replace aging F-16s, A-10s, Boeing (BA) F/A-18s and AV-8Bs, though Marine Commandant Gen. Joseph Dunford, who has been tapped as the next Joint Chiefs chairman, told the Senate Armed Services Committee that the F-35 buying plan is under review.International orders are expected to push the total number produced to over 3,100.The F-35 has come a long way — longer than expected — since Lockheed won the contract in October 2001. At that time, the first planes were expected to be available for military operations by 2010.The path to combat readiness has been turbulent, marked by delays, glitches and cost overruns. More recently, an issue with a United Technologies (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caused a fire last summer. The Pentagon has said the problem has been resolved.Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, failed to meet basic requirements like identifying faults and failures. And a 2013 Defense Department inspector general report found hundreds of flaws in the way the F-35 was being produced.But defense officials remain confident in the F-35's progress and plan to ask Congress for a ""block buy"" order for up to 500 planes that could top $40 billion vs. piecemeal orders like last year's $4.7 billion contract for 43 planes. The Pentagon is looking for a three-year order starting in fiscal 2018.The block buy ""will really be a mark that this aircraft has made it after going through its teething stages,"" said Andrew Hunter, director of the Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""The discussion over if the F-35 should have been done becomes more of a historical discussion and less of a policy discussion.""The massive bulk procurement is key to addressing the program's cost, which lawmakers are looking to slash by more than 10% with a block buy, according to Hunter.Under the most recent order, each plane without the engine costs $95 million to $116 million, depending on the variant. But a block buy could drive down costs to $80 million per plane, including the engine, according to Mark Bobbi, a military aircraft analyst at IHS.Lower costs as well as a strong performance by the Marine Corps' F-35B after being combat-approved could also help sway countries still on the fence about buying the F-35, Bobbi added. And additional foreign orders would further trim costs.So far, the F-35 seems to be hitting its marks ahead of IOC. In late June, the first live-bomb drops in a non-test environment were successful, with 14 pilots delivering 30 high explosives over a restricted area in southeastern California.""The weapons employment went extremely well and validated the simulated procedures pilots have been training to and gave us confidence in the jet's ability to perform with real weaponry as advertised,"" said Maj. Brendan Walsh, a pilot and operations officer, in a statement to IBD.In May, the plane also successfully completed 100 short takeoffs and 100 vertical landings aboard the USS Wasp, along with successful tests in both day and night conditions, according to Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office.But as the F-35 nears combat readiness, skeptics of the program have doubted its ability to perform in actual combat.According to a report in the military blog War Is Boring, an older F-16, developed by Lockheed and General Dynamics (GD), outmaneuvered the F-35 in an air combat test in January. Analysts have also questioned the F-35's effectiveness at longer ranges.But the program office has said the test plane that was matched against the F-16 wasn't equipped with updates on F-35s currently in production, such as the latest software. It also noted the F-35 is designed to hit targets from long distances rather than engage in dogfights.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

355,GD,"The first live-bomb drops for Lockheed Martin 's (LMT) F-35 Joint Strike Fighter in a nontest environment were successful as the Marine Corps gets ready to declare the jet combat ready.Fourteen pilots dropped 30 weapons last week over a restricted area in southeastern California, and all of the high-explosive weapons went off.""The weapons employment went extremely well and validated the simulated procedures pilots have been training to and gave us confidence in the jet's ability to perform with real weaponry as advertised. These were the first ordnance expenditures by a fleet squadron in a nontest environment,"" said Major Brendan Walsh, a pilot and operations officer, in an emailed statement to IBD.Lockheed shares rose 1.1% to 187.93 in the stock market today.The live-bomb drops come as the Marines are expected to declare the fighter operational in the coming weeks.In May, the F-35B version completed 100 short takeoffs and 100 vertical landings aboard the USS Wasp, said Joe DellaVedova, public affairs director for the F-35 Joint Program Office, in an earlier interview with IBD. The plane also successfully performed tests in both day and night conditions.The Marines will carry out a final operational readiness inspection (ORI) in mid-July before declaring the first squadron of 10 F-35B fighter jets ready for initial combat use, according to Maj. Paul Greenberg, a Marine public affairs officer. The tests take about a week.""If the ORI is completed in July, and we are confident that the aircraft are ready for worldwide deployment, then we'll declare IOC (initial operational capability, the point when an item first becomes usable) in July,"" said Lt. Gen. Jon Davis, Deputy Commandant for U.S. Marine Corps Aviation, in an emailed statement to IBD. ""If that doesn't happen until August, then it will be August. Bottom line is that we won't rush this; we are doing this the right way.""There have been some issues with the plane's development over the years. A problem with the United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney engine caused the plane to catch on fire last summer. The Pentagon has said that the problem has been resolved.The updated 3F version of the F-35's software will fix problems with the earlier software and give the plane full war-fighting capabilities in 2017, according to DellaVedova.However, issues with the plane may remain. According to a report in the military blog War Is Boring, an older General Dynamics (GD) F-16 outmaneuvered the expensive F-35 in an air combat test in January.But the Joint Program Office said that the report was misleading, that the F-35's technology is designed to work best at long range and not necessarily in dogfighting situations, and that the test plane wasn't equipped with updates on planes currently in production, such as the latest software that would allow the aircraft to use its next-generation sensors.Once declared ready, the plane's first deployment is slated for Iwakuni, Japan, in 2017, according to Greenberg.Follow Gillian Rich on Twitter: @IBD_GRich.

370,GD,"Lockheed Martin (LMT) has worked out some mechanical issues on the F-35 and racked up more orders, but there are still problems with the stealth jet that could weigh on quarterly earnings.The defense giant reports Tuesday, kicking off a busy week for aerospace companies and Pentagon contractors. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect a nearly 40% jump in Lockheed's fourth-quarter EPS to $2.85 per share. Sales are seen rising 3% to $11.9 billion.During the last quarter, the $400 billion F-35 program got a boost when the Pentagon ordered an eighth batch of fighter jets for $4 billion. The contract also includes additional cost savings. In October, the U.K. announced an agreement in principle to order four more F-35s, bringing the total order up to 14. Israel also has plans to buy more F-35s.United Technologies' (UTX) Pratt & Whitney division said it would supply a seventh batch of F125 engines for the F-35, also with some cost savings.And more orders could come as production costs fall. Operational costs should also fall 15%, Rear Adm. Randy Mahr, the Pentagon's F-35 deputy program manager, told Reuters last year.But developmental problems persist. After an engine fire that temporarily grounded the F-35 fleet last summer, other issues continue to plague the program.Due to delays in software development, the F-35B model won't be able to fire its 25mm cannon by the Marine Corps' July target to declare the jet ready for combat use.Software issues don't stop with the gun. Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon's director of combat testing, told Congress recently there were ""serious deficiencies with hardware and software used to develop data files"" in the plane's computers. The files help identify enemy radar and ""are essential.""But the plane remains in demand around the world. And while the Pentagon and militaries abroad have scaled back budgets, the rise of the Islamic State, unrest in Syria and an aggressive Russia could mean more spending on high-tech weaponry like the F-35.General Dynamics (GD) is slated to announce Q4 results Wednesday.

374,GD,"WASHINGTON, D.C. — The Marine Corps Commandant said Thursday he is ""very confident"" that Lockheed Martin 's (LMT) F-35 will be ready for combat this year, despite ""complex"" issues with the plane.The F-35 is expected to be combat-ready for the Marine Corps in July, but there are 54 separate modifications needed to be done on the aircraft before then, said Gen. Joseph Dunford at the House Appropriations Committee's defense subcommittee hearing.Lockheed shares fell 1% to 201.09 on the stock market today.Dunford said the issues with the plane are complex but he is ""absolutely optimistic"" that everything will be ready.""The work is spread out, so we can get it done in time,"" he said to reporters after the hearing. ""I've taken a look at the folks that we have doing it, and we have the capacity and they have the time and they've got the parts.""A software patch for the Autonomic Logistics Information System, which helps manage diagnostics, maintenance and supply-chain issues, also will be ""satisfactory"" and will have the plane working at its ""highest capacity.""Last year, the Government Accountability Office found that the F-35 program continues to ""encounter slower than expected progress in developing the Autonomic Logistics Information System.""The stealth jet is behind schedule and over budget, but Dunford stressed the need for the plane because other jets in service are near the end of their life-cycles.Software glitches have been a persistent problem, and earlier reports said software issues will prevent the F-35 from being able to fire its 25mm cannon until 2019.Also during the hearing, Chief of Naval Operations Adm.

377,GD,"As the multibillion-dollar market for military and commercial drones gains traction, Lockheed Martin (LMT) and Raytheon (RTN) are just two firms that could benefit from the State Department's newly announced policy on expanding drone exports to allies.On Tuesday, the Obama administration established new standards for the global export of the unmanned devices that include strict sale conditions and ""end-use assurances"" from recipient nations.The new policy, which prohibits the use of American drones for ""unlawful surveillance,"" opens the door to U.S. drone and arms manufacturers looking to make sales abroad.According to Reuters, the U.S. has sold armed drones to the U.K., while unarmed U.S. military drones have been sold to countries like France and Italy. The State Department will now review requests for armed drones from Italy and Turkey.Lockheed could notably stand to gain from increased drone exports: the General Atomics' Predator and Reaper drones use Lockheed missiles.The State Department's decision could also boost makers of drone components.""Additional sales of Reapers to international users would benefit Raytheon, maker of the MTS-B multispectral targeting sensor, and L-3 Communications (LLL), which provides satellite communications components and training simulators,"" said Guggenheim Partners' Roman Schweizer in a note. ""Honeywell (HON) supplies turboprop engines and guidance components.""Lockheed shares were down 0.2% on the stock market today.

398,GD,"IBD 50 companies of all kinds are expected to report solid quarterly results in the coming week, potentially an indication that the gears driving our tech, retail, auto, medical and defense sectors are moving more freely. Here's a look at what analysts expect.NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) — the security chipmaker that helps keep your Apple Pay transactions safe — reports fourth-quarter results after the close on Wednesday.The Netherlands-based company, which recently introduced technology allowing drivers to lock and unlock their cars via their phones, owes much of its success to the immense popularity of Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 6, of which NXP is a supplier.Analysts expect NXP's EPS to springboard up 33% to $1.32 — the strongest gain of any of the IBD 50 stocks reviewed here. Revenue is seen increasing 17% to $1.51 billion.NXP shares emerged from a first-stage flat base this month but have rattled around near their 50-day line, where investors will often buy shares if they have faith in the company. The stock has ascended 82% since 2014.Shares slipped 0.7% on the stock market Friday but are still holding above a buy point and are in buy range.Medical-device maker Edwards Lifesciences (EW) reports on Tuesday. The company's artificial heart valve, Sapien, has helped keep gains aloft in recent quarters.Analysts expect earnings per share to rise 4% from a year earlier to 95 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 14% to $610.5 million.Edwards' Q3 results in October indicated to analysts that growth in the global transcatheter aortic valve replacement market continues to exceed expectations.The stock is up about 86% in the last year but in recent weeks has converged with its 50-day line. Shares fell 3% Friday to below that key level of support.As more business adapts to so-called omnichannel retailing — in which customers might use a combination of online and in-store outlets to buy products — Manhattan Associates' (MANH) supply-chain-management software helps them keep track of the orders.When the company reports Q4 results on Tuesday, analysts expect to see EPS rise 16% to 28 cents and revenue elevate 10% to $118.9 million.Since July 2012, the last time the stock spent any extended time below its 200-day line, Manhattan shares have risen more than 300%.Shares tripped up last November after trying to clear a cup-with-handle base begun in March. But they ricocheted up off their 50-day line in early January and have remained above it since.Car-dealer operator Asbury Auto (ABG) has thrived in recent years on the auto industry's rebound. Analysts expect the company, which reports Q4 results on Wednesday, to grow EPS by 15% to $1.01, though that would mark the slowest growth since Q3 2011. Sales are seen increasing 8% to $1.48 billion.Shares entered into a sixth-stage consolidation from July through November and have been seeking support at their 50-day line for most of January. The later the stage, the greater a stock's chance of topping out, IBD research finds. Still, shares are up 48% since 2014.O'Reilly Auto Parts (ORLY) also reports Q4 results Wednesday. With more cars lasting longer, the company has benefited from part replacements. As the months get colder, O'Reilly could also see sales pick up from repairs to winter-ravaged cars.Spirit Aerosystems (SPR) — a company whose propulsion, fuselage and wing systems go into military aircraft and passenger jets — reports Q4 results Tuesday. Analysts see EPS increasing 17% to 76 cents. Revenue is expected to rise 12% to $1.674 billion.Spirit serves such companies as defense contractor General Dynamics (GD) and aerospace giant Boeing (BA), which this week both reported estimate-topping Q4 results.Spirit shares cleared a flat base and have found support at their 50-day line.Apparel retailer Under Armour (UA), whose 'athleisure' wear continues to attract the athletic and the leisured alike, reports Q4 results Wednesday after the close.Analysts see EPS escalating 30% to 39 cents and revenue rising 24% to $849.63 million, which would continue a slight deceleration in sales gains over the past three quarters.Citigroup this month upgraded Under Armour to buy, citing the company's domestic and international prospects. But that upgrade came a day after Jefferies downgraded the stock, citing ""few near-term catalysts and valuation that accurately reflects the company's long-term growth prospects.""Under Armour stock cleared a fourth-stage cup-with-handle base on Thursday but struggled for momentum Friday as they slipped 1%.

But Boeing has chosen to increase production rates, which requires you to have more inventory.""Shares closed down 4.5%.Cash Flowing To 787In January, Boeing (BA) raised the 787 production rate to 10 per month, up from seven per month in 2013. But costs for the new fuel-efficient plane haven't fallen as expected, and CFO Greg Smith said Q3 cash flow was affected by a build-up of parts inventory for 787-9s.Operating cash flow before pension contributions fell 61% to $1.68 billion in Q3. Boeing expects ""very strong cash flow"" in Q4, but analysts aren't so sure.Sterne Agee analyst Peter Arment said in a research note that he sees ""increased bear calls for higher 787 costs and lower cash flow estimates.""The production rate issue comes just weeks after Boeing announced it will boost 737 output to 52 per month in 2018 from 42 currently as narrow-body demand increases.But this summer, Air Lease (AL) President John Plueger called narrow-body production rates a ""major concern"" because suppliers are reaching their capacity, and Canaccord Genuity analysts have called such production increases unsustainable.Morningstar's Dihora said higher output could be ""borrowing from later sales"" and noted the potential for cancellations. Still, he acknowledged the industry remains healthy and that cash flow is more an issue for shareholders expecting payouts.Robust Commercial DemandBoeing secured deals for 501 new commercial aircraft in Q3, and backlog rose 11% during the quarter to $490 billion with more than 5,500 orders.Commercial airplane revenue rose 15% to $16.1 billion, though operating margins narrowed to 11.2% from 11.6% on deliveries of lower-margin 787s and 747s.The company raised its full-year EPS outlook by 20 cents to $8.10-$8.30, but the midpoint is still below the $8.28 consensus.Defense, space and security sales fell 2% to $7.9 billion amid Pentagon spending cuts.Space has been a bright spot for Boeing, which won a contract last month for NASA's space taxi program to take astronauts to the International Space Station along with Elon Musk's SpaceX.Also on Wednesday, General Dynamics (GD) reported quarterly earnings that topped estimates as aerospace sales, which include its Gulfstream business jet and Jet Aviation units, rose 6.4% to $2.3 billion. But overall revenue missed.The business jet industry took a hit during the recession, but earlier this week Honeywell (HON) forecast global deliveries of up to 9,450 new business jets from 2014 to 2024, up from a prior forecast of 9,250.Northrop Grumman (NOC) also reported earnings and revenue that beat estimates and raised its full-year EPS outlook.Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin (LMT) reported Q3 EPS that topped analyst estimates, but its sales fell below views and it sees 2015 sales declining.

505,GD,"In part two of our discussion, we focus on the impact of recent changes in Federal Reserve (Fed) policy on locally-denominated fixed income across emerging markets (EM).1 As we noted in part one, higher short-term interest rates in emerging markets helped dampen losses from currency depreciation since the Fed began to ""taper"" its bond purchases in December. In this analysis, we take a broader view of the Fed's change in policy. In the charts below, we show the bond market's reaction to Ben Bernanke's taper comments from May 2013 and then look at the impact once the Fed actually started to reduce its bond purchases in December.2 Our primary takeaway from this analysis is that even though many emerging markets have rebounded, the rebound has not been particularly widespread. Yields remain considerably higher and currencies lower than May of last year. Compared to other fixed income sectors, we believe there is still opportunity for returns on account of high levels of income and further appreciation in EM currencies. 
"
506,GD,"From the end of May 2013 through the end of the year, global fixed income markets came under pressure, and many EM currencies depreciated against the U.S. dollar. As we noted at the time, countries that were perceived by the market to be dependent on foreign funding came under the greatest amount of pressure. Indeed, many of these countries actually hiked interest rates in order to stem the depreciation pressures on their currencies. In January, the vast majority of emerging market fixed income and currencies began to bottom out. In our view, this marked a turning point as more investors began to reassess the underlying fundamentals against their valuations. 
"
507,GD,"So far in 2014, bond yields around the world have declined. As we outline below, we believe that at current levels, EM local debt continues to appear attractively priced compared to other more traditional fixed income sectors and could prove to be much more resilient than the dramatic move we noted last summer. 
"
508,GD,"For the definition of GBI-EM GD Index, click here. As shown in the chart above, many of the countries that were the most significant underperformers leading up to the implementation of tapering have been among the strongest outperformers so far this year. In most instances, higher income and the fall in yields from their peaks has helped many of these countries recoup losses experienced in 2013. As we noted in part one of this series, emerging market currencies have not necessarily fully participated in this recovery. In fact, only eight of 19 EM currencies in this analysis have appreciated against the U.S. dollar over this most recent period. Since tapering began in December 2013, currencies remain a modest detractor from overall returns of the asset class. In spite of this tepid rebound, total returns for investing in emerging market debt have been close to 4% over the period compared to 0.59% investing in five year U.S. Treasury bonds. In our view, this represents the fundamental value of emerging market debt. As long as currencies don't depreciate by significant margins at the same time, emerging market fixed income can help provide investors with much greater total returns than plain-vanilla U.S. fixed income. With currency volatility continuing to be constrained so far this year, we believe that emerging market fundamentals will continue to favor currency appreciation in the long run.

509,GD,"Viewing the cumulative impact of tapering since May 22, 2013 in the table above, we continue to see a high degree of dispersion in the performance of emerging market countries. Again, currencies remain much weaker against the U.S. dollar with only three (Romania, South Korea and Poland) managing to appreciate over the period since Bernanke hinted at a reduction in bond purchases. However, an interesting element of this analysis shows that six out of 19 of these markets are no worse off than investing in U.S. 5-year Treasuries over this period. While volatility is undeniably higher for emerging market fixed income, yields of 1.75% in the United States provide limited options for attractive returns if rates rise by even a modest amount, in our view. 
"
510,GD,"In sum, we continue to believe in the long-term story of investing in emerging market local debt. While currency performance has served as a headwind to total returns, we do not believe this will be the case in perpetuity. In our view, faster economic growth, improving fundamental balances and increases in investor sentiment should continue to provide a positive backdrop for emerging market fixed income in the long run. 1 EM local debt represented by the J.P.

558,GD,"CSRA Inc.  recently received a revised acquisition offer from General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report). Under the new merger agreement General Dynamics plans to acquire all outstanding shares of CSRA for $41.25 per share in cash, an increase from the previous $40.75 per share offer.The revised offer is an attempt to dispel an unwanted proposal from CACI International Inc (CACI  -  Free Report). Notably, CACI proposed $7.2 billion in cash for this takeover.       Shares of CSRA were up more than 1% yesterday, while that of General Dynamic rose 1.3%.CSRA Inc. Price CSRA Inc. Price | CSRA Inc. QuoteStory of the DealCACI had offered to merge with CSRA in a bid to disrupt the latter's buyout proposition by General Dynamics, another defense contractor. The strategic move comes after CSRA agreed to sell itself to General Dynamics last month, for $40.75 per share in cash, as companies in the sector seek to position themselves for a pickup in government spending under Trump administration.The acquisition proposal represents an 8% premium over the price CSRA’s shareholders would receive in the announced transaction with General Dynamics. This combination will enable CSRA’s shareholders to participate in long-term growth of the combined company. CACI expects to realize $165 million annually in net run-rate cost synergies — a substantially better figure than the synergies contemplated by the General Dynamics transaction — offering shareholders of both CACI and CSRA the opportunity to participate in additional value creation.The acquisition will unite two businesses with long-term customer relationships, complementary capabilities and significant presence in high-growth markets. The combined entity will be able to provide customers with solutions that link domain and mission knowledge with industry-leading enterprise support offerings. The combination with CSRA will further capitalize on the opportunity for growth, amplifying both companies’ position in key market areas along with improving value proposition and customer footprint.Notably, the tender offer for CSRA shares commenced on Mar 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on Apr 2.Reasons for Selling ItselfCSRA expects sluggishness in award procurement to continue in the near term (we expect at least over the next two quarters) due to numerous ongoing transitions at the Trump administration. This will impact new business wins and top-line growth.Further, revenue concentration is a major risk for CSRA. In fiscal 2017, 94% of revenues came from sales to the U.S. federal government either as a prime contractor or subcontractor. Further, concentration exists within the federal government as 45% of total revenue is derived from defense including intelligence. Due to this massive dependency, changes in government’s IT spending budget is a huge deciding factor for the company’s top-line growth.CSRA’s leveraged balance sheet adds to the risk of investing in the company. As of Dec 29, 2017, the company had total debt (including the current portion) of $2.65 billion. So it badly needs cash infusion or a takeover by a much larger player.However, CSRA is benefiting from contract wins based on its deep domain knowledge and expertise in next-generation IT services. The company's partnerships with the likes of Amazon Web Services, ServiceNow, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, VMware and Oracle are expanding its service offerings consequently driving top-line growth. The company is also expected to benefit from increased spending in defense and various environmental programs. Further, strong backlog, strategic partnerships and frequent contract wins augur well for the company. These positive factors make CSRA a potential acquisition target.Zacks Rank & Key PicksCurrently, CSRA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the technology sector is NVIDIA Corp.

559,GD,"Following President Trump’s decision to dismiss U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson from office, major defense stocks in the United States moved north in the pre-market trading session on Mar 13. Trump has proposed Mike Pompeo, CIA chief, to replace him. Pompeo is a hard-line conservative.Wall Street took a hit yesterday following a technology sell-off that sent the Nasdaq indexes to their steepest losses in six weeks. A data breach report at Facebook took a toll on the U.S. stock market and, in turn, weighed on the defense industry, outweighing the surge it gained due to Tillerson’s exit news.Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the red over the past five trading sessions. Evidently, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index fell 1.4% over the same time frame, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index suffered a drop of 1.5%. Nevertheless, in keeping with its usual trend, the U.S. defense industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon over the trailing five sessions.Among the highlights of the last week, defense majors Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) secured a number of orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. Meanwhile General Dynamics progressed with the CSRA acquisition.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Lockheed Martin recently clinched a contract worth $3.5 billion for providing Army training aids, devices, simulators and simulations, maintenance, sustainment, operations and support to instrumentation systems and live-fire ranges. Work related to the deal is expected to be completed by Apr 30, 2020.The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Orlando, FL.

The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Per the terms, the deal will offer long lead time material for steam and electric plant components; the main propulsion unit efforts and ship service turbine generator efforts; and miscellaneous hull, mechanical and electrical system components (read more: General Dynamics Wins $696M Deal for Nuclear Submarines).Meanwhile, General Dynamics recently entered into a bidding war with CACI International for acquiring IT service provider CSRA Inc. . While General Dynamics offered last month $9.6 billion, including a $2.8 billion of debt, for the CSRA buyout, CACI proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover.In spite of the unsolicited offer that CACI made to acquire CSRA, General Dynamics remains confident of the deal and plans to proceed with its tender offer to acquire CSRA’s all outstanding shares. Notably, the tender offer for CSRA shares has commenced on Mar 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on Apr 2.With General Dynamics having secured the necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction, the chance of CACI snatching the deal from this shipbuilder is highly unlikely (read more: Can General Dynamics Beat CACI to Acquire CSRA for $9.6B? ) .4.

560,GD,"General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) recently entered into a bidding war with CACI International for acquiring IT service provider CSRA Inc. . While General Dynamics offered last month $9.6 billion, including a $2.8 billion of debt, for the CSRA buyout, CACI proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover.What’s CACI offering?Apparently CACI’s offering seems to be more profitable for CSRA’s shareholders, with the company offering $44 per share of CSRA compared with the General Dynamics proposal of $40.75 a share. This indicates that CACI’s offer will give investors an 8% premium over General Dynamics’ bid.General Dynamics vs. CACI: Who’s the Favorite?In spite of the unsolicited offer that CACI made to acquire CSRA, General Dynamics remains confident of the deal and plans to proceed with its tender offer to acquire CSRA’s all outstanding shares. Notably, the tender offer for CSRA shares has commenced on Mar 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on Apr 2. With General Dynamics having secured the necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction, the chance of CACI snatching the deal from this shipbuilder is highly unlikely.Moreover, General Dynamics believes that CACI’S offer overstates the real value to the CSRA shareholders and understates the involved risk. The company is also of the opinion that CACI's proposal would burden the CSRA with approximately $6.8 billion of debt, once acquired.Another implication of the deal is time value of money for investors as CACI would close the acquisition formalities by July 31, 2018. This means that if CACI wins the bid for CSRA, investors will incur significant opportunity cost due to the four months lag, whereas General Dynamics aims to complete the transaction by early April.Also, the real value of CACI’s stock tends to remain uncertain due to the market risks associated with the CACI transaction closing four months in the future with more than 65% of its stock consisting a fixed exchange ratio.Our ViewPer a report published by Forrester, global purchases of technology software and services by businesses and governments will grow by 4% and software and tech consulting services by 6% in 2018. Such increasing demand of technology services on a global scale will encourage businesses and governments to be more aggressive in their tech spending plans and companies like General Dynamics with their big customer base, through CSRA’s takeover will benefit hugely.General Dynamics’s Information Systems and Technology unit posted revenues of $2.49 billion in the fourth quarter, which was up 9.5% year over year. Subsequently, the company believes that CSRA’S acquisition will open doors for it to become a premier provider of high-tech IT solutions to the Government Technology Services market that will in turn boost this unit’s revenues.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has returned about 16% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 42.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), each of them sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

561,GD,"The aerospace and defense sector has been on a rally since last year. This has primarily been due to President Donald Trump’s push to boost defense spending in the United States. Further, a steep reduction in corporate taxes late last year will prove to be instrumental in bolstering growth for the sector in 2018.Also, Trump’s fiscal 2019 budget plan beefs up spending on defense and military research by as much as $470 billion over the next two years. Under such circumstances, the space is poised to breach boundaries in 2018 as the momentum that the segment picked up in last one year will continue.Defense Rally to Continue The space has seen splendid growth over the last one year. This is evident from the rise that the three broader ETFs tracking the sector has experienced in a year. The iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF ITA, the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF XAR and PowerShares Aerospace & Defense PPA have all surged 34.9%, 31.3% and 31.9%, respectively. Notably, all these ETFs have surpassed the S&P 500’s (.INX) performance in the same period where the broader index climbed 17.4%.Coming to the top players in the industry, we find a similar trend of growth with each of the stocks individually surpassing the S&P 500’s performance in a year’s time. Shares of Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Orbital ATK, Inc. , General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Rockwell Collins, Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corporation (UTX  -  Free Report) have gained 43.2%, 45%, 43.6%, 19.6%, 34.9%, 46% and 20.4%, respectively. Both the companies possess a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Trump’s Defense Budget ProposalThere’s no denying the fact that Trump’s presidency has come as a boon for the U.S. defense space, which was grappling with the budget sequestration act implemented by the prior government. While the fiscal 2018 (FY18) defense budget reflecting a noble 10% hike from the FY16 level was a major forerunner for this sector’s growth at the beginning of 2017, the FY18 defense policy bill worth $700 billion that extensively surpassed Trump's budget request took stocks to new heights in the second half of the year.On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled its fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by the President, in a bid to rebuild the U.S. military into a more agile and lethal force globally. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Of the total, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level, and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs. The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity.More Mergers & Acquisitions in PipelineIn the second half of 2017, we have seen a wave of mergers between big aerospace and defense companies in a bid to fend off competition, restructure business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. United Technologies has agreed to take over Rockwell Collins for $30 billion, while Northrop Grumman is set to buy Orbital ATK for $9.2 billion.While the deal will make United Technologies one of the world's largest aircraft equipment manufacturers, Northrop Grumman’s product line will benefit from Orbital's rocket motors, missiles and electro-optical countermeasure equipment. Slated to wrap up in 2018, synergies from these mega deals are sure to benefit the sector.Trump’s zeal to fortify the U.S. military has only strengthened the defense sector’s fortunes. The space rallied throughout last year, breaking boundaries in the second half of 2017 in particular. Most importantly, a reduction in corporate taxes to 21% has opened up more avenues for investments. Such developments have paved way for a plethora of acquisitions in the defense and aerospace segment in 2018.On Feb 12, the day Trump presented his second annual federal budget proposal, General Dynamics announced plans to purchase CSRA Inc  in a bid to venture and gradually expand the government sector business.Commenting on the deal, General Dynamics’ executive vice president of Information Systems & Technology Daniel Johnson stated that the company has an expanding budget and the analysts within the company believe that the services sector would spring back to pre-2011 conditions when the space was in its prime. This has encouraged the company to invest more on such ventures.Moreover, major defense contractors can expect a slew of contracts from the Pentagon. On the first day of 2018, Raytheon won a deal worth $333.4 million and Boeing secured a $193.6-million contract. With more such contracts anticipated, we expect major defense stocks to maintain the rally in 2018.U.S. Leads Global Defense ExportsEmerging nations like Japan and India as well as European countries are raising their defense budgets on account of the widespread geo-political uncertainties. As the United States is the largest supplier of defense equipment, it is without doubt a golden era for Aerospace & Defense stocks.According to the latest report from Aerospace Industries Association, United States led the global exports in the aerospace and defense segment in 2017. The country accounted for 34% of the total industry export. Further, U.S. Department of Commerce, the defense segment generated an astounding $143 billion from exports alone.Also, per the report from Aerospace Industries Association, China maintained the top spot as the largest importer of defense products from the U.S., accounting for a total of $16.3 billion worth of goods. Further, France and United Kingdom came in as the second and third, purchasing goods worth $12.9 billion and $10 billion, respectively.To ConcludeThe U.S. defense sector started off 2018 on solid note and is poised to witness stupendous growth in the days to come with a massive defense budget, steep reduction in corporate taxes and a plethora of merger deals and acquisitions lined up for 2018. Its recognition as the largest exporter of defense products in the world is another feather in its cap.Zacks Top 10 Stocks for 2018In addition to the stocks discussed above, would you like to know about our 10 finest buy-and-hold tickers for the entirety of 2018?Last year's 2017 Zacks Top 10 Stocks portfolio produced double-digit winners, including FMC Corp. and VMware which racked up stellar gains of +67.9% and +61%.

562,GD,"Investors interested in Aerospace - Defense stocks are likely familiar with Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report). But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Wesco Aircraft Holdings has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while General Dynamics has a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that WAIR likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than GD has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.WAIR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 14.67, while GD has a forward P/E of 16.91. We also note that WAIR has a PEG ratio of 1.22. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. GD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.75.Another notable valuation metric for WAIR is its P/B ratio of 1.67. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, GD has a P/B of 4.70.These metrics, and several others, help WAIR earn a Value grade of B, while GD has been given a Value grade of C.WAIR sticks out from GD in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that WAIR is the better option right now.

563,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, Inc., recently secured a $149.2 million modification deal for Hydra rockets, motors and associated components. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL, under the foreign military sales (FMS) program.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, General Dynamics will deliver various quantities of M151, M274, M257, M278, M156, M264, M278, and WTU-1/B warheads for Hydra-70 rockets, motors and associated components to Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, Kenya, Jordan, Nigeria and Qatar.Work related to the deal will be performed in Williston, VT and Hampton, AZ, and is expected to get completed by Feb 28, 2021. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2016, 2017 and 2018 other procurement (Army) funds for completing the task.Advantages of the Hydra-70 RocketsGeneral Dynamics' Hydra-70 rockets include unitary and cargo warheads for use against point and area targets, providing the user a lethal and lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability. The Hydra-70 rockets are universally compatible with the Advanced Precision Kill System (APKWS).Fitted to the MK66 MOD 4 motor, these warheads provide low-cost munitions capable of area suppression and defeating threats at extended ranges, as well as providing battlefield obscuration, illumination and marking.These rockets provide military personnel with affordable firepower, matched to the mission for effective engagements and area suppression of a long list of lower-value targets on the battlefield. These advanced rockets can also be mounted on most of the rotary and fixed-wing aircraft, which include the Apache, Cobra and F-16.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As widespread geo-political tensions loom across the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking significant initiatives to upgrade rocket systems. This, in turn, should boost General Dynamics’ overall growth in the rocket and missile market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures and supplies Hydra-70 rockets, registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters as well, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven rocket systems, eventually leading to contract wins like the latest one. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Moreover, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $1.2 billion on the Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its various rocket systems.Furthermore, the rocket and missile market is projected to grow from $55.5 billion in 2017 to $70 billion by 2022, at a CAGR of 4.74%, during the forecast period (as per Markets and Markets research firm). This, in turn, should enable General Dynamics to enhance its market share in the aerospace and defense industry.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has lost 5.4% in the last year compared with its industry’s growth of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Textron and Wesco Aircraft Holdings carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

564,GD,"This week was an eventful one with some of the major developments having a positive or negative impact on the global stock market. Below we discuss some of the biggest events that dominated the headlines and influenced the market:Trump-Kim DealThe historic summit between President Donald Trump and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore has created history, possibly ending bitterness that lasted for 68 years. This is especially true as Trump and Kim signed an agreement, which offers undisclosed American “security guarantees” in exchange for a commitment from North Korea to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” Although this is a positive step, lack of details on the denuclearization process and talks of follow-up negotiation have disappointed Wall Street.  Peace talks have pushed the defense stocks down after the summit. Major defense players -- Raytheon RTN, Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) -- saw rough trading on the day following the announcement of denuclearization. Of these, NOC has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) while BA and RTN have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.AT&T-Time Warner ApprovalU.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon approved AT&T’s (T  -  Free Report) $85.4 billion purchase of Time Warner  without any condition. The long-awaited decision has paved the way for a merger frenzy, which will change the landscape of the media industry. This is especially true, as Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) has made a $65 billion or $35 per share bid to acquire the film production and studio assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA. The move resulted in a bidding war with The Walt Disney Company (DIS  -  Free Report), which had struck a deal in November to acquire the same assets for $52.4 billion in an all-stock deal. Each of the stocks carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) while FOX downgraded to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).  Hawkish FedAs expected, the Fed has raised interest rates for the second time this year by 25 bps to 1.75-2%. This also marks the seventh rate hike since December 2015. The central bank signaled a hawkish outlook with two more lift-offs that would translate into four total increases in 2018. The decision has led to a spike in yields. The two-year Treasury yields, which are most sensitive to shifting expectations of Fed policy, rose faster than that of 10-year and 30-year yields, narrowing the spread between the short-term and long-term yields. In fact, the yields curve flattened to the levels last seen in August 2007.Generally, a rising rate scenario is highly profitable for banks, as they seek to borrow money at short-term rates and lend at long-term rates, thereby expanding net margins and bolstering banks’ profits. But this is not the case now as short-term rates are creeping higher and long-term rates are moving up slowly, leading to a decline in net margins. Still, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS  -  Free Report) having a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and a Momentum Score of A seems an excellent pick as its earnings are expected to grow 33.13% year over year this year.Dovish ECBThe European Central Bank (ECB), currently buying €30 billion in monthly asset program, plans to reduce its asset purchases to €15 billion from October to December and then finally end the massive program. Additionally, the bank has pledged to keep interest rates at record lows at least through the summer of 2019 pointing to a dovish outlook. The move led to strong gains for European stocks, which are poised for the best week in more than three months, while euro fell sharply.A decline in euro will actually benefit exporters and the manufacturing industry, resulting in soaring stock prices. As a result, some of the top-ranked European ADRs are poised to outperform in the coming months. Statoil ASA EQNR with a market cap of $89.2 billion and SAP SE SAP with a market cap of $148 billion have a Zacks Rank #1 and 2, respectively.World Cup Buying FrenzyThe 2018 FIFA World Cup has kicked off in Russia with the high expectation of driving growth across zones, especially in industrial spaces such as media, advertising, restaurants, hotels and airlines. Some of the top-ranked (#1 or 2) stocks in these spaces include Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report), Marriot Vacations Worldwide Corporation VAC, BJ's Restaurants, Inc. BJRI, Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG  -  Free Report), and SkyWest Inc. (SKYW  -  Free Report)  that could offer immense upside potential from the month-long event.Trump TariffTrump has approved of a plan to impose significant import tariffs on Chinese goods and is expected to announce today the first round of list for goods targeted for tariff. The move if enacted could lead to retaliation from China. Beijing earlier revealed a list of $50 billion in U.S. products that would face retaliatory tariffs, including beef and soybeans. As a result, meat producers like Tyson Foods Inc. TSN and Hormel Foods Corporation HRL could take a hit. Both stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

565,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, has clinched a modification contract to procure onboard repair parts for Virginia Class Submarines Pre-Commissioning Unit (PCU) New Jersey (SSN 796) and PCU Iowa (SSN 797). Work related to SSN 796 is scheduled to be over by February 2021, while that for SSN 797 is expected to be completed by August 2021.Details of the DealValued at $36.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The deal includes option for Block IV mechanical and electronic repair parts, which will be stored on the ship while at sea.  Electric boat will utilize fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund to finance the task, which will be carried out in Groton, CT.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries HII.Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are also carried out by these fast-attack submarines. Notably, these vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these three submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world, which are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines,In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprised 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines. However, the number of SSNs is projected to decline by more than 20% over the next decade due to a smaller number of procurements done in the 90’s. This means, to reach the force-level goal, the U.S. Navy should accelerate their procurement rate in the coming days.Therefore, an increased number of procurement contracts can be expected from the Pentagon for the Virginia-Class submarines, which in turn should boost General Dynamics’ profit margin effectively.Furthermore, the U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as its top priority and allotted an upmarket budget for the same. This also bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor for this program.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have lost 1.1% compared with the industry’s rally of 33.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that General Dynamics faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report), Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Textron (TXT  -  Free Report). While Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Boeing and Textron carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

566,GD,"Investors interested in stocks from the Aerospace - Defense sector have probably already heard of Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Wesco Aircraft Holdings and General Dynamics are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. This means that WAIR's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years.WAIR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 15.26, while GD has a forward P/E of 17.97. We also note that WAIR has a PEG ratio of 1.27. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. GD currently has a PEG ratio of 1.93.Another notable valuation metric for WAIR is its P/B ratio of 1.73. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, GD has a P/B of 5.04.Based on these metrics and many more, WAIR holds a Value grade of B, while GD has a Value grade of C.WAIR has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than GD, so it seems like value investors will conclude that WAIR is the superior option right now.

567,GD,"To everyone’s surprise the first-ever formal meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and his North Korean counterpart Kim Jong-Un in Singapore was extremely successful. While the eco-political consequence of signing the denuclearization agreement at this historical meeting was a constructive one, hinting at a peace regime across the Korean peninsula, it does not bode well for the U.S. defense industry.Major U.S. defense contractors paid the price, witnessing a sudden downfall in their stocks on Tuesday, since a settlement of the long-standing conflict between these two nations may lower demand for weaponries from these contractors.Crux of the Denuclearization DealPresident Trump and Chairman Jong-Un signed an agreement at yesterday’s historical summit that aimed at averting any major military confrontation between the two nations, at least in the near term. The two primary aspects of the agreement were Kim’s renewed commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and Trump’s promise to pull out thousands of troops stationed in South Korea.While the minute details of the deal were not made public, in a press conference, Trump announced that as part of the deal America will end joint military drill with South Korea against North Korea and eventually withdraw troops from the Korean Peninsula.Defense Stocks That Took a BeatingFrequent cross-border altercations between the United States and North Korea were one of the primary driving forces behind defense stocks’ rally last year. Indeed, major U.S. defense contractors, especially the ones that manufacture high-end missiles or offer missile surveillance services, hit all-time highs, following the countering missile-test war between these two nations.Naturally, the signing of the denuclearization deal, hinting at easing of tensions between Pyongyang and Washington, sent the following defense stocks lower.Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) provides systems, products and solutions to government and commercial customers in the areas of aerospace, mission systems and technology services worldwide. Its cyber solutions offer missile warning and defense systems. Northrop Grumman sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here.The company’s shares have lost 1.5% since the news of denuclearization surfaced. Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is one of the largest aerospace and defense companies in the United States with a diversified line of military products, including missiles, radars, sensors, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, communication and information systems, naval systems, air traffic control systems and technical services. Its notable missile system includes the Tomahawk cruise missile, an advanced surface or submarine-launched cruise missile with loitering and network communication capability. Raytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company’s shares have lost 2.8% since the announcement. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is the largest defense contractor in the world, which manufactures military aircraft, Joint Light Tactical vehicle, Littoral combat ships and many more alike defense equipment. Among its varied missile programs, notable ones are the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD). Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The company’s shares lost 1.3% in the last trading session. General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) is a prominent military shipbuilder and is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. It manufactures combat-proven missile destroyer ships, missile submarines as well as tactical missile aerostructures. General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.The company’s shares lost 1.6% following the announcement. Will the Deal Really Jeopardize Defense Growth?While the signing of the denuclearization deal has adversely impacted defense stocks, the effect will wane over time. After all, United States’ cross-border tension with North Korea was not the sole driver of U.S. defense stocks.Factors like expansionary U.S. budgetary amendments under Trump administration along with rising defense spending by other major regional powers such as Japan and India have boosted investors’ optimism in the U.S. defense industry. Also, owing to regional tensions in the Middle East, U.S. defense majors have been increasingly receiving contracts from countries like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which are boosting international sales. In fact, the aforementioned defense primes have been witnessing upward earnings estimate revisions even before the U.S-North Korea tension escalated, thanks to intrinsic strength of their diverse product portfolio. Moreover, analysts are skeptical about the viability of the deal over the long term. This is because North Korea had made similar commitments in the past but continued to develop nuclear weapons. In fact, following the summit, Trump said that there is no surety that there will not be a reversal of situation in another six months or so, owing to which he may act against Jong-Un. This keeps the doors open for defense majors to regain momentum. We believe signing of the deal is a small step toward maintaining peace between these two nations. Verification and monitoring will be necessary to ensure that North Korea has actually put down its nuclear weapons. For this, the U.S. government will have to rely on its defense contractors. So, all’s not lost for the U.S. defense majors.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

568,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Bath Iron Works (BIW), recently secured a contract for providing lead yard services (LYS) to DDG-51 class ships. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by June 2019.Contract DetailsValued at $50 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. However, options included in this deal, if exercised, would bring the cumulative value of the agreement to $304.8 million.Per the deal, BIW will offer necessary engineering, technical, material procurement and production support; configuration; class flight and baseline upgrades and new technology support; data and logistics management; lessons learned analysis; acceptance trials; post-delivery test and trials. Also, the deal provisions for post-shakedown availability support; reliability and maintainability; system safety program support; material and fleet turnover support; shipyard engineering team; turnkey; crew indoctrination, design tool/design standardization, detail design development as well as other technical and engineering analyses.Such efforts are likely to support construction as well as test and trials of the DDG 51 Class ship. Furthermore, DDG 51 Class LYS has provisions for offering design, engineering, procurement and manufacturing/production services to support design feasibility studies and analyses. These additional supports will modify DDG 51 Class destroyers for Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programs sponsored by the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense.Majority of the work related to this latest deal will be performed in Bath, ME. General Dynamics will use fiscal 2014, 2016 and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) fund for completing the task.A Brief Note on DDG-51 The DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class is a multi-mission warship. It features an advanced anti-submarine warfare system, the AEGIS combat system, the Vertical Launching System, two embarked SH-60 helicopters along with advanced anti-aircraft missiles and land-attack missiles. Impressively, the warship offers defense against a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics’ Marine Systems business segment has an extensive experience in the construction of nuclear submarines, surface combatants and auxiliary ships. BIW, a unit of this segment, provides lifecycle support services for Navy surface ships. Interestingly, as of February 2018, the company secured construction contracts for six DDG-51s, scheduled for delivery through 2024. This reflects the solid demand that this class of ships boast, indicating at the possibility of increased revenue recognition from this program in the coming days.In first-quarter 2018, Marine System’s revenues totaled $2,034 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of more than 5%. We may expect the latest contract win along with the aforementioned delivery contracts to add more impetus to this segment’s growth in the near future.Furthermore, President Trump’s proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget includes an investment plan of $179.1 billion for the U.S Navy. Notably, this financial plan was up 4% compared with the fiscal 2018 budget request. Considering such favorable budgetary revisions, General Dynamics, a prominent shipbuilder in the United States, is expected to win similar contracts from the U.S. Navy moving ahead.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have gained 1.7% compared with the industry’s rally of 43.3%.

570,GD,"On Feb 12, the Pentagon unveiled the fiscal 2019 budget proposal outlined by President Trump, intended at rebuilding the U.S. military into a more capable, lethal, and geared up Joint Force. Notably, the budget proposal aims at spending $716 billion on national security.Naturally, the budget presentation sent defense stock rallying higher. Notably, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace and S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) indices rose 7.2% since the revelation of the budget proposal. Highlights of the Budget PlanOf the total, $686.1 billion is being kept as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting a 5% real growth over the initial FY 2018 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). The budget includes $617.1 billion as base budget, highlighting a 17.8% increase from the 2018 current CR level and $69 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.Notably, the fiscal 2019 budget raises the end strength for the Army, Navy and Air Force by 25,900 (24,100 in active components and 1,800 in reserve components) over the fiscal 2018 budget. The latest budget’s major war fighting investments include spending plans of $21.7 billion on Aircraft, $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding and $5.8 billion on Ground Systems.Moreover, in the wake of North Korea’s ballistic missile threats, the budget proposal includes an investment plan of $6 billion for varied missile programs.The budget requests for increased investment worth $10.5 billion on facilities, reflecting a 7% rise over the fiscal 2018 base budget request. The funds will be used for fortifying military infrastructure to increase force lethality and minimize the cost of maintaining unneeded capacity. Also, the budget plan targets continued savings from reforms such as defense travel modernization as well as headquarters reduction by 25%.Interestingly, the fiscal 2019 budget is the second full budget request from the President, initiating the rebuilding process for the U.S. military that Trump has been consistently emphasizing on. The rebuilding process will involve additional investments in near-term readiness, thereby providing impetus to the programs that suffered due to years of budget cuts.Stocks in the LimelightDefense stocks in the United States have been on a solid rally since the beginning of 2018, courtesy of the nation’s conflict with Pakistan. Notably, cross-border tensions escalated between the nations following the United States’ allegation that Pakistan is playing a ""double game"" with respect to fighting terrorism.Notably, since Trump’s ascension to the presidency, companies in the Aerospace and Defense space have gained the maximum in comparison to other sectors. The presentation of fiscal 2019 budget proposal has perked up prospects for these stocks, all the more.In view of this, it seems prudent to focus on defense stocks like the ones mentioned below:Boeing (BA  -  Free Report)Boeing is the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States. The fiscal 2019 budget proposal has kept provisions for $3 billion investment in 15 KC-46 Tanker Replacements, $2 billion for procuring 24 F/A-18s, $1.3 billion for 60 AH-64E Attack Helicopters and $2.2 billion for 10 P-8A jets. Notably, maximum of the budget provision for Aircraft was allotted for Boeing’s products.Boeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Its shares have gained 7.1% since the fiscal 2019 budget proposal was released. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report)The Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin, is the manufacturer of the defense department’s most vital program, the F-35 fighter jet. The budget proposal hints at an increase in Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.

571,GD,"Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) recently cleared the final regulatory red tape in its acquisition of Orbital ATK , following the receipt of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) approval for the deal. Notably, the FTC nod succeeds the European Commission’s approval received in February 2018.We expect Northrop Grumman to duly complete the buyout within the first half of 2018, now that it has got through the last lap of regulatory approvals. However, this clearance remains subject to condition that the acquirer shall supply the solid rocket motors to competitors for missile contracts. Also, operations of the two companies must remain segregated.About the DealIn September 2017, Northrop Grumman announced that it has signed an agreement to purchase rocket and satellites-maker Orbital ATK for a total cash of $7.8 billion. Additionally, it disclosed plans to setup Orbital ATK as a new and fourth business unit, on the deal’s closure.Through this merger, Orbital ATK’s knowledge and expertise in satellites, spacecraft components and commercial space launch system will significantly expand Northrop Grumman’s product offering.Also, Orbital ATK's contracts with the NASA and the U.S. Army are expected to boost Northrop Grumman’s product portfolio and rake in more than $4.8 billion in the form of annual revenues, according to Orbital’s 2017 financials.Positive Synergies Led to Raised ViewEarlier, Northrop Grumman announced that post the merger, this new business unit will be accretive to earnings per share and free cash flow during the remaining months of 2018. In particular, adding Orbital ATK will boost Northrop Grumman’s earnings per share and free cash flow in the first year of acquisition and lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Keeping up with its earlier announced strategy, Northrop Grumman will name its fourth business unit as Innovation Systems, post integration of Orbital ATK. We believe the final regulatory nod for the deal has encouraged Northrop Grumman to add on the benefits from this acquisition to its full-year result, even before the official completion of the merger. Surely, the expected operational results of Orbital ATK, nay Innovation Systems, have led Northrop Grumman to raise its 2018 financial guidance.In particular, post the merger, Northrop Grumman expects to generate earnings in the range of $16.20-$16.45 on revenues of $30 billion in 2018. This reflects a solid improvement when compared with the company’s earlier earnings guidance of $15.40-$15.65 per share on revenues of $27 billion. Northrop Grumman has also raised its guidance for free cash flow from $2-$2.3 billion to $2.3-$2.6 billion for 2018.Looking AheadNew macro challenges along with rising completion are lately prompting aerospace and defense industry players to revisit their business models as well as expand core operations and product lines. We believe Northrop Grumman’s proposal to buy Orbital ATK last year was also driven by similar rationale.So far, Northrop Grumman provided satellite communications, but now, with Orbital ATK in its business, the company will be able to manufacture satellite. This, in turn, will enable the acquirer to win major contracts from NASA, thereby adding to length and breadth of its existing product portfolio.With similar expansion agenda in mind, General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) completed the acquisition of IT service provider CSRA Inc. in April 2018 for $9.7 billion. Realizing the increasing demand for technology software and services worldwide, this deal should serve as a strategically fit step for General Dynamics to expand its footprint in the cybersecurity space.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, shares of Northrop Grumman have rallied about 30% compared with the industry’s increase of 41.8%. The underperformance may have been caused by the higher operating expenses that the company incurs, which tend to weigh on its profit margin.Zacks Rank Northrop Grumman has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same industry is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Boeing has surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarter, with an average positive surprise of 29.51%. Over the last 60 days, the company’s 2018 earnings estimate has moved up by 4% to $14.61 per share.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon.

572,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for providing fiscal 2018 lead yard services and development studies and design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.  Majority of the work related to this deal will be carried out in Groton, CT.Details of the DealValued at $432 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the modification, the lead yard services will maintain, update, and support the Virginia-class design and related drawings and data for Virginia-class submarines. This will include technology insertion, throughout its construction and post shakedown availability period.Moreover, the company will provide engineering and related lead yard services necessary for direct maintenance and support of Virginia-class ship specifications. In addition, this contract will offer development studies and design efforts related to the Virginia-class submarine design and design improvements, preliminary and detail component and system design, integration of system engineering, design engineering, test engineering, logistics engineering and production engineering.Development studies and design efforts will also be supplied in relation to components and systems to accomplish research and development tasks and prototypes and engineering development models required to evaluate new technologies to be inserted in succeeding Virginia-class submarines.Fiscal 2018, 2017, 2012, 2015, 2013, 2014 and 2016 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds,  as well as fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 research, development, test and engineering funds will be utilized to complete the task by December 2018.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued at around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. With widespread geo-political tensions looming over the globe, nations are strengthening up their arsenals and boosting up their naval power through upgrading submarines is one such strategy.In line with this, considering the solid demand for the Virginia-class submarine, the U.S. Navy plans to build an advanced model of this submarine in the subsequent years. This latest model will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  We believe the launch tubes of VPM will have the capability to carry a total of 28 additional Tomahawk cruise missiles.In fact, the Navy earlier proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM. This indicates additional defense contracts for General Dynamics, which, in turn, is expected to boost the company’s growth trajectory.Further, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted for the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor. As a result, we believe that the modification contract will undoubtedly put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Industry ScenarioIn September, the U.S. Senate approved a $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act, which provides necessary funding to the U.S. Military to carry out activities in homeland and overseas. The bill authorizes $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.The defense expenditure for fiscal 2018 is expected to exceed fiscal 2017 levels by nearly $83 billion. The defense spending approved by the Senate is higher than what President Trump had requested for. This has raised the growth prospects of defense primes like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In addition, the bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. This would benefit the nation’s prime shipbuilders like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls.Price Performance General Dynamics’ stock has returned 12% over a year, underperforming the 28.4% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the prior U.S. government.  Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

573,GD,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) Defense, Space & Security business segment recently secured a modification contract for providing sustainment support to its E-4B military aircraft. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by Nov 30, 2018.Details of the DealThe contract, with a ceiling value of $80 million, was awarded by the Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, OK. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer program management, field service representative, system integration laboratory, spare procurement, repair/overhaul, emergency support and engine overhaul. The related work will be carried out in Oklahoma City, OK and Offutt Air Force Base, NE. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to partially finance the deal.A Brief Note on E-4BThe E-4B, a militarized version of the Boeing 747-200, is a four-engine, swept-wing, long-range high-altitude airplane capable of refueling in flight. An E-4B can provide seating for up to 112 people, including a joint-service operations team, Air Force flight crew, maintenance and security component, communications team and selected augmentees.These aircraft are equipped with 13 external communications systems and are designed for 72 hours long missions. Their aircraft provide protection against electromagnetic radiation and nuclear blast.Secondary missions assigned to the E-4B include VIP travel along with Federal Emergency Management Agency support, which facilitates communications in relief works following natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. The company's defense segment stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time. Effective July 2017, it created a new segment — Boeing Global Services (BGS) — to include its  Commercial Aviation Services businesses, and certain Boeing Defense, Security & Services (BDS) businesses (primarily those previously included in the Global Services & Support segment). The move is expected to enhance product efficiency and lower costs for Boeing's defense customers in addition to maintaining delivery schedules.In particular, among other defense equipments, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.For example in October, the company won a contract worth $240 million for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1. In the month prior to that, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $600 million to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program.Additionally, recent Senate approval for the $700-billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. This, in turn, will most likely prove to be beneficial for defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) in the near term.Although BDS segment’s performance was weak in the third quarter of 2017, management expects this business unit is poised to grow, going forward. Considering the current favorable budgetary scenario, we anticipate that such generous fund flows from Pentagon, in the form of contracts, like the latest one, will help Boeing to achieve its desired business expansion in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 81.5% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 31.1%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.  Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

574,GD,"Dubai Air Show 2017 witnessed some landmark deals involving renowned jet makers from across the globe, showcasing their state-of-the art aircraft both in the defense as well as commercial space. The Air Show ended on Nov 16.Dubai Air Show 2017 — A Grand SuccessAir Shows are often held as trade events wherein aircraft manufacturers unveil their new jets alongside demonstrating upgraded avionics to promote their product lines to global customers. The Dubai Air Show is also no exception. A number of record-breaking deals have been signed at the event, following which value of total orders booked was $114 billion.This figure is nearly three times the $37.2 billion orders signed in 2015 (according to Gulf News). Trade visitors to the event increased 20% compared to the 2015’s figure. These statistics certify the fact that the air show was a grand success.Global Aircraft MarketConsidering the fact that a lion’s share of deals sealed in the Dubai Air Show came from commercial airlines, it is imperative to mention that the global market for commercial jets have improved considerably. Rapid escalation in passenger and freight traffic has been bolstering the demand for commercial airplanes.In this line, aerospace giant The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) released its global market outlook for commercial jets this June, wherein the company raised its 20-year forecast for global jetliner demand by 3.6%. Boeing predicts that there will be a requirement of around 41,030 new planes worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036, globally.Moreover, during the Dubai Air Show, Boeing issued its 20-year forecast for jetliner demand in the Middle East. The company expects that demand for jetliners in the region will be around 3,350 new planes, worth $730 billion, between 2017 and 2036.Overall, the Middle Eastern commercial fleet is expected to be fueled by sustained 5.6% annual growth in commercial passenger traffic. Keeping in account these improving statistics, jet makers across the world will try to make most of the opportunity and clinch deals with global airlines.The rising geo-political turmoil globally have considerably boosted the defense space. The recently passed fiscal 2018 U.S. Defense Policy Bill worth $700 billion has also been a notable catalyst for U.S. defense contractors to expand their business. Therefore, the growth prospect of global military aircraft market is also immense at the present.Hence, considering the above discussion it is evident that the global aircraft market, both commercial as well as military, holds strong growth potentials. This in turn act as primary growth drivers for air shows like the latest one in Dubai.Highlights of the Air ShowThe Dubai Air Show 2017 witnessed some of the game-changing deals being signed. Majority of the deals were won by Boeing and Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report) — the two dominating players in the global manufacturing market for commercial aircraft. On the other hand, stocks like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK, Inc.  exhibited their new designs.Boeing sealed a deal worth $15.1 billion for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates airline, on the very first day of the show. The company clinched another significant deal worth $27 billion for delivering 225 737 MAX airplanes to flydubai airlines. This marked the largest-ever single-aisle jet order for Boeing, from a Middle East carrier.Apart from these two orders, Boeing received an order from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for supplying 20 additional 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion. Additionally, the company secured an order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters, valued at $1.9 billion, from Azerbaijan Airlines. Further, the aerospace giant got a new customer, when Egyptair agreed to lease six Boeing 787-9 Dreamliners.In terms of the defense and space businesses, the company unveiled its key capabilities including the CST-100 Starliner docking and KC-46 re-fueling simulators, apart from announcing services agreements at the event.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Airbus won the largest commercial jet order in its history when Indigo Partners agreed to buy its 430 aircraft in its A320neo family, for nearly $50 billion. With this order, Indigo Partners doubled its existing order of 427 A320 family aircraft.Apart from this, Golden Falcon Aviation, the exclusive aircraft provider of Kuwaiti carrier Wataniya airways signed a deal to lease 25 Airbus A320neo Family aircraft for $2.7 billion, while Air Arabia, the Middle East low cost carrier, agreed to lease six Airbus A321neo aircraft. AerCap and Egypt Air negotiated a deal with Airbus during the Dubai Air Show to lease 15 Airbus A320neo.On the other hand, the UAE Ministry of Defense announced a US$250-million purchase deal for five Airbus CN295 tactical airlifter aircraft.General Dynamics exhibited three of its business jets at the Dubai Air Show, the flagship Gulfstream G650ER, the award-winning Gulfstream G550 and the class-leading Gulfstream G280. These exhibitions are expected to induce interest in customers, creating an opportunity for future agreements. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Orbital ATK earlier announced plans to highlight a variety of products, including the Palletized Weapon System (PaWS) and advanced capabilities for customers in the Middle East, Africa and Asia at the program. PaWS combines Orbital ATK’s combat proven GAU-23 30mm cannon and mission system operators console. The gun system incorporates a modified variant of Orbital ATK’s Mk44 Bushmaster Automatic Cannon and is designed to fire numerous types of NATO 30MM X 173 rounds, including the 30MM PGU-46/B munitions.Additional products to be featured include Orbital ATK’s Eliminator, the latest version of the highly-successful AC-208B Armed Caravan aircraft. The Eliminator is able to locate, fix, identify, track, target, and engage emerging and time-sensitive targets with two Hellfire missiles per wing or 2.75-inch guided rockets, based on mission requirements.Orbital ATK currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bottom LineSome milestone deals, both in scope and size, were signed at the Dubai Air Show, reflecting the expanding global market for aircraft. Nevertheless it’s difficult to gauge which company gained more at the event in terms of deals, since the real impact will be ascertained after a timely delivery of the jets.We expect to witness similar deal wins at the Farnborough Air Show, scheduled to take place in July 2018.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

575,GD,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) won a modification contract worth $12.8 million, to provide yard services for CG-47-class cruisers and DD 963-class destroyers to the U.S. Navy. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2018.Details of the DealPer the terms of the deal, the company will provide long lead-time material procurement and management services for lifetime for both maintenance and modernization of these ships. The services include necessary engineering, technical, planning, ship configuration, data as well as logistics efforts.The contract was awarded by the Shipbuilding, Conversion, and Repair, Gulf Coast, Pascagoula, MS; and will utilize fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task at Pascagoula, MS.A Brief Note on CG-47 & DD 963USS Ticonderoga (CG 47) is an Aegis guided missile cruiser, jointly constructed by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report). Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Tomahawk missiles were deployed in these warships. These ships are equipped with Aegis Combat System which integrates the cruiser’s electronic sensors and weapons systems to engage anti-ship missile threats. Notably, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system, used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.On the other hand, built by Huntington Ingalls, DD 963 Spruance-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare, including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. It is designed to hunt down and destroy high speed submarines in all weather, but can also engage ships, aircraft, and shore targets. These multi-purpose combatants are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with Marine amphibious operations worldwide.Our ViewThe Department of the Navy (DON) proposed its base budget of $171.5 billion this May, for fiscal year 2018. Striving to restore Navy readiness through this budget, the DON requested $54.6 billion for operations and maintenance, funding 100% of projected ship depot maintenance. Surely this scrumptious budget boosted the prospects of Huntington Ingalls, which is one of the two primary military shipbuilders in the United States.Further, majority of the new eight ships allotted for purchase by the Navy in fiscal 2018, will come from either Huntington Ingalls or General Dynamics. This provided further impetus to the stock, as a result of which, the company has witnessed an 8% rise in its share price, since the budget was proposed.Although this budget proposal has not yet been approved by the U.S. Senate, we believe the recently won contract is indicative of the fact that the U.S. Navy remains firm with its focus toward modernizing its existing fleet of warships. If the budget proposal gets eventually approved, we can expect to witness more such contracts for Huntington Ingalls, in the coming days. This will surely boost the company’s profit level, which in turn is most likely to get reflected in increased earnings for shareholders.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 29% in a year, underperforming the industry’s 40.3% gain. This could be because of the earlier budget cuts which have put pressure on the top line. Also, investors remain concerned about budget deficits and political uncertainty that may make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankHuntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

576,GD,"On Jun 22, the European Union (EU) slapped tariffs on $3.2 billion of American products in response to taxes imposed on steel and aluminum by the United States. It seems like trade tensions have rapidly spread to other parts of the world in a ripple effect of the ongoing dispute between America and China over tariff impositions and trade protectionism issues.Unfortunately, global stocks were caught in crossfire as is evident from their underperformance over the past five trading sessions. Consequently, a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon was not sufficient to boost the aerospace and defense stocks. Evidently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — dropped 0.6% in the last five trading sessions.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) — secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for June 21, 2018 here)Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1.

577,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Aeronautics, recently clinched a foreign military sales (FMS) contract for manufacturing 16 F-16 V Block 70 aircraft. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Sep 30, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $1.1 billion, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. Per the terms of the agreement, the F-16 jets will be delivered to the Kingdom of Bahrain.The production will be carried out in Greenville, SC; and Fort Worth, TX. Lockheed Martin will utilize FMS funds to complete the order.A Brief Note on F-16Originally manufactured by General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), F-16 became part of Lockheed Martin after it acquired the former’s aircraft manufacturing business. The combat-proven F-16 falcon is a multi-role fighter jet, which currently serves 28 nations. As an F-16 Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), Lockheed Martin is uniquely qualified to design, engineer, develop, integrate and sustain a complete F-16 weapons system to meet customer requirements.Over the decades, the F-16 falcon has evolved from a day-only lightweight jet to all-weather multi-role fighter. The F-16V Block 70 is the newest and most advanced generation of the F-16 fleet. Its superiority over the earlier F-16 models lies in its advanced APG-83 AESA radar.Notably, Northrop Grumman’s (NOC  -  Free Report) APG-83 radar provides F-16s with 5th generation fighter radar capabilities, which allow better detection and tracking ranges, multiple target track as well as high-resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) maps for all-environment precision strike.Foreign Military Sales: A Key Catalyst Apart from enjoying a strong foothold in domestic markets, Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven jets are also well acclaimed internationally. In March 2017, the U.S. administration declared that it will go forward with the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Bahrain worth $5 billion. Earlier, the deal was stalled by the Obama Administration owing to the human rights concerns. This go-ahead gave a huge boost to the F-16 product line’s growth.Meanwhile, realizing the expanding defense market in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions lately, Lockheed Martin inked a landmark deal with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) in June 2017. Per the contract, both the companies will jointly manufacture Lockheed Martin’s F-16 Block 70 fighter jets in India. We believe this deal to be an important strategic move by the defense prime to substantially expand its foothold in the market of India — the world’s largest military weapons importer. Thus, reflecting the increased demand for Lockheed Martin’s F-16 model overseas.Moreover, the United States considers Bahrain as its important partner in this region, given the prevailing socio-political tensions in the Middle East. This is quite evident from the last year’s deal. Moreover, in May 2018, the U.S. State Department approved Bahrain’s purchase of 3,200 bomb bodies to arm its fleet of F-16 fighters. This, in turn, is expected to bolster the Royal Bahraini Air Force’s ability to conduct and sustain air operations with its F-16 combat aircraft, which is expected to get yet another boost with the latest contract win.For Lockheed Martin, aircraft deal wins like the latest one, should substantially drive its Aeronautics division’s sales. In the first quarter of 2018, this segment witnessed a 7% year-over-year improvement in sales and can be expected to exhibit similar performance moving ahead, based on aforementioned developments.Price Movement    In a year’s time, Lockheed Martin has gained about 6.9% compared with the industry’s rally of 30.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space for its broad portfolio of products and services, both domestically and internationally. Zacks Rank & Key Pick    Lockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), which has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

578,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Land Systems, recently secured a $258.6 million modification contract to upgrade Stryker flat-bottom vehicles to the patented double V-hull design. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI.Work related to the deal will be performed in Sterling Heights, MI, and is expected to get completed in Mar 31, 2020. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2018 procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles’ funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on Stryker Land VehicleThe eight-wheeled, armored combat vehicle is powered by a 350 horsepower Caterpillar JP-8 diesel engine that provides the U.S. Army with an effective mix of capabilities, including infantry transport offensive firepower and reconnaissance. The Stryker's other capabilities include the anti-tank guided missiles, mobile C4ISR, engineering and fire support, mobile gun system, and medical evacuation.The vehicle is employed in Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, light and mobile units based on the brigade combat team doctrine that relies on vehicles connected by military C4I (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) networks.The vehicle was outfitted with a new double-V hull, to survive in IED-prone zones of Afghanistan. Such improvements in the design led to staggering improvements in soldier survivability, providing protection in open terrain areas.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?With widespread geo-political tension around the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade land-combat military vehicles. This in turn should boost General Dynamics’ growth, with the company being one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures wheeled combat vehicles registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters as well, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven war vehicles that eventually led to the latest contract win. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $5.8 billion on Ground Systems. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its wheeled combat and tactical vehicles.Price Movement    General Dynamics’ stock has lost 6.4% in the past year against its industry’s growth of 30%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the same space are Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings, Inc.

579,GD,"While a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon and the fiscal 2019 defense budget sanction by the U.S. Senate on June 19 boosted the U.S. aerospace and defense industry, the escalating trade dispute between America and China created a major upheaval in the entire stock market.  Concerns that the dispute might grow more intense and drag down global economic growth, spooked investors worldwide.  Therefore, a sudden sell-off was witnessed in the global stock market, which in turn overweighed the positive impact of the U.S. Senate’s approval for fiscal 2019 budget. This induced a decline in share price of major U.S. defense contractors in the trailing five trading sessions. Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — decreased 4%, respectively, in the same period.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors — The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) — secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. American Outdoor Brands Corp. (AOBC  -  Free Report) also released its fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1.

The company is one of the two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the other one being Huntington Ingalls Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). This positions General Dynamics at a strategic advantage. Additionally, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have been in favor of the company’s business line.Earlier in August, General Dynamics’ business unit, Land Systems, secured a contract from the U.S. Army to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3. (Read More: General Dynamics' Unit Wins $311M U.S. Army Contract)The company’s business division, Electric Boat, was also awarded a $115.3-million modification contract to offer additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines from the U.S. Navy. (Read More: General Dynamics Wins $115M Virginia-class Submarine Deal)General Dynamics is committed to R&D activities that facilitate the introduction of new products and first-to-market enhancements. It broadens customer choices, improves aircraft performance and sets new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity. The company has been increasing R&D expenditures over the past three years. Notably, company-sponsored R&D expense increased 5.8% year over year to $418 million in 2016.The Defense ScenarioThere are multiple reasons which have boosted the defense sector in the recent times. Firstly, terror activities are constantly rising across the globe. United States and its allies are on high alert anticipating major threats and have been taking extra effort to strengthen their defense system.Secondly, the tension between the United States and North Korea is increasing. The conflict between these two countries has given a good boost to the major defense stocks like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics, Huntington Ingalls and others. The proposed 10% hike in the 2018 defense budget by President Trump is expected to rake in new orders to these giants.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have returned 29.3%, underperforming the industry’s gain of 32.2% in the last year.This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cuts will hurt the company’s growth prospects.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

581,GD,"The U.S. aerospace and defense industry grabbed investors’ attention this week on the back of two significant developments. On Sep 5, defense stocks surged following North Korea’s ‘successful’ hydrogen bomb test — largest nuclear device test since 2006.The U.S. administration strongly condemned the act, wherein the U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis warned North Korea of dire consequences if the nation goes on encouraging such violent operations. This in turn boosted defense stocks on anticipation of escalated military actions from the United States.The finalization of the merger between United Technologies and Rockwell Collins however, dragged down defense stocks. The aerospace giant Boeing raised strong objections against the merger citing the deal’s potential to hinder competition in the aerospace supply chain market. This may have raised skepticism surrounding the deal.Meanwhile, keeping up with the trend, defense stocks continued to receive generous flow of funds from the Pentagon.Coming to the performance of the major indices of the Aerospace sector, in the last five trading sessions, the stocks ended up in the red zone. Notably, the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index dropped 2.6%, while the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index dipped 2.3% during this period.Among last week’s highlights, defense primes Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Orbital ATK, Inc.  secured notable contracts from the Department of Defense (DoD). Moreover, Rockwell Collins Inc. (COL  -  Free Report) and United Technologies Corp. (UTX  -  Free Report) finalized their merger deal.(Read Defense Stock Roundup for Sep 1, 2017 here)A Look Back at Last Week’s Key Stories1. Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls’ unit, Newport News, clinched a contract worth $2.8 billion, to support the refueling and complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73).

582,GD,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business segment, Newport News, recently clinched a modification contract worth $105 million, for upgrading nuclear submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by September 2019.Details of the DealThe contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, Huntington will provide engineering, technical, design, configuration and database management as well as integrated logistics support for the ships. In addition, the company will also offer research and development, modernization and industrial support for submarines.The modification related task will be executed at the Newport News shipyard, located in Virginia. Huntington aims to utilize fiscal 2017 other procurement, fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation as well as fiscal 2015 shipbuilding and conversion funds to complete the project.Nuclear Submarines And the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling. Currently the Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.Notably, in the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). As a result both the companies enjoy a large share of the market as well as high profit margins.It is imperative to mention in this context that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How the Deal Will Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.Of late, the U.S. Navy has committed to design the Columbia class submarine as a replacement of the currently aging Ohio class nuclear ballistic missile submarines. The Ohio class SSBN includes 14 nuclear ballistic missile submarines and four nuclear cruise missile submarines. The Columbia class program currently has 12 ballistic missile submarines. The U.S. Navy has initiated the design process for the new class of submarines, and in early 2017 the program has entered into the engineering and manufacturing development phase. As a subcontractor, Huntington will support General Dynamics to build modules for the entire Columbia class submarine program, with the first ship’s construction expected to begin in 2021. To this end, management at Huntington believes the Columbia class submarines hold significant growth opportunity for the company, in the days ahead.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 28.2% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s 37% gain. This could be because of the earlier budget cuts which have put pressure on the top line. Also, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. As a result, the company's performance lagged the likes of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) that outperformed the industry.Zacks RankHuntington currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

583,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division — Electric Boat — recently clinched a modification contract for developing air conditioning unit component, which will be incorporated in Block V Virginia class boats. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by September 2022.Details of the DealValued at $16.6 million, the contract was awarded by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding Conversion and Repair, Groton, CT. Per the terms, Electric Boat will procure prototype material and manufacturing for the aforementioned air conditioning units.Majority of the work will be carried out in York, PA. Fiscal 2018 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funding will be utilized to partially finance this contract.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Also, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are managed by these vessels. In fact, the Virginia-class is one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.Notably, Electric Boat is the prime contractor for the Virginia-class submarine program. This division continues to operate at a two submarines-per-year construction rate and has delivered 15 Virginia-class submarines as of 2017-end, in conjunction with Huntington Ingalls. Impressively, since the delivery of the lead Virginia-class submarine, the cost and time to deliver follow-on ships has been reduced consistently from 84 months to 66 months, while improving the mission capability and quality of the ships at the time of delivery.The remaining 13 submarines are scheduled for dispatch through 2023. This reflects that the company has opportunities to win more such contracts like the latest one, which in turn, will provide impetus to its growth story.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted for the same. Evidently, the fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal for the U.S. Navy includes a request for spending $58.5 billion to buy 10 new ships, including two Virginia-class submarines. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor.Going ahead, we expect the company to win more such contracts like the latest one, which in turn, should enable it to expand footprint in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, General Dynamics’ shares have gained 2.6% compared with the broader industry’s increase of 44%.

584,GD,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) announced that its board of directors has approved a 9% hike in its quarterly common stock dividend. This has taken the annualized payout to $4.80 per share.The new quarterly dividend of $1.20 per share is up by a dime from the earlier quarterly dividend. The hiked dividend will be paid on Jun 20, 2018 to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jun 4.The board of directors of Northrop Grumman Corporation has been clearing annual dividend hikes for more than a decade now. We note that yearly payout increases are becoming a regular event for this defense major. The current dividend revision marked the 16th consecutive annual dividend raise by the company.The current annualized dividend yield is 1.50% compared with the industry average of 0.91%. This rise in distributable income vouches for the company’s strong balance sheet and a steady cash flow position, which provides it with financial flexibility and a cushion for incremental dividend.Can Northrop Sustain Dividend Hikes?Northrop has inked a deal to take over rocket-maker Orbital ATK  for $9.2 billion in 2017 and the transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. This acquisition will likely boost Northrop’s product portfolio as Orbital ATK has contracts with NASA and the U.S. Army. The consolidation will be accretive to Northrop’s earnings per share and its free cash flow in 2018. Further, the acquisition might lead to annual cost savings of nearly $150 million by 2020.Defense being a capital-intensive sector, business investment remains Northrop’s first priority. The company continues to anticipate free cash flow of $2-$2.3 billion after capital spending of approximately $1 billion in 2018.The company is committed to deliver higher returns to its shareholders by way of greater dividend payouts and efficient share repurchase strategy. We believe that the company’s strong cash flow and organic growth will help generate sufficient funds to meet its financial commitments.Dividend Hikes in the Same SpaceNorthrop Grumman is not the only company to reward its shareholders with increased dividend. There are also other players in the same industry to add shareholder value.For instance, General Dynamic Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) announced a quarterly dividend of 93 cents per share on Mar 7, 2018, registering a raise of 10.7% compared with the dividend amount paid in the previous quarter.The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) also approved a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share on Dec11, 2017, delivering a 20% hike compared with the dividend paid in the previous quarter.Price MovementNorthrop Grumman Corporation’s stock has rallied about 31.2% in the past year, underperforming Zacks Aerospace/Defense industry’s gain of 42.5%. Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman Corporation currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

586,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat, recently clinched a modification contract worth $696.2 million for supplying long lead time materials for the construction of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020 Virginia-class submarines.Details of the DealMajority of the work related to the deal will be carried out in Sunnyvale, CA; while the rest will be executed in different parts across the United States as well as Loanhead, United Kingdom. The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC.Per the terms, the deal will offer long lead time material for steam and electric plant components; the main propulsion unit efforts and ship service turbine generator efforts; and miscellaneous hull, mechanical and electrical system components. Fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the task by January 2019.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. Nations are strategically strengthening their arsenal and naval power by upgrading submarines as widespread geo-political tensions loom large.Notably, Electric Boat is the prime contractor for the Navy’s Virginia-class submarine program. It continues to operate at a two submarines-per-year construction rate and has delivered 15 Virginia-class submarines as of 2017-end, in conjunction with Huntington Ingalls. Impressively, since the delivery of the lead Virginia-class submarine, the cost and time to deliver follow-on ships has been reduced consistently and significantly, from 84 months to 66 months, while improving the mission capability and quality of the ships at the time of delivery.The remaining 13 submarines under contract are scheduled for despatchthrough 2023. This reflects that the company has opportunities to win more such contracts like the latest one, in relation to supporting the construction of these 13 submarines, which in turn will provide impetus to its growth story.The recently announced budget proposal made by Trump provisions a spending of $18.3 billion on Shipbuilding. The latest budget includes $7.4 billion for buying 2 Virginia-Class Submarines, for which General Dynamics is the prime contractor. This in turn is expected to further strengthen the company’s position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price PerformanceIn a year’s time, General Dynamics’ shares have rallied 17.2% compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.6%. The underperformance may have been led by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.  Zacks Rank & Key PicksGeneral Dynamics has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the same industry are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report)) and Wesco Aircraft Holdings (WAIR  -  Free Report).

587,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Land Systems, recently secured a $68.6 million modification contract to upgrade Stryker flat-bottom vehicles to the patented double V-hull design. The contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI.Work related to the deal will be performed in Sterling Heights, MI, and is expected to get completed in Mar 31, 2020. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2017 Army procurement of weapons and tracked combat vehicles’ funds for completing the task.Benefits of the Stryker Land VehicleThe eight-wheeled, armored combat vehicle is powered by a 350 horsepower Caterpillar JP-8 diesel engine that provides the U.S. Army with an effective mix of capabilities, including infantry transport, offensive firepower and reconnaissance. The Stryker's other capabilities include the anti-tank guided missiles, mobile C4ISR, engineering and fire support, mobile gun system, and medical evacuation.Prone to devastating IED attacks in Afghanistan, the vehicle was outfitted with a new double-V hull. Such improvements in the design led to staggering improvements in soldier survivability, providing protection in open terrain areas.Our ViewWith widespread geo-political tension around the globe, many nations are strengthening their arsenals and taking initiatives to upgrade land-combat military vehicles. This, in turn, should boost General Dynamics’ growth, with the company being one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.Notably, General Dynamics' Combat Systems segment that manufactures wheeled combat vehicles registered $1.44 billion of sales in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting 11.9% year-over-year growth. We may expect General Dynamics to witness similar strong results in this segment in upcoming quarters, buoyed by strong demand for its combat-proven war vehicles that eventually led to the latest contract win. This, in turn, should expand the company’s profit margin.Furthermore, the fiscal 2019 defense budget, recently approved by the U.S. Senate, provisions for a spending plan of $5.8 billion on Ground Systems. Such robust budgetary allotments should aid General Dynamics in acquiring major contracts from the Pentagon, related to its wheeled combat and tactical vehicles.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has lost 4.9% in the last year compared with its industry’s growth of 31.4%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Key Picks    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

588,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract for economic ordering quantity material associated with the fiscal 2019-2023 Virginia class submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by January 2019.Details of the DealValued at $225 million, the contract was awarded by Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Electric Boat will utilize fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to finance the task.Work for the modification will be carried out in Spring Grove, IL; Bethlehem, PA; and several different locations across the United States.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries.Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare are also carried out by these fast-attack submarines. Notably, these vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these three submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet, which included 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, comprising 66 SSNs. Thereby, reflecting the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.However, the number of SSNs is expected to decline by more than 20% over the next decade due to a smaller number of procurements done in the 90’s. This means, to reach the force-level goal, the U.S. Navy should accelerate their procurement rate in the coming days. For the Virginia-Class submarines, an increased number of procurement contracts can be expected from the Pentagon, which in turn should boost General Dynamics’ profit margin effectively.Furthermore, the U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as its top priority and allotted an upmarket budget for the same. This also bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor for this program.Price Movement    In a year’s time, shares of General Dynamics have lost 4.2% against the industry’s rally of 34%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that General Dynamics faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                   General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

589,GD,"The play of mixed factors has kept U.S. defense stocks afloat in the five trailing trading sessions, with limited upside in sight. While a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon and completion of the mega merger between Northrop Grumman and Orbital ATK boosted the U.S. aerospace and defense industry, the denuclearization deal at Singapore’s summit marred the expected growth rate.In particular, shares of major U.S. defense contractors declined on Jun 12 following a conflict-free settlement of the denuclearization deal. Consequently, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense space — the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index — inched up 0.6% in the last five trading sessions.Moreover, defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) secured a few orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session.

590,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Bath Iron Works (BIW), has recently won a contract from the U.S. Navy to provide integrated planning yard services for DDG-51 and FFG-7 class ships. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by February 2019.Contract DetailsThe contract, worth $87.2 million, has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms, BIW will supply designing, planning, and material support services for both the maintenance and modernization of DDG 51 and FFG 7 Ships.The entire work, related to the deal, will be performed in Bath, ME. General Dynamics will use fiscal 2018 other procurement, operations and maintenance (Navy) funds for completing the task.A Brief Note on DDG-51 and FFG-7 ShipsThe DDG 51 Arleigh Burke-class is a multi-mission warship that features an advanced anti-submarine warfare system, the AEGIS combat system, the Vertical Launching System, two embarked SH-60 helicopters along with advanced anti-aircraft missiles and land-attack missiles. It offers defense against a wide range of threats, including ballistic missiles.On the other hand, the Perry class FFG-7 is a capable undersea warfare platform. These ships are equipped to protect carrier battle groups, amphibious landing groups, underway replenishment groups and convoys. They can also conduct independent operations to perform counterdrug surveillance and maritime interception operations tasks.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?General Dynamics’ Marine Systems unit offers comprehensive maintenance, modernization and lifecycle support services to extend the service life and maximize the value of ships and submarines. Interestingly, as of February 2018, the company had construction contracts for six DDG-51s, scheduled for delivery through 2024, thereby indicating increased revenue recognition from this program.Notably, Marine System’s revenues of $2,034 million in the first quarter of 2018 reflected a 5.2% year-over-year growth. We may expect the latest contract win along with the aforementioned delivery contracts to add more impetus to this unit’s growth in the upcoming quarters.Furthermore, President Trump’s fiscal 2019 proposed defense budget includes an investment plan of $179.1 billion for the U.S Navy, which witnessed a 4% surge from the fiscal 2018 budget request.

591,GD,"With 267 S&P 500 companies having already reported results, the Q1 earnings season has crossed the half-way mark. As of Apr 27, of these 267 index members which revealed their earnings numbers, 79.8% delivered an earnings beat, while 73.8% surpassed revenue estimates.Coming to the Zacks Aerospace sector’s projections for Q1, earnings of this space is expected to improve 37.3% on 7.5% sales growth.However, such impressive numbers failed to drive the defense stocks over the last five trading sessions.

592,GD,"A day ago, after Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) ushered in a stellar Q1 earnings report, pre-market futures were zooming up. Q1 earnings season in general was going along swimmingly, and it looked like Tuesday trading was off to the races.Well, a funny thing happened in CAT’s Q1 conference call — CEO Jim Umpleby was quoted as saying Q1 represented a “high water mark” for Caterpillar’s 2018 earnings, which caused a hasty reassessment among market participants, and trading in the markets, the Dow in particular, sank like a stone.For sure, Mr. Umpleby has learned a valuable lesson about what to say (or what NOT to say) in his company’s conference call, but Caterpillar remains within a strong cycle overall. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of B.What we caution investors to learn from this is something akin to “all that glitters is not gold.” Meaning although a company may provide excellent top and bottom-line quarterly numbers, market sentiment — especially when economic realities are making traders a bit more sensitive these days, such as a 3% 10-year bond yield pointing toward higher interest rates in the future — may turn on a dime. And what we should take away is the understanding that jumpiness among market participants is a reality; stick with your strategy to find light at the end of the tunnel, and don’t give into hysteria.So, with that in mind, here are some highlights from a few of the big names reporting earnings results ahead of Wednesday’s opening bell:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is trading up 2.74% in today’s pre-market on solid top and bottom-line beats this morning. Earnings of $3.64 per share outpaced the $2.59 in the Zacks consensus, and revenues in the quarter of $23.38 billion surpassed the $22.32 billion analysts were expecting. Beating estimates is nothing new for Boeing: its trailing 4-quarter earnings beat average is above 20%. Also in the quarter, Boeing bought back $3 billion worth of company shares and paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends. For more on BA’s earnings, click here.Keeping in the Aerospace arena a moment, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) also easily topped earnings and revenue estimates in its Q1: $4.21 per share on $6.74 billion in revenues beat the $3.63 per share and $6.58 billion, respectively. Its Aerospace division rose 10% year over year, and this marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2, Style Score B-rated company. For more on NOC’s earnings, click here.One more from this sector: General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, posted a 7% beat on the bottom line to $2.65 per share. Revenues of $7,535 million was a smidge under Zacks consensus — so call this a mixed earnings report — on revenue growth of 1.3% year over year. For more on GD’s earnings, click here.Also, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) reported earnings ahead of the opening bell today, with 62 cents per share and $22.79 billion in the quarter outperforming the 59 cents per share and $22.72 billion expected, up 10.7% on the company’s top line. Internet customer net adds grew 379K, partially augmented by a loss of 96K Video customers. The company also formally announced its big for the 61% of Sky Communications it doesn’t already own. For more on CMCSA’s earnings, click here.

594,GD,"The defense space kick-started the Q1 earnings season with Textron (TXT  -  Free Report) releasing results on Apr 18. This multi-industry conglomerate’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  Today, sector behemoth Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report results. In fact, majority of the defense giants are expected to release financial numbers this week.As of Apr 20, 87 S&P 500 index members reported their quarterly results, wherein earnings increased 25% on 10.7% higher revenues. The space’s earnings are anticipated to record an 18.3% increase on 7.7% higher revenues, while two of the 16 Zacks sectors are likely to suffer a decline in earnings. We expect to have a clear picture of the space’s performance by the end of this week as 178 of the index members are scheduled to release their quarterly figures.As of Apr 20, total Q1 earnings from the broader Aerospace sector are expected to increase 14.9% year over year on 4.6% higher revenues.  For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the first quarter, courtesy of fiscal 2019 defense budget proposal presented by President Trump. Of the total amount, $686.1 billion has been reserved as funding for the Pentagon, reflecting 5% real growth over the initial FY18 President’s budget and 10% real growth over the current Continuing Resolution (CR). A steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with several nations increasing their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.Let’s take a look at four defense majors—The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and FLIR Systems, Inc. (FLIR  -  Free Report)—all of which are scheduled to release Q1 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.Boeing delivered a positive earnings surprise of 64.95% in the last quarter. Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 20.69%.Being the largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings. Markedly, the company received a number of orders for both commercial as well as military jets in the first quarter.Such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.During its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volumes will drive its bottom line in 2018. Though, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries remained high. With the commercial business constituting almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we expect the unit to drive the company’s first-quarter earnings.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Impressively, Boeing constitutes that right combination.The company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%.

The company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 4.02%.Order flow form the Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception.In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $7.5 billion, reflecting 1.4% year-over-year growth.In the first quarter, General Dynamics offered to buy CSRA — an information technology provider — for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Dynamics’ first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.47 per share, marking 0.4% annual decline. This might have been caused by higher R&D expenses that management expects to incur across 2018.The current Earnings ESP for General Dynamics is -0.23%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #3.Therefore, our model does not show that the company is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter (read more: General Dynamics' Q1 Earnings: Is a Beat in the Offing?). General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation Quote Northrop Grumman delivered a positive earnings surprise of 2.55% in the last quarter.

Notably, in the first quarter, the company received a number of contracts for this segment. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment is $3,131 million, reflecting annual growth of 16.1%.The company’s total sales growth has historically benefited from higher sales at the Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems segment. Cumulatively, this is likely to boost the company’s total sales growth for the first quarter. While lower corporate tax on account of the recent tax reform is likely to boost the company’s bottom line, Northrop Grumman is expected to incur notable expenses in regard to its Orbital ATK acquisition.The current Earnings ESP for Northrop Grumman is -0.99%, while it carries a Zacks Rank #2.

We believe that steady market traction of the newly launched products should continue supplementing sales performance in the upcoming quarters as well.The Earnings ESP for FLIR Systems is +2.33%, while the company carries a Zacks Rank #3.

595,GD,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results before the opening bell on Apr 25.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by regular contract wins along with higher commercial jet deliveries.Let's take a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both the Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of big orders for its commercial jets in the first quarter including a $12-billion contract from American Airlines for 47 Dreamliners, a $8.8-billion order from Jet Airways for 75 737-Max jets, a $6.2-billion order from Lion Air Group for 50 737 MAX 10 jets and a $2.8-billion contract from Hawaiian Airlines for 10 787-Dreamliners.Among the defense contracts won in the first quarter, the significant ones include a $1.2-billion deal to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets and a modification deal with cumulative face value of $305 million for Royal Saudi Air Force F-15SA fighter jet. Boeing also clinched a contract worth $312-million modification contract for providing Joint Direct Attack Munition tail kits. The company won a delivery order worth $430 million to provide F/A-18 planned maintenance interval-1 high flight hour depot support.In addition, on Mar 30, 2018 Boeing announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement with Saudi Arabian Military Industries to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia.Boeing has also agreed to provide the technological know-how required to install weaponry on the aircraft included in the JV as well as localize the supply chain for spare parts.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of contract wins will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $22.2 billion, reflecting a year-over-year increase of 5.9%.Q1 Deliveries to Boost Bottom LineBoeing’s first-quarter deliveries showed an 8.9% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments declined 40.5% than the year-ago figure. Higher demand for the 737 jets primarily drove the year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries. Boeing’s total deliveries were 209 units in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 211 the year-ago period figure.Notably, during its fourth-quarter 2017 earnings call, Boeing announced that higher volume will drive its bottom line in 2018. Although, the company’s overall deliveries declined, commercial deliveries reflected solid growth and with this business constituting for almost 60% of Boeing’s total revenues, we may expect to see a notable uptick in first-quarter earnings.In line with this, the consensus estimate for the company’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at $2.56 per share, reflecting a solid year-over-year increase of 27.4%. The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise  The Boeing Company Price and EPS Surprise | The Boeing Company Quote Cash Flow: A Strong PositiveDuring 2017, Boeing paid $3.42 billion in dividends and repurchased 46.1 million shares for $9.2 billion. This reflects strong balance sheet and cash flows that the company boasts, which in turn provide it financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Boeing generated $13.34 billion of operating cash flow at the end of 2017, up 27.1% year over year. The company projects to generate operating cash flow worth $15 billion for 2018, reflecting annual improvement of 12.4%. Therefore, we may expect its upcoming results to reflect such solid cash flow features, as we have witnessed in prior years, buoyed by the scrumptious orders that Boeing won in the first quarter. What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model shows that Boeing is likely to beat earnings this quarter. For this to happen, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Well, Boeing possesses the right combination currently, as the Zacks Rank #2 company has an Earnings ESP of +1.70%.

597,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, General Dynamics Mission Systems, recently secured a $144-million contract for the operation, maintenance and expansion of the global U.S. Battlefield Information Collection and Exploitation System Extended (US BICES-X) federated trusted network environment infrastructure. Operations related to the deal will be carried out across multiple locations globally.The contract was awarded by the Secretary of the Air Force, Concepts, Development, and Management Office, Pentagon, Washington, DC. General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds to partially finance the task. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be completed by Mar 31, 2024.A Brief Note on US BICES-XThe global US BICES-X is a communication system that provides U.S. forces, NATO and other military organizations with near-real-time, correlated, situation and order of battle information. US BICES-X extends these capabilities across the Department of Defense to the different combatant commands.What is Favoring General Dynamics?Due to rising security threats, the defense budget funding’s focus has shifted toward upgrading existing capabilities and emphasizing on ISR, cyber security and space technology. Such macroeconomic factors have been boosting General Dynamics’ growth prospects, in particular its Information Systems and Technology segment, which deals with communication systems. Evidently, the segment generated revenues of $2,487 million, up 9.5%, in the fourth quarter of 2017.Moreover, General Dynamics being one of Pentagon’s prime contractors has been acquiring quite a few contracts from the Department of Defense of late. In February, its Mission Systems unit secured a $208-million contract for the delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR). Such inflow of orders, including the latest one, will enable the segment to deliver similar encouraging performance in days ahead.Its recent acquisition of CSRA Inc. is also poised to benefit General Dynamics massively. The deal makes the latter the largest provider of integrated information technology services to the federal government along with boosting its global workforce by more than 19,000 that will enable the company to speed up operations and upgrade its information systems for delivering cost-effective, next-generation IT solutions to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.Price Movement    General Dynamics’ stock has returned about 15.6% in the past one year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 45.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report).

598,GD,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report), known for brands like Bell Helicopter and Cessna Aircraft, is scheduled to report first-quarter 2018 results, before the market opens on Apr 18.We expect sales growth at the Industrial segment, which accounts for the majority of Textron’s top line, to drive first-quarter revenues. However, the rebound in the Bell segment in the last reported quarter may not continue in the to-be-reported quarter.Let’s discuss these factors in detail.Industrial Segment — Remains a Key CatalystTextron’s Industrial segment designs and manufactures automotive engine components, specialized vehicles as well as varied industry-related tools and equipment. While management expects the Arctic Cat acquisition to continue driving this segment, innovation of specialized vehicles is anticipated to provide more impetus. In line with this, Textron launched HF600 heavy-duty reel mower, new models of GA Aerator Series, TR Series trim mowers as well as Cushman Hauler 800 and 800X utility vehicles in the first quarter.Meanwhile, improved demand in the snow retail channel has been lately driving sales at this unit and is expected to do the same in 2018. These developments altogether are anticipated to substantially boost segmental revenues in the yet-to-be reported quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this segment’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $1 billion, reflecting a 4.1% improvement from the prior-year quarter’s $961 million.Will the Bell Segment Weigh on Growth?  The Bell segment, managed to deliver improved results in the third and fourth quarters of 2017, after showing weak performance in many of the prior quarters. However, management fears that the segment may again see a drop in sales on account of lower military volumes.With management expecting lower military sales throughout 2018 and dearth of contract inflows from the Pentagon in the first quarter, we expect the upcoming results to reflect decline in revenues at the Bell segment. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s first-quarter sales is pegged at $680 million, reflecting a 15% decline from the prior-year quarter’s $800 million.Other Factors at PlayIn addition to the afore-mentioned factors, Textron expects to witness higher aftermarket revenues driven by increased aircraft utilization. This, in turn, is likely to boost first-quarter sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron’s total sales is pegged at $3.11 billion, reflecting a year-over-year rise of 0.7%.Moreover, since the beginning of 2018, the company has adopted a revenue recognition accounting standard. As a result, Textron expects an increase in retained earnings of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2018, with no restatement of prior periods.The company is also expected to incur lower corporate tax expenses in 2018, thanks to the U.S. government’s latest tax reform. This, in turn, may get reflected in the form of improved bottom-line growth in the upcoming results. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Textron’s first-quarter earnings is pegged at 46 cents, in line with the year-ago quarter’s figure.Textron Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Textron Inc.

599,GD,"Rising fears of a trade war between China and the United States unnerved investors, sending Wall Street on a bumpy ride for past few weeks. In particular, the market tumbled on President Trump’s proposal of imposing a tariff of $60 billion on Chinese imports. In retaliation China threatened to levy a hefty tariff on a number of American goods.  However, these developments did not have any major impact on the U.S. defense stocks. In fact, the recent joint venture (JV) that aircraft major Boeing formed with Saudi Arabian Military Industries is likely to keep the U.S. defense industry on a growth trajectory. The deal is also likely to boost the growth prospects of other defense majors as well. Evidently, a few of them have already started to win contracts from Saudi Arabia. Consequently, major indices in the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the green over the past five trading sessions. Both the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) index and the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense index rose 1.7%, over that time frame. Moreover, keeping with its usual trend, the U.S. defense industry witnessed a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon over the trailing five sessions.Among the highlights of the last week, defense majors Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report)  secured a number of orders from the Department of Defense’s daily funding session. General Dynamics completed the CSRA acquisition.Recap of Last Week’s Key Stories1. Raytheon secured a contract fordelivering Patriot Missile Systems to Poland, after the country signed a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (“LOA”) agreement with the U.S. government.Per Reuters, this deal, valued at $4.75 billion, requires Raytheon to deliver two Patriot System Batteries, each with two fire units in 2022. This is a major achievement for Raytheon, since in spite of the U.S. State Department having cleared a potential $10.5 billion sale of four Patriot defense systems to Poland last November, the deal got stuck in cross-border negotiations.Per the agreement, Raytheon will continue to work with Polish defense companies and help them build key parts of the missile system (read more: Raytheon to Gain From US-Poland $4.8B Deal for Patriot). 2. Boeing won a contract worth $1.2 billion for providing long-lead non-recurring engineering to develop a baseline configuration for the production and delivery of 22 F/A-18E and 6 F/A-18F Super Hornets. These services will be providedto the government of Kuwait.The contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, Maryland.

After engaging in a brief period of bidding war against CACI International, General Dynamics successfully acquired CSRA on Apr 3, for $9.7 billion, which includes a $2.8 billion debt.CSRA has thus become part of General Dynamics’ Information Systems & Technology segment. Following the closure of the transaction, General Dynamics has acquired all of CSRA’s outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash.The acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to the company’s earnings per share and cash flow next year.

600,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently clinched a modification contract for purchasing missile tube long-lead-time material to support the Columbia-class fleet ballistic missile submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by December 2023.Details of the DealValued at $126.2 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. The agreement is a joint U.S./U.K. Common Missile Compartment program, work for which will be carried out in Quonset Point, RI. The U.S. Navy will purchase 72% of the modification, while the government of the U.K. will acquire the remaining 28%, under the Foreign Military Sales program.Fiscal 2018 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy); and U.K. funding will be utilized to finance the majority portion of the task.A Brief Note on Columbia-class SubmarineThe Columbia-class submarine program, formerly known as the Ohio replacement submarine program, was designed by the Navy to replace its existing force of 14 Trident-armed Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines with a new class of 12 ballistic missile submarines. Originally built by Electric Corp., the Columbia-class submarines are also operated by the U.K., Russia, China, France and India.Under the Navy’s Submarine Unified Build Strategy, the Columbia-class submarines will be jointly constructed by General Dynamics’ Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries’ (HII  -  Free Report) Newport New division. However, the Navy has requested General Dynamics to continue as the prime contractor for designing and building the Columbia-class boats.Why General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics is a leading Navy contractor. Apart from this, the company continues to be a prime contractor for the development of Virginia-class submarines (another class of nuclear-powered submarine), with Huntington acting as the subcontractor.Meanwhile, in February 2018, President Trump proposed fiscal 2019 defense budget which included investment provisions worth $3.7 billion for Columbia-Class Submarine. With General Dynamics being a prime contractor, we may expect the company to win more such contracts like the latest one, which will undoubtedly poise the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics’ stock has rallied about 8.1% in past three months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 6.3%. The outperformance may have been driven by the company’s consistent focus on research and development, diverse customer base and an attractive product mix.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks                                    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A few better-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

601,GD,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) on Mar 30, 2018 announced that it has signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) with Saudi Arabian Military Industries (“SAMI”) to form a new Joint Venture (""JV"") worth $450 million. The JV will help to localize more than 55% of the maintenance, repair and overhaul (“MRO”) services for fixed and rotary-wing military jets in Saudi Arabia.Interestingly, this tie-up got finalized a week after President Trump praised Saudi Arabia for being a ‘big purchaser’ of American weaponries, during Saudi crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman’s visit to the White House. The latest JV further strengthens the relationship between the oil-rich Saudi Arabia and largest weapon exporter America.Strengthening Boeing-Saudi Arabia RelationshipOver the years, Boeing has developed a genial relationship with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (""KSA""). The former U.S. President Roosevelt’s gifting of a DC-3 Dakota jet to the Saudi king in 1945 enabled the aircraft major to initiate commercial business in the nation. The company’s defense unit started doing business with the nation following Royal Saudi Air Force’s (“RSAF”) purchase of F-15C/D fleet in 1978. Notably, this remains the mainstay of KSA’s air defense till date.Since then, Boeing has been winning a number of contracts from the KSA for advanced military weaponries. Of the latest notable deals, in August 2017, the company won a $223-million contract for supplying eight CH-47F new helicopters to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command (""RSLFAC""). It goes without saying that the latest JV will allow the company to expand its footprint in KSA, which has bountiful prospects.Also, through the latest JV the Saudis aim to progress with their Vision 2030 program — a project aimed at auguring KSA’s long-term economic growth. The latest MoA is expected to improve KSA’s local research, design, engineering, manufacturing and MRO abilities, with help from Boeing. The JV will also help to enhance maintenance capabilities and lower the support cost of the Saudi military fleet as well as prepare them to be ready for action at short notice. This, in turn, is likely to help enhance the performance of the Saudi army.Additionally, the agreement is expected to help create 6,000 jobs and training opportunities for the Saudi youth, support local content and improve Saudization levels in the industry. Boeing has also agreed to provide the technological know-how required to install weaponry on the aircraft included in the JV as well as localize the supply chain for spare parts. We believe, with Vision 2030 in view this JV will help the company to earn more profits from this oil-rich nation.Defense Majors to Tread Growth Track: Here’s WhyIn response to Trump’s plaudits last month, Salman committed to invest $400 billion in the United States over the long run. Last year, the two nations signed an arms deal with a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years. With Saudi Arabia being America's one of the most important partners in the Middle East, these investment strategies show the huge growth prospects that the U.S defense primes enjoy in KSA.In fact, the White House informed the Congress on Mar 22 that it plans to approve a $1-billion arms sale deal to Saudi Arabia, a package that includes vending about 6,700 U.S.-built TOW anti-tank missiles, along with providing support, maintenance and spare parts for American tanks, helicopters and other equipment already in Saudi Arabia's arsenal.  We believe the latest JV to be a by-product of that plan.Now that Boeing has signed the MoA with the kingdom, in light of the recent investment strategies we expect other defense majors, who already enjoy a good business rapport with KSA, to follow suit. While a few of them are already getting contracts from the Kingdom, a few other are expected to win such deals soon, as part of the$1-billion plan.3 Defense Stocks to Keep in Your Watch ListWhile Boeing will certainly remain on a growth trajectory now owing to the recent MoA it has signed with SAMI, let us turn our focus toward other defense stocks that have the potential to gain substantially from the recent investment strategies adopted by the Saudi prince. These defense primes not only have a solid growth prospect but are also market outperformers. Moreover, since these stocks also boast a favorable Zacks Rank, they are worth keeping in your watch list.Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) is the largest defense contractor in the world. Following the U.S. administration’s plan to approve $1-billion arms deal, the company has won a modification deal worth $279 million for enhancement of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missiles. Also per the contract, the company will provide cost-reduction initiative (CRI) missiles and associated ground support equipment to Saudi Arabia.Notably, the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average positive earnings surprise of 4.62%. It boasts a solid long-term earnings growth rate of 7.3% and its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has improved 1.4% in the last 60 days.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Lockheed Martin’s shares surged 24.2% in last one year outperforming the S&P 500 market index’s gain of 9.7%.  Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is a defense major with a diversified line of military products, including missiles, radars, sensors, surveillance and reconnaissance equipment, communication and information systems, naval systems, air traffic control systems, and technical services. With the latest $1-billion arms deal proposal, involving the sale of TOW anti-tank missiles made by Raytheon, the company will be a significant beneficiary.The company topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 6.36%. It boasts a solid long-term earnings growth rate of 10.9% and its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has improved 0.2% in the last 60 days.The company carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Raytheon’s shares surged 41.4% over a year, outperforming the S&P 500 market index’s rally.  General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) engages in mission-critical information systems and technologies; land and expeditionary combat vehicles, armaments and munitions; shipbuilding and marine systems; and business aviation. Thanks to the $1-billion deal’s proposal, the State Department announced that it is planning to approve the possible sale of Abrams tanks and armored vehicles worth $300 million to Saudi Arabia. With General Dynamics being the primary contractor for these tanks, this plan’s approval will surely boost its profit margin.The company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters with an average beat of 4.02%. It boasts a solid long-term earnings growth rate of 8.5% and its Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 earnings has improved 5.2% in the last 90 days.The company carries a Zacks Rank #3. General Dynamics’ shares gained17.4% in a year’s time, outperforming the S&P 500 market index’s growth.  Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

604,GD,"General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) recently won against CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report) in the bidding war for the acquisition of CSRA Inc. . Following a month-long battle, CACI surrendered after a higher purchase price was offered by General Dynamics.Interestingly, General Dynamics has revised its acquisition deal with CSRA on Mar 20, 2018. Per the agreement, General Dynamics will acquire all of CSRA’S outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash, reflecting an increase of 50 cents from the previous proposal. This amounts the total transaction value at $9.7 billion, including $2.8 billion in debt.What Gave General Dynamics the Upper Hand?In March 2018, General Dynamics offered to buy CASR for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt, while CACI proposed $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover. Although, CACI’s offering of $44 per share was apparently more profitable for CSRA’s shareholders, compared with General Dynamics proposal of $40.75 a share, there remained a few concerns.  For instance, time value of money for investors played a major role in shifting the favor toward General Dynamics. As CACI was planning to close the acquisition formalities by Jul 31, 2018, investors would have had to incur significant opportunity costs due to the four-month lag compared to General Dynamics, which already planned of completing the transaction by early April.Moreover, General Dynamics believed that CACI’s offer overstated the real value to the CSRA shareholders and understated the overall risks involved. It also stood against CACI’s proposal burdening CSRA with approximately $6.8 billion of debt, once acquired.All these factors made analysts favor General Dynamics. The last nail in the coffin came after General Dynamics hiked its cash offer by $100 million last week, making it difficult for CACI to match up. Consequently, CACI withdrew its buyout offer, thereby leaving General Dynamics as the sole prospective acquirer.  What’s Ahead for General Dynamics?In the age of digitization, widespread cyber attacks have prompted all nations to enhance their focus on strengthening their cyber security space. America being the largest digitally advanced country is also the forerunner of securing its technology software and services, thereby expanding the realm for cyber security providers.Per a report published by Forrester, global purchases of technology software and services by businesses and governments will grow by 4% and software and tech consulting services by 6% in 2018. Therefore, the latest buyout proposal for CSRA by General Dynamics seems to be a strategic step taken by this defense major to expand its footprint in the cyber security space. Notably, the CSRA buyout can help General Dynamics in creating new segment focused on the growing Federal IT services space and in accelerating its growth and profitability, along with improving value proposition and customer base.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock has returned about 17.7% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 46.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space.Zacks Rank & Key Pick    General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Boeing recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 20.69% in the last four quarters.

606,GD,"On Sunday, North Korea raised global geopolitical tensions after it claimed it had conducted a sixth and substantially more powerful nuclear test. This announcement also significantly increased pressure on the Trump administration, representing the most serious foreign affairs crisis in years.Much of this depends on how the United States ultimately responds to this latest provocation from North Korea. However, initial reactions suggest that policymakers are still weighing their options and are likely to issue a studied and measured response.This is why the impact of this event on the U.S. bourses will largely be limited to the short term. At the same time, a flight toward safe haven assets and another surge in popularity of defense stocks is likely as developments surrounding North Korea continue to unfold.Mattis Issues Stern WarningOn Sep 3, North Korea claimed that it successfully tested a hydrogen bomb capable of being fitted onto an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). In a televised statement, the country claimed that the test was a “perfect success” and guaranteed that North Korea now possessed a credible nuclear warhead.Reacting to the test, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis issued a stern warning to North Korea. Mattis said the errant country would have to face a tremendous military response if it indulged in an act of aggression against the United States or its allies.Over the last few weeks, the Trump administration has hinted that it will explore further steps to isolate North Korea’s economy following its recent actions, especially with regard to testing of missiles and nuclear weapons. Future attempts to curb the country economically could include increasing pressure on China to stop its oil imports to North Korea, a move which could cripple the country in several ways.Defense Stocks to Gain Apart from economic sanctions, the prospects of U.S. military action against North Korea have also increased following Mattis’ strong response to the nuclear test. Given such a backdrop, U.S. defense stocks are likely to mop up considerable gains in the days ahead. Reports from South Korea hinting at further missile tests by its Northern neighbor, including an ICBM launch, are likely to provide further impetus to this sector.This in keeping with gains enjoyed by defense stocks in the aftermath of last week’s missile launch over Japan. On Aug 29, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing into the sea. Following this event, stocks such as Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) moved north. Each of these stocks have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Popularity of Safe Haven Assets to RiseMeanwhile, South Korea carried out live-fire drills, intended to exhibit the country’s military strength, as a response to the nuclear test. Additionally, it is speeding up the deployment of the U.S. manufactured THAAD missile defense system. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that the popularity of safe haven assets is on the rise.Since Sunday’s test, treasuries, gold, the yen and the Swiss franc have all found favor with investors. But such a state of affairs is unlikely to last beyond a point. In the past, investors have participated in a short term selloff and rushed toward safe haven assets in the aftermath of such an event. Subsequently, they have bought the dip soon after receiving indications that tensions have eased or are unlikely to escalate further.In ConclusionNorth Korea’s latest nuclear test is likely to add to U.S. investors’ woes in the week ahead. But this set to be a short term phenomenon, given that U.S. military action in the region still seems unlikely. Given such prospects, markets are likely to focus on strong economic fundamentals and bullish earnings performance of stocks. This means that a major stock slide, even in the midterm, seems unlikely. Stocks are likely to return to their winning ways once tensions begin to recede.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!                   It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Defense stocks continued to receive a moderate flow of fund from the Pentagon. However, major indices of the Aerospace-Defense industry ended in the red over the trailing five sessions.

608,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 24, before the opening bell.We believe order procurement to be a primary growth driver for this defense bellwether’s upcoming third-quarter results. On the other hand, segment operating profit is expected to reflect conflicting numbers in the quarter.Let's have a detailed look at the factors influencing Lockheed Martin’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy of its varied military product offerings.Among the contracts this defenese major won in the third quarter, the significant ones include a $3.8 billion foreign military sales (FMS) deal for multi-year production of Black Hawk helicopters, a contract worth $409 million for Next Generation Thermal, Power, and Controls (NGT-PAC) program and a modification contract worth $5.6 billion to offer low-rate initial production (LRIP) of the 11th lot of F-35 Lightening II Joint Strike Fighter.The company also won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract worth $499 million, another deal worth $900 million for the replacement of the AGM-86B air-launched cruise missile and a modification contract worth $548 million to support production requirement of a Hellfire II missile.It goes without saying that such steady inflow of orders will surely boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Q3 sales growth is pegged at $12.83 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 11.04%.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteOperating Profit: A Mixed BagDuring its second-quarter earnings call, Lockheed Martin raised its total segment operating profit for 2017, citing improved expectations for Aeronautics business unit, for the remaining year.  Our consensus estimate also predicted numbers in line with this expectation. Thus this segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $535 million, up 23.8% year over year.However, the consensus estimate for the Space Systems business unit reflects an annual decline of 11.8% to $224 million, in contrast to an improved number expected by the company.Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise each of Lockheed Martin’s segments has positive sales growth expectation, in line with what management hinted last quarter. Our consensus estimate showed notable sales growth in all the three segments of Lockheed Martin in the third quarter.However in terms of bottom-line growth, expectations are not so bright for the yet-to-be-reported quarter. For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is $3.25 per share, down 9.9% year over year. Moreover, this estimate has declined by a couple of cents in past 60 days.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Lockheed Martin has an Earnings ESP of -0.68%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $3.23, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.25.

Notably, the modern-day nuclear-powered submarines are markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.In the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). As a result both companies enjoy a large share of the market as well as high profit margins.It is imperative to mention in this context that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers like Huntington Ingalls in boosting production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How Will the Deal Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% and to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 47.9% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 45.3% gain. The company is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S. Over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships and the company continues to enjoy strong order growth from the U.S. Navy. This in turn may have led to the company’s aforementioned outperformance.  Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the aerospace-defense space are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2.

613,GD,"Wednesday, January 24, 2018This morning’s pre-market indexes look for fresh all-time highs today, as another robust earnings season hits high gear. Commodities like oil and gold are also starting in positive territory this morning, and the 10-year t-bill is now residing around 2.65%. All good things, relatively.Let’s start Q4 reports with the worst performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average through 2017: General Electric (GE  -  Free Report). The Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company with a Zacks Style Score of F (Value, Growth, Momentum) missed bottom line estimates of 28 cents per share by a penny, on quarterly revenues of $31.4 billion which fell far short of the $32.9 billion expected in the Zacks consensus.For fiscal 2018, GE guidance is currently between $1.00-1.07 per share. Recently installed CEO John Flannery has called 2018 a “reset year,” seeking to reduce corporate costs by $2 billion and laying off 12K GE workers.

615,GD,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a contract for the Royal Saudi Air Force (RSAF) airborne warning and control system (AWACS) modernization program phase 1. It has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hanscom Air Force Base, MA.Contract DetailsPer the $240.2 million contract, Boeing will offer AWACS mission computing, navigation and communications upgrades as well as the next generation in identification, friend or foe enhancement designs. In addition, it covers foreign military sales to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.Work will be carried out at Oklahoma City, OK and is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2019.A Brief Note on AWACSInitiated in 1977, Boeing’s AWACS was derived from its 707 model. Markedly, the company’s 707-320B and the E-3 airframe based system deals with command and control, and surveillance and communications activities for strategic and defensive missions. Also, it has been used by the U.S. Air Force, Japanese Air Self Defense Force, North Atlantic Treaty Organization, RSAF, the UK, and the French Republic.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and emerges by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog among its peers. In particular, the company’s key forte has been its combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late. Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.In September, Boeing secured a modification contract worth $600 million to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization program. Again, it won a $676.6 million deal to offer full-rate production of six Lot 41 F/A-18E and eight F/A-18F aircraft. Going forward, we expect these recently won contracts to add impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Additionally, recent Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. This, in turn, might prove to be beneficial for defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) in the near term.Price MovementShares of Boeing have skyrocketed 93.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 54.4%. This impressive performance can be attributed to the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

616,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat, has clinched a $28.6 million modification contract to exercise options for reactor plant planning yard services for nuclear-powered submarines.The company will also support yard services for the Navy’s moored training ships. Markedly, the deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractPer the modification contract, Electric Boat will offer furnishing, fabricating, or purchasing materials, supplies and services that will likely be required to perform the functions of the planning yard for reactor plants and related portions of the propulsion plants for nuclear powered submarines. The unit will also support yard services for moored training ships.While majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT, the rest will be performed at Charleston, SC. It will be completed, using fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) as well as fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds, by September 2018.Nuclear Submarines and the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.Currently, the U.S. Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.In fact, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States, operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). As a result, both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins.In this context, it is imperative to mention that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, in the fiscal 2017 budget proposal $8.1 billion fund was allocated for submarines.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. In addition, the company is a prime contractor for the development of Columbia-class submarines and Virginia-class submarines.Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, we believe the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Furthermore, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Going forward, the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have surged 41.8% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%. This might have been caused by the company’s declining backlogs in recent times. Additionally, the stock faces stiff competition from its industry peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

This will benefit General Dynamics to witness robust growth since it is one of the major players in the wheeled military vehicle market.General Dynamics’ Abrams tanks provide troops with a proven decisive edge. In addition, survivability, mobility, adaptability and maintainability are important features of the tank. These capabilities make the tanks formidable. The company is the only producer of this tank in the United States, while Abrams is the only battle tank used by the U.S. military.General Dynamics enjoys a strong international customer base for its Abrams tank, with countries like Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Iraq being the primary customers. Surely the latest move to upgrade these tanks will encourage international customers to modernize their existing battle tanks fleet, which in turn will invite more foreign contracts for General Dynamics.The company intends to continue with this legacy but at lower operational and support cost. It also plans to extend service life of these tanks to 2030 and bolster the M1A1’s capabilities in urban operations. With the current U.S. administration in favor of scrumptious defense spending as well as the huge demand that the Abram fleet of tanks already enjoy in the global space, we expect the company to win more such contracts from Pentagon.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics stock has moved up about 15.7% over a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 43.2%. This underperformance may have been caused due to the budget cuts made by the prior government and the intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank & Key PicksGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).A few better-ranked stocks from the same sector are Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report), Leidos Holdings, Inc.

619,GD,"The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) business division, Defense, Space & Security, recently secured a foreign military sales (FMS) contract worth $6.2 billion. Per the terms of the deal, the company will procure 36 new F-15QA aircraft that will be provided to the Qatar Emiri Air Force.The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH and is scheduled to be over by Dec 30, 2022. FMS funds will be utilized to partially finance the work, which will be executed in St.Louis, MI.    A Brief Note on F-15 Boeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all-weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is unbeatable in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories. The F-15QA is a variant of F-15 that has been developed for the Qatar Air Force.Our ViewBoeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, with its defense business standing out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog.In particular, among other defense equipment, the company’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. So far, Boeing has manufactured more than 1,600 of the aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire the F-15, thereby indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability. In 2016, the company delivered 15 F-15s, up 25% from the year-ago tally.In October 2015, Boeing was selected by the U.S. Air Force as the prime contractor for its Eagle Passive Active Warning Survivability System program, which was initially valued at $4 billion. The program was developed to counter threats and protect air crew at an advanced level and aimed at upgrading F-15 aircraft.  Needless to say, this reflects the popularity that this particular jet enjoys in the United States.With rising security threats across the globe, apart from developed nations like the United States, developing economies like India, Qatar and a few more are ramping up their arsenal. Considering this we may expect further expansion of customer base for F-15, beyond its domestic realm, which in turn will boost Boeing’s profit from its defense business.Moreover, the $700-billion worth fiscal 2018 defense policy bill that got sanctioned this September by the U.S. Senate, is expected to boost the business of the major U.S. defense contractors like Boeing, General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price PerformanceBoeing’s stock has moved up 87.4% over a year, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 43.1%. This might have been led by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Zacks Rank Boeing currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

620,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aeronautics business division recently secured a contract for offering comprehensive F-22 air vehicle sustainment.  Work related to this deal is scheduled to get over by Dec 31, 2027.Details of the DealValued at $7 billion, this contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UH. The deal includes five-year base ordering period. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partially finance the task.Work will be performed at five operational bases and six support locations situated across various parts of the United States as well as overseas locations, combat deployment and enroute support bases, potential locations through depot partnering agreements, and system program office locations.A Brief Note on F-22Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor is the fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft with a unique combination of stealth, speed, agility and situational awareness along with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry.However, high development costs, ban on exports and development of the more versatile F-35 aircraft led to the discontinuation of F-22 production few years back. Nevertheless, the company’s F-22 team remains committed to provide full support for Follow-on Agile Sustainment, a comprehensive weapons management program. This award-winning performance-based logistics contract offers a highly integrated F-22 support system.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Of late, there has been a rapid increase in terrorist activities across the globe. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is leaving no stone unturned to develop  tactical weaponries base.Pentagon being the prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Naturally, the number of contracts it wins from Pentagon is also noteworthy. Moreover, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), among others.In particular, in September 2017, the U.S. Senate approved the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, include funding for various defense programs. This has been a primary factor which is expected to rake in more orders for the defense majors in the long run.During the third-quarter earnings call, Lockheed Martin’s management increased outlook for 2017 profit for Aeronautics, Space Systems and Missiles and Fire Control by $35 million, reflecting both improved performance and higher volumes. We believe significant contract wins like the latest one will substantially help the company achieve this increased profit target.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 25.4% in last 12 months, underperforming the 42.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This underperformance was mostly led by intense competition that the company faces in the domestic and international markets. Zacks Rank Lockheed Martin currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

621,GD,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) reported third-quarter 2017 deliveries, wherein commercial shipments were up 7.4% on a year-over-year basis. However, defense shipments were 12% lower than the year-ago figure.Commercial DeliveriesThe year-over-year improvement was primarily driven by higher deliveries of 737 model. Boeing’s other models 777, 787 and 767 jets, registered marginal year-over-year drop in deliveries. In the reported quarter, the company delivered 202 airplanes.Delivery of the single-aisle 737 jets improved to 145 from 120 a year ago. Shipments of the 777 and 787 Dreamliners were 16 and 35 compared with 22 and 36 in the year-ago period, respectively. The company delivered two 767 jets compared with five in the year-ago quarter. Deliveries of 747 jets were four compared with five in the year-ago period.Year to date, commercial deliveries were 554 airplanes compared with 563 in the year-ago period.Commercial Order & Backlog A look at Boeing’s third-quarter order details reveals that the company booked 127 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects a drop from the year-ago figure of 150.At the end of third quarter, the backlog of commercial airplanes touched 5,679. This clearly indicates the dominance and popularity of Boeing in commercial aerospace. The customers are willing to wait for years to get delivery for the high quality aeroplane Boeing offers.Defense DeliveriesIt is to be noted that in the defense and space business, Boeing’s deliveries totaled 44 in the third quarter compared with 50 in the year-ago quarter. Total deliveries consisted of 18 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 11 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed). In addition, the company delivered six F/A-18s, five P-8 models and four F-15s.Development in Defense SpaceWe expect that the new development in the defense space is likely to increase the defense orders for Boeing.The Senate has approved a $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act, which provides necessary funding to the U.S. Military to carry out activities in homeland and overseas. The bill authorizes $640 billion for national defense spending and $60 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations.The new bill authorizes $2.9 billion for procuring 17 KC - 46A tankers, which is $400 million and two tankers more than the administration’s request. It also authorizes $3 billion for Army helicopters, including nearly $1.8 billion for different variant of Chinooks Helicopters. Boeing is going to directly benefit from this development.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has increased 93.4% in the last 12 months, outperforming the Zacks Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 52.3%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Our ViewBoeing anticipates that in next two decades, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion. The company expects cost effective single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion.We believe Boeing, with its high quality single-isle 737 model, is well placed to capture a large  share of the new orders of commercial jets.Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

622,GD,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Space Systems, recently secured a contract for conducting the Airborne Launch Control System Replacement (ALCS-R) program. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Oct 2, 2020.Details of the DealValued at $80.8 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Per the deal, Lockheed Martin will conduct technology maturation and risk reduction for delivering a preliminary design and developing a fully functional prototype.  The company will utilize fiscal 2017 and 2018 research, development, test, and evaluation funds to complete the task at Littleton, CO.Moreover, through this agreement, ALCS-R aims to replace the legacy Airborne Launch Control System (ALCS) with an affordable system, to support the Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile weapon system. This replacement is expected to be complete by 2036. This in turn will offer a solution to meet the survivable launch platform — airborne fire control requirements for the ground based strategic deterrent weapon system through 2075. A Brief Note on Minuteman IIIThe Minuteman III is a strategic weapon system of the United States that uses a ballistic missile of intercontinental range. Through the state-of- -art improvements, the Minuteman system has evolved to meet new challenges. Modernization programs have expanded targeting options and improved accuracy and survivability of this system.Our ViewALCS help in conducting missile tests and deploying missiles successfully. During loss of command capability between the launch control center and remote missile launch facilities ALCS automatically assume command and control of the isolated missile or missiles.It is imperative to mention in this context that Lockheed Martin enjoys a legacy in developing operational intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and has been continuously supporting the Air Force’s ICBM mission since the beginning, as the developer of the Atlas, Titan, MX Peacekeeper and Small ICBMs. Also the company is the leading provider of ground command and control systems for today’s Minuteman III.With increasing geopolitical tensions across the globe, it has become a necessary mandate for nations to stock up their arsenals to defend terrorist attacks. For the United States, the frequent missile tests conducted by North Korea have been sending a strong message of hostility toward America for past few months. As a result, the latter has been enthusiastically strengthening its missile stack in recent periods. The latest contract for ALCS-R reaffirms this fact.With Lockheed Martin being the largest defense contractor worldwide and given its combat-proven military equipments, we can expect more such contracts to usher in from Pentagon, which in turn will substantially boost its growth trajectory.Moreover, the recently approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion also buoys optimism for investing in major defense stocks. Therefore the time is ripe to add defense primes like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) in your watchlist.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 32.2% over a year, underperforming the 50.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This may have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which despite being a prime project of the U.S. government has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Zacks Rank & Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin presently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

624,GD,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) business segment, Rotary and Mission Systems, clinched a modification contract for providing electronic warfare equipment to support Virginia-class submarines. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by April 2020.Details of the DealValued at $71.5 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington Navy Yard, D.C. Majority of the work will be executed in Syracuse, NY and Fairfax, VA; while the rest will be performed in Germantown, MD; Van Nuys, CA and Buffalo, NY.The contract will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion, fiscal 2016 shipbuilding and conversion, fiscal 2017 other procurement and fiscal 2016 other procurement funds to complete the task.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class Submarines The Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs), designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions. These are being jointly constructed by military shipbuilders General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these ships will be operational until 2070.What’s Electronic Warfare?Electronic Warfare (EW) represents the ability to use the electromagnetic spectrum-signals such as radio, infrared or radar — to sense, protect, and communicate. Being one of the top-graded defense contractors in the world, Lockheed Martin manufacturers advanced EW technologies that have the ability to control the electromagnetic spectrum.  The company also develops disruptive technologies to combat adversary threats.For the U.S. Navy, Lockheed Martin offers a handful of next-generation EW systems like the Advanced Off-Board Electronic Warfare (AOEW), Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (SEWIP) and MK234 Nulka Off board Countermeasure System. By incorporating these new age warfare systems, the Navy fleets can detect incoming threats and effectively respond to them.Our ViewThe U.S. Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. Currently, the Navy plans to procure two Virginia-class submarines in fiscal 2018, for a total investment worth $5.5 billion. The move will boost the ship’s manufacturers — General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls — along with Lockheed Martin, the EW of which will be installed in these ships. We believe the recent modification contract is a notable step toward the fulfillment of the plan.Moreover, the fiscal 2017 defense budget strongly emphasized on enhancing the nation’s EW capabilities along with other defensive abilities. In particular, the budget included an investment of $1.2 billion for upgrading the U.S. fleets by spending more on development including for that of EW.  This raises hope for increased demand for Lockheed Martin’s combat-proven EW systems, which in turn will boost its revenues.Lockheed Martin’s EW serves the U.S., Australian and Canadian Navy. Going ahead, the global EW market is expected to reach a value worth $25.36 billion by 2021 and with Lockheed Martin being a dominating player in the space, the stock is poised to grow.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has moved up 26.5% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 39.5%.This could be of the present defense budget which is in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks Rank & Key PickLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

628,GD,"General Dynamics Corp’s (GD  -  Free Report) Mission Systems business recently won a contract for the procurement, manufacturing, testing and delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR) systems. The defense major will also supply high frequency distribution amplifier group components, spare parts and engineering services to support field and maintenance work.Closer Look at the DealValued at $198 million, the contract was awarded by the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command, San Diego, CA. Work will be executed in Scottsdale, AZ, and is scheduled to be over by Dec 2022.General Dynamics will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to complete the work. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $209 million, if the options included in the contract are exercised.Details on DMR SystemsDMR is a modular, software defined reprogrammable radio system with embedded cryptography that provides all radio frequencies (RF) to-baseband and baseband-to-RF conversion functions required for line-of-sight (LOS). It offers multiple waveforms and multi-level information security for voice and data communications using frequencies ranging from 2.0 megahertz to 2.0 gigahertz.Notably, General Dynamics’ AN/USC-61 (C) DMR is the first software defined radio to become a communications system standard for the U.S. Military.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics’ Mission Systems unit is a leading integrator of mission critical C4ISR solutions across the land, sea, air, space and cyber domain. This unit falls under the company's Information Systems & Technology (IS&T) segment, which offers high-assurance mission and display systems, signal and sensor processing and command-and-control solutions for airborne platforms. Its aircraft mission computers are installed in the Navy's F/A-18 Super Hornet strike fighter and Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier II aircraft, providing pilots with advanced situational awareness and combat systems control.Currently, the company’s DMR operates overseas on the U.S. Navy surface and sub-surface vessels, fixed-sites and other Department of Defense communication platforms. Although IS&T segment revenues declined year over year in the third quarter of 2017, management forecasts strong fourth-quarter results from this segment. This may have been driven by expectations of strong DMR demand. The latest contract win is reflective of this bullishness.Considering the favorable defense budget scenario in the United States, we expect General Dynamics to win more such contracts, which in turn will boost the IS&T segment further.Price PerformanceShares of General Dynamics have rallied about 13.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s 34.8%. Budget cuts by the prior government have probably led to the underperformance.Zacks Rank & Key PicksGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

629,GD,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is currently benefiting from stable financials and also providing regular cash returns to shareholders. Evidently, during the first nine months of 2017, the company paid $82 million worth of dividend, up from $70 million a year ago. In November 2017, the company announced a quarterly dividend hike of 20% to 72 cents per share.Going forward, based on its strong cash generating capabilities, the company continues to expect to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividend hikes of at least 10% annually.Being the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the United States, over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships. This has helped the company to expand its service portfolio.Additionally, the solid fiscal 2018 budget proposal, along with the additional appropriations bill put forward by President Trump, has boosted the growth prospects of the company. Moreover, Huntington Ingalls continues to urge both the Executive Branch and the Congress to support investment in defense sector in 2018 and beyond, which will efficiently leverage its profitable production lines.Going forward, Huntington Ingalls projects to invest approximately $1.5 billion by 2020 to strengthen its core shipbuilding business. This is expected to boost the company’s earnings numbers going forward. Notably, the company delivered positive earnings surprise in two of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 14.22%.Moreover, its current year Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has improved 4.2% in past 60 days. Impressively, the company boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 15% compared favorably to the industry’s rate of 11.7%.However, the company faces steep competition from another shipbuilding giant General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), in its primary business of designing, building, overhauling, and repairing military ships.  Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingallshave outperformed the industry in the last three months. The stock has advanced 11.5% compared with the industry’s growth of 11.2%.This can be attributed to the company’s solid cash generating capabilities along with recent developments witnessed in the shipbuilding business.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

631,GD,"L3 Technologies, Inc. (LLL  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 26, before the opening bell.Last quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 8.87%. Moreover, it surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 9.70%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayL3 Technologies expects sales of roughly $2.7 billion in the to-be-reported quarter, which reflects about a 6% organic growth. While operating margin is anticipated to lie in the mid-9% range, earnings per share is projected to be between $1.85 and  $1.95. Again, free cash flow is forecasted in the range of $150 million to $200 million.However, the company expects Aerospace Systems segment to decline in the third quarter compared with the first half of 2017. This is primarily due to certain contract price modifications at Vertex sliding into the fourth quarter of 2016, and sales mix in Intelligence, Surveillance & Reconnaissance (ISR) as well as aircraft systems.While the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects 3.12% year-over-year growth, the same for revenues is pegged at $2.69 billion, implying a 7.40% year-over-year improvement.L-3 Communications Holdings, Inc.

632,GD,"The Q3 earnings season is in full swing with 87 S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly results as of Oct 20. So far, the results reflect a positive and reassuring view of corporate earnings, which will most likely get strengthened as we move in the thick of the reporting cycle.Notably, 24.7% of the index’s total market cap have reported results. While annual earnings have improved 9.4%, revenues increased 7.3%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 71.3%, while that for top line was 70.1%, as of Oct 20.Coming to the Aerospace-Defense industry, we saw Textron Inc. (TXT) kick-starting the Q3 earnings season last week with better-than-expected quarterly numbers. Several other majors in this space are slated to report third-quarter results this week.Notably, projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at a mixed quarter, when compared to the overall Q3 forecast for the S&P 500 cohort. The sector’s earnings are likely to decline 12.9% on 5.3% higher revenues; while earnings for S&P 500 members are likely to rise 2.6% on 5% higher revenues. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Interestingly, defense stocks in the third quarter reached new-all-time highs multiple times, courtesy of the varied supportive defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. In particular, the favorable budgetary amendments made by the U.S. government, like the passing of the fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 million, have boosted growth prospects of defense stocks. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon to ‘rebuild’ the U.S. Army also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are surely to gain notable traction in coming days.With more than 700 companies (180 S&P 500 members) slated to report their results this week, let’s find out where the following defense stocks stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Oct 25.The Boeing Company’s (BA  -  Free Report) solid deliveries of commercial aircraft are expected to primarily drive the company’s growth in the third quarter. Notably, its commercial deliveries showed a 7.4% annual improvement. Also a solid inflow of contracts for varied defense product offerings from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies will boost its quarterly sales.Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales growth is pegged at $24.06 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%.Moreover, thanks to the huge number of commercial orders that the company won, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has predicted higher operating numbers for the third quarter. Commercial Airplanes segment’s operating profit is now expected to be $1,756 million, up 10% year over year.Meanwhile, our proven model does not conclusively show an earnings beat for Boeing this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. However, Boeing lacks the right combination.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third quarter sales is $7.9 billion, reflecting 2.1% year-over-year growth.In particular, the company won a number of contracts in relation to its submarines. Being one of the top-notch submarine contractors in the nation, such contracts are expected to bolster the company’s Marine Systems segment’s growth. Evidently, our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems’ sales stands at $2,068 million, up 0.2% annually.However, Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year might be dented owing to unfavorable margins improvement. Our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at $2,039 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.2%.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of -0.01%.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteNorthrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) Aerospace Systems segment that fetch almost half of its sales, is a primary contributor to its quarterly growth.Notably, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft mainly boosts this segment’s sales. In the third quarter, the company won a number of contracts from the Pentagon. Impressively, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Aerospace Systems segment stands at $2,928 million, reflecting annual growth of 12.9%.Segment-wise, Mission Systems business unit has been benefiting from the cost-reduction initiatives. We expect the third-quarter results to reflect strong sales growth for this unit. Evidently, our consensus estimate for sales for Mission Systems unit is $1,156 million, reflecting annual growth of 1%.On the flip side, increased unallocated corporate expenses and effective tax rate dented the company’s second-quarter earnings growth. Anticipating similar expenses to linger, our consensus estimate for Northrop Grumman’s earnings of $2.92 per share reflects 3.2% annual decline.Moreover, our proven model does not conclusively shows that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is becausethe company currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.93%.

We expect this trend to continue in the soon-to-be-reported quarter as well.In addition, impressive traction of FLIR Systems’ products, featuring the Lepton thermal microcamera core, is anticipated to boost the top line significantly. Also strategic acquisitions are likely to boost the company’s inorganic growth. Previously completed acquisitions, including Armasight, DVTEL and Dynamics, are expected to boost the company’s top-line performance.Our proven model shows that FLIR Systems is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 and has an Earnings ESP of +2.08%.

634,GD,"Leading aircraft manufacturer, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) is set to release third-quarter 2017 results before the opening bell on Oct 25.The company’s results in the to-be-reported quarter are anticipated to be primarily driven by constant contract wins and higher commercial deliveries. Meanwhile, lower defense deliveries are expected to reflect conflicting numbers.Let's have a detailed look at the factors influencing Boeing’s quarterly results.Slew of Contract Wins — Key CatalystBeing largest aircraft manufacturer and one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors in the United States, Boeing enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from both Pentagon as well as foreign allies, courtesy its varied product offerings.Markedly, the company received a number of orders for its commercial jets including a $2.16 billion order from Qatar Airways for two 747-8 Freighters and four 777-300ERs (extended range). Again, it announced that Turkish Airlines intends to purchase 40 787-9 Dreamliners, which are estimated to be valued at approximately $11 billion at list prices.Among the defense contracts won in the third quarter, the significant ones include a $600 million contract to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program. Again, it won a contract worth $323.5 million to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft. Boeing clinched a contract worth $222.5 million for eight CH-47F new build helicopters as well. Considering these defense orders, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.6 billion showed 0.8% sales growth in Integrated Defense System segment.Thus, it goes without saying that such steady inflow of orders will surely boost Boeing’s quarterly sales. Evidently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter sales growth is pegged at $24.06 billion, reflecting year-over-year increase of 0.7%.Q3 Orders & Deliveries: A Mixed BagBoeing’s third-quarter deliveries showed a 7.4% improvement year over year in commercial shipments. However, defense shipments were 12% lower than the year-ago figure. The year-over-year improvement in commercial deliveries was primarily driven by higher deliveries of 737 model. Boeing’s other models 777, 787 and 767 jets, registered marginal year-over-year drop in deliveries.

636,GD,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 3, before the market opens.In the last reported quarter, this military shipbuilder delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.51%. Coming to expectations for the first quarter of 2018, while higher aircraft carriers’ volume is likely to keep the Newport News segment on its toe, tax reform is anticipated to boost earnings growth.Let’s discuss the factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Newport News – A Key CatalystHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last few years. However, in the past couple of reported quarters, this segment’s top line has rebounded to a positive growth trajectory.In particular, higher volumes in aircraft carriers and Navy nuclear support services have been boosting the top line at this segment. We expect first-quarter results to reflect similar trends, which in turn is likely to bolster the segment’s quarterly revenues.  In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Newport News unit’s first-quarter revenues stands at $1,012 million, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.2%.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. QuoteTax Reform: A BoonManagement at Huntington Ingalls believes that the recent adoption of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act by U.S. administration has created an opportunity for the company to increase its investments. Per the company, the latest Tax Reform will allow Huntington Ingalls to push up its investment in Shipbuilding business by $300 million. These investments, in turn, will expand operational capacity at the Ingalls segment and increase investment in digital tools to improve operational efficiencies at Newport News. We believe this will get translated into improved earnings growth for the company, which is expected to be partially reflected in the upcoming quarterly result.In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Huntington Ingalls’ first-quarter earnings of $4.07, represents an annual improvement of 117.7%.Dearth of Order in Q1: A Killjoy?A steady inflow of orders from Pentagon has always provided an impetus to Huntington Ingalls’ results. However, in the first quarter, the company won not many notable contracts. Nevertheless, considering solid contributions from Camber acquisition along with robust sales volume as well as Navy nuclear support services boom, overall sales growth expectation for Huntington Ingalls’ first quarter remains positive. In sync with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, implying a 2.4% year-over-year increase.Here’s What Our Quantitative Model PredictsHuntington Ingalls does not possess the right combination of two main ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.Zacks ESP: Huntington Ingalls has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: The company carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some companies from the Aerospace sector you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post earnings beat this quarter:Curtiss-Wright Corporation (CW  -  Free Report) is expected to report first-quarter 2018 results on May 2.

638,GD,"Wednesday, April 25, 2018A day ago, after Caterpillar (CAT  -  Free Report) ushered in a stellar Q1 earnings report, pre-market futures were zooming up. Q1 earnings season in general was going along swimmingly, and it looked like Tuesday trading was off to the races.Well, a funny thing happened in CAT’s Q1 conference call — CEO Jim Umpleby was quoted as saying Q1 represented a “high water mark” for Caterpillar’s 2018 earnings, which caused a hasty reassessment among market participants, and trading in the markets, the Dow in particular, sank like a stone.For sure, Mr. Umpleby has learned a valuable lesson about what to say (or what NOT to say) in his company’s conference call, but Caterpillar remains within a strong cycle overall. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating and a Zacks Style Score (Value, Growth, Momentum) of B.What we caution investors to learn from this is something akin to “all that glitters is not gold.” Meaning although a company may provide excellent top and bottom-line quarterly numbers, market sentiment — especially when economic realities are making traders a bit more sensitive these days, such as a 3% 10-year bond yield pointing toward higher interest rates in the future — may turn on a dime. And what we should take away is the understanding that jumpiness among market participants is a reality; stick with your strategy to find light at the end of the tunnel, and don’t give into hysteria.So, with that in mind, here are some highlights from a few of the big names reporting earnings results ahead of Wednesday’s opening bell:The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) is trading up 2.74% in today’s pre-market on solid top and bottom-line beats this morning. Earnings of $3.64 per share outpaced the $2.59 in the Zacks consensus, and revenues in the quarter of $23.38 billion surpassed the $22.32 billion analysts were expecting. Beating estimates is nothing new for Boeing: its trailing 4-quarter earnings beat average is above 20%. Also in the quarter, Boeing bought back $3 billion worth of company shares and paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends. For more on BA’s earnings, click here.Keeping in the Aerospace arena a moment, Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) also easily topped earnings and revenue estimates in its Q1: $4.21 per share on $6.74 billion in revenues beat the $3.63 per share and $6.58 billion, respectively. Its Aerospace division rose 10% year over year, and this marks at least the fifth straight earnings beat for the Zacks Rank #2, Style Score B-rated company. For more on NOC’s earnings, click here.One more from this sector: General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company, posted a 7% beat on the bottom line to $2.65 per share. Revenues of $7,535 million was a smidge under Zacks consensus — so call this a mixed earnings report — on revenue growth of 1.3% year over year. For more on GD’s earnings, click here.Also, Comcast (CMCSA  -  Free Report) reported earnings ahead of the opening bell today, with 62 cents per share and $22.79 billion in the quarter outperforming the 59 cents per share and $22.72 billion expected, up 10.7% on the company’s top line. Internet customer net adds grew 379K, partially augmented by a loss of 96K Video customers. The company also formally announced its big for the 61% of Sky Communications it doesn’t already own.

640,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release first-quarter 2018 results on Apr 24, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 5.91%. Lockheed Martin has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 4.62%.Let's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Slew of Contract WinsBeing the largest defense contractor in the United States, Lockheed Martin enjoys a solid inflow of contracts from the Pentagon and its overseas clients, courtesy of its varied defense and military product offerings.Among the contracts Lockheed Martin won in the first quarter, the significant ones include $3.5 billion deal to offer army training solutions to the U.S Army and $1.5 billion contract for the procurement of spare parts for F-35 lightning II air systems.Other notable contracts also include a $524 million modification contract for the delivery of Patriot Advanced Capability-3 missiles, a $522 million deal for the production of Trident II (D5) missile and a contract worth $481.2 million to support the construction of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant ships.Evidently, such steady flow of orders will certainly boost Lockheed Martin’s quarterly sales. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter sales is pegged at $11.3 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 2.22%.Other Factors at PlayIn 2017, the company completed the last F-16 production aircraft delivery. So the absence of this product line might weigh on Lockheed’s Aeronautics segment’s revenues in the first quarter. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales of $4.2 billion for this unit shows a 6% annual decline.Management at Lockheed Martin expects to deliver higher earnings in 2018, buoyed by lower tax rate, higher segment operating profit and improved FAS/CAS outlook. We believe such year-over-year bottom-line improvement will get reflected in the company’s first-quarter results as well. In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings is pegged at $3.40 per share, reflecting a 13.3% increase year over year.Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Lockheed Martin Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Lockheed Martin Corporation QuoteEarnings WhispersOur proven model does not show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter. That is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

641,GD,"With 26% of the S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 26, we are in the thick of the fourth-quarter earnings season. So far, the results reflect a positive trend, with an above average proportion of companies beating top- and bottom-line expectations. As the reporting cycle gets underway, the earnings scenario will most likely show more favorable trends.Annual earnings for the 133 index members that have released their Q4 results have improved 12.3%, while revenues increased 8.8%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 81.2%, while that for the top line was 78.9%, as of Jan 26.Coming to the Aerospace sector, we saw General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) kick-starting the Q4 reporting cycle with its earnings release on Jan 24. The next day saw reports from Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), L3 Technologies Corp. and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report). This week, defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) also came up with its financial results.Projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its Q3 performance.The sector’s earnings are likely to improve 8.2% on 6% higher revenues in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, earnings for this sector declined 6.8% on 4.4% sales growth. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, courtesy of the various defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks.

643,GD,"General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) recently completed the acquisition of IT service provider CSRA Inc. . After engaging in a brief period of bidding war against CACI International (CACI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics successfully acquired CSRA on Apr 3, for $9.7 billion, which includes a $2.8 billion debt.CSRA has thus become part of General Dynamics’ Information Systems & Technology segment. Following the closure of the transaction, General Dynamics has acquired all of CSRA’s outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash and subsequently the latter’s shares will get delisted  from the NYSE.Brief History of the Deal    Interestingly, following General Dynamics’ proposal to buy CASR last month for $9.6 billion, including $2.8 billion of debt, CACI offered to pay $7.2 billion in cash for the takeover. However, General Dynamics revised its acquisition deal with CSRA on Mar 20 stating that it will acquire all of CSRA’s outstanding shares for $41.25 per share in cash, reflecting an increase of 50 cents from the previous proposal. Consequently, CACI withdrew its buyout offer, thereby leaving General Dynamics as the sole prospective acquirer.  Benefits of the DealThe deal will poise General Dynamics as the largest provider of integrated information technology services to the federal government as CSRA is known for its cyber security and data-analytics business along with its information technology know-how.The acquisition is anticipated to be accretive to the company’s earnings per share and cash flow next year. Further, the deal is expected to generate annual pre-tax cost savings of 2% of the combined company's revenue by 2020.The takeover will boost General Dynamics’s global workforce by more than 19,000. With such an addition, the company’s combined workforce can speed up operations and upgrade their information systems and deliver cost-effective, next-generation IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies.What Lies Ahead for General Dynamics?In the age of digitization, widespread cyber attacks have prompted all nations to improve their cyber security. The United States, being the largest digitally advanced country, is no exception.Per a report published by Forrester, global purchases for technology software and services by businesses and governments will grow by 4% and software and tech consulting services by 6% in 2018. Therefore, the latest buyout by General Dynamics seems to be a strategic step taken to expand its footprint in the cyber security space.Price Movement    General Dynamics’s stock returned about 17.6% over a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 47.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the intense competition that the company faces in the aerospace-defense space. Zacks Rank & Key PickGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).A better-ranked stock in the same sector is Huntington Ingalls (HII  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Huntington Ingalls recorded an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the last four quarters.

644,GD,"CSRA Inc.  recently met with rejection regarding the acquisition offer from CACI International Inc (CACI  -  Free Report), paving the way for General Dynamics’ (GD  -  Free Report) $9.7 billion epic buyout offer.Per the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, CACI is now withdrawing its proposed $7.2 billion in cash takeover, losing a month-long bidding war to General Dynamics.The move came after General Dynamics revised its merger agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of CSRA for $41.25 per share in cash, an increase from the previous $40.75 per share offer. This made it hard for CACI to compete and enabled it to take a step back.According to analysts, “Given that General Dynamics' offer is in cash, it represents considerably less risk than CACI's cash-and-stock bid.”Story of the DealCACI had offered to merge with CSRA in a bid to disrupt the latter's buyout proposition by General Dynamics. The strategic move comes after CSRA agreed to sell itself to General Dynamics last month for $40.75 per share in cash, as companies in the sector seek to position themselves for a pickup in government spending under the Trump administration.General Dynamics: The Clear Winner?In spite of the unsolicited offer that CACI made to acquire CSRA, General Dynamics remains confident of the deal and plans to proceed with its tender offer to acquire CSRA’s all outstanding shares. Notably, the tender offer for CSRA shares has commenced on Mar 5, 2018, and is scheduled to expire on Apr 2. With General Dynamics having secured the necessary regulatory approvals for the transaction, the chance of CACI snatching the deal from this shipbuilder is highly unlikely.Moreover, General Dynamics believes that CACI’s offer overstates the real value to the CSRA shareholders and understates the involved risk. It is also of the opinion that CACI's proposal would burden CSRA with approximately $6.8 billion of debt, once acquired.Another implication of the deal is time value of money for investors as CACI would close the acquisition formalities by July 31, 2018. This means, if CACI wins the bid for CSRA, investors will incur significant opportunity cost due to the four-month lag, whereas General Dynamics aims to complete the transaction by early April.Also, the real value of CACI’s stock tends to remain uncertain due to the market risks associated with the CACI transaction, closing four months in the future, with more than 65% of its stock consisting of a fixed exchange ratio.CSRA’s Growth ProspectsRecently, Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOGL  -  Free Report) Google Cloud partnered with CSRA. Per the new alliance, CSRA will leverage Google Cloud Platform and G Suite products to the IT needs of government customers. The latest deal is an extension of Google’s ongoing partnership with CSRA.CSRA’s product portfolio will also strengthen and will help in acquiring more federal contracts by improvising its key offering of IT solutions. In February 2018, it signed a million-dollar deal with the Uniformed Services University of Health Science with the earlier expansion of its partnership with Google.CSRA is benefiting from contract wins, based on its deep domain knowledge and expertise in next-generation IT services. Its partnerships with Amazon Web Services, ServiceNow, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, VMware and Oracle are expanding its service offerings while driving top-line growth consequently. The company is also expected to benefit from the increased spending in defense and various environmental programs.Further, strong backlog, strategic partnerships and frequent contract wins augur well for the company. These positive factors make CSRA a potential acquisition target.Zacks Rank and Key PicksCSRA currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Investor Alert: Breakthroughs PendingA medical advance is now at the flashpoint between theory and realization.

645,GD,"The U.S. defense contractor, CACI International Inc (CACI  -  Free Report), has made a proposal to acquire all of the outstanding shares of CSRA Inc. , for a combination of CACI common stock and cash. This includes a fixed exchange ratio of 0.184 shares of CACI common stock for each share of CSRA and cash equal to $15 per share.The combination of cash and stock equates to approximately $44 per share, based upon CACI's closing price of $157.45 as of Mar 16, 2018. Per the terms of CACI's offer, CSRA shareholders would own 55% of the combined entity.   Benefits of the DealCACI has offered to merge with CSRA in a bid to disrupt the latter's $6.8-billion buyout proposition by General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), another defense contractor. The strategic move comes after CSRA agreed last month to sell itself to General Dynamics, for $40.75 per share in cash, as companies in the sector seek to position themselves for a pickup in government spending under Trump's administration.  The acquisition proposal represents an 8% premium over the price CSRA’s shareholders would receive in the announced transaction with General Dynamics. This combination will enable CSRA’s shareholders to participate in long-term growth of the combined company. CACI expects to realize $165 million annually in net run-rate cost synergies — a substantially greater figure than the synergies contemplated by the General Dynamics transaction, offering shareholders of both CACI and CSRA the opportunity to participate in additional value creation.  The acquisition will unite two businesses with long-term customer relationships, complementary capabilities and significant presence in high-growth markets. The combined entity will be able to provide customers with solutions that link domain and mission knowledge with industry-leading enterprise support offerings. The combination with CSRA will further capitalize on the opportunity for growth, amplifying both companies’ position in key market areas, and improving value proposition and customer footprint.Guidance RaisedIn concurrence with the proposed deal, CACI raised its fiscal 2018 guidance. Buoyed by strong operating performance on a number of programs (particularly on fixed price contracts), the company raised its net income and earnings per share (EPS) guidance. It also raised the lower end of its annual revenue guidance range due to increased certainty in operations as it approaches fourth-quarter fiscal 2018.For fiscal 2018, revenues are likely to be up from $4,350-$4,350 million to $4,400-$4,500 million. Net income is expected to be up from $277-$283 million to $285-$291 million, while EPS guidance has been increased from $10.95-$11.19 to $11.26-$11.50. The company reaffirmed that the U.S. tax reform is expected to add approximately $100 million to net income, which is reflected in the current guidance. CACI’s encouraging financial outlook underscores the significant value-creation opportunities in the proposed transaction.Share Price MovementCACI has a market capitalization of $3.9 billion compared with CSRA's $6.7 billion. CACI’s shares have outperformed the industry in the last three months, with an average return of 16.2% compared with 6% growth recorded by the latter, emboldening this Arlington, Virginia-based firm to use its stock as currency to pursue a transformative deal.CACI has committed financing in place for the proposed transaction and therefore its proposal is not subject to any financing contingency. It expects the deal to close by Jul 31, 2018, subject to approval by shareholders of both companies.CSRA’s board of directors, in consultation with its legal and financial advisors, will carefully review CACI's proposal. General Dynamics' tender offer is scheduled to expire on Apr 3.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCACI carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the industry includes ManTech International Corporation (MANT  -  Free Report), sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.  ManTech has an expected long-term earnings growth rate of 8%.

646,GD,"The global stock market took a hit last week following the U.S. President’s proposal of an imposition of a 24% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tax on aluminum imports.Though Trump’s decision is aimed at keeping a check on foreign imports and boost jobs in the country, possibility of a global trade war stemming from the same provided a severe jolt to the share market. In fact, post the declaration, many companies’ share price (except steel and aluminum makers) slumped on Mar 1 on the fear of reeling under higher prices for inputs.Why Should the Aerospace Majors Worry?Aluminum and steel are the basic raw materials required for the manufacturing of aircraft as well as other defense products like rockets, missiles, tankers to name a few.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, operational aluminum smelters in the United States have declined from 23 in 1993 to five in 2018. Per a Commerce Department report only one of these smelters make the high-purity aluminum needed for fighter jets.Aircraft manufacturers as well as defense majors rely on foreign imports to develop high-end weaponries.  Per a report by The Washington Post, U.S. companies import 90% of aluminum that is needed to manufacture products as diverse as beer cans and fighter jets.However, steel, in the United States, is used to a much lesser extent by Aerospace companies, when compared to aluminum. Per The New York Timer, the United States imports only about one-third of its steel required for manufacturing jets and defense equipment.Therefore, the imposition is likely to have a significant impact on the major players in the U.S. Aerospace & Defense space.Implication of the Tariff: Experts ViewThe U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis supported Trump’s decision. However, he is of the opinion that the move should come through a system of targeted tariffs and import curbs on aluminum can be put on hold for now.He added that direct defense needs account for only about 3% of U.S. production. The proposed curbs will not dent Pentagon’s ability to obtain steel and aluminum needed to meet national defense requirements.However, the Aerospace Industries Association believes that the imposition might lead to a marketplace retaliation and has thus extended a critical review of the tariff plan. In particular, its CEO believes that the tariff will adversely impact the Aerospace-Defense space by raising costs and disrupting supply chains, putting the U.S. global competitiveness at risk. According to him, the U.S. aerospace and defense industry generates more than $86-billion net surplus a year — the highest in the manufacturing sector. Therefore, the tariff, if imposed, will surely affect the industry and in turn the economy.     Trump’s latest announcement has not gone down well with the foreign allies of the nation. The European Union has already announced plans to impose higher tariffs on Harley-Davidsons, Kentucky bourbon and bluejeans, if this tax comes into effect.Stocks in FocusFollowing Trump’s announcement, Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) stock fell almost 4%, The Boeing Co.’s (BA  -  Free Report) stock declined 3.5% and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) shares dipped 1.4% on Mar 1.Aluminum is one of the three most important raw materials that Boeing requires for the manufacturing of aerospace products.  According to several experts, the company uses aluminum for the manufacturing 80% of older models like 737 and 777 which accounts for 12% of the cost. However, most of the aluminum Boeing uses is domestically produced and only around 25-30% is imported. So the tariff may hike the cost of a plane by 0.3%. On the other hand, many fear that prices of domestic aluminum is likely to rise if the tariff is imposed and in turn weigh on the company’s sales.Moreover, with Boeing operating a diverse business globally, Bloomberg believes that it remains most susceptible to a possible trade war as a result of this tariff.For Lockheed Martin as well, aluminum is an important raw material. The company’s CEO remains concerned over the impact of the proposed tax on the company’s growth. The company, which relies on sales to foreign allies, remains worried because Trump’s latest plan could hamper those relationships as well as lead to marketplace retaliation.Meanwhile, Lockheed is likely to clinch a long-term purchase agreement which would cushion it against the proposed US steel and aluminum tariff until 2021 (per the Financial Times).On Mar 2, the governor of Virginia warned that Trump's plans to impose tariffs on steel imports will hurt defense shipyards like Newport News, which is building America's next class of aircraft carriers. This in turn may adversely impact shipbuilders like General Dynamics. ConclusionThe primary objective of the tariff imposition is to create jobs for Americans, yet there remains a fallacy in the policy itself. While American steelmakers lost “three-quarters of their jobs” between 1962 and 2005, a major study by the American Economic Association revealed that much of this had been due to improved production technology as output per worker rose fivefold. Thus, declining domestic demand was not the prime reason for the rising unemployment rate. So the latest tariff now will most likely not boost the domestic job market to the extent that Trump expects.Despite this, if it is imposed the aerospace defense stocks will be affected, at least in the initial days. This is because that not only it will make imported steel and aluminum dearer, but also will push up the cost of its domestic counterparts, putting these stocks at a competitive disadvantage compared to their foreign peers. Yet, considering the fact that America is the largest supplier of defense equipments, the major players in this industry including those mentioned above are expected to turn around in the long run.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues.

In 2017, the company’s cash inflow from operating activities was around $3,879 million, up 76.5%. Free cash inflow from operations in 2017 was $3,451 million, up 91.1%.We believe strong performance of its diverse defense offerings has given General Dynamics the financial flexibility to pay incremental dividends. Undoubtedly, this will attract more investors to spend money inthe company’s shares.Moreover, last month the company acquired CSRA — a premier provider of high-tech IT solutions for $9.6 billion. With increasing demand for cybersecurity solution across the globe, this has been a significant step adopted by General Dynamics to enhance its footprint in the cybersecurity market.This buyout enables General Dynamics to offer cost-effective IT solutions and services to the Department of Defense, the intelligence community and federal civilian agencies which in turn will push up its profit margin.We believe that the company’s strong cash flow and organic growth, along with its inorganic strategies like the CSRA purchase will help generate sufficient funds to meet its financial commitments, apart from awarding shareholders through lucrative dividend payouts.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics’s stock has rallied about 13.4% in the last three months, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 15.7%. The underperformance may have been caused by the 2017 Tax Cuts and JobsAct that had an adverse impact on the company's financials. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the same sector are Boeing Co.

648,GD,"With global awareness on gender diversity, the number of female corporate leaders has gone up in recent years. After dropping to 21 in 2016, the number of women CEOs on Fortune 500 increased more than 50% to a record 32 at the start of 2017. However, the number declined to 27 as of January 2018 and will drop further down to 24 by April. Despite this, women hold 21% of board seats at S&P 500 companies per Catalyst, a group researching women and work.Several researches show that the companies led by women have outperformed the market. According to analysis by the bank Nordea, companies with a woman in the chief executive or chairperson role have performed far better than a major global index over the past eight years. Annualized returns for female-led firms, based on an equal weighting, was 25% since 2009, compared with just 11% for the broader market — the MSCI World Index.The U.S. stock market is turning nine on Mar 9, representing the second-longest bull run in history after the 1990s rally that ended when the tech bubble burst in 2000. With regard to this, it is worth shedding light on the women leadership over this nine-year period and the outperformance of companies having female employees in top brass.The list of women CEO in the S&P 500 is still small at nearly 5% of the total.

649,GD,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently clinched a modification contract for procuring long lead parts associated with the manufacture of 19 P-8A aircraft of the 10th Lot. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by March 2022.Details of the DealValued at $282.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD. Per the deal, 10 of the 19 jets will be delivered to the U.S. Navy, five to the government of Norway and four to the U.K. administration.Majority of the work will be executed in Seattle, WA and the rest at Cambridge, U.K. and various other locations across the United States. Notably, the deal includes 49.7% of the work for the U.S. Navy, 28.7% for the government of Norway and 21.6% for the U.K.Fiscal 2018 aircraft procurement (Navy) and foreign military sales funds will be utilized to complete the task.About P-8A AircraftBoeing’s P-8A Multi-mission Maritime aircraft, also known as Poseidon, is used for long-range anti-submarine warfare, anti-surface warfare and intelligence as well as surveillance and reconnaissance missions. It is also capable of broad-area littoral operations.A derivative of the Next-Generation 737-800, the P-8A and its variant for India, the P-8I, delivers superior performance and reliability with an advanced mission system that ensures maximum interoperability in the future battle space.Our ViewBeing one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s defense segment stands out among peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company has also reshaped its defense portfolio from time to time.In particular, among other defense equipment, Boeing’s forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Of late, it has also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft. In fact, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, the company has been clinching a number of contracts from the Pentagon.During 2017, the defense segment had backlog worth $50 billion, further reflecting the slew of orders that Boeing enjoys for its varied weaponries. Going ahead, similar backlog figures can be expected at this segment, buoyed by contract wins like the latest one.Considering the fiscal 2019 defense budget worth $716 billion, proposed by President Trump last month, we expect Boeing to win more contracts from the Pentagon on solid demand for its military aircraft.Price MovementIn a year’s time, Boeing's shares have surged about 93.8% compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. The outperformance was primarily led by significant demand for its military jets along with long-term robust demand for its commercial aircraft. Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderBoeing sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Some other stocks worth considering from the same space are Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp.

650,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) recently secured a foreign military sales (“FMS”) contract worth $481.2 million to support the construction of four Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (“MMSC”) ships. Work related to this deal is expected to be over by October 2024.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, DC. Majority of the work will be carried out in Walpole, MA; Washington, D.C., Moorestown, NJ, Germany and a few other locations. The agreement will cater to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia.A Brief Note on MMSC Lockheed Martin’s MMSC is a derivative of the US Navy’s Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship (“LCS”). It is a lethal and highly-maneuverable surface combatant that performs littoral and open-ocean operations.With proven combat management system lineage, Lockheed Martin’s MMSC has the interoperability necessary for today’s joint and allied naval force maneuvers. Paired with world’s most advanced maritime helicopter, MH-60R SEAHAWK, the MMSC has a robust anti-submarine mission capability that is fully interoperable with the U.S. Navy and its coalition partners.Our ViewApart from being Pentagon’s prime contractor, Lockheed Martin is also the chief contractor of the U.S. Navy’s latest LCS. With President Trump in favor of spending heavily in the nation’s defense arena, his reign is considered to be a golden era for aerospace-defense players like Lockheed Martin.This gets very well reflected in the fiscal 2019 (FY2019) defense budget that was released last month. For the Naval section, the FY 2019 budget provisions for procurement of one LCS for $1.3 billion. This in turn will boost Lockheed Martin’s Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) segment that designs, manufactures, serves and supports a variety of defense products like the LCS.During fourth-quarter 2017, RMS segment registered 14% top-line growth. We may expect this business unit to show similar upward sales trend in the first quarter and beyond, buoyed by the latest contract that the company won along with the recent budgetary amendments.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock moved up about 27.3% in a year, compared with the broader industry’s gain of 48.1%. This underperformance may have been caused by intense competition that the company faces for its broad portfolio of products and services in the domestic and international markets.  Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderLockheed Martin carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks from the same space are Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report).

652,GD,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release third-quarter 2017 results on Oct 25, before the opening bell.We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon to drive the company’s revenues in the third quarter. However, Aerospace segment is expected to face margin pressure in the second half of the year, which is reflected in third-quarter sales estimate for this unit.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.String of Contracts to Boost GrowthA scrumptious order flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States tend to boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third quarter sales is $7.9 billion, reflecting 2.1% year-over-year growth.Notably, the significant contract that General Dynamics secured in the third quarter, include a $5.1-billion special incentives contract to complete the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs); a modification contract worth $115.3 million for offering additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts to support Virginia-class submarines and a contract worth $310.6 million to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteThe company also won a $341.2-million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines and another modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets.Being one of the top-notch submarine contractors in the nation, such contracts are expected to bolster the company’s Marine Systems segment’s growth. Evidently, our consensus estimate for the Marine Systems’ sales stands at $2,068 million, up 0.2% annually.Will Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport? During second-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics’ management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year, citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport. In line with this expectation, our consensus estimate for the segment is pegged at $2,039 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 9.2%. Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 10.4% to $398 million, per our consensus estimate.Although the company continues to boast a strong forte in the Gulfstream business, which exhibits a strong pipeline growth, a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment’s overall third-quarter growth. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, other two business units of General Dynamics indicate higher annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.On the flip side, the company’s services business is expected to deliver weak performance due to slow execution of programs in several civilian agencies, owing to uncertainty and, in some cases, reduction in funding levels.For the to-be-reported quarter, our consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ earnings is pegged at $2.43 per share, down 2.14% year over year.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings this quarter. Notably, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. General Dynamics possess both of these attributes, as mentioned below:Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.37%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.44, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which along with a positive earnings ESP hints at possible surprise prediction.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter:Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is expected to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8. The company has an Earnings ESP of +2.04% and a Zacks Rank #2.Leidos Holdings, Inc.

Total revenues in the quarter were $3.48 billion, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54 billion by 1.5%.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

654,GD,"Military shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) business unit, Newport News, recently secured a modification contract for performing dry-docking operations of USS Helena (SSN 725). Work related to this deal will be executed at the company’s shipbuilding yard in Newport New, VA.Valued at $65.1 million, the contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the deal, the company will conduct repairing, maintenance, upgrades and modernization of USS Helena. Huntington Ingalls will utilize fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete the task by April 2018.A Brief Note on USS HelenaUSS Helena (SSN 725) is a Los Angeles-class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine. Notably, the Los Angeles-class forms the backbone of the U.S. Navy's submarine force.Nuclear Submarines & the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. Notably, the modern-day nuclear-powered submarines are markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling.In the United States, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one, operated by two prime players — Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). As a result both the companies enjoy a large share of the market as well as high profit margins.It is imperative to mention in this context that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers like Huntington Ingalls in boosting production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.How Will the Deal Benefit Huntington?Huntington’s Newport News division enjoys one of the leading positions in the designing and building nuclear-powered submarines for the U.S. Navy. As of December 2016, Newport News delivered 59 submarines to the U.S. Navy which comprised 45 fast attack and 14 ballistic missile submarines. Moreover, of the 52 nuclear-powered fast attack submarines currently in active service, 25 were delivered by Newport News.The global submarine market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5% to reach a value of $27.6 billion from 2016 to 2021, as forecasted by Technavio market research analysts. Considering this and the aforementioned developments, we can expect Huntington Ingalls to win more such submarine-related contracts going ahead, thereby boosting its profit margin.Price PerformanceShares of Huntington have rallied 47.1% over a year, outperforming the industry’s 46.9% gain. The company is the sole designer and manufacturer of nuclear powered aircraft carriers in the U.S. Over 70% of the active U.S. Navy fleet consists of Huntington Ingalls ships and the company continues to enjoy strong order growth from the U.S. Navy. This in turn may have led to the company’s aforementioned outperformance.  Zacks Rank and Other Stocks to ConsiderHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).A few other top-ranked stocks in the aerospace-defense space are The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), both of which carry a Zacks Rank #2.

655,GD,"We issued an updated research report on Textron, Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) on Oct 12. The company is a global multi-industry company that manufactures aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools.Textron follows a systematic inorganic growth strategy and thus remains focused on acquisitions. In line with this strategy, during the first quarter, Textron closed the acquisition of Arctic Cat, a leader in the recreational vehicle industry, for $247 million. This acquisition has expanded Textron’s presence in the power-sports segment as well as utility vehicle market, courtesy of Arctic Cat’s established dealer network. Management expects Arctic Cat to contribute $400-$500 million of sales for the company in 2017.The company also remains focused on innovation to expand its existing operations. To this end, Textron began delivering its new ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the second quarter. Notably, the ELiTE offers high efficiency with zero battery maintenance, apart from demonstrating Textron’s industry-leading product innovation.Moreover, Textron is forging ahead with the development of its 505 Jet Ranger X programs. We expect, new product offerings will heighten competition and ensure fresh orders for the conglomerate.On the flip side, Textron’s Aviation business continues to exhibit dismal performance on account of lower military and commercial turboprop volumes. Dearth of international order for the King Air turboprops was the primary reason for its weak performance. As a result, despite strong long-term fundamentals, we remain skeptical about the intermediate prospects of Textron’s commercial aerospace businesses.Moreover, the company faces tough competition from its peers like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report). This may have caused the company to underperform its industry over a year.Evidently, Textron's share price gained 41.7% in the last one year, underperforming the industry's rally of 47.7% Zacks RankTextron currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

656,GD,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) recently introduced a new developer program focused on public safety innovation. The program will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network that AT&T is set to build.Notably, in March 2017, the U.S. telecom behemoth was selected by the FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network will cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs over the next two years.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Importantly, per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for commercial purposes and consumer services as well.Consequently, the company will be able to connect FirstNet users to its telecommunications network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. Therefore, FirstNet contract can be considered a necessary boost to AT&T’s profile.Meanwhile, the market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is gradually becoming intensely competitive. In August 2017, telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers.Price Performance of AT&TAT&T’s shares have declined 1.21% compared with the industry’s gain of 1.65% over the past 90 days.

657,GD,"Military shipbuilder General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract worth $20.6 million for planning and execution of USS Washington (SSN 787) in the post-delivery work period. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by February 2018.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair, Groton, CT. Per the terms of the agreement, Electric Boat will conduct planning and execution-related tasks including long-lead-time material procurement. These tasks will aid in accomplishing the maintenance, repair, alterations, testing and other work on USS Washington during the scheduled post-delivery work period.Majority of the work will be carried out in Newport News, VA. The company will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016, and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion funds to finish the task.A Brief Note on USS WashingtonUSS Washington is a nuclear powered, fast attack submarine (SSN) designed to operate in shallow coastal regions and maintaining the capacity for open ocean submarine warfare. It is the 14th Virginia-class attack submarine.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report), another stalwart in military shipbuilding space, along with General Dynamics, co-manufactured USS Washington. It is believed, that upon delivery, this ship will be the most technologically advanced submarine in the U.S. Navy’s service. It will also be the least expensive submarine as its design incorporates significant innovations to reduce acquisition costs over earlier ships of the class without impacting mission capabilities. The USS Washington was commissioned on Oct 7.Our ViewBeing one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprises 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.The Navy plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years. This will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  In fact, the Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM.Since majority of such attack submarines are co-developed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls, for the construction of VPM, Pentagon will offer lucrative additional defense contracts to both these shipbuilders, which, in turn, is expected to boost their growth trajectory.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics with the company being identified as the prime contractor for Virginia-Class submarines, in 2016. As a result, we expect the latest modification contract has the ability to put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics's have rallied about 40.9% over a year, underperforming the industry's gain of 55%. This may have been caused by the fact that the company is witnessing declining backlogs in recent times. Moreover, the stock also faces stiff competition from its industry peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

658,GD,"The fourth-quarter earnings season has gathered steam with 53 S&P 500 members having reported their quarterly numbers as of Jan 19. So far, the results reflect a positive view of corporate earnings, with tax cuts driving earnings estimates. As the reporting cycle gets underway, the earnings scenario will most likely show more favorable trends.Notably, annual earnings for the 53 index members that have released their Q4 result have improved 11.7%, while revenues increased 7.5%. The beat ratio for the bottom line was 81.1%, while that for top line was 75.5%, as of Jan 19.Coming to the Aerospace-Defense industry, none of the stocks have reported their Q4 results so far. However, considering the inherent stability of this industry, projections for the Aerospace sector (one of the 16 Zacks sector), which constitutes the Aerospace-Defense industry, hint at an impressive quarter, when compared to its Q3 performance.Evidently, the sector’s earnings are likely to improve 6.6% on 5.7% higher revenues in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter earnings for this sector declined 6.8% on 4.4% sales growth. For more details on quarterly releases, you can go through our latest Earnings Preview.Defense stocks remained on a growth trajectory in the fourth quarter, courtesy of the various defense policy initiatives adopted by President Trump. A steady flow of contracts from Pentagon also provided an impetus to the stocks. With Trump strongly opposing the budget sequestration imposed by his predecessor, defense stocks are likely to gain traction in the coming days. Moreover, growing international market for weaponries with more developing nations expanding their defense spending is also likely to fuel the industry’s growth.With almost 262 companies (81 S&P 500 members) slated to report their Q4 results this week, let’s find out where the following defense stocks stand before their release of quarterly numbers on Jan 24.General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.70% in the last quarter. Notably, the company outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters, with an average beat of 3.44%.Order flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter sales is $8.4 billion, reflecting 2.5% year-over-year growth.However, unfavorable margins may impact its Aerospace segment’s results. Evidently, fourth-quarter consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,930 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.2%. Segment wise, other three business units of General Dynamics indicate positive annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.Per our proven model, a stock is likely to beat earnings estimate if it has a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold).

659,GD,"Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 25 before the opening bell.We expect the Missile Systems business unit of the defense major to primarily drive the company’s revenues in the quarter. Moreover, its overseas business expansion is also expected to boost results. Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing Raytheon’s quarterly results.Missile Systems Unit Driving GrowthSegment-wise, Missile systems business unit that represent almost 30% of the company’s total business sales continues to be a major growth driver. The fourth quarter is also poised to benefit from this unit.  Notably, the company won a modification contract worth $300 million for supplying Tube-launched Optically-tracked Wireless-guided missiles and another modification contract worth $304.2 million to procure 618 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) air-to-ground missiles, containers, component parts/support equipment (spares) and engineering technical assistance. Moreover, at the end of the year the company won a $634.2-million deal for manufacturing the 31st Lot of Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile. Such order wins indicate solid demand for missiles manufactured by Raytheon and in turn is expected to boost sales.Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $2,219 million for the segment, reflecting year-over-year growth of 17.1%.In fact, buoyed on this segment’s double-digit sales growth, our consensus estimate for fourth-quarter sales is pegged at $6.83 billion for Raytheon. This represents an annual improvement of 9.6%.For 2017, the company expects to witness sales growth of 10% for the Missile Systems unit, driven by higher sales volume.International Operations: A Major PositiveApart from its strong forte in domestic front, international business expansion has always been a primary growth driver for Raytheon. Japan having pursuing missile defense solutions to protect its homeland, has created growth opportunities for Raytheon. The company is currently co-producing SM-3 Block IIA missiles with Japan. Moreover, Raytheoncontinues to make progress on several large Patriot opportunities in Europe, while in the Middle East the company is additional demand signal for early warning sensing and missile defense products. We believe once the company reports fourth-quarter results, these nations’ contribution to Raytheon’s growth story will become clearer.Other Factors to ConsiderApart from its strong forte in missile defense, the company also enjoys a leading position in offering cybersecurity, particularly on the domestic front. Notably, at the onset of the fourth quarter, the Government Accountability Office dismissed the protest surrounding the Domino contract worth $1 billion and Raytheon is now actively working with the Department of Homeland Security on this largest single cybersecurity contracts ever awarded. We may expect further gains from this contract to get reflected in the company’s fourth-quarter sales.Such a steady contract securing expectation led the company to increase its 2017 booking outlook by $500 million. The company also enhanced its 2017 sales outlook, citing solid expectations for fourth-quarter results.In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is $25.4 billion, reflecting annual growth of 5.8%.The company also raised its 2017 earnings outlook.  In line with this the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2017 earnings is at $7.61, reflecting annual growth of 0.8%.Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise  Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company Quote What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model show that Raytheon is likely to beat estimates this quarter.

660,GD,"Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and 2017 results on Jan 25, before the opening bell.Lack of orders from Pentagon as well as international allies of the United States may hamper the company’s fourth quarter sales growth. Moreover, the Aerospace Systems segment is not likely to be a majorsupport for Northrop Grumman this time around.Let’s discuss the factors influencing the defense giant’s quarterly release.Will Aerospace Systems Remain the Key Contributor?The Aerospace Systems segment fetches almost half of Northrop Grumman’s sales and has traditionally been a primary contributor to growth.Usually, increased demand as well as deliveries of manned aircraft boosts sales at this segment. However, the segment managed to clinch very few contracts in the fourth quarter.This is reflected in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s Q4 revenues, which stands at $2,861 million, reflecting an annual decline of 0.4%.Lack of Orders to Impact SalesDefense majors have been receiving a slew of contracts from the Pentagon and foreign U.S. allies, Northrop Grumman being no exception. However, in the fourth quarter, the company won a handful of notabledeals only like the $445-million Air Force contract to support LAIRCM program.Consequently, the Q4 revenue growth expectation is not very ambitious. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $6.37 billion, reflecting a 0.4% year-over-year decline.Other Factors to ConsiderThe Mission Systems business has been benefiting from increased volume for sensors and processing programs along with air and missile defense programs and Advanced Capabilities business. Considering acontinuation of this trend in the final quarter of the year as well, Northrop Grumman had slightly lifted the 2017 sales expectation for this unit during the third-quarter earnings call.Taking this into consideration, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit’s Q4 revenues is pegged at $2,906 million, reflecting annual growth of 2.1%.Meanwhile, unallocated corporate expenses rose $90 million in the third quarter, primarily on account of the Orbital ATK acquisition. As the transaction is still on track, we expect the company to incur higherunallocated corporate expenses in the fourth quarter as well.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation Quote Earnings WhisperOur proven model does not conclusively shows an earnings beat for Northrop Grumman this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy)or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.

663,GD,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) received a $150-million contract to provide engineering support services for multiple Commercial Derivative Aircraft (CDA) platforms.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Work related to the deal will be majorly carried out in Oklahoma City, OK; San Antonio, TX and other locations across the United States. Work under the contract is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2019.A Brief Note on CDA PlatformA commercial derivative aircraft began operations as a commercial aircraft but was later transformed into military aircraft. The U.S. Military and Defense forces are currently using Boeing’s P-8A and P-8I, both of which were launched as a Next Generation 737-800. Other derivatives like the Airborne Early Warning & Control, Airborne Warning and Control System and KC-46 tanker started operations as 707s, 737s or 767s.Our ViewBoeing’s third-quarter backlog stood at $46 billion, with international customers accounting for 35%. This included 36 F-15 fighter aircraft for Qatar, 28 F-18 fighter aircraft for Kuwait, up to 40 Chinook helicopters for Saudi Arabia and the C-17 military transport aircraft for India.This shows the solid demand that Boeing’s products enjoy in the overseas. In particular, products like rotorcraft, commercial derivatives, fighters and satellites have been witnessing solid traction in the international market. As developing countries like Japan and India are expanding their defense budget, in line with developed countries, we expect Boeing to win more FMS contracts like the latest one.In line with this, during the fourth quarter, Boeing’s Defense business secured a foreign military sales contract worth $6.2 billion from the Qatar Emiri Air Force. The company also clinched a $279-million deal for delivering the first KC-46 tanker and logistics support to the Japan Air Self-Defense Force.During the third-quarter earnings call, Boeing raised its 2017 sales outlook citing higher sales volume as the primary reason. Considering the rise in international demand as indiacted by rising contract wins for its defense offerings, we expect Boeing to see impressive sales growth in the days ahead.The company poses stiff competition to peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report).Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

664,GD,"Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because General Dynamics is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings—with the most up-to-date information possible—is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for GD in this report.Analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for GD, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.19% heading into earnings season.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that GD has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for General Dynamics, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce ""the world's first trillionaires,"" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.See Zacks' 3 Best Stocks to Play This Trend >>

665,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 results on Jan 24, before the opening bell.We believe substantial inflow of military contracts from Pentagon will continue to drive the military shipbuilder’s revenues in the fourth quarter. However, Aerospace segment may face margin pressure in the quarter under review, as is evident from the expected annual decline in operating earnings.Let’s take a detailed look at the factors influencing General Dynamics’ quarterly results.Order Growth to Boost SalesOrder flow form Pentagon as well as foreign allies of the United States generally boost quarterly sales of defense bellwethers and General Dynamics is no exception. In this line, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth quarter sales is $8.4 billion, reflecting 2.5% year-over-year growth. Management also remained optimistic about the company’s fourth quarter order growth, which led it to project revenue growth of 15%, sequentially.Notably, the contracts that General Dynamics secured in the fourth quarter, include a $2.6-billion deal for upgrading 786 M1A1 configured Abrams vehicles in relation to the newly configured M1A2 System Enhancement Package Version 3; an agreement worth $198 million for the procurement, manufacturing, testing and delivery of the AN/USC-61(C) Digital Modular Radio (DMR) systems.Moreover, the company’s business division, Electric Boat, secured a modification contract worth $432 million for providing fiscal 2018 lead yard services and development studies and design efforts for Virginia-class submarines.The contract wins throughout 2017 will surely bolster the company’s full-year revenues, as is evident from the 4.9% growth reflected by our consensus estimate for the full year.General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise  General Dynamics Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | General Dynamics Corporation QuoteWill Aerospace Segment be a Spoilsport?During second-quarter earnings call, General Dynamics’ management expressed concern about the Aerospace segment’s sales growth in the second half of the year, citing unfavorable margins to play a spoilsport. In line with this, fourth-quarter consensus estimate for the segment’s revenues is pegged at $1,930 million, reflecting a year-over-year decline of 13.2%. Operating earnings for this business unit is also projected to reduce by 20.6% to $348 million, per our consensus estimate.Although the company continues to have a strong forte in the Gulfstream business, which exhibits strong pipeline growth, a substantial downtick on the margin may hamper this segment’s overall fourth-quarter growth. Other Factors at PlaySegment-wise, other three business units of General Dynamics indicate positive annual sales growth, considering the respective Zacks Consensus estimate.On the bottom-line front, a higher effective tax rate in the fourth quarter is expected to result in lower earnings. Evidently, our consensus estimate for General Dynamics’ earnings is pegged at $2.36 per share, reflecting 9.9% annual decline. The full-year earnings estimate of $9.81 per share also represents a 0.6% drop.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model show that General Dynamics is likely to beat estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.Zacks ESP: General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.

667,GD,"On Jan 19, Defense Secretary Jamis Mattis finally unveiled the highly awaited National Defense Strategy for 2018. Speaking at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, Mattiss warned that the United States’ competitive edge has “eroded in every domain of warfare” and is “continually eroding” even now.Mattiss went on to outline a new strategy which focuses on cementing alliances, improving coordination with the State Department and elicit steady financial backing from Congress. One of the major priorities of the new strategy was to increase investments in various areas ranging from nuclear and cyber warfare to space operations and capabilities.This new strategy is another reminder that improving the capabilities of the defense services is at the top of the Trump administration’s agenda. The document has also been released at a time when major defense stocks are preparing to report earnings numbers.With General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) scheduled to report on Jan 24 and Jan 29, respectively, this may be a good time to consider which of these is a better stock. Both these stocks have a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Other defense stocks reporting earnings this month include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report)Price PerformanceIn terms of price performance, Lockheed Martin is a clear winner. Both stocks have underperformed the broader industry, which has gained 13.4% over the last three months. However, Lockheed Martin has gained 6% over this period, clearly outperforming General Dynamics which has lost -1.4%. ValuationSince the defense sector is capital intensive, the most appropriate ratio to value companies is EV/EBITDA. Additionally, it is the ideal metric to compare two companies within the same industry. Further, it is not impacted by differing capital structures and excludes the impact of non-cash expenses.  Coming to the two defense stocks, with an EV/EBITDA value of 15.64, Lockheed Martin is overvalued relative to the rest of the industry. General Dynamics holds the edge here with a lower EV/EBITDA value of 13.55, making it undervalued relative to the rest of the industry, which has an EV/EBITDA value of 13.68.Return on CapitalReturn on capital or return on capital employed is a suitable metric to compare the profitability of companies relying on the quantum of capital that they utilize. The capital utilized or employed is the total capital that the company requires to return a profit. This ratio is particularly useful when the objective is to compare the performance of companies which belong to capital intensive sectors. This is because unlike other profitability metrics like return on equity (ROE), return on capital takes into account debt and other related liabilities.Such an approach ensures a more holistic picture of companies which utilize a significant amount of debt. Here, Lockheed Martin is clearly ahead with a return on equity level of 23.3%, which is higher than the General Dynamic’s level of 21.6%.Debt to AssetsThe debt to assets ratio or debt ratio is utilized to gauge the amount of leverage a company utilizes. A higher ratio necessarily indicates a higher amount of leverage, which raises the financial risk involved. Industries which are capital intensive in nature usually have a relatively higher debt ratio. Lockheed Martin is saddled with a relatively poor debt-to-assets level of 29.2%. This round easily goes to General Dynamics, which has a debt-to-assets ratio of around 14%, which is lower than Lockheed Martin’s as well as that of the broader industry, which has a debt-to-assets ratio of 17.1%.Dividend YieldLockheed Martin’s dividend yield over the last one year period is 2.41%. With a dividend yield of 1.6%, General Dynamics’ shareholders earn a lower dividend yield than those of Lockheed Martin as well as the broader industry, which has an average dividend yield of 1.7%. Earnings History, ESP and Estimate RevisionsConsidering a more comprehensive earnings history, Lockheed Martin has delivered earnings surprises in three of the four preceding quarters. On the other hand, General Dynamics has delivered earnings surprises in all of the four preceding quarters. While General Dynamics has an average earnings surprise of 3.4%, Lockheed Martin stands out with an average earnings surprise of 4.9%.When considering Earnings ESP values, Lockheed Martin holds the edge with a reading of +0.31%, higher than General Dynamics’ figure of +0.19%. At the same time, Lockheed Martin’s earnings estimate for the current year has increased by 3.8% over the last 30 days, higher than General Dynamics’ level of 3.7%. ConclusionOur comparative analysis shows that there is little to choose between the stocks when considering ranks, since both carry a Zacks Rank #2. But General Dynamics does hold an edge over Lockheed Martin when considering valuation and debt ratios.However, Lockheed Martin is superior when considering price performance, dividend yield, estimate revisions and a more detailed earnings history. What clinches the case for Lockheed Martin over General Dynamics is a higher ESP value, which makes it a better choice ahead of upcoming earnings results.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

668,GD,"AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) had a disappointing 2017. We believe that the U.S. telecom behemoth is currently facing several headwinds. However, the FirstNet Project may appear as a ray of hope for the company in 2018.Recently, AT&T and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that all the 50 states of the nation, as well as two U.S. territories and Washington D.C., have entered the FirstNet project, the first dedicated nationwide wireless network for first responders.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network aims to cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs over the next two years.In October 2017, AT&T and FirstNet introduced a new developer programme focused on public safety innovation. The programme will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network, which AT&T is set to build.The FirstNet project aims to convert every city in the United States as smart cities with state-of-the-art IoT (Internet-of-Things) opportunities. AT&T will deliver a portfolio of IoT devices by March 2018. These gadgets will be used by police, firefighters and other first responders to create monitoring and tracking systems.Importantly, AT&T plans to roll out next generation 5G wireless broadband (Internet) in a dozen U.S. cities by late 2018. It aims at becoming the first U.S. carrier to introduce 5G wireless Internet if the deadline is met. The company will connect FirstNet users to its telecom network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial and consumer purposes. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).Price performance and Zacks Rank  In 2017, AT&T’s shares decreased 9.89%, worse than the industry’s decline of 8.14%. Notably, the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained a whopping 18.25% in the same time period. AT&T carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). General Dynamics also carries the same Zacks Rank.

669,GD,"Aircraft giant The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) won a five-year basic ordering contract worth $41.5 million for supplying spare parts for F/A-18 E/F aircraft. Work pertaining to the deal will be carried out in Missouri.The contract has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 through 2021 Navy working capital funds to complete the task by Sep 30, 2021.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier. A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor — the F/A-18C/D — but contains 42% lesser structural parts.Our ViewWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spendings, the international market for defense equipment has been on an upward growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the Aerospace-Defense industry.Being one of the major players in the defense business, Boeing’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. Also, it has started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft of late. Banking on its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been winning contracts from the Pentagon for long. Last quarter, the company’s military aircraft business contributed $2.9 billion to its total revenues. Thanks to the recently won contract, we expect the company to witness similar solid revenue growth in this business, in the coming quarters.Moreover, last week’s Senate approval for the $700 billion National Defense Authorization Act indicates significant inflow of contracts for the front-row defense stocks in the United States. Therefore, the time is ripe for adding defense majors like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report), in your watchlist.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

671,GD,"As per reports from SNS Research, the wireless or mobile network infrastructure industry is expected to grow at a rate of 2% over the next three years.Per projections, the market will witness an annual spending of $56 billion by 2020, up from $53 billion in 2017.The wireless network infrastructure industry continues to expand on the back of increased investments by mobile operators. Notably, the operators have increased investments in Heterogeneous Network or HetNet infrastructure. The spending will be allocated to small cells, carrier Wi-Fi and DAS (Distributed Antenna Systems) and 5G NR (New Radio) rollouts — beginning in 2019, to cope up with the increasing capacity and coverage requirements. Further, mobile operators are keen to shift towards a C-RAN (Centralized RAN) architecture.  By the end of 2020, C-RAN, small cells, DAS and carrier Wi-Fi, together with their fronthaul and backhaul segments, will account for more than 45% of total infrastructure spending. With increasing demand for LTE (Long-Term Evolution) and its latest updated versions, LTE, LTE-Advanced and LTE-Advanced Pro networks are expected to generate more than $950 billion in service revenues annually by 2020.New market players are striving to strengthen foothold as mobile operators continue transition to virtualized network infrastructure. Notably, carriers are opting for wider range of hardware and technologies in order to upgrade their networks.Meanwhile, annual investments in LTE infrastructure for public-safety purposes have also attracted everyone’s attention in the domestic market. Public safety LTE infrastructure initiatives are being pursued around the world and the segment is expected to exceed $800 million by the end of 2017. Multiple LTE networks dedicated to public safety are already in use,globally.To this end, AT&T Inc (T  -  Free Report) and First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) have introduced a new developer program focused on public safety innovation. The program will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by responders who will select appropriate solutions to operate on the FirstNet network.In March, the U.S. telecom behemoth was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network will cover 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories. The consortium includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government.Accordingly, the market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is becoming intensely competitive. In August, telecom giant Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers.Currently, AT&T and Verizon carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Bottom LineLTE has been primarily considered a supplementary mobile broadband technology in the public safety sector. This is because LTE enables high-bandwidth data applications which cannot be delivered over existing narrowband LMR (Land Mobile Radio) systems.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks.

672,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Ordnance and Tactical Systems secured a contract worth $59.9 million for 30mm x 173mm armor piercing, fin stabilized, discarding sabot with tracer cartridges.The deal has been awarded by the Army Contracting Command, NJ. Work related to it is scheduled to be completed by May 31, 2021.Defense Scenario Driving OrdersWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the past few years along with more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the U.S. Aerospace-Defense industry with the nation being the largest weapon supplier. Again, the growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times.Furthermore, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Raytheon Co. (RTN  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the days to follow.In September 2017, the U.S. Senate passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion. The bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Therefore, this bill is expected to drive revenue growth for General Dynamics, one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Our TakeGeneral Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the leading commercial disposer of explosive materials and devices in the United States. It is also one of the leading manufacturers of mortar weapons and systems, bomb bodies and propellants.Notably, this business unit of General Dynamics has been producing 30mm ammunition for over 40 years. The 30mm x 173mm family includes armor-piercing, anti-personnel, airburst and low cost training ammunition that offer enhanced accuracy, penetration and lethality necessary to defeat a spectrum of threats on the battlefield.This units valued expertise in design, development and manufacturing of cartridges, included in the latest contract, establishes General Dynamics as a globally recognized supplier of high quality ammunition.Consequently, strong demand for such ammunitions has been boosting the company’s revenue growth. Evidently, during the third quarter of 2017, the Combat Systems segment, which constitutes Ordnance and Tactical Systems unit, generated 13% revenue growth year over year. Going forward, we can expect consistent growth in the segment's top line driven by strong demand for its products and frequent contract wins.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 14.8% in a year compared with the broader industry’s gain of 34.3%. The underperformance might have been caused by the company’s declining backlogs in recent times. Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

673,GD,"Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), has clinched a modification contract to incorporate an unpriced change order for acceleration and stabilization/restoration of supply rate for F-22 sustainment.Details of the DealValued at $70 million, the contract has been awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds to complete the work by Dec 31, 2019. Work related to the modification deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on F-22Lockheed Martin’s F-22 Raptor is the fifth-generation, single-seat, twin-engine, all-weather stealth tactical fighter aircraft with a unique combination of stealth, speed, agility and situational awareness along with lethal long-range air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry.However, high development costs, ban on exports and development of the more versatile F-35 aircraft led to the discontinuation of F-22 production.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Of late, there has been a rapid increase in terrorist activities across the globe. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.Markedly, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense industry in the United States. Also, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favoured defense giants like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics Corp (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) among others.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill as well.

674,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) subsidiary, Electric Boat Corp., has clinched a $341.2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines. Notably, the deal has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.About the ContractElectric Boat will provide drawings and associated technical data, design change documentation, logistics technical data, configuration management as well assubmarine safety design review.The contractor will also offer hull, mechanical and electrical engineering, non-propulsion plant electrical system engineering, propulsion plant engineering, besides maintenance engineering.In addition, this subsidiary will give refit/availability technical support, on-site support, configuration change program design and installation support, configuration change program material support and submarine technical trade support.These apart, the company will also support training and facility, research, development, test and evaluation program, research and development of submarine/submersibles, miscellaneous special studies, temporary alteration support, modernization of submarine/submersible systems/subsystems and affordability/cost reduction technical support. Markedly, the dealincludes foreign military sales (FMS) to Spain.While majority of the work will be performed at Groton, CT, the rest will be performed at a few other places across the United States. It will be completed using FMS and fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) as well as fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) fundsby September 2018.Nuclear Submarines and the United StatesTo counter the rising geopolitical tensions across the world, the U.S. government has been designing submarines for decades. In 1954, the U.S. Navy was the first to launch a nuclear-powered submarine. These submarines were markedly better than the diesel-engine ones that had to make multiple stops for refueling. Currently, the U.S. Navy has three classes of nuclear-powered attack submarines — Virginia-class, Ohio-class and Los Angeles-class.Notably, the market for nuclear submarine is a consolidated one in the United States, operated by two prime players like General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report). As a result, both the companies enjoy a large share of the market and high profit margins.In this context, it is imperative to mention that recently the U.S. administration has been allotting significant provision for nuclear submarines in the nation’s defense budget, thereby encouraging submarine-manufacturers in boosting their production. Evidently, the fiscal 2017 budget proposal allocated $8.1 billion for submarines.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. This is because it is one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. The company is also a prime contractor for the development of Columbia-class submarines and Virginia-class submarines.Given the Navy’s recent acknowledgement of the nuclear submarines as its top priority and the huge budget allotted to the same, the modification contract will undoubtedly render the company a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Recently, the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee approved fiscal 2018 defense policy bill. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2018, worth $700 billion, includes $25 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. Going forward, the bill is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, which is one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have surged 31.9% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 43.7%. This downturn might have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government in the defense space.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Better-ranked stocks in the same space include Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report).

675,GD,"Shares of companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report), fell on Monday despite newly intensified rhetoric from North Korea regarding the possibility of war with the U.S.North Korea Tensions North Korea’s foreign minister Ri Yong Ho said on Monday that the U.S. had declared war on his country, according to a Wall Street Journal report. The foreign minister’s claim was reportedly in response to a Saturday flyover of U.S. bombers and fighter jets near North Korea—north of the Demilitarized Zone—and a tweet from President Donald Trump.But the U.S. has a different view of those flights, and President Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) Saturday to rebuke the North Korean foreign minister’s statements to the U.N. over the weekend.“This mission is a demonstration of U.S. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat,"" Defense Department spokesman Dana White said in a statement over the weekend. “North Korea's weapons program is a grave threat to the Asia-Pacific region and the entire international community.”Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017The North Korea minister told reporters on Monday that North Korea had “every right to make countermeasures, including the right to shoot down U.S. strategic bombers, even if they are not yet inside the air-space border of our country.” The official said that every possible option for a North Korean response is on the table.Ri Yong Ho also said if North Korea takes action against U.S. military planes that “the question of who will be around much longer will be answered then.”U.S. officials were quick to respond and try to curb the further escalation of tensions. “We continue to seek a peaceful denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” State Department spokesman Justin Higgins said. ""No nation has the right to fire on other nations’ aircraft or ships in international airspace or waters.”White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders also responded and said that claims that the U.S. declared war against Kim Jong Un’s regime were “absurd.”Defense StocksDespite the revved up and continued war of words between Washington and Pyongyang, shares of some of the biggest U.S. aerospace and defense companies fell.Lockheed Martin stock dipped 0.41% while Boeing saw its stock price fall 0.85%. Shares of Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) fell 0.54%, while General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) stock experienced more marginal declines.  Defense ETFs,including the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report), the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report), and the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) all fell by about 0.50%.Aside from defense stock dips, the iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund ETF (EWY  -  Free Report), which tracks South Korean companies, fell by 0.65%.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

678,GD,"Following fresh tensions over North Korea’s fanatic militant activities, this time targeting Japan, majority of the U.S. defense stocks moved north on Aug 30. Notably, North Korea fired a ballistic missile which flew over Japan's Hokkaido island before crashing in to the sea.This sudden move made investors skeptical owing to which major world market indices, at the onset of Aug 29 trading session, dipped. However, by the end of the day, the U.S. stocks regained their footing.The S&P 500 ended the session by inching up 0.1%, while both the Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.3%. Though investors were initially unnerved by the mounting tension due to the missile launch and Hurricane Harvey’s devastation, the day eventually closed on a promising note. U.S. administration’s aggressive defense strategy probably saved the day for the stocks.How Did North Korea Justify?North Korea’s President Kim Jong-Un justified the move as an action to counter the United States and South Korean military drills. Per major media sources, Kim maintained that the missile launch was his first step of conducting military operations in the Pacific and more such actions can be expected, going forward.Moreover, North Korea's official news agency KCNA claimed that the move marks the anniversary of the disputed Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula.South Korea and U.S. RetaliatesA high alert has been issued in Japan following North Korea’s missile launch. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe strongly condemned the action as a “reckless act” and a grave threat to the country’s security. He also reminded North Korea of the U.S.’ cordial relationship with Japan. In response, a few hours after the attack on Japan, South Korea dropped bombs at the Taebaek Pilsung Firing Range in North Korea’s Gangwon province. Through this South Korea exhibited its military strength to dent the opposition’s confidence when needed.Further, North Korea’s missile attack on Japan, was severely criticized by the U.S. President Trump.

679,GD,"The year 2017 has been an overwhelming one for The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), with the aerospace giant winning a series of billion-dollar orders for commercial jets. In addition, being one of the largest defense contractors, with a market cap of more than $175 billion, this market mover has led the S&P 500 index to new highs multiple times in 2017. Evidently, Boeing’s share price has surged 89.7% so far this year, which more than quadrupled the S&P 500’s gain of 20.1%.Compared to its arch-rival Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report) as well as other peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), this was a notable achievement for Boeing, since none of these stocks gained more than 55% year to date. The company also delivered the latest model of renowned 737 fleet — the 737 Max — in May 2017. Ever since, the company has been witnessing solid order growth for this particular model from varied customers.Below we have discussed the factors which have helped Boeing outperform the broader market this year. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.(Looking for the Best Stocks for 2018? Be among the first to see our Top Ten Stocks for 2018 portfolio here.)Commercial Orders: A Major Growth DriverBoeing is well known for winning notable commercial orders for its renowned aircraft each year. At the Paris Air Show and the Dubai Air Show in 2017 the company won a number of billion-dollar orders. At the Paris Air Show, the company won a $6.2-billion deal for delivering 50 737 Max 10 jets to Lion Air Group, a $2.2-billion deal for delivering up to 40 737 Max to ALAFCO, a $2.5-billion deal for 20 737 airplanes, an $8.1-billion deal for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, a $7.4-billion deal for a number of 737 10s, 737 8s and 787-9 Dreamliners to CDB Aviation among others.Dubai Air Show 2017 also witnessed some landmark deals involving Boeing. The company won a deal worth $15.1 billion for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates airline, a $27-billion deal for delivering 225 737 MAX airplanes to flydubai airlines, a $2.2-billion order for supplying 20 additional 737 MAX 8s to ALAFCO and a $1.9-billion order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters.Needless to Say, such huge flow of commercial orders aided Boeing’s growth. Notably, the company’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Interestingly, majority of the commercial orders Boeing won in 2017 belonged to the 737-fleet.Considering the fact that 737 is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from 92 customers, such huge order growth will aid the 737 model to maintain its leading position in the single-aisle jet market.Solid Demand Aiding Boeing Demand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes is on the rise due to a steady improvement in passenger and freight traffic. Per Boeing's current market outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. Boeing also expects the commercial fleet to be fueled by sustained 4.7% annual growth in commercial passenger traffic.Single-aisle jets are expected to be the major demand driver, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years, reflecting 5% increase over last year's projection. Boeing, being a leading company in single-aisle jet production, on virtue of its 737 model expects to raise the 737 production rate from 47 per month in 2017 to 52 per month in 2018. This surely reflects the optimism that Boeing boasts toward increased demand for its 737 fleet of jets.Apart from its strong forte in the United States, the company expects that China will need 7,240 new planes worth $1.1 trillion over the next 20 years. India will need 2,100 new planes worth $290 billion in 20 years, up 13.5% from the year-ago estimate of 1,850 planesIn the Middle East, Boeing expects to witness demand for 3,350 new planes worth $730 billion between 2017 and 2036. Single-aisle jets worth $190 billion are projected to comprise over 50% of the total deliveries in the Middle East. Such expanding market outlook surely indicates increased growth prospects for Boeing.Defense: Another Glowing BusinessBoeing’s defense business stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and order backlog. The company’s third-quarter 2017 defense deliveries were 44 units. Total deliveries consisted of 18 AH-64 Apache helicopters (both new and remanufactured) and 11 Chinook helicopters (new and renewed), six F/A-18s, five P-8 models and four F-15s.Boeing remains on track with the $52 billion KC-46 aerial tanker program. Boeing is scheduled to complete delivery of all 179 aircraft by 2027. Apart from the KC-46 aerial refueling tanker program, the new organization will also oversee the building of the presidential aircraft for the Air Force along with the CST-100 spacecraft for NASA. Considering the $700-billion fiscal 2018 defense bill sanctioned by the U.S. Senate this September, the defense business of Boeing is expected to gain traction in coming days.New Business VenturesBoeing has lately taken initiatives to expand in an unconventional business line — the “Space.” The company’s management has identified satellite business and space exploration as the two ""key"" opportunities to generate growth. In particular, Boeing has teamed up with NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) to deliver “Deep Space Gateway” and “Deep Space Transport.” While, the Deep Space Gateway is a space outpost, the Deep Space Transport is a vehicle that will take humans to longer-duration space missions. Management expects to construct the gateway in four launches by the early 2020s.Interestingly, fiscal 2018 budget has allocated $3.7 billion for SLS and associated ground system. Once the deep space gateway and transport vehicle concepts are materialized, Boeing, being the prime SLS contractor, will gain the most.Restructurings to Add ValueIn June 2017, Boeing decided to lay off 50 executives from its Defense, Space & Security (BDS) segment. Simultaneously the company also decided to break down its Military Aircraft and Network & Space Systems segments into four smaller units. At that time Bloomberg announced that 60 defense executives will be transferred to Boeing Global Services. This new unit, incorporating defense and commercial aircraft parts, maintenance, and information technology products, is expected to evolve into a $50-billion business.Constituting more than 21% of the company’s total earnings as of third quarter of 2017, BDS unit holds a significant key to Boeing’s growth story. The company’s management has been focused on reducing cost and inducing enhanced competitiveness and growth in this segment recently. Toward this end, last November, some consolidation initiatives were announced, under which by the end of 2020, its facility spaces were aimed to be reduced by approximately 4.5 million square feet, causing layout of 500 employees.We believe the executive lay-off decision was a bold one taken by Boeing’s management, going a step ahead of what it has done earlier. Such a notable job cut will clearly save money for the company, which, in turn, can be reinvested to boost further growth of its defense unit.Solid Cash Flow Aiding Dividend HikeBoeing has been rewarding shareholders with lucrative dividend hikes. Earlier this month, the company boosted its quarterly dividend by 20.4%, bringing the quarterly payout to $1.71 per share and the annualized payout to $6.84. Along with the dividend hike, Boeing also authorized a new stock-repurchase plan of $18 billion, which replaces the existing share buyback program.Impressively, Boeing has increased its dividend per share by more than 250% over last five years. Also, the company has been consistently paying dividends to shareholders each quarter for over 75 years. A solid cash flow structure primarily supports this dividend payouts for Boeing. Evidently the company boasts solid cash and investments in marketable securities worth $10 billion, as of September 2017. Its cash flow from operating activities at the end of the third quarter of 2017 was $10.4 billion compared with the year-ago quarter figure of $7.7 billion.Should You Invest in BA?We consider that Boeing is a profitable stock which can be a prudent long-term bet for risk averse investors. Year to date, the company’s share price has gained 89.8% compared with Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry’s rally of 44.3%.On the valuation front too, the company looks very attractive. The stock currently has an earnings yield of 3.3%, falling below the S&P 500 average of 4.8%, thereby reflecting scope for improvement. Moreover, the company’s long-term earnings growth rate of 13% is more than that of industry’s 11.7%.Further, Boeing has a VGM Score of A. Notably, the VGM Score rates each stock on their combined weighted styles, helping to identify those with the most attractive value, best growth, and most promising momentum, across the board. This assures our point that the stock has still plenty of potential.To conclude, factors like solid cash flow offering financial stability to Boeing, huge jetliner demand play a vital role for investors to choose this stock as a profitable investment option, which in turn will enable Boeing to maintain its stellar performance and lead the S&P 500 in 2018 as well.Wall Street’s Next AmazonZacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time. It’s a once-in-a-generation opportunity to invest in pure genius.Click for details >>

680,GD,"Aerospace behemoth The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) won a modification contract for upgrading F-15 Radar Modernization program (RMP).Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Apr 30, 2020.Valued at $94.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH. Per the terms of the agreement, the modification includes exercise of options for 13 RMP Group A kits, 13 RMP Group B kits, 38 RMP installs, 14 conformal fuel tank installs, and other required support being produced under the original contract. Work will be executed in St. Louis, MO.A Brief Note on F-15 & RMPBoeing’s F-15 Strike Eagle is a twin-engine, all weather tactical fighter aircraft. Its proven design is undefeated in air-to-air combat, with more than 100 aerial combat victories.Under the F-15 RMP, the legacy APG-70 mechanically-scanned radar incorporated in F-15 jets is replaced with an active electronically-scanned array (AESA) system - the APG-82(V)1 radar. Notably, APG-82 V1, manufactured by defense prime Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), optimizes the F-15’s multirole mission capability. It includes extended-range, superior multi-target tracking and precision engagement potential. This version also enhances the  system’s reliability over the prior model of APG-70 radar.Other hardware and software modifications comprising the RMP effort include a more powerful Environmental Control System, updates to the aircraft Operational Flight Program and Electronic Warfare software, a new radio frequency tunable filter and aircraft modifications.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing is one of the largest aerospace and defense contractors, with its defense business standing out among peers on virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog. The company has been receiving several contracts from the Pentagon to install the APG-82 radar systems on its F-15E fighter-bombers. With the installation of these radar systems, high-resolution ground-mapping data has been enabled in the F-15, which helps the crew to identify targets from great distances and increases situational awareness, lethality and survivability.Till date, Boeing has manufactured more than 1,600 of the aircraft for six countries and none of them plan to retire the F-15, thereby indicating this jet’s enhanced sustainability. In 2016, the company delivered 15 F-15s, up 25% from the year-ago tally. Considering the recent contract for RMP and the escalating geopolitical tension across the globe, we may expect increased demand for Boeing’s combat proven aircraft in days ahead. This in turn, will boost the company’s revenue growth trajectory.Price MovementBoeing’s stock has moved up 85.7% in the last one year, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 39.8%.This might have been led by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. The company also poses strong competition to its peers like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

682,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Ordnance and Tactical Systems secured a contract worth $14.7 million for supplying machine gun barrels. The deal has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Land and Maritime, Warren, MI.Details of the DealPer the three-year contract with no option periods, the machine gun barrels will be used by the U.S. Army.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 24, 2021. It will be executed in Vermont and will utilize Army working capital funds of fiscal 2018 through 2021.Regular OrdersGeneral Dynamics holds a strong position in the domestic as well as international defense space. In fact, Huntington Ingalls Inc (HII  -  Free Report) and this defense major are the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. Also, General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. This, in turn, allows the company to win notable contracts from Pentagon and other U.S. allies.Last month, General Dynamics secured a modification contract worth $109.2 million for procuring Hydra rockets. Again, in September, it had clinched a $341.2 million modification contract to exercise the option for design agent, planning yard, engineering and technical support for in-service nuclear submarines. Also, a $5.1 billion special incentives contract has been awarded to General Dynamics for completing the design of the Integrated Product and Process Development for the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs). Going forward, we expect such awards to bolster the company’s revenue growth.Defense Scenario Driving OrdersWith the meteoric rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) over the last few years and more developing nations increasing their share of defense spending, global market for defense equipment has been on growth trajectory. This, in turn, has provided a solid impetus to sales in the U.S. Aerospace-Defense industry with the nation being the largest weapon supplier. Again, the growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times.Furthermore, the recent budgetary amendments in the country have favored defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the days to follow.In July 2017, the U.S. House passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion. The bill includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. If approved, it is anticipated to boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Our TakeGeneral Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the leading commercial disposer of explosive materials and devices in the United States. Also, it is one of the leading manufacturers of mortar weapons and systems, bomb bodies and propellants. This unit falls under the General Dynamics Combat Systems segment.During the third quarter of 2017, the Combat Systems segment generated 13% revenue growth year over year. We can expect consistent growth in the segment's top line, going forward. The improvement is anticipated to be driven by strong demand for its products and frequent contract wins.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 17.3% in a year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 35.9%. This may have been caused by the fact that the company is witnessing declining backlogs in recent times.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

683,GD,"Shares of companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), jumped on Tuesday as tensions surrounding North Korea escalated once again, this time in the wake of a missile launch over Japan.North Korea North Korea launched a missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, which eventually landed in the Pacific Ocean. Pyongyang missile launches have become all too commonplace, but the most recent one over Japan was the first of its kind in almost a decade.Kim Jong Un’s regime had never launched a missile over a major foreign population center—his deceased father, Kim Jong Il last fired over Japan’s main islands in 2009. The newest provocation caused not only heightened responses from world leaders, including Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, but helped to send markets and indexes down as well.“A missile launch across Japan is an outrageous act that poses an unprecedented, grave and serious threat, and significantly undermines the peace and security of the region,” Prime Minister Abe said in a statement. “The Government has lodged a firm protest against North Korea. We ask the United Nations Security Council to convene an emergency meeting.”Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said he will ask for funds to begin to utilize a land-based version of an anti-missile system used by U.S. battleships called the Aegis Ashore, according to the Wall Street Journal. One unit of the defense system, which is manufactured by Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), costs about $80 billion.The escalating tensions out of North Korea also prompted President Donald Trump to respond.“The world has received North Korea’s latest message loud and clear: this regime has signaled its contempt for its neighbors, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behavior,” President Trump said in a statement released by the White House.“Threatening and destabilizing actions only increase the North Korean regime’s isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table.”Defense StocksOn the back of escalating North Korean tensions, U.S. defense-based stocks saw gains on Tuesday. Shares of Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report) climbed over 1.80% to touch a new all-time high of $182.05 a share. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) stock jumped by 1.35% and just missed matching its all-time high.Shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) both gained around 1%, while General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) rose 1.25%.Defense ETFs,including the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report) and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report), both saw their stock prices rise by over 1%. The iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report) gained 0.90%.Other Movement Tied To North KoreaAside from the upward movement by military defense stocks, companies and indexes in the region fell.The iShares MSCI South Korea Index Fund ETF (EWY  -  Free Report), which tracks South Korean companies, fell by 0.84%. The Nikkei-225 index, which tracks top-rated Japanese companies listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, closed down 0.45%. The Nikkei has fallen by 2.82% over the last month.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

684,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) announced that its aeronautics business segment has secured a $47.8 million contract from the U.S. Air Force.Per the terms of the contract, the company is required to provide engineering and technical services for F-16 aircraft. Work related to the deal will be carried out at the Hill Air Force Base, UT; Toledo, OH; Tucson, AZ and McEntire Joint National Guard Base, SC along with 12 other international locations such as Bahrain, Pakistan, Chile, Jordan, Turkey, Morocco, Taiwan, Oman, Egypt, Iraq, Thailand and Indonesia. Operations are expected to be completed by June 2020.The F-16V, which is the latest F-16 configuration, comes with numerous enhancement designs to make the F-16 aircraft one of the top choices for the international security forces. The latest version is equipped with Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar, a modern commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based avionics subsystem, a large format, high-resolution display and a high volume and speed data bus.Importance of Foreign Military SalesForeign Military Sales (FMS) is a program with which the U.S. government assists defense companies in selling related articles and services to other governments or international customers. The U.S. Department of Defense thus works as an intermediary between manufacturers and foreign customers.FMS helps in extending military ties between the United States and other military governments and helps U.S. allies to contribute efficiently in joint missions. The FMS contracts support the top line of the U.S. defense companies when there is a drop in domestic orders.Foreign Military Sales Aids LockheedIn March 2017, President Donald Trump’s administration said that it will go forward with the sale of 19 Lockheed Martin F-16 jets to Bahrain worth $5 billion. This deal was earlier stalled by the Obama Administration owing to the human rights concerns. This gave a huge boost to this product line for the company. (Read More: Trump Admin to Pursue Lockheed's F-16 Jet Sale to Bahrain)Additionally, the company has been witnessing strong demand for its equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany, helicopters in Poland and missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe and Middle East regions.Moreover, in the month of May, Trump signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia. Notably, Lockheed Martin seemed to have garnered the majority of this huge pact, with Saudi Arabia set to procure its integrated air and missile defense, combat ship, tactical aircraft and rotary wing technologies and programs for $28 billion.Other than the foreign military sales, the proposed hike in the 2018 defense budget is also expected to boost the performance of defense behemoths like Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) among others.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have gained 13.1%, outperforming the industry’s gain of 12% in the last six months.As the largest defense contractor in the world, Lockheed Martin continues to be a strong cash generator. The recently passed defense policy bill for 2018, with a promise of $696 billion budget, is also expected to boost growth of this defense prime.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

685,GD,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a contract to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft. It has been awarded by the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation, Philadelphia, PA.Contract DetailsValued at $323.5 million, the deal includes a five-year base contract with one five-year option period.Work is scheduled to be completed by Dec 30, 2023 and will be carried out at Missouri. The contract will use Navy working capital funds of fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2023.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet – a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet – is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. It is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier.Among the F/A-18 family, F/A 18E is a single-seat variant of the Super Hornet that is about 25% larger than its predecessor, the F/A-18C/D but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business and stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. In particular, among other defense equipments the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft. It also started developing military aerial refueling and strategic transport aircraft, of late.Notably, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, Boeing has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Recently, the company clinched a modification contract, valued at $222.5 million, for eight CH-47F new build helicopters. The deal aims to support the Royal Saudi Land Forces Aviation Command. Again, it won a $349.2 million contract for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent. Per the agreement, Boeing will deliver an affordable total system replacement of Minuteman III missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Meanwhile, Trump’s proposal to boost the nation’s defense budget by 10% in 2018 from that of 2016 is likely to benefit defense biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 78.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.4%. This may have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

686,GD,"Defense bellwether Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) business unit recently secured a contract for the development and production of a digital receiver exciter for the AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Jan 31, 2021.Details of the dealValued at $25.3 million, the contract was awarded by the Marine Corps System Command, Quantico, VA. However the maximum value of the agreement can reach up to $46.7 million, on exercise of options included in the deal.Majority of the work will be executed in Liverpool, NY, while the remaining at Atlanta, GA and Clearwater, FL. Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2016 research, development, test and evaluation (Marine Corps) funds to complete the contract. A Brief Note on AN/TPS-59A(V)3 Radar systemLockheed Martin’s AN/TPS-59A(V)3 is a long-range 3-D ground-based air surveillance radar.The radar, the latest version of the TPS-59 variety fielded in 1985, can detect and track air-breathing targets like aircraft and cruise missiles as far away as 300 miles. It can also detect tactical ballistic missiles as far away as 400 miles. AN/TPS offers 360-degree coverage to elevations of nearly 200 miles.Developed for the United States’ Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the Marine Corps, the TPS-59 (V) 3 is designed to operate with HAWK and Patriot systems. The radar has been designed to be transported by truck, helicopter, or C-130 cargo plane rapidly.Our ViewLockheed Martin’s radar systems offer advanced precision targeting, navigation, threat detection and next generation intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. In fact, the company’s radars and sensors have been designed and delivered to every armed service and operational environment. Thanks to its advanced radar systems, the company’s RMS unit enjoys a steady flow of contracts from the Pentagon. Evidently, Lockheed Martin won a contract worth $1.58 billion from the U.S. Army to supply radars that track incoming rocket, mortar and artillery fire in March 2017.In the second quarter of 2017, the RMS business segment generated sales of $3.4 billion, which represented 26.8% of Lockheed Martin’s total sales and witnessed a 3% rise from the year-ago quarter figure. Currently, the company is developing the next generation radars and sensors that can detect, track and identify threats quickly. Considering this, more such radar-based contracts like the recent one can be expected for Lockheed Martin. This in turn will further boost sales growth for the RMS unit.Moreover, in the budget proposals for additional fiscal 2017 appropriations worth $30 billion, the White House requested an extra base budget of $24.9 billion and Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget worth $5.1 billion. Given the current U.S. administration being in favor of higher defense spending, there is a high chance for this proposal getting approved in the U.S. House as well as the Senate. This in turn will definitely improve the growth prospects of defense majors like Lockheed Martin, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) in the nation.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock moved up 24% in the last one year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.4%.This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line while the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Furthermore, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankLockheed Martin currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

687,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a $24-million contract by the U.S. Army. Per the terms of the order, the company will work on the modification of Hydra rockets. Work related to the contract will be carried out at the company’s Williston, VA facility and is expected to be completed by Nov 30, 2017.Hydra-70 RocketsOrdnance and Tactical Systems, a unit of General Dynamics, is the primary contractor for the Hydra rockets. Hydra-70 rockets are 2.75-inch unguided rockets that include unitary and cargo warheads. They can be used for point and area targets. The missiles are part of a lethal yet lightweight weapon system with multi-mission capability.In August, the company was awarded another $60-million contract for the modification of Hydra-70 rockets. General Dynamics has manufactured more than four million Hydra-70 rockets since 1996 for the U.S. Army.Regular Orders Boosting PortfolioGeneral Dynamics holds a strong position in the domestic as well as international defense space. In addition to being one of the two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the other one being Huntington Ingalls Inc (HII  -  Free Report), General Dynamics boasts a diverse product and service portfolio along with a wide customer base. This in turn allows this defense biggie to win notable contracts from both Pentagon and other U.S. allies.To this end, last month, the company secured a contract worth $311 million to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3 battle tank. We expect such awards to bolster the company’s revenue growth in the coming days.Defense Scenario Helping Industry GiantsThe growing cross-border tension due to North Korea’s continuous nuclear tests along with radical terrorism has boosted the defense sector in the recent times. The recent budgetary amendments in the country have also favored defense giants like General Dynamics, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) among others. These factors are expected to rake in more orders for these companies in the days to follow.Moreover, the U.S. House passed fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $696.5 billion in July 2017. It includes $6 billion to boost Navy shipbuilding. If approved, this will also boost revenue growth for General Dynamics, one of the prime shipbuilders in the United States.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 33.1% in a year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 45.0%.This may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts inflicted by the U.S. government in the defense space.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

688,GD,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has won a modification contract, worth $600 million, to provide new preliminary design activity requirements for the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization (PAR) program. The contract was awarded by the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, OH.Details of the ContractThis modification will supplement work that is already taking place under the PAR contract, which includes risk reduction activities and the acquisition of two commercial Boeing 747-8 aircraft.Per the contract, Boeing will complete preliminary design work for the modification of two 747-8 aircraft to replace the two aging VC-25A and Boeing 747-200, used as presidential support aircraft.The resulting modification to the aircraft, which is expected to be negotiated in a future contract modification, will include incorporating a mission communications system, electrical power upgrades, a medical facility, an executive interior, a self-defense system, and autonomous ground operations capabilities.Work is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2018 and will be executed in Seattle, WA. The contract will use fiscal 2017 research and development funds to complete the task. Future PlansFurther modifications are expected to be made in the contract, going forward. This will be done to include the purchase of the commercial 747-8 aircraft, in addition to designing, modifying and testing them to meet the standards for the presidential mission.Once the results of the risk reduction activities have been identified, the Air Force will offer the majority of the program on a separate contract.The PAR ProgramOn Jan 28, 2015, Secretary of the U.S. Air Force, Deborah Lee James, in coordination with Frank Kendall, Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, revealed that Boeing’s 747-8 has been selected as the next presidential aircraft, commonly known as Air Force One. It was approved on Sep 4, 2015.The PAR program will replace the existing Air Force One, VC-25A, through an extremely customized acquisition program by 2024.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 95.4% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 42.6%. This might have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.

689,GD,"Recently, AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report), and the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) together revealed that so far more than 80% of the state governors have decided to enter the FirstNet project, the first nationwide dedicated wireless network for first responders. States still reviewing their options have until Dec. 28 to opt in or out of the project.Notably, in March 2017, AT&T was selected by FirstNet to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network aims to cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs over the next two years.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Importantly, per the deal, AT&T will be able to use this highly valuable spectrum for both commercial purposes and consumer services. This is why several industry researchers believe that the FirstNet project may come as a boon to cell tower operators such as American Tower Corp. (AMT  -  Free Report) and SBA Communications Corp. (SBAC  -  Free Report).In October 2017, AT&T and FirstNet introduced a new developer programme focused on public safety innovation. The programme will supply applications to a new FirstNet app store. These apps will be utilized by first responders who will select appropriate solutions to work on the FirstNet network that AT&T is set to build. Importantly, AT&T will connect FirstNet users to the company's telecommunications network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.Price Performance of AT&TAT&T’s shares have gained 2.03% compared with the industry’s growth of 2.31% over the past 90 days.

690,GD,"General Dynamics Corporation’s (GD  -  Free Report) business unit, Land Systems, secured a contract to design, develop and integrate several engineering changes into the Abrams M1A2 SEP V3 (System Enhancement Package Version 3).Contract DetailsValued at $310.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Army Contracting Command, Warren, MI.Work is scheduled to be completed by Feb 28, 2024. It will be performed in Lima, OH; Sterling Heights, MI; Scranton, PA and Tallahassee, FL. The deal will use fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds.About the AbramsThe Abrams M1A2 is the advanced version of the M1A1 battle tank, which includes a commander's independent thermal viewer, weapon station, position navigation equipment, and a full set of controls and displays connected by a digital data bus. The M1A2 is equipped with an improved fire control system due to these upgrades.Notably, M1A2 SEP V3 is the most modern version of the Abrams tank. It has a number of upgrades in the area of survivability, maintainability, fuel efficiency and network capabilities. Moreover, its upgrades comprise the new armor package and improved anti-IED capability.Why General Dynamics?General Dynamics has a long-standing strategic alliance with the U.S. defense establishments. This partnership has been backed by its consistent efforts on trying to meet its commitments in terms of maintaining product and service standards, along with delivery timing. Also, it has been upgrading Saudi Arabia’s fleet of M1A1 and M1A2 tanks for a long time.General Dynamics’ Abrams tanks provide troops with a proven and supreme decisive edge. In addition, survivability, mobility, adaptability and maintainability are important features of the tank. These capabilities make the tanks formidable and allow them to dominate the battlefield.Major international militaries of countries like Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Iraq are the primary customers of the Abrams tanks.Price MovementGeneral Dynamics’s stock has rallied about 30.3% in the last year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 36.3%. This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders, and any further budget cut in the United States might hurt the company’s growth prospects. Moreover, the stock's performance lagged compared with its peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) and Leidos Holdings, Inc.

691,GD,"After the North Korea issue, geopolitical risks heightened again, with Trump's Afghanistan speech. President Donald Trump recently commented that as many as 4,000 more U.S. troops will be employed to handle Afghanistan’s terror issue and that he will launch a political arrangement with the Taliban. The President also said that a quick removal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan may once again attract terrorists to fill that gap.As per an article published on Bloomberg, the comments mark a shift from Trump’s presidential campaign. During the campaign, Trump only approved the necessity of U.S. interference in Afghanistan’s terrorism issue. In fact, he hinted at the more crucial need for abandoning military engagement in that region and deploying resources rather at the domestic land.At the start of the month, Donald Trump pledged that North Korean premier Kim Jong-Un’s nuclear threats will be met with “fire and fury.” Increasing tensions between the two regions — the U.S. and North Korea and recent comments about Afghanistan have pushed up defense and aerospace stocks (read: ETFs to Profit from US-North Korea Tensions).Moreover, the earnings season has also been quite impressive for companies in this sector. The sector came up with 90% of earnings and 70% revenues beat, which is pretty encouraging (read: Q2 Earnings Effect: 4 Must-See ETF Charts).ETF WinnerDefense Since stocks like Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) (up over 1.7%), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) (up about 1.9%), General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) (up about 1.3%), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) (up about 1.4%) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report) (up about 1%) gained post Trump’s Afghanistan comments, aerospace and defense ETFs like iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), PowerShares Aerospace & Defense Portfolio (PPA  -  Free Report) and SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) gained on August 22, 2017.ITA put about 11.1% weight in Boeing while the other above-mentioned stocks take about 27% of the fund.

692,GD,"The recent altercation between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un sent the major defense stocks rallying. Notably, Trump cautioned North Korea that if it does not refrain from repeated missiles threats, the U.S. will respond with “fire and fury.”In retaliation, Kim threatened to fire missiles on Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses military bases. While the rest of the broader market reacted negatively to the escalated geopolitical tensions, defense stocks picked up pace.But it is imperative to mention that this tension between the U.S. and North Korea has not been the only driving force behind the defense stocks’ rally. In fact, the space has been a big market winner for quite some time now, on the back of Trump’s presidential win and a few other factors.However, major indices for the Aerospace sector ended up in the red in the trailing five trading sessions. While the S&P 500 Aerospace & Defense (Industry) Index lost 0.8%, the Dow Jones U.S. Aerospace & Defense Index declined 0.9% during this period. Nevertheless, a generous flow of funds from the Pentagon continued to boost the sector.Among last week’s highlights, defense majors like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), Boeing Co.

Quote Total RevenuesTotal revenues in the third quarter were $1.86 billion, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.78 billion by 4.5%. The top line rose 10.7% from the year-ago figure of $1.68 billion. The upside was driven by improved sales growth in all the business divisions of the company.Segment DetailsNewport News Shipbuilding: Segment revenues were $1,053 million, up 7.7% year over year due to higher revenues from aircraft carriers, submarines and naval nuclear support services. Operating income improved 41.2% to $96 million.Ingalls Shipbuilding: Segment revenues were $593 million, up 2.8% year over year on higher revenues in amphibious assault ships. Operating income at the segment improved 12.1% to $74 million.Technical Solutions: Segment revenues were $241 million, up 56.5% year over year primarily, due to higher volume in integrated mission solutions services.

694,GD,"Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report) is set to report third-quarter 2017 results on Nov 8, before the market opens.Last quarter, this military shipbuilder posted a positive earnings surprise of 22.52%. While the company’s Ingalls segment is expected to drive strong growth in the third quarter, the Newport News segment is likely to be a spoilsport.Let’s discuss these factors influencing Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, in brief.Ingalls Unit – A Key CatalystHuntington Ingalls’ Ingalls segment manufactures amphibious assault and expeditionary ships for the U.S. Navy and is the only builder of National Security Cutters (NSCs) for the U.S. Coast Guard. Notably, this division launched LHA 7, the second America-class amphibious assault (AAA) ship in May which has been driving sales volumes for this segment, lately. Based on the company’s better-than-expected second-quarter result, we expect the soon-to-be reported quarter’s results to reflect similar solid sales volumes, as well.  In line with this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s Ingalls business segment is pegged at $595 million for the third quarter, reflecting an annual improvement of 4.4%.Newport News Segment May Dent Growth: Here’s WhyHuntington Ingalls’ Newport News is the nation's sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers.This division, which generates more than 50% of the company’s total revenues, has been underperforming for the last couple of years. Going ahead, no near-term improvement can be expected anytime soon for this business unit.In line with this, our third-quarter consensus estimate for Newport News unit stands at $988 million, reflecting an annual decline of 16.3%. However, at the onset of the third quarter, this business unit signed a contract with United Steelworkers of America as the largest bargaining unit, which in turn may boost this division’s results.Other Factors to ConsiderIn addition to the aforementioned facets of Huntington Ingalls’ quarterly results, a steady inflow of orders from Pentagon is expected to provide an impetus to third-quarter sales. Among the notable deals that the company won in the yet-to-be-reported quarter, worth mentioning is the $105-million modification contract for upgrading nuclear submarines, another modification deal worth $149 million to procure additional long-lead-time material for USS Enterprise (CVN 80) and a $2.8-billion contract to support the refueling and complex overhaul of USS George Washington (CVN73).Moreover, the company’s Technical Solutions business continues to gain traction from Camber Corp’s acquisition.As a whole, for the third quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings reflects improvement of 22.5% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $1.78 billion, implying a 5.9% year-over-year increase.What Does the Zacks Model Unveils? Our proven model shows that Huntington Ingalls has chances of beating third-quarter earnings estimates because it has the right combination of two key components. While the company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), its Earnings ESP is +0.84%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.80, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.78. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.A positive ESP along with a favorable Zacks Rank serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Conversely, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

695,GD,"This year has been a big year for the stock market, with many notable indexes soaring to new highs. But 2017 was important for more than just share price performance—it also marked another year where the number of women leading Fortune 500 companies jumped as well.The percentage of women heading Fortune 500 companies hit an all-time high in 2017. As of this summer, when Fortune released its 2017 Fortune 500 list, 32 of the CEOs were women, up from just 21 last year.That number still only accounts for 6.4% of the total, but it proved to be the highest in the history of the list. The number of female-led companies on the Standard & Poor's 500 index is smaller by comparison, with only 26 women—or 5.2%—holding their company’s top position. This figure is based on a list compiled by the nonprofit group Catalyst. The firm also noted that women hold 21% of S&P 500 board seats.Those numbers indicate that there is still plenty of progress to be made, but female CEOs did lead some of the biggest and most well-known companies, in a range of industries, in 2017.This list includes the likes of aerospace and defense power General Dynamics’ (GD  -  Free Report) Phebe Novakovic, as well as industry competitor Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).In the retail sector, Barbara Rentler has helped the discount department store firm Ross Stores (ROST  -  Free Report) stock hit a new all-time high this year, making her one of several women leading their companies to new heights.Let’s take a closer look at more of those leaders:Mary Barra,General Motors (GM  -  Free Report) General Motors’ Chairman and CEO Mary Barra has served as the auto giant’s chief executive since January 2014. Since taking over the role as CEO, Barra has helped push GM towards the future with a focus on connected vehicles and electric car technology. On top of that, Barra began to focus some of GM’s energy on autonomous vehicle technology.Shares of GM are up 21.96% in 2017, and the company rests close to its five-year high, which it reached earlier this year. GM has beat or matched earnings expectations in the trailing 10 quarters and nearly every quarter since Barra became CEO.Tricia Griffith, The Progressive Corporation (PGR  -  Free Report) Tricia Griffith took over as president and chief executive officer of the insurance giant in July 2016. Since taking on the leading role at Progressive, Griffith began to bolster the company’s offerings. Previously, the company only really offered automotive coverage, but now Progressive has entered the $300 billion home insurance market—where they offer customers the chance to bundle home and auto.Griffith helped roll out the company’s HomeQuote Explorer tool. “Normally, homeowner quotes are a nightmare,” Griffith told Fortune. “They take a long time. This is something that we will buy, any publicly available data. You fill in a couple of fields and you get a home quote from four companies. Really easy.”Shares of Progressive are up over 57% on the year, and just hit a new 52-week and all-time high of $56.28 per share on Wednesday.Indra Nooyi,Pepsico, Inc. (PEP  -  Free Report)Indra Nooyi became Pepsico’s President and CEO in October 2006. She was then appointed chairman in May 2007. Nooyi facilitated Pepsico’s merger with Quaker Oats, which brought the beverage giant not only Quaker, but sports drink power Gatorade as well. She also helped lead the acquisitions of Tropicana and Wimm-Bill-Dann—which is the largest international acquisition in company’s history.Pepsico stock is up 13.36% this year, and it just recently hit a new all-time high of $119.74 per share, thanks in large part to Nooyi’s improvements to the company’s business.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

696,GD,"The market for U.S. public safety network for first responders and civil protection services is gradually becoming intensely competitive. Recently, U.S. telecom behemoth Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ  -  Free Report) announced plans of dedicating network capacity to emergency services providers.Notably, in March 2017, U.S. telecom giant AT&T Inc. (T  -  Free Report) was selected by the First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) to build and manage the first nationwide broadband network dedicated to America's police, firefighters and emergency medical services. The network will cover all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia, including rural communities and tribal lands in those states and territories.As part of the 25-year contract, FirstNet will provide AT&T with a swath of 20 MHz of spectrum in the 700 MHz frequency band for the entire duration. AT&T will also be given success-based payments of $6.5 billion over the next five years to design and build the network. The company is expected to spend around $40 billion over the life of the contract to build, deploy, operate and maintain the network. AT&T has projected that this contract will create more than 10,000 jobs in the next two years.AT&T’s consortium to deploy FirstNet includes Motorola Solutions Inc. (MSI  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Sapient Consulting and Inmarsat Government. Importantly, AT&T will connect FirstNet users to the company's telecommunications network assets, valued at more than $180 billion. This contract can be considered a necessary boost to the company’s profile.In order to take on the FirstNet-AT&T nationwide public safety network, Verizon stated that it will enhance its 4G LTE network to allow first responders priority access nationwide. In an apparent bid to ensure dedicated capacity for first responders, Verizon has decided to separate public-safety network from its commercial networks. The priority access and pre-emption services will be available to public safety when necessary and at no extra cost.Moreover, Verizon will make Band 14 devices available and ensure full interoperability with any Band 14 radio access networks (RANs) deployed by FirstNet. Band 14 is the 700MHz LTE band allocated for the public-safety network. Public authorities can use FirstNet, in addition to Verizon's public-safety services without federal funding. The company will also offer devices compatible both with FirstNet spectrum and its own wireless public-safety network.Price performance of Verizon Year-to-date, the stock price of Verizon has witnessed a decline of 10.28% compared with the industry’s growth of 3.44%. Nevertheless, the company has a very powerful diversified business model. On the wireless front, it will start initial deployment of the upcoming 5G network in 2018. Meanwhile, it is aggressively expanding its fiber-based footprint on the wireline front. In the digital media front, Verizon has emerged a major contender for the lucrative online advertisement business.

698,GD,"President Trump revealed a reversal of strategy in Afghanistan, promising to “fight to win” instead of withdrawing entirely. He vowed to ramp up U.S. engagement in Afghanistan, the country’s longest war to date. He added that moving troops away from Afghanistan would create a “vacuum”, which terrorists would “instantly fill”. But, he refrained from revealing specific troop numbers or measures of success.Defense stocks moved north on Trump’s Afghanistan speech, while such stocks have nearly doubled the S&P 500’s performance since his election victory. His commitment to swiftly increase military spending boded well for defense stocks. This calls for investing in such stocks for solid gains.Trump Announces More War in AfghanistanIn a much awaited speech, Trump announced that he won’t pull out troops from Afghanistan and is committed to a plan at winning the nation’s longest war, which is now in its 17th year. In other words, he is introducing a dramatic, new offensive in Afghanistan, which will integrate diplomatic, economic and military power. But, Trump refrained from divulging details on troop deployments or specific dates of operations for security reasons. He did acknowledge that his “original instinct was to pull out”, which was once an important campaign pledge before he became the President.Trump mentioned that the war will crush al Qaeda and prevent Taliban from taking over Afghanistan. He will urge NATO forces to join hands and support his new strategy. He also said that Pakistan is a terrorist hotbed and has harbored militants. Afghan Taliban and Haqqani network has found safe haven in Pakistan for the launch of multiple attacks on neighboring Afghanistan. He warned Islamabad of consequences if its government doesn’t take sweeping steps to eradicate such terrorist organizations. He stressed that Pakistan needs to have stronger ties with India in war against terrorists.Finally, he concluded that “terrorists take heed. America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat. Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military. And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense. In every generation we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed”.Big Money for Defense Contractors Tied to James MattisGeneral Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) stands to gain handsomely from Trump’s Afghanistan “surge’’. And why so? Prior to joining the Trump administration, Defense Secretary James Mattis was an “independent director” of the multinational defense contracting behemoth. He was paid $594,369 by the company between 2013 and 2016.It was during that time, the company boasted of receiving a $216 million order from the U.S. Army to build a “Warfighter Information Network” system. It was immensely successful in serving the army in Afghanistan. The company also received multi-million dollar payments for providing soldiers in Afghanistan items like Foxhound vehicles to IT management services.And now with Mattis holding a far more operational role, it can be expected that General Dynamics will benefit more from the Afghan war. Mattis now looks into more lucrative Pentagon contracts, which are positioned to even get more lucrative in the light of Trump’s declaration to deploy more troops in Afghanistan.Defense Stocks Rise on Trump’s SpeechDefense stocks rose broadly following Trump’s remarks, with the iShares U.S. Aerospace and Defense ETF (ITA) rising 1.2% on Aug 22. Major defense stocks like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and Boeing Co (BA  -  Free Report) gained 1.9%, 0.9% and 1.7%, respectively. Northrop and Boeing were also awarded contracts for intercontinental ballistic missile system replacements.In fact, Trump’s pledge to significantly increase federal spending related to national security was cheered by Republicans and has helped defense and aerospace stocks scale higher. He had promised to seek a $54-billion hike in spending on tanks, ships and weapon systems. The defense budget will climb 10%, according to the White House, while Trump recommended $30 billion in supplementary military spending for this year (read more: 5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Promises to Spend Big on Defense).5 Best Defense Stocks to Buy NowAs Trump’s Afghanistan strategy gives defense stocks a boost, investing in the same seems a prudent choice.

699,GD,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has secured an order from Avolon — the international aircraft leasing company — for 75 of its 737-MAX airplanes. Following the signing of memorandum of understanding at the Paris Air Show in June, the deal has been finally awarded during the 2017 Dubai Air Show.Order in DetailThe agreement comprises an order for 55 MAX 8 and 20 MAX 10 airplanes — the newest and largest member of the 737 MAX family — including purchase rights for 20 additional MAX 10 jets.Valued at nearly $11 billion at current list prices, the deal represents the largest single order till date that the company has placed with Boeing. Given the size of the deal, Avolon is expected to get a discount on the list price of the aircraft.With this latest aircraft deal, Avolon’s position as a leading lessor in the global commercial aviation market is likely to be strengthened. Currently, this Dublin, Ireland-based company has over 140 MAX aircraft in its owned and committed fleet, and expects MAX family airplanes to continue boosting its customers’ profit in their businesses, going forward.Deals Inked at the Ongoing Dubai Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic.Of late, at the Dubai Air Show, this aircraft giant received an order from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 additional 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion. Additionally, the company secured an order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters, valued at approximately $1.9 billion, from Azerbaijan Airlines.Apart from this, the company sealed a deal for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates,  the largest airline in the Middle East.  The purchase order also comes with equipments related to the 787-10 fleet, valued at $15.1 billion.Given the enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is witnessing significant progress, especially in the single-aisle market.Global Demand for Single-Aisle AircraftBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. The figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind the increase in demand, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges. Recently, Airbus received an order for 430 single-aisle airplanes valued at $49.5 billion at the Dubai Air Show.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Notably, the 737 model is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from 92 customers. The latest order that Boeing won from Avolon will aid the 737 model to maintain its leading position in the single-aisle jet market, going ahead.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has surged 68.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.9%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions.The stock also performed better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), which missed the industry mark.Zacks RankBoeing carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The company will utilize fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy), and operations and maintenance (Navy) funds to complete operations.A Brief Note on CG-47 & DD 963USS Ticonderoga (CG 47) is an Aegis guided missile cruiser, jointly developed by Huntington Ingalls and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report). Raytheon Company’s (RTN  -  Free Report) Tomahawk missiles were deployed in these warships. Currently, they are equipped with Aegis Combat System, which integrates the cruiser’s electronic sensors and weapons systems to engage anti-ship missile threats.Notably, Lockheed Martin Corporation’s (LMT  -  Free Report) AEGIS or Advanced Electronic Guidance and Instrumentation System is an integrated missile-guidance system, used by the U.S. Navy and allied ships to protect the battle group.Meanwhile, built by Huntington Ingalls, DD 963 Spruance-class destroyers were developed for the primary mission of anti-submarine warfare including operations as an integral part of attack carrier forces. It was designed to hunt down and destroy high speed submarines in all weather but can also engage ships, aircraft, and shore targets. These multi-purpose combatants are also capable of providing naval gunfire support in conjunction with Marine amphibious operations worldwide.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of Huntington ships.Going forward, the company's overall growth momentum is expected to continue, given the recent positive budget revision done by the Trump administration. In this regard, it is imperative to mention the fiscal 2017 spending bill, which include Ohio-Class replacement, advanced procurement for refueling CVN-74, advanced procurement for CVN-80, two Virginia class submarines and two DDG-51s, advanced procurement for LHA-8 and TAO(X), besides continuation of CVN-79 and investment in a new Coast Guard Icebreaker.Moreover, we believe the recently won contract by Huntington Ingalls to be a part of this spending bill and indicative of the fact that the U.S. Navy remains focused toward modernizing its existing fleet of warships. Hence, we can expect to witness more such contracts for Huntington Ingalls, in the coming days, which in turn will boost the company’s growth trajectory.Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied 32.7% in the last year, underperforming the industry’s gain of 41.6%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line. Additionally, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

701,GD,"Aerospace giant, The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), has secured a modification contract to offer full-rate production of six Lot 41 F/A-18E and eight F/A-18F aircraft. The terms of the deal includes delivery of these aircraft as well.Details of the DealValued at $676.6 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.The deal will utilize fiscal 2017 aircraft procurement (Navy) funds to complete the task, which is scheduled to be over by February 2017. While majority of the work will be carried out in El Segundo, CA, the rest will be executed in St. Louis, MS and various other locations across the United States.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft. Also, it is capable of landing and taking off from an aircraft carrier.A single-seat variant of the Super Hornet, F/A 18E, is about 25% larger than its predecessor —the F/A-18C/D — but comparatively contains 42% lesser structural parts.Why Boeing?Boeing is one of the major players in the defense business. In particular, the company’s key forte has been combat-proven aircraft compared with the other defense equipments. Additionally, with its proven expertise in aerospace programs, this aerospace giant has been clinching a huge number of contracts from the Pentagon for long.Evidently, Boeing won the Aerospace Systems Air Platform Technology Research program contract last week, from the U.S. Air Force. The deal came up with a ceiling value of $499 million. Per the contract, the company will provide quality research for affordable, revolutionary capabilities for the warfighter.Earlier, in August, the company clinched a contract worth $323.5 million, to supply spare parts of F/A-18 A-F and F/A-18 aircraft from the Defense Logistics Agency Aviation. To this end, we expect the recently won contract to add further impetus to the company’s growth trajectory.Meanwhile, the current budget scenario seems favorable for the defense industry, which buoys investors’ optimism this industry’s bellwethers like Boeing. In July, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. Markedly, the figure exceeded President Trump’s fiscal 2018 defense budget request proposed in March, 2017. If enacted, this budgetary amendment is expected to immensely boost Boeing’s as well as other defense majors’ business growth, going forward.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 91.9% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 41.4%. The improvement might have been because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Also, the company poses strong competition to its peers like Lockheed Martin Corp.

702,GD,"Defense prime Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Space Systems business unit secured a modification contract for Trident II (D5) missile deployed system support. Work related to this deal is expected to be completed by Sep 30.Valued at $21.9 million, the contract was awarded by the Strategic Systems Programs, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the agreement, majority of the work will be executed in Sunnyvale, CA; Cape Canaveral, FL and the rest at different other parts of the U.S.Fiscal 2017 weapons procurement (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Navy) funds will be utilized to complete the work.A Brief Note on Trident II (D5)Trident II (D5) is the latest generation of submarine-launched fleet ballistic missiles, developed and produced by Lockheed Martin. It was first deployed in 1990 and is currently aboard the OHIO-class and British VANGUARD-class submarines.These missiles are equipped with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV) and thermonuclear warheads.What’s Favoring Lockheed?Lockheed Martin’s Space Systems Co. is the prime contractor of the Navy's Trident missile. The company supplies technical and logistical support at sites where the missiles are deployed.In Sep 2016, the Navy launched an unarmed Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile, following which the company announced that it is building on a 60-year partnership with the Navy. The declaration was made to ensure that the missile system remains capable for decades ahead through the company’s shared robust flight test plan.The latest contract is expected to boost the company’s business substantially.  Given that Trident II (D5) is one of the most advanced U.S. Navy’s missile system, the company remains confident of winning more of such contracts in the near term.Price MovementLockheed Martin’s stock has returned 19.8% in the last one year, underperforming the 34.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could be attributed to the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticised for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

703,GD,"Defense behemoth, General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Ordnance and Tactical Systems, secured a modification contract worth $20.6 million, for supplying aircraft bombs. The deal has been awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Rock Island Arsenal, IL.Details of the DealAccording to the deal, the company will provide 10,933 MK82-6 bomb bodies, 866 MK84-4 bomb bodies and 1,365 MK84-10 bomb bodies to support the Air Force, the Navy and the foreign military sales (FMS) requirements.The modification covers FMS to Australia, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be completed by Dec 31, 2018. It will be executed in Garland, TX, and will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 aircraft procurement (Army) funds.A Brief Note on MK82 & MK84The Gun and Guided Missile Director MK82, produced by Ordnance and Tactical Systems, is a component of the Group MK81. Currently, it is being produced for Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Aegis Weapon System MK7.Markedly, the Antenna Assembly AS-34444/SPG-62 that is produced by Raytheon Co's (RTN  -  Free Report) Equipment Division is mounted on the MK82 by an elevation-over-train pedestal to provide space stabilization for the radar's line of site. The assembly is an unmanned system, which is capable of moving on two axes, train and elevation.MK84 is a general purpose bomb and also the largest of the MK80 series of weapons. It is a free-fall, non-guided GP 2,000-pound bomb that is used in the majority of bombing operations where maximum blast and explosive effects are desired. These bombs are relatively light and approximately 45% of their total weight is explosive.Our TakeGeneral Dynamics’ Ordnance and Tactical Systems is the leading commercial disposer of explosive materials and devices in the United States. It is one of the leading manufacturers of mortar weapons and systems, bomb bodies and propellants. This unit falls under the General Dynamics Combat Systems segment.As a whole, General Dynamics engages in mission-critical information systems and technologies, land and expeditionary combat vehicles, armaments and munitions, shipbuilding and marine systems and business aviation. It is the leading tank and artillery ammunition producer providing high-performance ammunition to the U.S. armed forces.During the second quarter of 2017, the Combat Systems segment generated 9% year-over-year revenue growth. We can expect consistent growth in the segment's top line, going forward. The improvement is expected to be driven by strong demand for its products and frequent contract wins like the aforementioned ones.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 29.9% in the last year, underperforming the broader industry’s gain of 41.4%. This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cuts will hurt the company’s growth prospects.Zacks Rank & Stock to ConsiderGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better-ranked stock in the same space include Leidos Holdings, Inc. (LDOS  -  Free Report) sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

704,GD,"Defense major Northrop Grumman Corporation’s (NOC  -  Free Report) business unit, Northrop Grumman Systems Corp., recently secured a modification contract worth $11 million, in relation to the Navy’s WSN-7 navigation system. Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by April 2019.The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Per the terms of the modification, the company will exercise a one-year option for production and supply of associated provisioned items of WSN-7 navigation system. Work will be carried out in Charlottesville, VA. Northrop Grumman will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds and fiscal 2017 other procurement (Navy) funds to finance the task.A Brief Note on WSN-7 Navigation SystemThe Inertial Navigation System (INS) AN/WSN-7 is a passive shipboard navigation system, deployed in the U.S. Navy ships, to calculate and indicate ship's position, attitude, heading and velocity in relation to the earth's rotation. The INS senses motion (inertial), gravity and earth rotation and helps in navigation functions.Additionally, the INS receives GPS updates and the ship's speed. The system is capable of operating throughout the world without any external position reference information. Per the U.S. Navy, the INS is unsusceptible to jamming and cannot be also detected by the opposition.Our ViewBeing the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, Northrop Grumman supplies a broad array of products and services to the U.S. Department of Defense, including defense electronics, unmanned aircraft and missile defense. Its Mission Systems business segment provides services relation to navigation systems.During the second quarter of 2017, this segment witnessed 3% revenue growth, courtesy of higher sales volume. Going ahead, for 2017, the company raised its sales outlook for the segment on the anticipation of success in the coat-reduction initiatives that management undertook as well as solid sales volume, in particular for F-35 jets.Notably, the company has a strong presence in Air Force, Space & Cyber Security programs which have aided it in securing regular contracts from different verticals of U.S. Defense. We believe winning contracts like the recent one will help Northrop Grumman in achieving its enhanced sales target for Mission Systems.Price PerformanceShares of Northrop Grumman have returned 26.2% in the last year compared to the industry’s increase of 36.1%. This might have been led by the company’s escalating operating expenses.In addition, steep competition from peers like Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) remains a major concern.Zacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(BA  -  Free Report), has secured a modification contract to provide additional funding for the Service Life Assessment Program (SLAP) and Service Life Extension Program (SLEP), Phase C for the F/A-18E/F aircraft.Notably, the SLAP and SLEP programs aid the extension of the service life of the F/A-18E/F jets beyond the original design of the 6,000 flight hours.Details of the DealValued at $42 million, the contract has been awarded by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Jul 30, 2021 and will be carried out in St. Louis, MS and El Segundo, CA.A Brief Note on F/A-18Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet — a twin-engine, supersonic, all weather multirole fighter jet — is the U.S. Navy’s primary strike and air superiority aircraft.

706,GD,"The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) has boosted its quarterly dividend by 20.4%. Also, it has authorized a new stock repurchase plan of $18 billion, which replaces the existing share buyback program. These initiatives are likely to allow investors share the benefits of soaring airliner deliveries.Dividend HikeBoeing will now pay a quarterly dividend of $1.71 per share, up from $1.42 paid earlier, bringing the annualized dividend to $6.84. The company will pay the revised dividend on Mar 2, 2018 to stockholders on record as of Feb 9.Notably, Boeing has increased its dividend per share by more than 250% over last five years. Also, the company has been consistently paying dividends to shareholders each quarter for over 75 years.In fact, this aerospace behemoth began offering dividend hikes from 2011. Boeing’s stable returns during the economic downturn also impressed investors. Last year, the company increased its dividend by 30% after witnessing a nominal increase in the range of 15-20% in the last couple of years. Again, in 2013, the company had gifted investors with a massive 50% hike. It is thus clear that the aerospace major is not exactly new to unusually high dividend hikes.Going forward, an accelerated rate of delivery is expected to enable Boeing to deploy the cash proceeds and continue raising its quarterly payout.Share Repurchase ProgramBoeing has declared the completion of its share buyback program for 2017. Meanwhile, the company has spent $9.2 billion out of the original $14 billion authorization announced last December. Markedly, the new approval takes the total authorization to $18 billion.Boeing’s management is yet to decide the timing and volume of repurchases. Under the new share repurchase authorization, buybacks will take place over the next 24-30 months.Our ViewAs the world’s largest aircraft manufacturer, Boeing holds a respectable position in the United States as well as the global aerospace and defense market. Not only did the company beat third-quarter earnings comfortably but it also raised the guidance for 2017, underscoring its strong cash flow position.The raised dividend and the new buyback authorization indicate Boeing’s optimism on its large and diverse order backlog, which is expected to continue enjoying a conducive environment ahead. Amid budget volatility, uncertainties related to high-cost programs, risks associated with key project executions and order cancellations such moves are sure to win investor confidence.The U.S. aerospace behemoth’s total deliveries during the first nine months of 2017 surpassed its archrival, Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) figures.Moreover, Boeing currently has a backlog of over 5,679 commercial jets as airlines plan to replace their entire fleets in upcoming years. This has urged the company to increase its rate of production to meet demand and ensure a steady source of income.Price MovementShares of Boeing have surged 80.1% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 40.7%. This could be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.The stock also performed better than General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp.

707,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.’s (GD  -  Free Report) Electric Boat division recently secured a $45.9-million contract for the New England Maintenance Manpower Initiative. Per the terms of the deal, the company will carry out non-nuclear maintenance of submarines based at Naval Submarine Support Facility in New London, CT. The deal has been awarded by The Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Details of the Deal    Per the contract, Electric Boat will provide non-nuclear repair services to support submarine overhauls, maintenance, repair, modernization upgrades, ship alterations, temporary modifications and field changes. In addition, it will deliver supplies, ancillary, corrective and preventative maintenance services.Work is scheduled to be over by December 2022 and will be executed in Groton, CT. Fiscal 2018 operations and maintenance funds will be used to partially finance work under the contract. Notably, the cumulative value of the contract may go up to $240 million, if the options included in it are exercised.Defense ScenarioThe defense industry got a heavy boost from the approval of fiscal 2018 defense policy bill worth $700 billion by the U.S. Senate in September. This bill provides about $640 billion for Pentagon’s main operations like buying weapons and paying the troops. The remaining $60 billion proposed for Overseas Contingency Operations will be utilized to fund the military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other terror afflicted region.This raised defense budget is certainly expected to rake in more orders for major defense contractors such as General Dynamics, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report), Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) and The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) that are dealing with different verticals of the U.S. Defense.Our ViewGeneral Dynamics, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor. Nations are strategically strengthening their arsenal and naval power through upgrading submarines as widespread geo-political tensions loom large.Notably, the U.S. Navy recently acknowledged nuclear submarines as its top priority. On top of that, a budget of $6 billion has been allotted for boosting Navy shipbuilding, under the recently- passed fiscal 2018 defense bill. This should help General Dynamics clinch more contracts and strengthen its position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics have rallied 15.7% year to date, underperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%. The underperformance may have been caused by the earlier budget cuts by the prior U.S. government. Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

710,GD,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) has inked a deal with flydubai for 225 737 MAX airplanes. Valued at $27 billion at current list prices, the order was awarded during the 2017 Dubai Air Show. It marks the largest-ever single-aisle jet order from a Middle East carrier.Order in DetailThe agreement comprises a commitment for 175 MAX airplanes and purchase rights for 50 additional MAX jets. Among these 175 airplanes, the order includes over 50 737 MAX 10s — the newest and largest member of the 737 MAX family — along with other MAX 8 and MAX 9 airplanes.With this third aircraft deal, flydubai, which started flights in 2009, will surpass its previous record order of 75 MAX jets and 11 Next-Generation 737-800s that was signed at the 2013 Dubai Airshow. The current fleet of the carrier is all Boeing and at present only operates 737-8s.Delivery of the 175 planes will commence in 2019 and be spread across 10 years with some coming ahead of the 2013 order. Given the size of the deal, it is expected that flydubai will get a discount on the list price of the aircraft.Deals Inked at the Ongoing Dubai Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising due to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic.Of late, at the Dubai Air Show, this aircraft giant received an order from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 additional 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion. Additionally, the company secured an order for five more 787-8 Dreamliners and a commitment to purchase two large freighters, valued at approximately $1.9 billion, from Azerbaijan Airlines.Apart from this, the company sealed a deal for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates,  the largest airline in the Middle East.  The purchase order also comes with equipments related to the 787-10 fleet, valued at $15.1 billion.Given the enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is witnessing significant progress, especially in the single-aisle market.Global Demand for Single-Aisle AircraftBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. The figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind the increase in demand, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges. Recently, Airbus received an order for 430 single-aisle airplanes valued at $49.5 billion at the Dubai Air Show.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.The 737 model is the fastest-selling airplane in Boeing’s history, exceeding 4,000 total orders from 92 customers.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has surged 77.5% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 35.6%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions.  The stock also performed better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp.

Also, Boeing expects twin-aisle airplanes to comprise nearly 50% of the total projection in the same region. This translates into a value of $520 billion, which is over 70% of the total value.Again, Boeing expects single-aisle jets to comprise over 50% of the total deliveries in the Middle East. To this end, there will be demand for 1,770 single-aisle airplanes, valued at $190 billion, driven by growth of low-cost carriers.Overall, this aircraft behemoth anticipates the commercial fleet to be fueled by sustained 5.6% annual growth in commercial passenger traffic.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has surged 75% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.1%.

Boeing expects twin-aisle airplanes to comprise nearly 50% of the total projection in the same region.

The company forecasts demand for 1,770 single-aisle airplanes, valued at $190 billion, driven by growth of low-cost carriers.Overall, this world’s leading commercial aircraft maker anticipates the commercial fleet to be fueled by sustained 5.6% annual growth in commercial passenger traffic.Deals Signed at the Ongoing Dubai Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been on the rise owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic.

Given the enormous commercial demand in the market, this aircraft maker stands to witness significant traction, especially in the single-aisle market.  Boeing’s Global Market OutlookIn June 2017, Boeing raised the 20-year forecast for global jetliner demand by 3.6% at the Paris Air Show. This projection was based on a promising Asian market and growing need for the improvement of fuel-efficient, single-aisle airliners.Per its outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes worth $6.1 trillion between 2017 and 2036. This figure is projected slightly above last year's estimated demand of 39,620 jets worth $5.9 trillion for the 2016-2035 timeframe.Markedly, Boeing expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver behind demand growth, comprising 72% of the total projection. This translates into worldwide demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, over the next 20 years. This figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Trailing behind single-aisle jetliners are their large wide-body, twin-aisle counterparts. In this regard, Boeing projects demand for 9,130 new planes in the 2017-2036 period. The company estimates that the total value of all wide-body planes (comprising small, medium or large) sold over the period will be $2.8 trillion compared with $3.2 trillion for the narrow-body variety.Other Players in the Same SpaceThe single-aisle jets have been the main area of competition between Boeing and its arch rival, Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report). Currently, these two aerospace behemoths are wooing the market with the updated versions of their popular single-aisle jets — Boeing’s new 737 MAX 10 against Airbus' new A321 neo.Undoubtedly, Boeing and Airbus dominate the commercial aerospace manufacturing market as major airlines worldwide uses their airplanes. Nevertheless, Canada’s Bombardier Inc. and Brazil’s Embraer S.A. (ERJ  -  Free Report) are also in the commercial race although their presence in the market is negligible.  Price MovementShare price of Boeing has surged 75% over the last 12 months, outperforming the broader industry’s gain of 34.5%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions.

714,GD,"Aerospace behemoth The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) secured a $349.2 million contract for Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD). Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 20, 2020.Details of the DealThe contract was awarded by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, Hill Air Force Base, UT. Per the terms of the agreement, Boeing will deliver an affordable total system replacement of Minuteman III missile to meet intercontinental ballistic missiles operational requirements. The replacement will be done by conducting technology maturation and reducing technical risk of this weapon system. Work will be carried out in Huntsville, Al, and various other locations. The company will utilize fiscal 2017 research, development, test and evaluation funds to finish the work.A Short Note on GBSD & MinutemanGround Based Strategic Deterrent (GBSD) is the next generation intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) for the U.S. Air Force. Boeing’s Minuteman is one such ICBM, conceived in the late 1950s. With nine other industry contractors — including North American Aviation’s Autonetics Division, based in Anaheim, CA— Boeing has built, tested and deployed the Minuteman missiles.Minuteman missiles offer a quick-reacting, inertially guided, highly survivable component to America's strategic deterrent program. Through state-of-the-art improvements, the Minuteman system has been developed to meet new challenges and assume new missions. The latest version – Minuteman III – constitute part of the United States’ Strategic Command that includes the Navy’s Ohio class fleet of ballistic missile submarines and Air Force’s B-2 and B-52 bombers.What’s Favoring Boeing?There has been a rapid rise in terrorist activities across the globe of late. With radical institutions having an easy access to weapons and North Korea consistently sending missile threats to the continental regions of the United States, America is left with little choice but to consistently develop its own tactical weaponries base.Coming to Boeing, apart from enjoying a strong forte in the combat-proven aircraft space thanks to its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and backlog enabled the company to acquire substantial shares of the defense missile industry. Consequently, the company’s Defense, Space & Security segment witnessed healthy revenues and margins growth during the second quarter of 2017, along with an order booking worth $1 billion from the US Missile Defense Agency.Notably, the global missiles and missile defense system market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 2.18% during 2017-2024, to reach a value of $41 billion. Given this and the fact that majority of the top 10 weapon manufacturers hail from the U.S., Boeing is expected to win more such awards. This in turn will enable the aircraft major to gain significant traction in the aerospace and defense space, in the coming days.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 78.7% over the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.6%. This might be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which have been providing financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. The company also poses strong competition to its peers like General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report).Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

716,GD,"The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) recently sealed a deal for delivering 40 787-10 Dreamliners to Emirates — the largest airline in the Middle East.  Notably, the aircraft giant received the order on the very first day of the Dubai Airshow.Details of the DealDeliveries of these twin aisle jets are scheduled to commence from 2022, while the 40th jet of the lot is expected to be delivered by 2030. The purchase order, in addition to the 40 jets, comes with equipments related to the 787-10 fleet, with a total value of $15.1 billion as per the current list price.Notably, Emirates will use some of these planes to replace its existing fleet of 777 jets, to maintain a young and efficient fleet; while the rest will boost the airline’s future network growth.A Brief Note on 787-10 DreamlinerBoeing’s 787-10 is the largest member of 787 Dreamliner family, which is 5.5 meters (18 ft) longer than the 787-9 model. It shares more than 95% commonality with its predecessors. It is also the fastest-selling twin-aisle airplane in history, which comes with low fuel use and operating costs.Notably, the latest order from Emirates takes the total number of new 787 orders and commitments  for Boeing this year to more than 180; and more than 210 orders and commitments for the 787-10 overall.Benefits of the DealEmirates became the first and sole carrier to operate an all-Airbus A380 and Boeing 777 fleet in November 2016. Now, subsequent to signing of the latest deal, airlines management considers the new 787-10 fleet to strongly complement its existing fleet, thereby offering it more flexibility to operate in a wide range of destinations. Moreover, this new fleet will offer 25% better fuel efficiency per seat and emissions than the existing airplanes.This in turn will boost Emirates’ strategy to expand its global route network.On the other hand, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce formula, such a multi-billion dollar deal will support more than 75,000 direct and indirect U.S. jobs.  Therefore, apart from boosting Boeing’s revenue growth, this deal will bolster the U.S. economy as a whole.Our ViewBoeing raised its 20-year forecast for jetliner demand by 3.6% at June’s Paris Air Show. Per its current outlook, the world will need 41,030 new planes, worth $6.1 trillion, between 2017 and 2036. Notably, while single-aisle jets are expected to be the major driver behind this demand growth, their twin-aisle counterparts are projected to witness a solid upward traction.In this context, Boeing projects demand for 9,130 new twin-aisle planes in the 2017-2036 period. The company estimates that the total value of all wide-body planes (comprising small, medium or large) sold over the period will be $2.8 trillion compared with $3.2 trillion for the narrow-body variety.It goes without saying that prospects for twin-aisle jet planes is impressive, with more airlines shifting to small and medium/large wide-body airplanes like Boeing’s 787 and 777X fleets. Boeing’s latest deal with Emirates is a bright instance for that.It is imperative to mention here that although Boeing and Airbus Group (EADSY  -  Free Report) dominate the commercial aerospace manufacturing market as major airlines worldwide uses their airplanes; the latter has been lagging behind the in terms of winning commercial orders lately.According to BBC News, Emirates’ chairman said that the airline chose 787-10 over Airbus A350 fleet, which we believe reflects Boeing’s 787 fleets’ efficiency over its arch rivals’ twin-aisle fleet.  In fact, while Emirates, is already the biggest customer for Boeing's 777 fleet, the latest order has raised the airline’s cost of purchase of Boeing aircraft to $90 billion.  This reflects the long-term partnership that Emirates and Boeing shares and while the former is enhancing its network, we may expect Boeing to win more such deals for its commercial jets going ahead.Price PerformanceShare price of Boeing has surged 73.9% over the last 12 months, outperforming the Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 29.9%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows which provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions. The stock’s performance is better than that of General Dynamics Corporation (GD  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report), which missed the industry mark.  Zacks Rank Boeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

717,GD,"Shares of several companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) and Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), climbed on Tuesday, just one day after President Donald Trump announced a rededication of U.S. military forces in Afghanistan.President Trump announced that the U.S. would expand its role in Afghanistan during a roughly 30-minute speech on Monday. The president did not specify how many new troops would be deployed in the country or provide a timetable for the operation. However, White House military officials pointed to an increase of up to 4,000 additional U.S. troops.The new U.S. military forces in Afghanistan will be deployed for counterterrorism and military training purposes, which does not differ much from former president Barack Obama and his administration’s tactics in the region.Currently, 8,400 Americans are stationed in Afghanistan, along with roughly 4,000 North Atlantic Treaty Organization troops, based on most estimates. President Trump noted that the added forces are supposed to help fight against the Islamic State and other terrorist organizations such as the Taliban. Some of the troops will focus on training Afghan forces.On the back of the news, shares of Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) and Boeing (BA  -  Free Report) both jumped by over 1.5% on Tuesday. Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report), and General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) all saw their stock prices gain between 1% and 1.4%.U.S. defense-based ETF prices also jumped after the announcement was made. Shares of the iShares US Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA  -  Free Report), the PowerShares Aerospace & Defense ETF (PPA  -  Free Report), and the SPDR S&P Aerospace & Defense ETF (XAR  -  Free Report) all jumped around 1%.Yet, even with the addition of 4,000 new American troops in Afghanistan, the total numbers will pale in comparison to the more than 100,000 U.S. troops that were stationed in the country at its 2011-peak.President Trump said the U.S. wouldn’t write “a blank check” nor stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. But the president also came down on one of Afghanistan’s neighbors. “We can no longer be silent about Pakistan’s safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond,” President Trump said in his speech on Monday.The Pakistani stock exchange KSE 100 index fell by 0.40% on Tuesday, which marks a continued downward trend for the index in August.Additional Gains  On top of the potential gains from an increased U.S. military presence in Afghanistan, Lockheed Martin recently won a $427 million deal to work on America’s fleet of F-35 Aircrafts. Boeing and Northrop Grumman also won separate $320-plus million deals to begin to replace America’s aging arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles.Zacks' 10-Minute Stock-Picking SecretSince 1988, the Zacks system has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year.

718,GD,"General Dynamics Corp.'s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently announced that it has been awarded a modification contract to redesign the main propulsion machinery (MPM) control systems of Virginia Class from the U.S. Navy.Contract DetailsValued at $40.7 million, the contract requires Electric Boat to undertake necessary planning and execution efforts and will procure long lead time material which will be capable of replacing the MPM control systems or the main propulsion unit along with the ship service turbine generator set.All work related to the deal will be carried out at the company’s Sunnyvale, CA facility. Electric Boat expects the work to be completed by May, 2020. At the time of the award, the company will be obligated with $20.3 million funds.Earlier this month, the company secured another modification contract worth $115 million. Per the agreement, the company will provide additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines. (Read More: General Dynamics Wins $115M Virginia-class Submarine Deal)About Virginia-class submarinesVirginia-class submarines are nuclear powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) which serves the U.S. Navy. These submarines are the result of joint efforts by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Each of these submarines is valued around $2.7 billion and is expected to be operational until 2070.Why General Dynamics?General Dynamics is one of the two companies across the globe, equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines. Therefore, the company enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.The U.S. Navy has plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years which will come with an additional mid-body section called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).The Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests of approximately $97.9 million for the research and development funding of the VPM. This indicates a possibility of additional defense contracts for General Dynamics.The Navy has also said that the Virginia-class submarines are one of its top priorities. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the one of the prime contractor for Virginia-class submarines.What’s in Store for Defense SpaceThe proposed budget hike for fiscal 2018 by President Trump reflected a 10% increase over the current base budget level of the current year, hinting at the U.S. government to spend more on defense primes like Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report) and others. More recently, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 2018 defense policy bill, reflecting an expenditure level of $696 billion. It exceeded President Trump’s defense budget request proposed this March. If enacted, all these budgetary updates will immensely boost the business growth of all defense giants.Price MovementShares of General Dynamic have returned 30.6% in the last one year compared to the industry’s return of 33.1% in the same time period.High competition from peers and declining backlogs are some of the major concerns for the company that affects its price performance.Zacks RanksGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

719,GD,"Defense behemoth, General Dynamics Corp.'s (GD  -  Free Report) business division, Electric Boat, recently secured a modification contract to offer additional lead-yard services, development studies and design efforts in support of the Virginia-class submarines.Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by October 2017.Details of the DealValued at $115.3 million, this contract has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. While majority of the work will be carried out in Groton, CN, the rest will be performed in Newport and Quonset Point, RI.Notably, the deal will use fiscal 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) and fiscal 2016 and 2017 research, development, test and evaluation (Navy) funding to complete the work.Per the modification, Electric Boat will provide lead-yard services for the nuclear submarines. This, in turn, will sustain, update and support the Virginia-class design and associated drawings as well as data for each submarine, along with technology insertion throughout its construction and post-shakedown availability period.The company will also provide all engineering and related lead-yard services required for direct maintenance and support of Virginia-class ship specifications. Moreover, this contract offers development studies and design efforts in connection with the Virginia-class submarine design and design improvements, preliminary and detail component and system design, integration of system engineering, design engineering, test engineering, logistics engineering and production engineering.Meanwhile, Electric Boat will continue development studies and design efforts associated with components and systems to complete research and development tasks and prototypes, and engineering development models essential to fully assess new technologies to be inserted in succeeding Virginia-class submarines.A Brief Note on Virginia-Class SubmarineThe Virginia-class submarine program is a class of nuclear-powered fast-attack submarines (SSNs) serving the U.S. Navy. These submarines are designed for a broad spectrum of open-ocean and littoral missions, jointly constructed by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).The submarines are also designed for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance operations as well as mine warfare. These vessels are one of the three classes of attack submarines used by the U.S. Navy. The other two are the Los Angeles class and the Seawolf class. Valued around $2.7 billion each, these submarines will be operational until 2070.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?As one of the only two contractors in the world that are equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.In December 2015, the Navy updated its force-level goal from its prior target to achieve and maintain a 308-ship fleet that comprises 48 SSNs to 355-ship fleet, including 66 SSNs. This, in turn, clearly reflects the immense priority that the U.S. Navy bestows upon this class of nuclear submarines.Going forward, the Navy plans to build an advanced model of Virginia-class submarines in the subsequent years. This will come with an additional mid-body section, called the Virginia Payload Module (VPM).  We believe the launch tubes of VPM will have the capability to carry a total of 28 additional Tomahawk cruise missiles.In fact, the Navy has already proposed fiscal 2017 budget requests worth $97.9 million in research and development funding for the VPM. This indicates additional defense contracts for General Dynamics, which, in turn, is expected to boost the corporation’s growth trajectory.Furthermore, the Navy has acknowledged the Virginia-class program as one of its top priority, and a sumptuous budget has been allotted to the same. This bodes well for General Dynamics as it is the prime contractor. As a result, we believe that the modification contract will undoubtedly put the company in a leading position in the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Price MovementShares of General Dynamics's have rallied about 31.1% in the last one year, underperforming the industry's gain of 35.1%. This could be because the company derives a major portion of its revenues from government orders and any further budget cut in the U.S will likely hurt the company’s growth prospects. Moreover, the stock's performance also lagged compared to its peers like Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Engility Holdings, Inc. (EGL  -  Free Report), which also outperformed the industry.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

720,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corp.’s (LMT  -  Free Report) Missiles and Fire Control (MFC) business unit has won a contract for the Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS) requirement. The deal has been awarded by U.S. Special Operations Command Contracting office, Tampa, FL.The $8 billion contract will enable Lockheed Martin to offer non-personal, global logistics support services along with the expertise to maintain program support. The deal will also help to maintain Enterprise management functions for the Program Executive Office of the Special Operations Forces Support Activity.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Bluegrass Station, Lexington, KY, Bluegrass Army Depot, Richmond, KY, Fort Walton Beach, FL, and Crestview, FL, as well as multiple customer locations both inside and outside the continental U.S. Fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance funds will be utilized to finance the proceeds of the contract.A Brief Note on SOF GLSSThe SOF GLSS deal is U.S. Special Operations Command's (USSOCOM) largest service contract vehicle providing a wide range of tailored logistics, maintenance and sustainment services. The Program Executive Office of the Special Operations Forces Support Activity (PEO SOFSA) oversees the contract and, under its direction, Lockheed Martin conducts its day-to-day operations, providing the full range of logistics services required to support the SOF community.Together, PEO SOFSA and Lockheed Martin provide one-stop service for agile, innovative, on-demand depot-like services to SOCOM components and other U.S. Government entities that support SOCOM’s missions worldwide.In 2016 the company submitted a bid for SOF GLSS contract, a competitive follow-on agreement to SOF CLSS and expected to receive an award decision on the same in mid-2017. The recently won deal seems to be in line with Lockheed Martin’s expectation.What’s Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin’s MFC business unit is well-known for offering air and missile defense systems along with fire control systems, mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services. In the second quarter of 2017, the MFC business segment generated sales of $1.6 billion, which represented 12.6% of Lockheed Martin’s total sales.Going ahead, the company expects MFC’s net sales to increase in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2017 on a year-over-year basis. We believe the aforementioned contract will surely aid the company in achieving this target.  Moreover, being the Pentagon’s prime defense contractor, Lockheed Martin enjoys a lion’s share of the aerospace-defense space in the U.S. Also, $13.5 billion of the additional $25 billion budget proposal that came from President Trump for core Defense Department programs for the current fiscal, has been allocated for a number of top-rated defense equipments including those of Lockheed Martin’s.  This in turn, if accepted, will boost Lockheed Martin’s revenues growth.Price MovementShares of Lockheed Martin have rallied 14% in the last one year, underperforming the 31.2% rally of the industry it belongs to. This could have been caused by the company’s F-35 program, which, despite being a prime project of the U.S. government, has been repeatedly criticized for being overtly expensive. Moreover, Lockheed Martin faces stiff competition from other defense majors like The Boeing Co. (BA  -  Free Report), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp.

721,GD,"Rising tensions between the US and North Korea weighed on the markets on Wednesday. The blue-chip index briefly slipped from the 22,000 milestone but pared losses to finish above the psychological level. Decline in the Dow was primarily due to losses made by shares of Disney after the media behemoth announced plans to end its distribution deal with Netflix. Escalating geopolitical uncertainties pushed the defense stocks up but weighed on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed at 22,048.70, declining by 0.2% or 36.64 points. The S&P 500 Index (INX) declined less than 0.1%, decreasing 0.9 point to close at 2,474.02. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index (IXIC) closed at 6,352.33, slipping 18.13 points or 0.3%. A total of around 6.48 billion shares were traded on Monday, above the last 20-session average of 6.16 billion shares. Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2.29-to-1 ratio. On the Nasdaq, decliners outnumbered advancers by a 2.47-to-1 ratio.Disney Slide Fells DowGeopolitical uncertainty between US and North Korea heightened, weighing heavily on the broader markets. The blue-chip index was dragged down primarily by a plunge in shares of The Walt Disney Co. (DIS  -  Free Report). These losses occurred after the media giant announced its plans to discontinue its distribution deal with Netflix (NFLX  -  Free Report) and launch its in-house Disney and ESPN steaming services.However, Disney posted better-than-expected earnings for the third straight quarter, as it reported third-quarter fiscal 2017 results. (Read More: Disney (DIS  -  Free Report) Q3 Earnings Top, Unveils Streaming Services)Market Wobbles Due To Geopolitical TensionsThe rising tension between Washington and Pyongyang, after the latter announced plans to attack the Guam Naval base, spiked the defense stocks. Shares of Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), Raytheon (RTN  -  Free Report), General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman (NOC  -  Free Report) all increased by 1.7%, 2.6%, 1.1% and 1.2% respectively. The Dow Jones U.S. defense index soared 1.6%.  Despite S&P 500’s declined over the trading day, seven of the index’s eleven primary sectors ended in positive territory, with utilities leading the decliners and followed by consumer-discretionary, telecom and financial sectors. According to experts, the index has been surprisingly calm with small intraday moves. The S&P 500 has gained or lost 0.3% for close to 15 sessions now. On Wednesday, the index overcame a point 13 point deficit incurred earlier in the session. The Nasdaq also ended in the red but was able to pare a 61 point decline suffered earlier in the session.Volatility Rises, But Remains at Record LowsThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) hit a one month high despite trading near all time lows. The best gauge of fear in the market- VIX, was up less than a point by 5.8% to 11.60. By all accounts, this has been the quietest stretch of trading since 1965.

722,GD,"Aircraft giant, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), has finalized an order for delivering 12 737 MAX airplanes to Air Lease Corporation (AL). Although details of the contract have been revealed recently, the order was announced during the Paris Air Show.The deal comprises order for five 737 MAX 7s and seven 737 MAX 8s. It also includes two new orders for the 787-9 Dreamliner.Notably, with this order Los Angeles, CA-based Air Lease Corporation’s total MAX orders reaches 130, and Dreamliner order reaches 49.As a member of the Next-Generation 737 family, the 737-800, continues to be an extremely popular single-aisle aircraft. This is because of its advanced technology and low operation as well as maintenance costs.The new 737s will feature the Boeing Sky Interior – the 787 Dreamliner inspired cabin – that provides passengers a sense of space with decorative sidewalls, larger windows, LED mood lighting and larger pivot overhead stowage bins.Deals Inked at the Paris Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising, owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic. This has been more strongly reflected in recent times, when the aerospace behemoth successfully won a huge number of commercial contracts at the Paris Air Show.In addition to the aforementioned deal,  other notable contracts secured by Boeing at the Air Show include a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion at current list prices. Moreover, Lion Group is committed to buy 50 737 Max 10 jets from the company for $6.24 billion.Also, Boeing signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet for 40 737 MAX airplanes worth $4.7 billion. Another MOU worth $2.5 billion was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes. Again, the company signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.Apart from this, Boeing clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given the huge commercial demand, this aerospace behemoth is expected to witness significant traction in the near term, especially in the single-aisle market.Single-Aisle Aircraft in DemandBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. This projected figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver of demand growth, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remains one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the aerospace market, the company continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Q2 Order DetailsBoeing’s second-quarter 2017 order details show that it booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations) compared with 381 net commercial orders in the previous quarter.On the contrary, Boeing’s rival, Airbus registered net bookings of just 203 aircraft in the same period, trailing far behind.Notably, Boeing and Airbus are the two largest players in the commercial aircraft space and their direct rivalry is quite evident. This, in turn, leads to intensifying competition in the Aerospace–Defense industry.Nevertheless, Boeing’s huge orders have won it a better position in the industry.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 77.1% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 34.3%. This could be because the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions. Additionally, the stock’s performance is in line with that of General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) that also surpassed the industry mark.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

723,GD,"Shares of several companies with ties to U.S. defense spending, including Lockheed Martin, climbed to new all-time highs on Wednesday, as tensions between North Korea, the U.S., and the United Nations continue to escalate.The growing conflict between the U.S. and North Korea sent many markets around the world down on Tuesday and Wednesday. One of the biggest reasons for the decline is a new heightened war of words between President Donald Trump and Pyongyang representatives, which stem from UN Security Council economic sanctions that were imposed unanimously on North Korea over the weekend—the sanctions will reportedly cut off $1 billion from the nation’s annual foreign revenue.Since then, an aggressive back and forth has occurred between the U.S. president and the North Korean capital. On Tuesday, President Trump warned North Korea against continuing its threats, or testing missiles, saying the U.S. would respond with “fire and fury like the world has never seen.”Pyongyang then responded that it would consider using missiles against Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific that houses U.S. military bases.Wasting little time, President Trump took to Twitter (TWTR  -  Free Report) on Wednesday morning to boast about the renewed strength of America’s nuclear arsenal.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017...Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!— Donald J.

729,GD,"Defense prime, Raytheon Company (RTN  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 27, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 7.45%. It is worth noting that Raytheon outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 5.16%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that Raytheon is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Raytheon has an Earnings ESP of +0.58%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $1.75, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.74. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Raytheon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Note that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings estimates.Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Meanwhile, Raytheon’s combination of a Zacks Rank #3 and +0.58% ESP makes us reasonably certain of an earnings beat.Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise Raytheon Company Price and EPS Surprise | Raytheon Company QuoteWhat’s Driving the Better-Than-Expected Earnings?Raytheon continues to retain its position as one of the large-cap defense giants in the U.S., thanks to its non-platform-centric focus. Strong demand for the company’s advanced combat-proven defense technologies from global customers as well as solid domestic bookings hint at an encouraging yet-to-be-reported quarter.Among the highlights of the second quarter, Raytheon clinched a few significant contracts, including a $200 million modification contract for procuring 317 of the 17th Lot of AIM-9X Block II missiles and a $113.2 million contract to supply engineering and technical services for Standard Missile to the U.S. Navy. Another notable one is the $617.6 million worth Navy deal to procure full-rate production requirements and spares for fiscal 2017 Standard Missile-2 (SM-2).On May 20, President Trump signed an arms deal worth $110 billion with Saudi Arabia – an agreement that came up with a potential value of $350 billion over 10 years. Although no contract value was released, as part of this arms package, Raytheon has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Saudi Arabia Military Industries Company to cooperate on defense-related projects and technology development.Also, the company will establish Raytheon Arabia – a wholly owned Saudi legal entity – to administer programs for creating indigenous defense, aerospace and security capabilities in the KSA. With the U.S. Department of State indicating a possible adoption of Raytheon’s Patriot missile system by Saudi Arabia, this arms deal is expected to boost the company’s sales growth in the days ahead.The company expects to generate sales in the range of $6.05–$6.20 billion. On the bottom-line front, management projects earnings in the band of $1.67–$1.71 per share.Moreover, the company expects the tax rate to be approximately 29.5% in the to-be-reported quarter, which will be lower than the full year’s projected rate, owing to the timing of the benefit associated with stock-based compensation.However, management expects to record a non-operating charge associated with the make-whole provision related to the early retirement of debt. This pre-tax charge of approximately $40 million will impact the quarter’s EPS by 9 cents.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $1.74 a share, reflecting a decrease of 0.57% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is $6.23 billion, implying a 3.17% year-over-year rise.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense stocks you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.General Dynamics Corp.

It is worth noting that General Dynamics has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 5.20%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise?Our proven model shows that General Dynamics is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients.Zacks ESP:  General Dynamics has an Earnings ESP of +0.41%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at $2.44, higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.43. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: General Dynamics carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, being one of the only two contractors in the world equipped to build nuclear-powered submarines, the company boasts a strong growth momentum in the U.S. as well as overseas.In the second quarter, General Dynamics secured a handful of big contracts from the Pentagon. These include the $250 million deal to modify, test, train and sustain the Prophet Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and electronic warfare (EW) system, and the $105 million deal for the execution of USS Makin Island (LHD 8) fiscal 2017 dry-docking phased maintenance availability. The company also won a $203 million modification contract to increase the design support requirements for Columbia-class submarines in the yet-to-be reported quarter.Coming to expectations regarding the second-quarter results, General Dynamics witnessed improved activity levels in Europe and China at the onset of the quarter. In particular, an uptick was observed in the demand for large-cabin aircraft in these markets. This would surely benefit the company’s growth trajectory and can be expected to get reflected in its upcoming results.Earlier, in the first quarter, the company almost completed the transition from engineering and prototype production on its two large international vehicle programs for Canada, the Mideast and the U.K. As per management’s projections, these programs must have entered full production by now and thereby will likely boost the company’s international expansion in the second quarter and beyond.For the to-be-reported quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $2.43 per share, down 0.27% year over year, while the revenue estimate is pegged at $7.80 billion, implying a 1.82% year-over-year improvement.Other Stocks that Warrant a LookHere are some other defense companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

733,GD,"Defense giant, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NOC  -  Free Report) is scheduled to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 26, before the opening bell. Being one of the largest U.S. defense contractors, it enjoys a strong presence in the U.S. Air Force, Space and Cyber Security programs.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 25.17%. It is worth noting that Northrop Grumman has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 10.87%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNorthrop Grumman’s better-than-expected first-quarter results demonstrated improved segment operating income, supported by strong sales growth and solid program performance. Similar outperformance can be expected in the soon-to-be-reported second quarter’s results as well.The company consistently follows a stable capital deployment strategy. In line with this, during the second quarter, Northrop Grumman hiked its quarterly dividend by 11%, bringing the annualized payout to $4 per share. This reflected the strong balance sheet and steady cash flow position that the company boasts. This, in turn, offers it substantial financial flexibility to invest in business and scope for incremental dividends.Further, the company won a handful of notable contracts in the second quarter. These include the $303.9 million modification deal for procurement of three low-rate initial production of second lot’s MQ-4C Triton unmanned aircraft, the $243.9 million contract for providing 72 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars and spares, and the foreign military sales (FMS) deal worth $179 million for providing hardware for large aircraft infrared counter measures (LAIRCM) and necessary support related to it. Such contracts will surely get reflected in terms of Northrop Grumman’s solid revenue growth in the second quarter and beyond.Moreover, the company identified a growing list of domestic and international opportunities across its businesses. This comprises the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent program,MQ-25 unmanned aerial system, new Space programs and a variety of international opportunities for Autonomous Systems as well as upgrading Lockheed Martin’s F-16 jets with its SABR Radar. It also includes additional international opportunities pursued by its Technology Services segment in the Middle East and Australia.  Further updates on these opportunities can be expected once Northrop Grumman reports its second-quarter results.On the flip side, the company continues to witness lower sales volume for its KC-10 program, which dragged down its revenue from Technology Services in the first quarter. With no improvement anticipated soon in this issue, we expect the second-quarter results to reflect a similar sales decline for the segment.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.84 per share, up 9.32% year over year, while the revenue estimate of $6.21 billion implies a 3.57% year-over-year improvement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Northrop Grumman is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Northrop Grumman has an Earnings ESP of -1.06%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate is pegged at $2.81, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.84. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Northrop Grumman carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But the company’s -1.06% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northrop Grumman Corporation Price and EPS Surprise | Northrop Grumman Corporation QuoteStocks that Warrant a LookHere are some defense companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this quarter.Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.

734,GD,"On Jul 20, shares of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) have soared to a new 52-week high of $211.25, before closing the trading session at $210.28. The closing price of this aerospace and defense prime, which has a market cap of around $126.9 billion, reflects a year-to-date gain of roughly 35.1%.Over the last 52 weeks, Boeing’s shares have ranged from a low of $126.31 to a high of $211.25. The average volume of shares traded in the last three months is approximately 2.9 million.What's Driving Boeing?In June, at the Paris Air Show, Boeing announced the launch of the 737 Max 10, a new model that will compete with the Airbus Group's (EADSY) extremely popular narrow-body passenger jet, the A321neo.Notably, the Max 10 is the fifth member of Boeing’s single-aisle aircraft series and the third of the Max family. It was designed to be larger than its previous model in order to increase passenger capacity compared with the A321neo’s capacity, which was outselling the 737 Max 9.So far the decision has paid off. Evidently, Boeing received huge number of contracts for the new model leaving Airbus far behind. At the Paris Air Show, the company won 50 737 Max 10 jets orders, valued at $6.24 billion, from Lion Group. It also signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.In addition to the aforementioned deals, Boeing grabbed notable contracts for other models at the Paris Air Show, including a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion, at current list prices.Furthermore, the aerospace behemoth signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet, for 40 737 MAX airplanes, valued at $4.7 billion. Another MOU was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes, valued at approximately $2.5 billion.Apart from this, the company clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given enormous commercial demand in the market, Boeing is expected to witness significant traction going ahead, especially in the single-aisle market.Notably, the second-quarter order details revealed by Boeing of late, shows that it booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). This reflects an increase from the year-ago figure of 171, which also will contribute significantly to the company’s top line.In the defense arena, Trump’s proposal to boost the nation’s defense budget by 10% in 2018 from that of 2016 is likely to benefit defense biggies like Boeing, Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc. (HII  -  Free Report).Again, the Trump administration has put forward the fiscal 2017 budget appropriation to expand the nation’s defense fund, citing that years of declining funding levels in the Army's investment and modernization accounts has hampered readiness of the U.S. forces. Such positive budget revisions will surely boost the company's growth trajectory as well.Price MovementShares of Boeing have rallied 57.6% in the last 12 months, outperforming the industry’s gain of 27.8%. This might be because of the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases and earnings accretive acquisitions.Zacks RankBoeing currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Will You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider. Much like petroleum 150 years ago, lithium power may soon shake the world, creating millionaires and reshaping geo-politics. Soon electric vehicles (EVs) may be cheaper than gas guzzlers. Some are already reaching 265 miles on a single charge.With battery prices plummeting and charging stations set to multiply, one company stands out as the #1 stock to buy according to Zacks research.It's not the one you think.See This Ticker Free >>

735,GD,"The defense stocks in the U.S. got a solid boost due to the U.S. House of Representatives passing the 2018 defense policy bill last Friday.

738,GD,"Military shipbuilder, Huntington Ingalls Industries, Inc.'s (HII  -  Free Report) unit, Newport News Shipbuilding, has clinched a modification contract to procure additional long-lead-time material for USS Enterprise (CVN 80). The work will be completed by Jan 2024.The deal, which is valued at $148.7 million, has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C. Work related to the contract will be carried out in Newport News, VA, and the company will utilize fiscal 2017 shipbuilding and conversion (Navy) funds to complete it.A Brief Note on USS EnterpriseThe USS Enterprise (CVN 80), Gerald R. Ford class’ third aircraft carrier, bears the name of the Navy’s first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, USS Enterprise (CVN 65).Once this aircraft carrier enters service, it will replace the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69), a Nimitz-class ship. Notably, the Enterprise is scheduled to be constructed and be operational by 2027.The air wing of this new USS Enterprise will be capable of supporting more than 75 aircraft of varied kinds including fixed-wing and rotary-wing systems. Moreover, an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS) will be incorporated in the ship, to replace the steam catapults of the older versions.Our ViewHuntington Ingalls is one of the largest military shipbuilders in the country. Over 70% of the active Navy fleet consists of this company’s ships. Notably, this military shipbuilder’s Newport News division is the nation’s sole designer, builder and refueler of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers. It also offers one of only two shipyards capable of designing and building nuclear-powered submarines.However, this division has been lagging in performance for the last couple of quarters. In the first quarter of 2017, the segment witnessed more than 2% sales decline due to lower sales volumes on submarines.Nevertheless, we expect the company’s overall growth momentum to continue in the days ahead, given the recent positive budget revision done by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the shipbuilding business outlook remains strong, particularly in light of the fiscal 2017 spending bill. The bill include Ohio-Class replacement, advanced procurement for refueling CVN-74, advanced procurement for CVN-80, two Virginia class submarines, two DDG-51s, advanced procurement for LHA-8 and TAO(X), continuation of CVN-79 and investment in a new Coast Guard Icebreaker.Price MovementShares of Huntington Ingalls have rallied 16.3% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 26.2%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line. Also, budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. As a result, the company's performance lagged the likes of The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), Airbus Group SE (EADSY  -  Free Report) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) that outperformed the industry.Zacks RankHuntington Ingalls currently holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

741,GD,"General Dynamics (GD  -  Free Report) announced that it has been awarded a $14.9 million contract by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Yongsan, Korea.Details of the ContractThis is a modification contract per which the company will provide support and maintenance services for the combined mission command network operations.Work related to this deal will be carried out in the Republic of Korea and is expected to be over by Jul 31, 2018. The contract amount will be obligated at the time of the award from the fiscal 2017 operations and maintenance (Army) funds.Our ViewPresident Donald Trump’s proposed 10% hike on the 2018 defense budget has boosted the overall defense sector. Moreover, due to rise in global terrorism many non-U.S. countries have raised their defense budget lately.As a result, General Dynamics along with other defense giants such as Lockheed Martin (LMT  -  Free Report), The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC  -  Free Report) have been receiving regular contracts from different verticals of the U.S. Military.In particular, General Dynamics’ diverse product portfolio along with its spread-out customer base has provided it with opportunities to generate revenues from different sources. Moreover, the company has been consistently witnessing increased sales from non-U.S. based sources. These sources have helped General Dynamics to counter the volatility in domestic defense spending.Further, the company has a strong research and development segment that promotes the introduction of new products and first-to-market enhancements. General Dynamics’ wider customer choices, improved aircraft performance and new standards for customer safety, comfort and in-flight productivity are expected to boost its growth trajectory, over the long run.Price MovementShare price of General Dynamics has rallied 39.6% in the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace-Defense industry’s gain of 26.5%.This could be because General Dynamics consistently maintains a strategic alliance with the U.S. Department of Defense, which allows it to enjoy a steady flow of contracts.Zacks RankGeneral Dynamics currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The work will be carried out at the company’s Groton, CT, facility and is expected to be completed by Jun 2021.Columbia-Class SubmarinesThe U.S. Navy designed the Columbia-class submarine with the aim to replace its existing 14 Trident-armed Ohio-class ballistic missile submarines. Under the Navy’s Submarine Unified Build Strategy (SUBS), the Columbia-class submarines will be jointly constructed by General Dynamics’ Electric Boat and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc.’s (HII  -  Free Report) Newport New division. Per the U.S. Navy’s request, General Dynamics continues to be the prime contractor for designing and building the Columbia-class boats.Why General Dynamics?As one of the two contractors in the world with the capacity to build nuclear-powered submarines, General Dynamics enjoys a dominant position as a Navy contractor.The U.S. Navy has kept Columbia-class submarine program among top priority list. As a result, huge budget has been allotted to the program. General Dynamics being the prime navy contractor, is expected to win a major portion of contracts from the nuclear-powered submarine industry.Defense Industry’s ScenarioDefense industry as a whole got a good boost when President Trump proposed a 10% hike in the 2018 Defense budget.

743,GD,"Textron Inc. (TXT  -  Free Report) is set to report second-quarter 2017 financial results on Jul 19, before the market opens.In the prior quarter, the company’s earnings came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Textron has missed expectations in one of the trailing four quarters, with an average negative surprise of 0.82%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderTextron is a multi-industry conglomerate that is well-known for its brands such as Bell Helicopter, Cessna Aircraft Company, Jacobsen, Kautex, E-Z-GO and Greenlee. Apart from manufacturing aircraft, automotive engine components and industrial tools as well as offering associated services, the company operates as a commercial finance corporation in select markets.With respect to second-quarter highlights, Textron won a couple of sumptuous contracts from Pentagon, which we believe will get duly reflected in the company’s increased revenue growth for the yet-to-be reported quarter. While one of these contracts, worth $475 million was awarded by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) for the Mid-Endurance Unmanned Aircraft Systems (MEUAS), the other one was a Navy deal worth $146.6 million for repairing parts of the UH-1Y and AH-IZ aircraft.Coming to expectations regarding the quarter’s outcome, the company is likely to witness strong sales growth at its Industrial business segment, courtesy of the Arctic Cat buyout in the first quarter of 2017. This segment’s growth will be further boosted with Textron having started delivering its highly efficient ELiTE series lithium golf cars in the first quarter, which comes with zero battery maintenance.Although the company’s Bell segment has been dragging down its top line for quite a few quarters so far, management expects to see some upward potential, at least in terms of this segment’s margins, starting from the second quarter.  On the flip side, lower-than-expected Tactical Armored Patrol Vehicle (TAPV) production in the first quarter hampered the company’s growth. Textron has incurred a notable loss of $24 million under a contract related to TAPV. In the near future, no significant improvement in this situation can be expected. We believe this program will remain a challenge for the second-quarter results as well. Also, the pre-tax special charges of $22 million incurred in the first quarter owing to the Arctic Cat acquisition, has forced the company to increase the annual pre-tax charges forecast by almost $15 million. These charges may also impose greater expenses on the company’s upcoming results.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at 55 cents, down 16.86% year over year, while the consensus for revenues is estimated at $3.59 billion, implying a 2.29% year-over-year increase.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Textron is likely to beat earnings this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. This is not the case here, as you will see below.Zacks ESP: Textron has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. This is because both the Most Accurate estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate stand at 55 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Textron carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which increases the predictive power of ESP. But the company’s 0.00% ESP makes surprise prediction difficult.Meanwhile, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.Textron Inc.

744,GD,"Pentagon’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin Corp.'s (LMT  -  Free Report) business unit, Missiles and Fire Control, has clinched a modification contract from the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. The deal involves foreign military sales (FMS) to Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the Republic of Korea, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan.Details of the DealThe contract is valued at $130.3 million. Per the terms, Lockheed Martin will produce the PATRIOT Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile for fiscal 2017 with an intention to expand the total missile segment enhancement quantity by 35. In addition, the company will provide 130 launcher modification kits with motor control units to the U.S.; parts library and missile segment enhancement storage and aging requirements to the U.S.; and cost and software data reporting requirement to the U.S. At the same time, it will reduce the missile round trainer quantity by 30 and the empty round trainer quantity by 36 for Qatar.Lockheed Martin will utilize fiscal 2015, 2016 and 2017 other and other procurement (Army) funds to complete the work by Jun 30, 2020. Work related to the modification deal will be carried out at Grand Prairie, Lufkin, El Paso, TX; Camden, AZ; Chelmsford, MA; Ocala, FL Huntsville, AL; Huntingdon Beach, CA.A Brief Note on PAC-3PAC-3 is the most advanced, capable and powerful terminal air-defense missile that can accost tactical ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft. It is a high-velocity interceptor that counters incoming targets by direct body-to-body impact. The PAC-3 missile uses a solid propellant rocket motor, aerodynamic controls, altitude control motors and inertial guidance to navigate.These missiles are currently used by six countries like the U.S., Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Arab Emirates and Taiwan. Apart from the countries listed under the latest deal, the company also has a contract with Kuwait.According to Lockheed Martin, the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (PAC-3 MSE) interceptor employs a two-pulse solid rocket motor that increases altitude and range to meet increasing threats. The company expects strong demand for this advanced missile system going forward, particularly in the politically tense regions of the Middle East.What's Favoring Lockheed Martin?Lockheed Martin manufactures combat-proven PAC-3 missiles under production deals from the U.S. Army, Air and Missile Defense Program. This enables the company to enjoy a steady stream of contracts.Meanwhile, the Trump administration put forward the fiscal 2017 budget appropriation in March to expand the nation’s defense fund, citing that years of declining funding levels in the Army's investment and modernization accounts has hampered readiness of the U.S. forces. Notably, the appropriation request included enhanced funding for upgrading Missile defense system of the country.Also, everyone is aware of the continuous missile brawl between North Korea and the U.S that has been taking place for the last few months. All these development, in turn, are bound to boost the demand for today’s A-one missiles such as that of Lockheed Martin’s PAC-3. Consequently, allowing the company to benefit in the near term.Furthermore, Lockheed Martin plans to increase its international mix from 21% in 2016 to 30% of total sales in the upcoming years, owing to robust demand witness overseas for its programs. Latest contracts like the aforementioned ones are expected to uplift the company's international business, substantially. It may also attract more such contracts in the future, since PAC-3 is one of the top priorities in the Pentagon's missile system.Price PerformanceLockheed Martin’s stock has rallied 12.4% in the last one year, underperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense  industry’s gain of 27.6%. This could be because the earlier budget cuts have put pressure on the top line, although the present defense budget is more in favor of the sector. Moreover, we believe that budget deficits and political uncertainty might make future defense budgets vulnerable to cutbacks. The company faces tough competition from other defense giants like The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Northrop Grumman Corp.

745,GD,"Aircraft giant, The Boeing Company (BA  -  Free Report), has entered into a draft deal for delivering three Next-Generation 737-800 airplanes to Algeria-based Tassili Airlines, per Reuters. Although the details of the contract have been revealed recently, the order was announced during the Paris Air Show, last month.However, at that time, Boeing's orders & deliveries website had attributed the order to an unidentified customer.Coming back to the details, the contract is valued at $294 million at list prices. Per the terms, Boeing will deliver these airplanes during the second half of 2018.A member of the Next-Generation 737 family, the 737-800, continues to be extremely popular as a single-aisle aircraft. This is because of its advanced technology, and low operation and maintenance costs.The new 737s will feature the Boeing Sky Interior – the 787 Dreamliner inspired cabin – that provides passengers a sense of space with decorative sidewalls, larger windows, LED mood lighting and larger pivot overhead stowage bins.Recent Deals Inked at the Paris Air ShowDemand for Boeing’s commercial airplanes has been rising, owing to a steady increase in passenger and freight traffic. This has been even more strongly reflected in recent times, when the aerospace behemoth successfully won the maximum number of contracts at the Paris Air Show. In addition to the aforementioned deal,  other notable contracts secured by Boeing at the Air Show, include a commitment from the Kuwait-based ALAFCO Aviation Lease and Finance Company for 20 737 MAX 8s, valued at $2.2 billion at current list prices. Moreover, Lion Group is committed to buy 50 737 Max 10 jets from the company for $6.24 billion.Also, Boeing signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with SpiceJet for 40 737 MAX airplanes worth $4.7 billion. Another MOU worth $2.5 billion was signed with Tibet Financial Leasing for 20 737 MAX airplanes. Moreover, Boeing signed an MOU with BOC Aviation Limited for 10 737 MAX 10 airplanes, worth nearly $1.25 billion.Apart from this, the company clinched an order from AerCap for 30 787-9 Dreamliners, worth $8.1 billion. Given the huge commercial demand, Boeing is expected to witness significant traction going ahead, especially in the single-aisle market.Single-Aisle Aircraft in DemandBoeing anticipates demand for 29,530 single-aisle jets, worth $3.2 trillion, in the next 20 years. This projected figure reflects a 5% increase over last year's projection.Moreover, the company expects single-aisle jets to be the major driver of demand growth, comprising 72% of the total commercial jets’ demand projection. While the new 737 MAX and the 737-800 is likely to grab the lion’s share of the new orders, Boeing’s arch-rival Airbus Group SE’s (EADSY  -  Free Report) A320neo is expected to pose significant challenges.Nevertheless, Boeing’s 737 model remians one of the best-selling planes in the single-aisle market, thanks to its fuel efficiency and passenger comfort. Therefore, to maintain its dominance in the commercial aerospace market, this aerospace behemoth continues to invest in research and development for upgrading and churning out upgraded versions of its existing planes.Q1 Order DetailsBoeing’s second-quarter 2017 order details show that the company booked 183 net commercial orders (accounting for cancellations). In the first half of 2017, it booked 381 net commercial orders. On the contrary, Boeing’s rival, Airbus registered net bookings of just 203 aircraft in the same period, trailing far behind.Since, Boeing and Airbus are the two largest players in the commercial aircraft space their direct rivalry is quite evident. This, in turn, leads to intensifying competition in the Aerospace–Defense industry. Nevertheless, the huge orders Boeing has won recently places it in a better position in the industry.Price MovementShare price of Boeing has increased 55.8% in the last 12 months, outperforming the Zacks categorized Aerospace–Defense industry’s gain of 26.7%. This could have been driven by the company’s strong balance sheet and cash flows that provide financial flexibility in matters of incremental dividend, ongoing share repurchases as well as earnings accretive acquisitions. Additionally, the stock’s performance is in line with that of General Dynamics Corp. (GD  -  Free Report) and Textron Inc.

(TXT  -  Free Report) recently announced that its Bell business segment has secured a modification contract for providing contractor logistics support (CLS) to the fleet of Bell 407GX helicopters of Iraq for one additional year. Work related to this deal is scheduled to be over by Aug 2017.Valued at $22.1 million, this foreign military sales (FMS) contract was awarded by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms, Textron will also provide spare parts for performing repair works on the 407GX model of helicopters.The contract will utilize fiscal 2017 other funds to complete the work, which will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX.A Brief Note on 407GX Built on the proven performance and reliability of the Bell 407 platform, the Bell 407GX incorporates the Garmin G1000H flight deck, which offers critical flight information at a glance for greater situational awareness and increased safety.Moreover, the flight deck's high resolution LCD screens provide primary flight and multi-function display information, including Helicopter Terrain Avoidance Warning System, Helicopter Synthetic Vision Technology, Traffic Information Systems and more. The 407GX also features a tail rotor camera that enables the pilot to have a clear view of the tail during take-offs and landings.Our ViewFor both its military and commercial products, Textron’s Bell segment provides post-sale support and service for an installed base of approximately 13,000 helicopters. The company is able to do so through a network of six Bell-operated service centers, four global parts distribution centers and over 100 independent service centers located in 32 countries. Collectively, these service sites offer a complete range of logistics support. This includes parts, support equipment, technical data, training devices, pilot and maintenance training, component repair and overhaul, engine repair and overhaul, aircraft modifications, aircraft customizing, accessory manufacturing, contractor maintenance, field service, and product support engineering.However, in the first quarter of 2017, the segment reported revenues of $697 million, down from the year-ago level of $814 million. Though there was a drop in the revenue, the segment managed to deliver a profit of approximately $1 million.Nevertheless, although the Bell segment remains a drag to Textron’s top line, the company’s geographically diverse network of aircraft, defense & intelligence, industrial and finance businesses keep adding to its growth.Price MovementTextron has outperformed the Zacks categorized Aerospace/Defense industry over the last 12 months. The company’s current rate of return is 27.6% compared with the industry’s average gain of 27.1%.The stock’s outperformance could have been spurred by Textron’s systematic inorganic growth strategy, along with its focus on strengthening international presence.

(GD  -  Free Report).Zacks RankTextron currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

747,GD,"Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT  -  Free Report) is set to release second-quarter 2017 results on Jul 18, before the opening bell.In the prior quarter, the company reported a positive earnings surprise of 8.70%. It is worth noting that Lockheed Martin has outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average positive surprise being 13.88%.Let’s see how things are shaping up at the company prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderLockheed Martin continues to enjoy its position as the largest defense contractor in the U.S., courtesy of its varied product offerings.

Further, United Launch Alliance (ULA) – a Lockheed Martin and Boeing joint venture (JV) – won two modification contracts, totaling $416.9 million, for launch vehicle production services (LVPS).In the next two months of the quarter, Lockheed Martin won significant deals from Pentagon.

This came as a move to expand its foothold in the Indian market, the world’s largest military weapons importer.However, management expects the company’s segment operating profit to remain under pressure for the second quarter and the rest of 2017, due to some unanticipated events that occurred in the first quarter. In fact, these events led the company to reduce its prior 2017 guidance for segment operating profit by $30 million.Moreover, the company’s Missile and Fire Control segment is expected to reflect a slightly lower-than-expected performance in terms of margin for throughout 2017. No improvement can be expected any time soon.For the second quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $3.09 per share, down 6.79% year over year, while the revenue estimate is pegged at $12.47 billion, implying a 3.47% year-over-year decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively show that Lockheed Martin is likely to beat earnings this quarter.
