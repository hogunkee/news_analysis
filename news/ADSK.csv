3,ADSK,"Tech stocks have faced challenges recently. But the world continues its migration to cloud computing. And software providers are still converting en masse to the cloud-based distribution model labeled SaaS, or ""software as a service.""This conversion has helped software hold steady at the No. 1 position among the 33 economic sectors tracked by Investor's Business Daily. Among the more interesting names in that sector, Autodesk (ADSK) is holding beneath a 141.36 buy point in a tight, nine-week flat base.In addition, analyst consensus projects the company is about to turn its first profit in seven quarters when it reports on May 24. Sales growth turned positive in the December quarter following nine quarters of declines. Consensus views expect sales growth to hold just about steady, at 15%, for the company's fiscal first quarter.Autodesk is a pioneer in the field of computer-aided design. Its tools are used extensively by engineers and designers in manufacturing, architecture, engineering and construction. But the company has struggled in its transition from a traditional, license-based model to a more streamlined subscription/cloud-based operation.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAutodesk's revenue peaked in 2015. It posted annual per-share losses over the past two fiscal years. (The company's fiscal year ends in January.)Revenue rose only 1% in fiscal 2018. But Autodesk reported that subscriptions accounted for 43% of the total for the year vs. 22% in 2017. Oppenheimer forecasts subscription revenue at $318.3 million in Q1 – 57% of the company's total.For fiscal 2019, Oppenheimer expects subscription revenue to grow to 65% of overall sales.The company named Andrew Anagnost as its new CEO in June last year. Anagnost is an aeronautics and computer science engineer with experience at Lockheed and NASA. He worked his way up through the ranks at Autodesk beginning in 1997.Autodesk's prior chief, Carl Bass, announced in February 2017 he would step down.Based in San Rafael, Calif., Autodesk saw about 36% of its 2018 revenue from sales in the U.S. Some 40% of total sales came from Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific region accounted for 18% of sales.For fiscal 2019, analysts project earnings of 90 cents a share, followed by a 256% advance in fiscal 2020. Sales are expected to rise 21%, which would mark the biggest advance since 2006.The company listed long-term liabilities at $2.25 billion at the end of the fiscal year, up nearly 20% vs. the end of 2017. Cash and equivalents were listed at $1.01 billion, down 11% year over year.Autodesk's base is a first-stage pattern. That means a breakout from that base is less freighted with risk than a move out of a later-stage base. But investors should still be cautious because the company is a turnaround story and has not yet built up a steady track record of earnings growth.Autodesk shares soared 15% after reporting its Q4 results in March. Its prior quarterly report, during November's lull in stock market action, sent the stock to a one-day loss of 16%.Underlying that uncertainty, the stock's relative strength line is edging to new highs but has essentially been consolidating — like the stock's price — since the company's prior quarterly report. A move to new highs with or before the breakout signals strength.Autodesk's Accumulation/Distribution Rating is a passing B-. It's Up/Down Volume Ratio stands at a very solid 1.4. Combined, the two measures suggest that institutional investors are holding their positions.KeyBanc has the stock at overweight. Oppenheimer and Credit Suisse both show outperform ratings.

5,ADSK,"Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) has been on a tear lately. After putting in the bottom to its latest base in early April, the veteran chip stock has posted 10 up weeks in a row. It's hitting price levels not seen since January 2007.Judging from Monday's action, the buyers aren't tired yet.While the stock is now extended sharply past a 13.95 buy point in a large, deep double-bottom base, it may be worth keeping the stock on the watch list. Here are two reasons.One, a stock that rises that many weeks in a row is showing something special. Fund managers are serious about accumulating the stock. No wonder that AMD's Accumulation/Distribution Rating has also shot up to an A+ as seen in IBD Stock Checkup.Two, fundamentals are getting white-hot at the Intel (INTC) rival in CPUs.Advanced Micro, which incorporated in 1969, ended two years of red ink by earning 13 cents a share last year. The Street sees earnings soaring 246% to 45 cents a share this year and rising another 33% to 60 cents in 2019.What's powering that solid profitability? Big sales. In the first quarter, Advanced Micro posted a 40% jump in revenue to $1.65 billion. That increase topped growth of 19%, 26% and 21% in the prior three quarters.Q1 gross margin jumped 400 basis points vs. the year-ago quarter to 36%, and the Santa Clara, Calif., company cut its operating expense as a ratio of sales from 33% to 29%.""PC, gaming and datacenter adoption of our new, high-performance products continues to accelerate,"" CEO Lisa Su said in a news release. Advanced Micro is clearly gaining traction in the area of GPUs, or graphics processors. The firm's computing and graphics segment vaulted 95% to $1.12 billion, offsetting a 12% slide in sales in the enterprise, embedded and semi-custom business unit.At this point, it would make sense to watch for the stock to take a rest and flash a follow-on entry point. Wait for the stock's first pullback to the 10-week moving average. This could take a while. The 10-week moving average is rising rapidly. But at 13.40, it's sharply below the current share price.A three-weeks-tight pattern would offer another potential follow-on buy point. But so far, there's no such formation.Elsewhere in stocks today, Estee Lauder (EL) cooled off on Monday after gaining more than 3% in each of the prior two weeks. Those gains enabled the cosmetics giant to rise past a 151.85 buy point in a nicely symmetrical cup with handle.The 5% buy zone goes up to 159.44.Autodesk (ADSK) muscled past a 141.36 buy point in a 14-week flat base that showed a mild correction of 14% from head to toe. The expert in computer-aided design software for manufacturers snapped a six-quarter streak of losses by earning 6 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter ended in April. Sales picked up 15% to $556 million.Autodesk's latest flat base is part of a base on base. The first base: a three-month double bottom that featured a 119.34 buy point.FleetCor Technologies (FLT), also featured in IBD's Stock of the Day column, gapped up powerfully at the open and rose as much as 6.3%.

13,ADSK,"General Motors (GM) is working with engineering software specialist Autodesk (ADSK) to develop lightweight 3-D-printed parts.The ability to manufacture lighter parts due to the new partnership could aid the automotive giant as it seeks to bring alternative-fuel vehicles to the market.GM has laid out plans to introduce 20 electric vehicle models by 2023 and eventually phase out internal-combustion engines. CEO Mary Barra has promised the Detroit company will make money selling electric cars by 2021.Rival Ford (F), which has already been testing 3-D printing for mass production, is also betting big on an electric future. During its Q1 earnings announcement, management vowed to make an ""all-in push"" on hybrid and battery electric vehicles. Ford outlined plans for six such vehicles by 2022 as part of an $11 billion electrification investment.GM was down 0.1% on the stock market today, and Autodesk rose 1.9%. Rival Ford fell 0.1%, Fiat Chrysler (FCAU) lost 0.7%, and Tesla (TSLA) sank 5.55% after reporting a faster cash-burn rate late Wednesday.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe new partnership will use cloud computing and AI-based algorithms to quickly explore multiple permutations of a part's design. Hundreds of high-performance design options based on goals and parameters set by the user will be generated. Variables will include weight, strength, material choice and fabrication method. The user will then decide on the best part design option.""This disruptive technology provides tremendous advancements in how we can design and develop components for our future vehicles to make them lighter and more efficient,"" GM Vice President Ken Kelzer, Global Vehicle Components and Subsystems, said in a press release. ""When we pair the design technology with manufacturing advancements such as 3-D printing, our approach to vehicle development is completely transformed and is fundamentally different to co-create with the computer in ways we simply couldn't have imagined before.""GM claims the new design technology will provide ""significantly more"" vehicle mass reduction and parts consolidation opportunities. It also said these would be unachievable through traditional design optimization methods.The multi-year alliance will see the car giant and Autodesk work together on projects involving generative design, additive manufacturing, and materials science.However it is not all rosy on the electric cars front.They could be hit by production issues after Moody's predicted a shortage of electric vehicle batteries.Tesla, GM and Ford are at risk if a scarcity of key metals such as cobalt, copper, lithium and nickel cause a slowdown in battery production.It is not just growth in battery operated vehicle production by car giants such as Ford that will increase demand. The building of a network of vehicle charging stations will exacerbate the shortage issues, according to the note.""Declining ore grades for copper, continued lack of investment in new mines, and the time required to bring new discoveries to production will constrain metal availability and, ultimately, the metal sector's ability to meet growing demand from battery/automakers, particularly in the near-term,"" the firm said in a research note.YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:General Electric Wins This 3D-Printing Contract From The NavyFord, Tesla, GM's Electric Car Production Could Be Hit By This Problem These GM, Ford Cars May No Longer Be Sold In A Few Years GM Calls Passenger Cars An 'Opportunity' As Ford Largely Exits In U.S. The Lesson For Investors In 2018 So Far: Protect Your Profits In StocksHow To Make Money In Stocks Using The CAN SLIM Investing System

24,ADSK,"Major indexes felt investors' chill over news that Gary Cohn is leaving his White House role as chief economic advisor, but the Nasdaq composite continues to prove that it is the index to beat in 2018. However, as seen in recent sessions, the U.S. equity markets continue to show rapid seesawing action as well.X Due to a recent spate of heavy distribution, or pronounced institutional profit-taking, from Feb. 20 to March 1 in both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500, IBD's current outlook continues to stand at ""Uptrend under pressure.""At 3 p.m. ET, the Nasdaq shaved its mild losses and is trying to hold above the breakeven level, up 0.1%, despite having multiple large-cap and megacap companies that do business overseas. But in the wake of continued uncertainty over the possibility of trade spats between the U.S. and China, the rest of Asia, and Europe, clearly the selling has been more focused on industrial companies.The Dow Jones industrial average, down at one point 1.4%, has cut its losses to around 0.7%. During session lows, at least half of the 30 components sank 1 point or more. IBM (IBM) was the sole stock within the Dow Industrials to rise 1 point or more.The S&P 500 slid nearly 0.8%, then cut the loss to less than 0.4% with an hour to go in Wednesday's session. At 2707, the large-cap benchmark has shaved its year-to-date gain to 1.6%.The Nasdaq is up 6.7% since Jan. 1.The Russell 2000 gained 0.7% as small caps outperformed. Perhaps institutional investors hold a general view that a budding trade war that focuses on tariffs on select products would hurt larger multinational companies more than smaller firms that sell primarily in the domestic market.The S&P SmallCap 600 is up 0.6%, and at 955 is now up 2% since Jan. 1.While steel stocks are emerging as a new leading sector thanks to strong gains by the likes of United States Steel (X), Steel Dynamics (STLD) and Nucor (NUE), the software, consumer and China sectors of the market continue to do well.Alibaba (BABA), Weibo (WB) and TAL Education (TAL) continue to show nice long-term uptrends and high relative strength. (See a detailed analysis of TAL's chart action near the bottom of this article.)Alibaba, a big winner in 2017, continues to a long trend of higher highs and higher lows. Notice on a daily chart how the Chinese and international facilitator of e-commerce and mobile payments had sold off in line with the early February correction that took the Nasdaq down nearly 12% from its perch. Yet Alibaba, hitting a 2018 year-to-date low of 168.88, did not undercut the Dec. 5 near-term low of 164.25. That's bullish.Plus, Alibaba has been weaving above and below its still-rising 50-day moving average. Such action indicates that the stock is trying to form a new base that could serve as a launching pad for a new breakout and a new run to price highs.When a stock breaks out and hits new highs, everyone in the market is happy, except for short sellers.Alibaba broke out of an eight-week cup with handle at 192.59 on Jan. 24, rallied 7%, then got reeled back into the belly of that chart pattern. So, a new base that potentially forms would technically serve as a base next to a base.Autodesk (ADSK) gapped up on very strong results and gave a rosy outlook based on success with its transition into a ""software as a service"" business model. Adobe Systems (ADBE) has already shown it's succeeded by selling its products online and giving users flexible subscription-based offerings.Both Autodesk and Adobe are members of IBD Leaderboard, which currently shows nine names on its Leaders list. Each of those Leaders has an annotated daily and weekly chart to help users find the right time to buy and the best time to sell to lock in gains and minimize losses.Autodesk jumped past a 131.20 buy point in a three-month base that can be viewed as a double bottom.

The leader in for-profit education for China's fast-growing middle class inched up on Wednesday, but more importantly, the large-cap consumer spending play continues to hold near a 36.26 buy point in a new four-month cuplike base.TAL, which has a relatively limited float of 182 million shares, has performed exceptionally well since it initially cleared a 12-week perfect cup with handle at 13.07 on Jan. 19, 2017 (adjusted for a 6-1 stock split later in the year). On that day, the stock vaulted 7.4% in very heavy volume and sprinted past the highest price within the downward-slanting handle within the base. Add 10 cents to a handle's high to find the exact buy point.To see that exact breakout, MarketSmith offers excellent easy-to-use historical charts that allow users to go back decades in time.On the day of TAL's January 2017 breakout, the correct buy point was 77.93, a dime above the handle's high, before the big stock split. In the handle portion of the base, TAL fell just 5% to 74.06. The handle indicates the final shakeout of remaining uncommitted shareholders before fresh new institutional demand comes in to lift the stock and spur the breakout to new highs.Since that breakout, TAL has advanced 200%.Over the same time period, the S&P 500 has gained as much as 27%, excluding dividends.TAL grew its revenue 39%, 38%, 43% and 68% over the past four years. In the fiscal year 2017 ended in February that year, the top line was $1.04 billion, hitting the billion-dollar level for the first time.The Street sees earnings rising 14% to 32 cents a share in FY 2018 (which just ended in February), then leaping another 62% to 52 cents in FY 2019 on revenue increases of 63% to $1.7 billion and 52% to $2.59 billion, respectively.In other financial markets, WTI crude oil futures slumped 2.3% to $61.14 a barrel despite reports that weekly U.S. crude oil inventories came in higher than expected at 2.4 million barrels, suggesting continued strong domestic output. In the prior week, inventories were higher at 3.0 million barrels.Bond traders have been conducting relatively quiet trading, at least from the view of U.S. Treasury long bonds. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note stood at 2.88%, relatively unchanged for the past two sessions and seven basis points below the year-to-date peak of 2.95%.The CME Fed Watch tool for analyzing fed funds futures currently shows no significant change in the probability that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates four times by December. The probability that the fed funds rate will hit a 2.25%-2.5% target range is 34%. This means the majority of bond traders see just three increases of a quarter point each for 2018, with the first one coming up after the Fed holds a two-day meeting on interest rate policy on March 20-21.(Please follow Saito-Chung on Twitter at @IBD_DChung for more commentary on top growth stocks, breakouts, sell signals, and other financial markets.)RELATED:Hot IPO LeadersDo You Know How To Spot This Money-Making Bullish Stock Chart Pattern?Stocks Near A Buy ZoneWill More Hot Growth Stocks Begin Forming This Key Pattern?Autodesk Shines After Its Q4 Results

28,ADSK,"Goldman Sachs (GS) and Intel (INTC) showed big gains and boosted the Dow Jones industrial average Monday after last week's massacre in stocks. The former is trying to avoid a collision course with its long-term 200-day moving average while the latter seeks to further stretch its market outperformance.Meanwhile, fellow Dow Jones industrial average component Apple (AAPL) also showed some intestinal fortitude as the iPhone and iPad giant looked poised to snap a six-session losing streak. At around 3:30 p.m. ET, shares ran up 4.5% to 172.45 and retook its key 50-day moving average. Apple also helped the blue-chip index gain more than 2.7% in late-afternoon trading in the stock market today.The Nasdaq composite moved even higher, rising nearly 3% on the back of strength in the FANG stocks as well as nice rebounds by semiconductor stocks.

In addition, instances where investors can consider adding a small amount of shares to a winning position are noted.The S&P SmallCap 600 rallied more than 2.1% while the lagging Dow Jones utility average rose 1%. At 680, the utilities are still down roughly 6% since Jan. 1.The 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 3 basis points to 2.84%.Returning to Apple, the largest company on the U.S. financial markets by market value continues to keep its long uptrend intact, and at just 6% below a 183.50 all-time peak, the stock's action suggests that yet another breakout has high potential.At that peak, the megacap tech has burst 55% higher since breaking out of a bottoming base at 118.12 on Jan. 6, 2017.Intel, up 5.6% to 52.14, is now up nearly 13% since Jan. 1 and has coasted more than 46% higher since it staged a first-stage saucer-with-handle breakout at 36.80 during the week ended Sept. 15, 2017.The Street sees Intel's profit rising 3% to $3.55 a share in FY 2018, which would mark a fifth straight year of annual earnings increases.Apple, meanwhile, could see its FY 2018 profit rise 24% to $11.46 a share, accelerating from an 11% jump in FY 2017, ended in September that year.Elsewhere, the Hang Seng benchmark in Hong Kong halted a three-session losing streak, climbing 0.8% to 30,548 overnight. The Hang Seng has now notched three tests of support near the psychologically important level of 30,000.A big dive beneath that price level would indicate that large institutional investors are worried that the U.S. and China won't be able to meet in the middle to resolve glaring differences on trade tariffs.Watch the Shanghai Composite as well. On Monday, it followed Friday's 3.4% lambasting with a 0.6% decline and a nice bounce off intraday lows.

Wall Street expected 150,000.Autodesk also modestly lowered its guidance for new subscribers in the current quarter, but that was likely influenced by lower promotional pricing activity, Cowen analyst Gregg Moskowitz said in a report.""Our belief is that this Q4 will have no aggressive promotions,"" he said.

37,ADSK,"Autodesk (ADSK) shares tumbled in late trading Tuesday after the maker of computer-aided design software gave mixed guidance for the current quarter and announced a major corporate restructuring.Autodesk plans to slash its workforce by 13% in the near term, cutting about 1,150 jobs.

During the regular session, Autodesk dipped 0.2% to 129.95.Through the restructuring, the company hopes to streamline the organization and rebalance resources to better align with its priorities, Autodesk Chief Executive Andrew Anagnost said in a written statement.Autodesk has been transitioning its business from perpetual license software to software subscriptions and cloud computing services. During the transition, revenue and earnings have been negatively impacted as customers pay over time rather than purchase software upfront.The San Rafael, Calif.-based company said it lost an adjusted 12 cents a share in its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of 18 cents a share in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 5% year over year to $515.3 million. Analysts expected Autodesk to lose 13 cents a share on sales of $513.5 million in the period.For the current quarter, Autodesk expects to lose 12 cents a share on sales of $542 million, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling for a loss of 14 cents on sales of $545 million.Autodesk said the restructuring plan will ""focus on the company's strategic priorities of completing the subscription transition; digitizing the company; and re-imagining manufacturing, construction, and production.""Anagnost stressed that the company isn't doing the restructuring simply to cut costs.""We're taking this restructuring action from a position of strength,"" he said. ""This is not a cost reduction activity as we maintain our commitment to keep total non-GAAP spend flat this year and next.""He added, ""As we enter the growth phase of our model transition, we need to rebalance investments to focus on our strategic priorities. This includes divesting from some areas and increasing our investment in others.""

""While passage of tax reform may provide mid-single digit upside to the S&P 500, we also estimate that equity allocations for most investor types are near historical highs, potentially leaving them less willing to increase allocations to U.S. equities further.

Stocks dipped Friday on a report that Michael Flynn, briefly President Trump's national security adviser, is willing to testify against Trump as part of a plea deal.Tech leaders, including many chip stocks and China internets, struggled. Bitcoin frenzy continued amid growing acceptance and concerns. General Motors (GM) said it will launch a robotaxi service for big cities in 2019.X The Dow and S&P 500 rallied to record highs as tax-cut hopes lifted stocks generally, with the Flynn-Trump news only paring gains. The Dow rose 2.9%, its best weekly gain of 2017. The S&P 500 advanced 1.5%. JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup (C) and other financials also rallied on rising bond yields while many retailers rebounded on holiday sales hopes.

Waymo — often seen as being furthest along on autonomous technology — said it will soon put passengers in driverless cars — without even a ""safety driver"" to take over the controls if things go wrong.

44,ADSK,"Shares in technology companies fell sharply Wednesday with so-called FANG stocks — Facebook (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), Netflix (NFLX) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) — among the hardest hit as investors rotated into banks and value-stocks, one market strategist said.The Nasdaq dropped 1.4% to close at 6,824.39. The Dow rose 0.4% to 23,940.68. Telecom and financial stocks rallied amid the tech sell-off.Among the FANGs, Facebook lost 4% to 175.13 on the stock market today, and Amazon was off 2.7% to finish at 1,161.27. Netflix plunged 5.5% to 188.15. Alphabet retreated by 2.4% to 1037.38.The last rotation out of big-cap internet stocks occurred after President Trump's surprise election in 2016. But FANG stocks and other techs bounced back in 2017, accounting for most of the Nasdaq's gains.Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets, says the breakout by banks is significant.""One day does not make a trend but we are seeing signs of a rotation,"" Belski said. ""Does (the tech sell-off) mean that value investing strategies are beginning to become more prevalent — banks and financials being the biggest part of the value index — I think the answer to that is yes.""""The money has to come from somewhere.

51,ADSK,"Ah, those sociable humans, they're always up to something online — texting, tweeting, messaging, Googling.HubSpot (HUBS) Chief Executive Brian Halligan says he's staying on top of all that, and making it work to his company's advantage.X""We are really watching the way the marketplace and humans are changing, and building products to match that,"" Halligan said on a recent company earnings call.HubSpot is an 11-year-old maker of sales and marketing software based in Cambridge, Mass., and it sells to small- and midsize businesses. Its own pitch is that potential customers — aka those sociable humans — find businesses through digital channels like blogs, internet search engines and social media. HubSpot's expertise lies in attracting people to websites and optimizing content so that visitors are converted into paying customers.Its mantra: Help customers create more personalized interactions with their prospective buyers to close the deal. The strategy has helped HubSpot see its revenue shoot up 38% to $171 million in the first six months of 2017. Shares are up 52% this year.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect 2018 revenue growth to slow to 25% from 34% this year. HubSpot could beat those earnings estimates if new initiatives gain traction, says Derrick Wood, an analyst at Cowen & Co.""Their rate of growth has come down. Marketing tech in general is a tough market to scale. It's fragmented with lots of small vendors. So to come out as a single winner and take a lot of market share has been challenging,"" said Wood, who has a neutral rating on the stock.Further, HubSpot's main challenge is maintaining a sales growth rate that will support its valuation.HubSpot has evolved into a multi-product company — adding sales automation and customer relationship management (CRM) software. Many of HubSpot's customers have 10 to 50 employees, with some in the low hundreds. Analysts say HubSpot targets firms with up to 2,000 employees.The company has focused on the midmarket as opposed to competing head-on for large corporate accounts vs. the likes of Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM), SAP and Adobe Systems (ADBE). That way HubSpot has avoided the cost of investing in its own sales staff to chase down and close deals, says Wood.""What's different about these guys is the focus on midmarket. They have to keep the new-customer growth engine going. They're looking at new ways to acquire customers,"" said Wood. ""Also going into new markets, like they're doing with sales force automation and CRM, is going to drive growth. But I don't think you'll see them go upmarket into (larger) enterprise (firms).""HubSpot's customers mostly engage in business-to-business marketing. They buy online subscriptions to software that ranges from $2,500 to $30,000 annually. The average marketing customer spends about $13,000 a year.HubSpot also has laid claim to what it calls ""Inbound Marketing."" Halligan and co-founder Dharmesh Shah wrote a book on using Google, social media and search-friendly blogs to attract customers via the internet. HubSpot sells tools that track the online activity of website visitors and personalize content as their interests are identified.Halligan says people are spending less time texting, emailing back-and-forth, or searching on Google. Instead, Halligan says, they're using messaging platforms more, including Slack, in the workplace.And, humans consume tons of video. So HubSpot helps its customers evaluate video platforms such as Facebook (FB) Live for marketing purposes.""If you look how people spend their day, they're spending an awful lot of time on social media,"" Halligan said on the earnings call. ""There are big shifts going on, and HubSpot's going to be there to help our customers through it.""HubSpot has used Twitter (TWTR), Facebook and Instagram to build its own follower base. In late September, HubSpot will host its annual ""Inbound"" user conference to rally the troops.Still, there's more to HubSpot's marketing than social media engagement. HubSpot has built up sales channels, such as website design and marketing agencies, that point people toward its products. About 40% of revenue comes from customer-referral channels, says Wood.HubSpot aims to borrow some techniques from Intuit (INTU) and Autodesk (ADSK), which have successfully targeted accountants and architects, as partners. HubSpot aims to partner with sales agencies. HubSpot also works with industry players. HubSpot has growing ties to Microsoft's (MSFT) LinkedIn and its sales tools.IBD'S TAKE: HubSpot has formed a cup-with-handle chart pattern with a buy point of 76.20. The stock is hovering near its 50-day moving average. Alarm.com, Realpage, and Appfolio have the highest Composite Rating, a CAN SLIM investing metric, of companies in IBD's Computer Software-Specialty Enterprise group.The company also provides help in integrating its software with Salesforce.com's bigger platform. And, HubSpot's tools work with e-commerce payment platforms such as Shopify (SHOP).HubSpot recently rolled out a $50 monthly marketing starter package. New visitors to its website are greeted with offers for free versions of HubSpot products. After using free versions for a while, or ""freemiums,"" the company figures users will upgrade to paid products.""If you roll the clock forward two, three, four years, that's just the way I think humans are going to buy products because they're going to want to try it and use it (first),"" said Halligan on the earnings call. ""This freemium thing is going to be here to stay.""Indeed, HubSpot has added two new board members — one from software firm Atlassian (TEAM) and one from data storage provider Drop — both of which use freemium business models.HubSpot has more than 34,300 customers, up 40% from a year ago, with roughly 27,000 of them buying marketing tools. Average revenue per customer has been falling, however, due to the lower-priced offers.Nate Cunningham, a Guggenheim Securities analyst, says HubSpot has a ""greenfield"" opportunity to target small companies that never bought marketing software. He says HubSpot needs to improve operating margins as it adds customers in new ways.""The No. 1 determinant of HubSpot's growth is probably not competitive displacement, to gain share vs. Salesforce or IBM,"" said Cunningham. ""It's more about how can they get people to try their product who never have had a marketing product before. I think greenfield is where the bulk of the opportunity is.""HubSpot had over 5,000 ""Growth Stack"" customers as of June 30, up from 3,000 at the start of the year. These high-spending customers buy more sales, CRM and marketing software tools. And, they're more likely to renew subscriptions annually as opposed to leaving.Bhavan Suri, analyst at William Blair, says HubSpot is on the right track.""We believe HubSpot's customer growth is a good indication of the health of the business,"" he said in a note to clients, ""and provides significant up-sell and cross-sell opportunities longer term, which we believe could ultimately lead to an acceleration of the business as soon as next year.""Shares of HubSpot have been in decline while forming a deep handle, but were up 2.2% at Friday's close to 67.35.RELATED:This Education Company Reaps Newfound Disposable Income In ChinaAd Tech Firm Does Bidding For Customers, One At A TimeBiotech Finds Its Stride With Kidney Cancer Treatment

53,ADSK,"Investors in Dow component Microsoft (MSFT) and countless other companies are due for a wake-up call in coming months, and this is one instance where hitting the snooze button isn't a good idea.A set of new accounting rules that govern revenue recognition — said to be the biggest change in standards since the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 — will take effect next year, affecting either fiscal 2018 or 2019 for all U.S. companies.The accounting changes are under the radar of many investors, who may scramble to make sense of what's happening with the stocks, many of them blue chips like Microsoft, into which they've poured their money.Under the designation of FASB 606 — FASB is an acronym for the Financial Accounting Standards Board — the new rules will make revenue recognition consistent across U.S. industries. It's geared to help investors, but there could be near-term pain. Many companies will likely speed up revenue recognition and possibly make earnings more volatile from quarter to quarter.""We expect that (the new rules) will cause significant investor confusion over the next 12 months to the financial analysis of companies ranging from small companies up to the largest, including Microsoft,"" said a recent report from Citigroup.But the rules aim to address a big problem.While top-line growth is a critical metric for investors, revenue recognition has been a weak link in accounting standards. With the new rules, Wall Street analysts and investors should get a better feel for how a company is doing and whether business is deteriorating or booming.One goal is providing more transparency in sales backlogs, or revenue not yet recognized from contracts already signed. Some companies state backlogs, some don't. Now they'll have to put a number on it in many industries. Guidelines specific to the software and defense industries, for example, are going away.In regulatory filings, companies also will be required to disclose more information on contracts. That should give investors and analysts more data on what risks or uncertainties companies face. Companies talk about things like pension costs in filings but don't provide the same transparency on revenue issues.Industries with the most ""deferred revenue"" — sales booked over time — will be most affected by FASB 606, says a Morgan Stanley report. Those include software, communications equipment, airlines, aerospace and defense.In industries that will be impacted most by the new rules, some analysts are talking about using more steady free cash flow as an alternative metric to earnings per share. The reason is free cash flow will be less impacted by the 606 rules.""I would expect to see more disclosures, certainly by the third quarter, on whether the standard is going to affect revenue recognition,"" said Dusty Stallings, a partner at accounting giant PricewaterhouseCoopers.Microsoft is expected to be one of the prominent early adopters of the new standard. It reports its 2017 fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on July 20, and a few weeks later the company plans to restate earnings for the prior two years.Also on the list with Microsoft are a number of other Dow components, including General Electric (GE), Boeing (BA) and Verizon Communications (VZ).A wide swath of other firms in many industries are expected to be impacted. They include Amazon.com (AMZN), American Airlines (AAL), AT&T (T), Electronic Arts (EA) and General Dynamics (GD). Others are First Solar (FLSR), Monsanto (MON) and T-Mobile US (TMUS)Companies that recognize more revenue upfront could have more earnings volatility. Surprises to the upside may be followed by sudden, equally surprising shortfalls. Companies prefer that a total contract value be recognized over time, which provides more flexibility in smoothing out earnings to meet consensus estimates.""New principle-based revenue rules will likely accelerate revenue recognition, while also introducing more volatility,"" said Snehaja Mogre, a Morgan Stanley analyst in a report. ""As the new standard will not impact actual cash flows, we expect investors to increase their reliance on cash flow metrics.""Many companies are still studying the new FASB 606 rules, but crunch time is coming. Expectations run high that many companies will finally declare whether the 606 standard is ""material"" or not to financial results on June- or September-quarter earnings calls.In Microsoft's case, the new standard is expected to impact Windows 10 revenue in particular. Microsoft is expected to book Windows 10 revenue when it bills hardware makers rather than over the life of a PC or device using the software. Microsoft in May briefed financial analysts, telling them that in fiscal 2016 revenue would have been about 7% higher —$6 billion or so — had it used the new revenue standard back then.While Microsoft will forecast earnings in July for its first fiscal quarter of 2018, it plans to update guidance in August using the new revenue recognition standard. When briefing analysts in May, Microsoft made the point that the FASB 606 rules will not impact free cash flow.""Net-net, investors could start paying more attention to cash flows given increasing revenue variability,"" Brent Bracelin, analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said in a recent note to clients.While some companies will opt to restate earnings for prior years, most are expected to take a ""modified"" compliance route, applying the new rules on a quarter-by-quarter basis going forward, adjusting results for new contracts, says Betsy Meter, an audit partner at KPMG.""It's industry-driven mainly,"" she said. Companies that delay, though, will be less likely to take Microsoft's approach and restate prior-year earnings, which gives investors more information.""For industries where there is a significant impact, a full retrospective approach will give them some history and visibility,"" Meter added.Some of the biggest names in tech, though, see little impact. Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) are among tech companies that expect little impact from the new standard. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) has not been heard from.In general, the rules are expected to affect companies with multiyear contracts, licensing revenue and contracts that peg revenue to performance benchmarks. And they will also affect companies that use third-party sales distribution channels.Revenue from Amazon-branded electronic devices sold through retailers will be booked earlier, rather than when consumers actually buy the devices, says a Connor Group report. The new rules also will impact Amazon gift cards, says the report.Key to the new accounting rules is that revenue must often be booked right away and not stretched out over the term of contracts. AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon will likely book more revenue from smartphone sales upfront, rather than over the course of an installment payment plan.Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) are among software companies still studying the impact of 606 rules. Workday (WDAY) has decided to  remove guidance for billings, a sales growth metric,  as it adopts the new accounting rules. It's unclear how many other companies may follow suit on billings.Companies with cloud-based, software-as-a-servicer (SaaS) business models that involve renewable subscriptions are expected to be less impacted than those that sell software installed on a customer's own in-house computers.Only about 7% of SaaS provider ServiceNow's (NOW) revenue comes from on-premise licenses, analysts say. Splunk (SPLK) and Ansys (ANSS), on the other hand, garner a large chunk of revenue from on-premise deals, says a William Blair report.While Microsoft will likely book Windows 10 revenue sooner, its online Office 365 sales will be less affected. Cloud-based software is rented via the internet.""SaaS models should see the least impact from the new standard, given that software is hosted and delivered over broadband connections vs. software installed on-premise,"" said Bracelin.Cisco Systems (CSCO), a big computer networking gear maker, could see its deferred revenue impacted, he says.Many software companies may be in the process of renegotiating contracts to ease the impact of rule 606, says KPMG's Meter.Some software makers, such as Autodesk (ADSK), have already transitioned business models to subscription licenses for cloud software. Under the 606 rules, only software that is continuously updated is eligible for revenue recognition over time, or ""ratably.""A lot of U.S. companies had hoped for further delays in carrying out the 606 rules, which have been in the works for more than a decade.""Companies know the time is upon them to get going,"" said Stallings at PricewaterhouseCoopers. ""There's acceptance that this is going live on Jan. 1, 2018, for calendar-year companies.""RELATED:Workday Ends Billings Guidance In Accounting Shift, Stock Falls

54,ADSK,"Computer-aided design software firm Autodesk (ADSK) late Thursday saw its stock surge higher after it beat Wall Street's targets for its fiscal first quarter.Autodesk reported an adjusted loss of 16 cents a share on revenue of $486 million in its fiscal first quarter ended April 30, compared with a loss of 10 cents a share on sales of $512 million a year earlier. Analysts expected Autodesk to report a loss of 24 cents a share excluding items on sales of $470.4 million as the San Rafael, Calif.-based company continues its business model transition from licensed software to cloud computing services.During Autodesk's transition, revenue is negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably rather than up front and as new offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price.Autodesk stock was up 8%, near 104, in after-hours trading on the stock market today. Autodesk hit a record regular-session high of 98.05 on Tuesday. It broke out of a flat base with a buy point of 89.28 on April 24.For its fiscal second quarter ending July 31, Autodesk expects to lose an adjusted 16 cents a share on sales of $494 million. In the year-earlier period, Autodesk earned 5 cents a share on sales of $551 million.Analysts were modeling Autodesk to lose 15 cents a share on sales of $488 million.Autodesk's annualized recurring revenue rose 18% year over year to $1.74 billion in the first quarter because of strong sales of subscription plans.""Broad-based strength across all subscription types and geographies led to another record quarter for total subscription additions and a fantastic start of the new fiscal year,"" Amar Hanspal, Autodesk co-CEO and chief product officer, said in a statement. ""Customers continue to embrace the subscription model, and we're expanding our market opportunity with continued momentum of our cloud-based offerings, such as BIM 360 and Fusion 360.""Autodesk is a member of IBD's eight-company Computer Software-Design industry group, which currently ranks No. 31 out of 197 industry groups.Another member of the design software group, Synopsys (SNPS), posted better-than-expected fiscal second-quarter sales and earnings late Wednesday.At least three investment banks raised their price targets on Synopsys stock on Thursday, including Needham, Pacific Crest and RBC Capital Markets. But shares fell 3.4% to 70.93.

Apple (AAPL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) rose about 1.5% in Thursday stock market trading, with Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) climbing close to 2%. Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL) was a relative laggard, up 0.9%, but still outperformed the major averages.X Apple's ecosystem also thrived. Apple iPhone chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) (2.8%), Skyworks (SWKS) (2.6%) and Qorvo (QRVO) (4.15%) had big gains.Futures for the Dow industrials and S&P 500 were virtually flat vs. fair value. So were Nasdaq 100 futures. After Thursday's close Applied Materials (AMAT), Salesforce.com (CRM), Ross Stores (ROST), Gap (GPS) and Autodesk (ADSK) rallied on their earnings reports.In Asian trading, Japan's Nikkei rose 0.1% while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 lost 0.2% and China's Shanghai composite was fractionally lower.Last week, Amazon celebrated its 20th anniversary as a public company. On Thursday, Facebook had its fifth anniversary. Facebook went public at 38 a share on May 18, 2012. Shares popped to 45 moments after trading began, but closed near the IPO price. Then it spent more than a year below 38. Finally, it broke out in powerful fashion in July 2013. From that 32.61 buy point, Facebook has soared 354% to Thursday's close of 147.94.IBD'S TAKE: Facebook is a standout company and stock. But it's only ranked sixth in IBD's Internet-Content group. To see which stocks are the group's top performers and how they stack up vs. Facebook and objective criteria, check out IBD's Stock Checkup.It seems obvious in hindsight that Facebook would thrive, even when its stock was underwater for 14 months. But it wasn't. Yahoo (YHOO) fell behind to Google in search, and Google couldn't catch up in social media with its ill-fated Google+. Facebook, like many other internet firms, had to deal with a massive shift to mobile, where ads paid out less. That meant Facebook had to spend more to make less.However, Facebook executed brilliantly. As mobile became its dominant form, additional users and ads translated into massive revenue and earnings growth yet again. Its Instagram purchase — a month before its IPO — turned out to be a boon, especially in battling upstart Snapchat, the main unit of recent IPO Snap (SNAP).On its anniversary, Facebook kept busy. Facebook reached a deal Thursday to live-stream 20 Major League Baseball games. It'll stream a game every Friday for the rest of the season, starting on May 19 with the Colorado Rockies vs. the Cincinnati Reds. Facebook already has a pact with Univision to stream some MLS soccer games.Facebook and other streaming sites are making a big push to cover sports. Amazon recently forged a deal to air the NFL's 10 ""Thursday Night Football"" games next season. Amazon is replacing Twitter, which had those rights in the most recent season.Facebook rebounded from its 50-day moving average on Thursday in above-average volume, though trading cooled from Wednesday. It was solid action at a key support level. But with the current market uptrend under pressure, investors should be cautious about stepping in.RELATED:The Big Picture: 3 Technical Signs That Favor The BullsSalesforce.com Beats Profit, Revenue Views, Tweaks Full-Year OutlookApplied Materials Hails 'Tremendous Momentum'; EPS Growth Tops 100% Again

72,ADSK,"Product-design software leader Autodesk (ADSK) plans to discount initial charges for customers that switch to its subscription service is the reason the company's guidance missed expectations, some analysts say, but they in general say the move will pay off amid the company's transition to cloud software.Autodesk late Thursday gave much lower-than-expected guidance for the current quarter, its fiscal Q1, and for fiscal 2018, while posting a beat on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal Q4 ended Jan. 31.""We believe that a primary reason for this lower-than-expected guidance was the company's announcement of an aggressive subscription discount plan to incentivize maintenance subscribers to transition to product subscriptions,"" William Blair analyst Anil Doradla wrote in a research report, reiterating his outperform rating on Autodesk stock.Maintenance subscribers have Autodesk's legacy on-premise perpetual license product, and they pay a small maintenance fee to keep that software up to date. But as of last quarter, Autodesk has moved solely to a cloud subscription business model, hoping to bring most of its customers over to the new model. Autodesk is the longtime No. 1 provider of CAD, or computer-aided design, software.The discount ""illustrates management's focus on completing the transition to a subscription-based model rather than prioritizing short-term revenue or earnings growth,"" Doradla said. ""We continue to believe that Autodesk's transition to a subscription-based model is on track ... .""IBD'S TAKE: Autodesk is part of IBD's small (nine company) Computer Software-Design industry group, which ranks a solid No. 23 out of 197 groups, largely thanks to Autodesk's gains the past six months.

"
73,ADSK,"Longtime product-design software stalwart Autodesk (ADSK), amid a major transition to cloud computing, late Thursday gave Q1 guidance that missed Wall Street views, but its Q4 results beat. Autodesk's transition into a cloud software vendor is progressing, and shares hit a record high Wednesday, but its weak guidance sent the stock down late Thursday.Shares weren't slowed by last month's surprise announcement that 11-year Chief Executive Carl Bass was resigning, with no new CEO yet appointed as the company undergoes a search. Bass remains a special advisor and board member, however, and he was praised heartily by the company in the announcement — praise echoed by analysts. The same day, Autodesk announced that two representatives of activist investor Sachem Head Capital Management, Scott Ferguson and Jeff Clarke, would resign from the board this year.The computer-aided design arena that Autodesk has long led has been a slower convert to cloud computing, but the company has been picking up steam in its conversion.Wall Street Q4, Q1 estimates: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Autodesk to swing to a per-share loss minus items of 34 cents from a 21-cent profit in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue for the period ended Jan. 31 is expected to rise 27% to $473.55 million. For its first quarter, analysts see a 13-cent loss, vs. a 10-cent loss in the year-ago quarter, on sales of $496.65 million, down 3%.Q4 results, Q1 guidance: The company posted a per-share loss minus items of 28 cents, as revenue rose 26% to $479 million. But for Q1, it guided to a per-share loss ex items of 21 cents to 27 cents, on revenue of $460 million to $480 million.Prior quarter: Three months ago, Autodesk posted an adjusted loss of 18 cents a share, swinging from a 14-cent profit. Revenue fell 18% to $490 million. But it marked the company's first quarter of selling only subscriptions, as opposed to on-premise licenses. In the new model, revenue is recognized gradually rather than upfront. The company said that its subscription accounts under the new model rose by 168,000 from the fiscal second quarter, to 861,000 total. It said that its new model annualized recurring revenue, which rose 88% year over year, to $414 million.Company Q4 guidance: The San Rafael-Calif.-based software maker guided to a per-share loss ex items of 32 cents to 39 cents, on revenue of $460 million to $480 million.Stock: Autodesk stock was down more than 2% in after-hours trading Thursday, following its earnings release. Shares fell 1.8% to 87.32 in the regular session, after rising 3.1% Wednesday and touching an all-time high of 89.18. At that point, it had hit a record high in three of the past four trading days.

75,ADSK,"Want to put Fidelity Investments' world-class research resources to work for your retirement accounts and your taxable portfolios? Of course you do.Knowing how the Boston-based asset management giant has deployed the assets of shareholders in its stock mutual funds and balanced funds can help you make decisions about your own buys and sells.For example, in the fourth quarter Fidelity trimmed its exposure to several big technology bellwether stocks. Not all Fidelity funds may act in lockstep, but overall the fund complex lightened its net share count in Facebook (FB) by 5.1%, according to Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research for CFRA, an independent research firm.Facebook is ranked No. 4 on IBD's Internet-Content industry group, thanks in part to a strong 91 Composite Rating from IBD and 87% average earnings per share growth over the past three quarters. 99 is the highest possible rating, which is on a scale from 1-99.Fidelity's Facebook holding is now at its lightest quarter-end level since the end of 2013, Rosenbluth says in a new report for MarketScope Advisor.Facebook has rallied 16% since the beginning in a year to an all-time high. Subsequent disclosures by Fidelity will reveal whether it's been a buyer of Facebook shares in the current period.The fund complex also trimmed its net share count in Google-owner Alphabet's C-class shares (GOOG) by 5.6% and its A-class shares (GOOGL) by 1.4%. Alphabet has rallied 6% so far this year. It faded after clearing the 816.78 buy point of a flat base on Jan. 23. It's retaken the buy point.Graphics chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) was a third tech big name to be trimmed by Fidelity. Fidelity also trimmed Salesforce.com (CRM), a provider of customer relationship management software.IBD'S TAKE: Nvidia ranks No. 1 in IBD's Electronics-Semiconductor Fabless industry group, buoyed by a solid-gold 99 Comp Rating and six straight quarters of EPS growth acceleration. For details, check the stock's vital signs at IBD's Stock Checkup.Still, tech remained Fidelity's biggest sector, accounting for 26% of the fund family's shareholders' money. That was an increase from Sept. 30's 24% and June 30's 23% weighting.And many Fidelity funds, including some of its largest, remained owners of stock in which the overall complex made net trims.For instance, now-$35.3 billion Fidelity Growth Company Fund (FDGRX) held Alphabet, Facebook, Microsoft, Nvidia and Salesforce.com in its top 10 at year-end.And there were several tech names in which Fidelity made net increases in its share counts during Q4.Fidelity boosted its share count in software giant Microsoft (MSFT) by 9.3% to 148 million shares. That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.That was the highest share count since the end of 2014, Rosenbluth wrote.""A few other stocks that had double-digit percentage share increases include Autodesk (ADSK),"" Rosenbluth told IBD, referring to the developer of computer-aided design software applications.Financials were Fidelity's second-largest sector, with 15% of shareholders' assets. That increase took place as Fidelity increased its exposure to some big U.S. banks.Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC) all saw double-digit percentage share count growth, Rosenbluth wrote. He added, ""CFRA thinks investor optimism for banks improved amid expectations for higher interest rates and regulatory reform.""President Trump and Congress are widely expected to lighten the regulatory restrictions on some banks.In addition, Fidelity made a double-digit percentage increase in its share count in Capital One Financial (COF).The $414.3 million Fidelity Blue Chip Value (FBCVX) held Alphabet, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in its top 10 at year end.Fidelity had a 9% weight in industrials as of the end of Q4. Fidelity managers made a 53% net addition to their share count in aerospace and defense contractor Northrop Grumman (NOC) in the quarter. They added 6.7% to their shares in General Electric (GE).Comcast (CMCSA) and Verizon (VZ) were two stocks in which Fidelity managers made double-digit share increases.Tech was not the only space in which Fidelity funds made cuts. Fidelity managers made double-digit decreases to telecom titan AT&T (T), energy explorer and producer Chevron (CVX), medical products maker Medtronic (MDT) and to athletic apparel, footwear and equipment maker Nike (NKE).Each of those decreases appears vindicated at this early point following the quarter. Comp Ratings for each of those stocks current range from an anemic 27 for Chevron to Nike's 59.All of Rosenbluth's data applies to Fidelity's 232 stock and balanced funds (mixtures of stocks and bonds), which together hold nearly $1 trillion in shareholder assets, according to Morningtstar Inc.Fidelity runs an additional 70 funds that hold bonds or commodities, accounting for an additional $233 billion in shareholder money.RELATED:P-s-s-st!

IBD's New Highs list not only makes this information easy to find, it ranks the companies by IBD performance metrics.The company is transitioning to selling its software as a service — on demand via the internet cloud — instead of the formerly standard way of selling software via perpetual licenses, as cloud computing rising to the fore. The company's software is used construction, engineering, manufacturing and other companies to design products and simulate the real-world performance of those products."" ... we still wonder about the pace of the transition when weighing the metrics against a reduced Q4/17 outlook and our lowered estimates through FY/18,"" RBC analyst Matthew Hedberg wrote in a research report, despite his price-target hike.Autodesk stock fell 3.5% in the stock market today to 72.66, earlier falling below its 50-day average for one of the few times in the past four-plus months but closing just above the line. Autodesk stock had touched a record high of 78.58 on Nov. 17, but it remains within profit-taking territory after its August breakout at 62.52.The company's guidance because of several factors, including incentives to get customers to switch to SaaS, Anil Doradla, an analyst with William Blair, said in a research note, calling those ""short-term issues that we expect to be sorted out over the next several quarters, and consequently the results and guidance keep us positive on the story."" He rates Autodesk stock outperform.But Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams maintained his sell rating on the company.""We have been looking for more clarity in their reporting and details around the transition so we could gain more confidence in their ability to attain the goals they have set in the past,"" Adams wrote in his research.He and other analysts said the expect to get more details at Autodesk's annual analyst day on Tuesday.RELATED:Autodesk Soars To New High After Q2 Earnings Report

86,ADSK,"Look for more software partnerships to surface at Amazon.com's (AMZN) annual cloud computing conference this week, says Citigroup.Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing business of the e-commerce giant, will likely announce more products for the enterprise market as it battles Microsoft (MSFT), says Citigroup. Re:Invent, AWS' annual Las Vegas conference, runs from Tuesday through Friday. AWS has forged partnerships in 2016 with Salesforce.com (CRM), a leader in software-as-a-service, as well as VMware (VMW), whose software is widely used in corporate data centers.Rather than unveil products that compete with enterprise software providers, AWS is likely to tout its growing list of partnerships, Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard said in a research report.IBD'S TAKE: Amazon.com has dropped out of the IBD Leaderboard, which now includes Freeport-McMo-Ran, Jack-in-the-Box and tech stocks Broadcom, Veeva Systems and Celegene. Holiday season e-commerce activity will be a key for Amazon. ""The tide has shifted in 2016 with more AWS partnering with software vendors,"" wrote Pritchard. ""We believe the market may be overly concerned around impact on Red Hat (RHT), Splunk (SPLK) and VMware.""He noted that Salesforce.com, Splunk, VMware as well as Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Intuit (INTU) are slated to take part is RE:Invent sessions.""We expect to hear AWS partnering more to keep up with Microsoft and IBM (IBM) in hybrid cloud deployment,"" Pritchard said.""We expect investor sentiment coming out of re:Invent to continue to focus on its disruptive impact on the enterprise market with significant traction with big-name customers,"" he said. ""We note that AWS as a development platform lags its position in infrastructure, but we see many of these customers presenting on how AWS is becoming key to its custom app development effort, replacing the likes of IBM, Microsoft and Oracle (ORCL).""AWS announced a new round of cloud computing price cuts in November.Citigroup lowered its price target on Amazon.com to 960 from 965 on Monday, on possible margin impact from the price cuts.In Q3, Amazon said AWS revneue jumped 55% year over year to $3.23 billion, topping analysts' estimate of $3.19 billion.Amazon stock fell 1.7% in the stock market today to 766.77.

88,ADSK,"Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco Systems (CSCO) and other technology companies could gain from President-elect Donald Trump's support of a one-time repatriation of U.S. companies' corporate profits held overseas — if the idea gets enacted by a still-Republican-held Congress.Trump has proposed a 10% repatriation tax on profits of U.S. corporate foreign subsidiaries, down from the statutory 35%. The top five overseas cash holders are Apple, Microsoft, Google-parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Cisco and Oracle (ORCL).Trump's cash repatriation proposal ""could bring a flood of money back into the U.S. that would be available for dividends, share buybacks and possibly for capital investments,"" said Kevin Logan, an HSBC economist, in a research report. ""The tax revenue raised could be used to fund an infrastructure spending program, something that was advocated by both candidates during the presidential campaign.""Moody's Investor Service says Apple is on track to have $230 billion in overseas cash by the end of 2016, followed by Microsoft at $113 billion, Cisco at $62 billion, Oracle at $52 billion and Google at $49 billion. It projects that the top five will have $505 billion overseas by year-end, or 86% of their total cash, up from $441 billion in 2015.""We expect most companies would take advantage of a hypothetical tax reduction on permanently repatriated moneys to the maximum extent possible, but the devil is always in the details,"" Moody's analyst Richard Lane told IBD via email. "" Nevertheless, a hypothetical 10% tax on the $1.3 trillion offshore that we project for 2016 translates into $130 billion in tax revenue that could be invested in efficiency enhancing, domestic infrastructure investments.""More important than temporary, one-time tax relief, however, would be permanent tax reform that provides companies clarity to make long-term capital allocation decisions.""Trump has also proposed reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate to 15%, down from 35%, in an effort to keep companies from leaving for countries with lower rates.""Given the Republican control, there is a possibility of some tax relief to incent companies to bring foreign cash back to the U.S. offering an opportunity for them to invest, buyback stock and acquire assets,"" Abhey Lamba, a Mizuho Securities analyst, said in a report.Walter Pritchard, a Citigroup analyst, says a Republican-controlled House and U.S. Senate ""is not likely to block"" the 10% cash repatriation proposal. Republicans kept a narrow lead in the Senate and maintained a solid advantage in the House.Pritchard says Adobe Systems (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), Citrix Systems (CTXS), Red Hat (RHT) and VMware (VMW) are among companies that could bring back cash.""We believe the chances increase of a larger share repurchase or (lesser chance) dividend from these companies,"" Pritchard said in a research report.The biotechs with sizable overseas holdings include Amgen (AMGN), Medtronic (MDT) and Gilead Sciences (GILD), says a UBS research report. It says other companies with lots of overseas cash include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Coca-Cola (KO).""While the specifics would depend on the ultimate legislation, we would expect that a significant amount of the overseas cash balances (perhaps 75% or greater) would be repatriated and used to continue to repurchase shares and pay dividends, but also to increase the pace of M&A and growth capex, of which the latter has been a missing component in the current cycle,"" UBS analyst Julian Emanuel said in the report.Among big tech stocks, Oracle was up 1.1% to 39.55 and Cisco added 1.2% to 31.36 at the close on the stock market today. Meanwhile, Apple was down a fraction to 110.88 and Alphabet slipped 0.8% 805.59.

90,ADSK,"Autodesk (ADSK) stock jumped to an all-time high Friday after the pioneering maker of computer-aided design software late Thursday gave better-than-expected guidance for the current quarter and posted a fiscal Q2 that beat on the top and bottom lines.The software maker said it had a record increase in cloud subscriptions for the quarter ended July 31, ""as our customers and partners embrace a model that has greater flexibility and a better user experience,"" Autodesk CEO Carl Bass said in the company's earnings release.Autodesk stock leapt 8.1% to 68.87 in the stock market today, hitting a record high.IBD'S TAKE: A good place to check for winners is the IBD New Highs list. This list not only shows stocks touching 52-week highs, but it ranks them by Composite Ratings, to help investors focus on the top stocks.The company is transitioning to selling its software as a service -- on demand via the internet cloud -- instead of the formerly standard way of selling software via perpetual licenses, as cloud computing rising to the fore. The company's software is used by customers such as construction, engineering and manufacturing companies to design products and simulate the real-world performance of those products.That transition ""is moving in the right direction,"" William Blair analyst Anil Doradla wrote in a research note Friday, in which he maintained his outperform rating on Autodesk stock.Pacific Crest maintained its overweight rating on Autodesk stock, along with its 81 price target.""Autodesk's move to the cloud should give the company more subscription revenue, which should ultimately provide it better visibility, more consistency in its financial results and very compelling cash flows,"" Pacific Crest analysts wrote in a research note.Autodesk stock is now extended from its 62.52 buy point, out of a cup-with-handle base, touched on Aug. 15.
"
91,ADSK,"As it completes a business model transition, Autodesk (ADSK) is set to report quarterly earnings after the market close Thursday.Autodesk is undergoing a transition familiar to many older software makers, moving away from selling perpetual licenses in favor of subscriptions and flexible license arrangements. The company's software is used by construction, engineering and manufacturing companies and other professionals to design products and simulate the real-world performance of those products.The Wall Street consensus estimate is for Autodesk to report revenue of $512.1 billion, down 16% year over year to mark the fifth quarter in a row of such declines, for its fiscal 2017 second quarter. Excluding one-time gains and losses, Autodesk is expected to report a 13 cent loss, as polled by Thomson Reuters, swinging from a profit. It would be the 14th consecutive quarter in which EPS has not risen year over year.Autodesk discontinued new perpetual license sales for most individual products at the end of its fiscal Q4. During the transition, revenue was negatively impacted as more revenue is recognized piecemeal rather than upfront, and as new product offerings generally have a lower initial purchase price.""The end of perpetual suite sales and the beginning of a complete subscription model begins now,"" wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Kirk Adams in a research note. ""The numbers will be interesting, since this is the first quarter we will see no new perpetual sales.""Adams has a neutral rating on Autodesk stock and price target of 54.Autodesk shares fell 0.5% to 63.17 in the stock market today. Autodesk stock has been on an upward swing since hitting a six-month low of 49.82 on June 27. On Tuesday, the shares touched an eight-month high of 64.IBD'S TAKE: Autodesk moved past a 62.43 buy point on Aug. 15 and remains in a buy range. It has a bullish Accumulation/Distribution rating of A-, suggesting institutional buying, and a positive Relative Price Strength Rating of 72. You can learn more about How To Buy Stocks at IBD University.Adams said his neutral rating is based on concerns that the stock price ""has gotten ahead of itself. They still have a long way to go to achieve their four-year goals, and we would like to continue to see good progress against those goals before we reevaluate our price target.""

95,ADSK,"3D printer makers Stratasys (SSYS) and 3D Systems (DDD) were downgraded by Piper Jaffray following channel checks that revealed a ""significant slowdown"" in product demand in the second quarter.Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen also expects shipments by Stratasys and 3D Systems will fall below expectations in the second half of 2016.He attributed the 3D printer slowdown partly to the entry of HP Inc. (HPQ), formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split, into the 3D printer market two months ago. HP introduced two 3D printers, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK) and Proto Labs (PRLB).""We believe several customers have and will likely continue to pause purchasing to assess these new (HP) offerings,"" Jensen wrote. He also thinks several existing resellers of Stratasys and 3D Systems are likely to partner with HP, which will likely distract channels and stress relationships.""Our 2Q16 survey results were the poorest we have seen in recent memory, and given the internal challenges both Stratasys and 3D Systems have, we have become more cautious on both companies,"" Jensen wrote.Though Stratasys fared better than 3D Systems in the survey, ""the overall tone remained extremely negative and system demand has seemed to have hit a recent low,"" Jensen wrote about Stratasys. Jensen downgraded Stratasys to neutral from overweight and lowered to 24 from 32.Stratasys stock was down 9.1% to 21.17 at the close on the stock market today, falling below its 50-day moving average.Jensen lowered his rating on 3D Systems to underweight from neutral and his price target to 10.25 from 12.

Joshi succeeded interim CEO Andy Johnson, who continues in his role as executive vice president and chief legal officer.Joshi had been executive vice president of the imaging and printing business of HP Inc. (HPQ) -- formerly Hewlett-Packard before its split. HP announced its entry into the 3D printer market on May 17, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK) and ProtoLabs (PRLB).In a related shakeup in the 3D printer industry, five days ago Stratasys announced the retirement of CEO David Reis, who held that position for seven years, effective June 30. Reis will remain on the company's board of directors. The new CEO is Ilan Levin, who is a member of the board and executive committee of Stratasys.Shares of 3D Systems and Stratasys were hammered in 2015 as both companies posted disappointing earnings and sales. In November, 3D systems announced that Avi Reichental had resigned as CEO and president after 12 years.3D Systems stock fell 1.15% to 13.75 in the stock market today. The stock hit a six-year low of 6 on Jan. 20.Stratasys stock lost 2.9% to 23 on Tuesday. It hit a seven-year low of 14.48 on Feb. 12.

98,ADSK,"Microsoft's (MSFT) deal to buy online professional social network LinkedIn (LNKD) for $26.2 billion took many on Wall Street by surprise. Most analysts thought it was more likely that Microsoft would acquire a software-as-a-service (SaaS) company like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY). Many say the deal could spark more mergers and acquisitions in enterprise software.Microsoft announced its agreement to purchase LinkedIn early Monday. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the deal ""brings together the world’s leading professional cloud with the world’s leading professional network.""Microsoft stock, which fell 2.6% Monday, closed 0.6% lower at 49.83 on the stock market today. Workday rose 2.5% Tuesday, while Salesforce.com stock dipped 0.5%.Microsoft reportedly tried to acquire Salesforce.com in early 2015 with a bid that topped $50 billion, but it was rebuffed. With LinkedIn, Microsoft will get tools to compete with Salesforce. Microsoft will be able to use LinkedIn's Sales Navigator as a social selling tool integrated with its Dynamics customer relationship management software.“Microsoft’s agreement to purchase LinkedIn came as a surprise -- we thought a SaaS application M&A strategy was more likely,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Ross MacMillan said in a research report.He said he sees the logic of the deal -- combining LinkedIn user data with Microsoft’s Office 365 and Dynamics CRM -- but he is not clear on how it materially expands Microsoft’s total addressable market.“The good news is this takes the risk of an even bigger deal off the table and (we think) implies Microsoft’s core business remains healthy,” MacMillan said. He rates Microsoft stock as outperform, with a price target of 61.The LinkedIn deal could spur more mergers and acquisitions in the cloud computing sector, Canaccord Genuity analyst Richard Davis said in a report.“This acquisition increases the likelihood of more M&A in enterprise and systems software,” he said.The question is which companies will step up. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google, Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), IBM (IBM), Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) are among the potential acquirers, he said.Microsoft eventually will consider buying a firm with exceptional sales talent, such as Salesforce, Workday, Adobe Systems (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW) or Splunk (SPLK), he said. Davis rates Microsoft stock as hold, with a price target of 55.Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle also sees more M&A ahead in internet cloud applications.“As Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft and Google compete more aggressively in the cloud, applications provide a means of differentiation,” Barnicle said in a report. “Microsoft leads in applications because of Office. LinkedIn would provide additional differentiation.""It is likely Amazon and Google will also look to acquire large application companies, like Salesforce.com, Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK) or Workday. They are less likely to buy the smaller or more vertical SaaS vendors because those companies are too small to make a big difference for Amazon or Google, in our view.""Barnicle rates Microsoft stock as overweight, with a price target of 65.While some analysts on Wall Street were cautiously upbeat about the Microsoft-LinkedIn tie-up, others said Microsoft paid too much.“While we believe there is some strategic rationale supporting the deal, we question at what cost,” Jefferies analyst John DiFucci said in a report. “We view this acquisition as similar to other major acquisitions that Microsoft has made over the years, including aQuantive, Skype, and Nokia.”The purchases of aQuantive and Nokia were costly failures, and Skype’s performance is an unknown quantity, he said.“Microsoft has historically gotten a free pass from investors, since these deals typically only represented about a quarter of free cash flow, vs. more than a year’s worth for LinkedIn, which may force accountability,” DiFucci said. He rates Microsoft stock underperform with a price target of 40.RELATED:Public, Private Software Firms May Compete In M&A, Says CanaccordSalesforce-Microsoft Office 365 Deal ‘Delivering Real Dividends’Is Salesforce Big Enough To Avoid Amazon, Oracle Overtures?

100,ADSK,"The long-awaited entry of HP Inc. (HPQ) into the 3D printer market began Tuesday, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and BMW.The new printer line, called HP Jet Fusion 3D Printing Solution, “revolutionizes design, prototyping and manufacturing, and for the first time, delivers superior quality physical parts up to 10 times faster and at half the cost of current 3D print systems,” HP said in its press release.HP will compete with 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), the two largest providers of 3D printers, among others.HP is offering two 3D printers. They are the HP Jet Fusion 3D 3200 printer, designed for prototyping, and the Jet Fusion 3D 4200 printer, designed for prototyping and short-run manufacturing needs. Pricing on the 4200 model starts at $155,000 and will be delivered in late 2016. Pricing on the 3200 model starts at $130,000, with deliveries in 2017, HP said.Besides Autodesk, software partners include  Materialise (MTLS) and Siemens. Besides Nike, BMW and Proto Labs, co-development partners and strategic partners also include Jabil  Circuit (JBL), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Shapeways.HP stock fell in the stock market today, to 11.53. HP stock has been below its 50-day line most of this month. 3D Systems stock, though, rose nearly 1% Tuesday, and Stratasys stock rose nearly 2%.

101,ADSK,"Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) and Starbucks (SBUX) were all near buy points ahead of their most recent quarterly reports, but have since dropped from those levels after issuing weak results. On the other hand, Facebook (FB) and Amazon (AMZN) had formed bases and were propelled higher by their strong earnings.Here's a look at four stocks that are trading near or in buy range ahead of their quarterly reports later this week: Applied Materials (AMAT), Autodesk (ADSK), Eight By Eight (EGHT) and Campbell Soup (CPB).You may not think of Campbell Soup when you think of top stocks, but the maker of packaged food has a high IBD Composite Rating of 92 out of 99. The company is expected to report Friday an earnings increase of 3%, a big slowdown from two quarters in a row of roughly 30% bottom-line growth. Revenue is expected to fall a fraction.Campbell breached support at the 50-day line Wednesday in above-average volume but was able to finish the session just above the line. Shares are now about 5% below their all-time high reached as the stock cleared a flat base buy point of 65.58. The stock is trading 3% below that pivot.Eight By Eight is a telecom services firm with an 85 Composite Rating. Earnings are expected to drop 60% while revenue climbs 25% when it reports Thursday.Shares tried to break out of a cup-with-handle base with a 12.05 buy point Wednesday, but closed the session below that level. The stock is 13% below its January peak.Applied Materials is expected to see earnings grow 10% on a fractional sales decline. The chip equipment maker, which reports Thursday, has a Composite Rating of 66.Shares are trading in buy range from a cup base the stock initially cleared in March. The stock ran up as much as 11% in the following weeks, but has since pulled back about 8% from its high reached one month ago.And computer software firm Autodesk is expected to swing to a loss of 14 cents a share on a 21% decline in revenue when it reports Thursday. The company has a 49 Composite Rating.Shares recently breached support at the 50-day line and are dipping back below buy range from a cup-with-handle base. The stock is now about 12% below its December peak.

102,ADSK,"The entry of HP (HPQ) into the 3D printer market is a disruptive force against 3D Systems (DDD) and Stratasys (SSYS), but it's not an overwhelming slam, as the two market leaders have time to react, say analysts.HP's entry is a ""negative"" for 3D Systems and Stratasys, but it's ""been expected and the real competitive impact could take years to develop,” wrote Pacific Crest Securities analyst Weston Twigg in a research note late Tuesday.The long-awaited entry of HP into the 3D printer market began Tuesday, with partners that include Nike (NKE), Autodesk (ADSK), ProtoLabs (PRLB) and Materialise (MTLS). HP said the printers are 10 times faster and half the cost of current 3D printing systems. HP is offering two 3D printers, one for prototyping and the other for prototyping and short-run manufacturing needs.HP has vast resources and a strong desire to turn 3D printing into a growth business, Twigg wrote. “The technology could be disruptive, and customers have shown a high desire to partner with HP on the development of the printer,” he said.The HP announcement is a “modest positive” for Materialise, a 3D printer maker that is partnering with HP on software and other areas, Twigg said. It’s also a modest positive for ProtoLabs, which focuses on the commercial market and offers industrial 3D printing as a service.Though not a direct competitor, Proto Labs is a close peer to 3D Systems and Stratasys and can quickly adopt HP printers if it makes economic sense, as Proto Labs is building out its additive manufacturing service bureaus.Sales of 3D printers totaled $5 billion last year, according to HP. It expects to ship and recognize 3D printing revenue by the Oct. 31 end of its fiscal 2016,  and ramp up the business in fiscal 2017. But HP does not expect 3D printing revenue to make a material revenue contribution in either year, wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani in a research note.HP’s new lineup poses a threat to 3D Systems and Stratasys in price and speed, but the threat is not overwhelming, said Piper Jaffray analyst Troy Jensen.“We do believe the aggressive pricing HP is promoting could cause pipelines to shrink over the next couple quarters as customers review HP’s printing capabilities,” Jensen wrote in a report. But select printers from 3D Systems and Stratasys “are better in certain applications,” he said.3D printing technology is being increasingly embraced by corporations, governments and universities. The market for 3D printers, including supplies, will grow 33% to $7.3 billion and will approach $10 billion in 2017, according to Wohlers Associates, which provides technical, market and strategic analysis on the 3D printer market.HP stock fell a fraction on Tuesday but was up a fraction in afternoon trading in the stock market today, near 11.50. HP stock has been below its 50-day line most of this month. 3D Systems stock, up nearly 1% Tuesday, was down more than 3% Wednesday afternoon, and. Stratasys stock, up nearly 2% on Tuesday, was down 3%.

103,ADSK,"No. 1 chipmaker Intel (INTC) will cut 12,000 jobs by mid-2017, and that will help kick off a ""recession"" with nearly 400,000 tech positions to be cut this year, a Global Equities Research analyst predicted Tuesday.Late Tuesday, Intel added another domino to the layoff train, joining VMware (VMW), Yahoo (YHOO), BlackBerry (BBRY), Autodesk (ADSK) and NetApp (NTAP), which recently announced plans to collectively lay off 5,125 employees.Intel's 12,000-cut represents 11% of its global workforce. Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry says it's just a drop in a 369,000 bucket (his prediction for tech layoffs that will be announced this year) and argued against a Federal Reserve rate increase amid what he calls a likely oncoming recession.On Wednesday, Wall Street was largely split on Intel's mixed Q1, with at least five analysts still rating Intel stock a buy. At least two analysts cut their price targets, however, and another downgraded Intel stock.In early afternoon trading on the stock market today, Intel stock was up 1.5%, near 32. But shares are down 8% for the year vs. a 3% decline in IBD's 39-company Electronic-Semiconductor Manufacturing industry group.For Q1 ended April 2, Intel reported $13.7 billion in sales and 54 cents earnings per share, up a respective 7% and 20% year over year. The consensus of 45 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected $13.8 billion and 48 cents.PC chip sales rose 2%, but that trailed stronger growth in data center, Internet of Things and security -- up a respective 9%, 22% and 12%. Nonvolatile memory chip sales fell 6%.Current-quarter sales guidance for $13.5 billion, plus or minus $500 million, lagged the consensus for $14.2 billion. Intel's April quarter benefited from an extra week.Intel's transition from a PC-oriented company will be ""messy,"" Credit Suisse analyst John Pitzer wrote in a research report. Late Tuesday, CEO Brian Krzanich said the layoffs would allow Intel to save $750 million in the first year and $1.4 billion per year starting by mid-2017, so that the company can ""intensify"" investments in key growth areas.Pitzer reiterated an outperform rating and a 40 price target on Intel stock.PCs represented 55% of Intel's Q1 sales vs. 58% a year earlier. In 2011, the client computing group accounted for 65% of Intel's revenue. The company is aiming to trim that to 50%, which Semiconductors Advisers President Robert Maire calls a ""milestone.""""Intel is certainly trying, perhaps with varying degrees of success, to get revenue from many other markets,"" Maire wrote in a research report. ""While individually, none hold a candle to the PC market, collectively they have been a great offset.""Unlike other companies, Intel isn't in the red while transitioning, Maire noted. He likened the restructuring -- which includes transitioning CFO Stacy Smith into a role leading sales, manufacturing and operations -- to teaching an elephant to dance.The elephant theme was popular Wednesday. ""Who says elephants can't dance?"" Summit Research analyst Srini Sundararajan queried in a report. Sundararajan reiterated his buy rating and 37 price target on Intel stock.""Keeping (2016) capital expenditures the same ($9.5 billion at the midpoint) while proceeding with a layoff confirms that Intel is trying to be more nimble and refocusing itself away from the PC,"" he wrote in a report.During Q2, Intel will recognize a $1.2 billion restructuring charge. But the second half of 2016 looks promising, Sundararajan said. Intel dropped full-year guidance to mid-single-digit growth vs. earlier views for mid- to high-single-digit growth.Sundararajan says this suggests a big second-half-year recovery, with revenue up 13%.

149,ADSK,"Accounting benefits for phone companies have made some telecom investors scratch their heads, and upcoming revenue-recognition changes for software companies could be the next conundrum.The good news for technology stock investors is that the accounting changes for software companies have been ""effectively delayed until 2018,"" says a Citigroup report. The bad news is that there's a long list of companies that would be impacted.They include: Adobe Systems (ADBE), security firm Palo Alto Networks (PANW), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce.com (CRM) and Splunk (SPLK).Industry ""deliberations"" over the new software revenue accounting standards will heat up in Fall, 2015, says Citigroup analyst Walter Pritchard in a report. ""Proposed changes are significant and make revenue treatment less conservative,"" he said.Accounting standards bodies FASB and IASB proposed the changes in international revenue accounting in 2014.Pritchard notes that the accounting changes come just as the industry is shifting toward cloud computing's software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model and subscription-based revenue, rather than one-time licensing fees.""We see the non-SaaS subscription contracts such as those employed by Adobe, Autodesk (ADSK), CA, Guidewire Software (GWRE), Jive Software (JIVE), Microsoft and Splunk to be most at risk to change, with revenue timing accelerated.""The new accounting rules ""could provide more of an incentive for companies to change contract terms in order to accelerate revenue and achieve quarterly targets, something that current rules make more difficult. Beyond subscription revenue treatment, we also see other proposed changes that could drive more inconsistent allocation of revenue between product (license-appliances) and ratable sources (maintenance support) as well as separation of hosting arrangements from software in certain SaaS arrangements,"" Pritchard said.The accounting changes, Pritchard speculates, could ""make it difficult to compare reported revenue between native SaaS companies (like Salesforce) and flexible SaaS companies (like Oracle and SAP).""In a separate report, Morgan Stanley on Thursday said more than 50 ""pension heavy"" companies have recently changed their GAAP accounting, thereby redefining pension costs, and sometimes eliminating pension costs from adjusted earnings. They include Boeing (BA), FedEx (FDX), Honeywell (HON) and AT&T (T).Telecom companies have roiled earnings by introducing wireless financing plans for mobile phones. The EIP (equipment installment plans) pull forward earnings by booking equipment revenue on the date of sale. T-Mobile's (TMUS) aggressive Uncarrier promotions started the EIP trend, and AT&T followed. Sprint (S) more recently has introduced leasing plans that boost EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization).Follow Reinhardt Krause on Twitter: @IBD_RKrause.

"
155,ADSK,"Does Mom have no luck with growing flowers and herbs? The $69 Miracle-Gro AeroGarden 3SL, from AeroGrow International, can turn her Thumb of Doom into a Green Thumb.
"
156,ADSK,"The AeroGarden is a hydroponic grow tank — it uses nutrient-enriched water instead of soil as the growing medium. An integrated grow light provides illumination at just the right color for maximum growth. The 3SL accommodates three seed pods, and our test unit had the Gourmet Herb pod.
"
157,ADSK,"There are also pods for flowers, peppers and other vegetables. The AeroGarden's water pump makes a slight noise, like that of an aquarium, and the grow light is on for 16 hours a day, so it needs to be placed where it won't annoy the family.
"
158,ADSK,"And in a few months, and with almost no care, Mom can have fresh basil, dill and parsley.
"
159,ADSK," AM/FM radios are passe nowadays. Thousands of specialized music and talk stations are on the Internet — and the $179 Grace Digital Mondo Internet Radio can receive them all.
"
160,ADSK,"It connects to the Web through your network and Wi-Fi and features a 3.5-inch color LCD screen that presents station information and time of day.
"

"
162,ADSK," Moms need that first cup of coffee or tea in the morning to bravely face the day. Keurig's (GMCR) K-Cup coffee machines have become enormously popular over the past few years. But the new 2.0 model will work only with Keurig-licensed K-cups, leaving out a panoply of great coffee.
"
163,ADSK,"The $140 iCoffee Opus Coffee Brewer, from Remington Designs, promises to let you brew a better cup of coffee using a patented SpinBrew technology.
"
164,ADSK,"It also lets you use any K-cup coffee pod, as well pods that use RealCup or OneCup technology.
"
165,ADSK,"Our taste buds weren't sophisticated enough to make a value judgment on which machine made better coffee, but we liked the Opus' 75-ounce water reservoir and the rotary dial that lets you easily select cup sizes up to 12 ounces.
"
166,ADSK,"And while Keurig does license a large selection of coffee and vendors, you simply can't use plenty of terrific coffee in the new Keurig 2.0 brewers without resorting to a work-around to disable the 2.0 sensing system.
"
167,ADSK," Most moms would probably not be very excited getting an appliance as a Mother's Day present. But the Neato Robotics Botvac 85 might be an exception.
"
168,ADSK,"While a number of robotic vacuum cleaners are on the market, the Botvac does things differently.
"
169,ADSK,"Rather than wander around in a random pattern, the Botvac scans and maps the room and computes the most efficient path to take while avoiding furniture and other obstacles. And magnetic strips keep the Botvac in the area Mom wants cleaned.

A free design application for the Apple (AAPL) iPad or PC is available for downloading, as are numerous projects.
"
173,ADSK,"Mom can even make 3D projects using Autodesk (ADSK) 123Design, and hundreds of project how-tos are downloadable so she can put the Cricut Explore Air to immediate use.

The gain left the stock thoroughly extended after a rebound from 10-week support.

279,ADSK,"To make vital information pop out in the widening ocean of Big Data, organizations must adopt the right tools and mindset. So says Phil Simon, author of  ""The Visual Organization."" He quotes Henry David Thoreau to make his point: ""It's not what you look at that matters; it's what you see.""Tips on making key info relevant:• Embrace tech. Business leaders must use interactive applications that highlight crucial discoveries. Pie charts can still tell a story, said Simon, but the best organizations ""understand that contemporary data-visualization tools allow for a high degree of interactivity, motion and animation.""Technology can lead to unexpected statistical conclusions. ""If at all possible, try to create data visualizations with embedded interactivity,"" Simon told IBD. ""These types of tools allow end users to easily and quickly ask and answer questions. In the end, better business decisions are likely to result.""• See all numbers. Don't neglect small data such as lists of sales, customers, employees and products internally and in presentations.• Exercise patience. With more sources of information than ever and more ways to analyze it, decoding data can seem overwhelming, said Bill Franks, author of  ""Taming the Big Data Tidal Wave.""""The potential is so large that organizations must push through the initial learning curve,"" said Franks, who is also chief analytics officer for software giant Teradata (TDC) . ""It has always taken time to integrate new data and new analytics into business processes.""So begin, experiment and shape the data to your firm's needs.• Start small. Some organizations make the mistake of building huge systems to gather masses of data before they get started, says Franks .""Capture just enough to prove or disprove what you're trying to do,"" he suggested. ""Once proved, move forward with the bigger effort.""For example, Franks says, you don't need all Web browsing history for all customers for a year to test how the data can improve marketing offers. You need a solid sample of just a few months.• Understand the stakes. Franks contends that you won't find an example where more information made analytics less powerful. ""Some of the highest market-cap companies in the world today, especially in Silicon Valley, have built their business around analytics,"" he said. ""It is possible for traditional organizations to make the transition and become an analytic organization that fully leverages Big Data.""Simon points to companies such as eBay (EBAY), Netflix (NFLX), Autodesk (ADSK), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOGL) embracing visual-data expertise. His take: ""Google in 2014 can do things that in 1998 it couldn't even imagine. In 2018, Google will do things that it can't do today. Recognize that it's a journey, not a sprint.""• Go beyond. Big Data and visualization expand the possible. ""Organizations must re-examine longstanding policies and assumptions about what can be done,"" Franks said. ""It is quite possible that analytics or actions that were not realistic to pursue even a few years ago could be very achievable today.""• Be open. Not everyone has to be a numbers scientist. ""Still,"" said Simon, ""it behooves organizations to remember this quote from Silicon Valley icon Jim Barksdale: 'If we have data, let's look at (them). If all we have are opinions, let's go with mine.'""

303,ADSK,"Autodesk (ADSK  -  Free Report) recently acquired Salem, MA-based Assemble Systems. Although the details of the transaction were not disclosed, it’s likely to be a mixture of cash and stock. Notably, Autodesk was a leading investor in Assemble’s Series A funding in 2017.Assemble’s software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform focuses on Building Information Modelling or BIM, in which Autodesk has keen interest. The platform provides 3D models, 2D drawings and other relevant construction related data.Autodesk will integrate Assemble in its BIM project management platform named BIM 360. The deal not only strengthens the company’s product portfolio but also its customer base. Assemble boasts a strong clientele (174 unique customers) across 1,000 sites, working on 12,700 projects.Moreover, the deal will help Autodesk become a significant provider of automation software in the preconstruction phase of a project. The rapid adoption of automation is expected to lead to better project management that bodes well for the overall construction industry. Autodesk is well positioned to benefit from this trend. Autodesk, Inc. Price and Consensus Autodesk, Inc. Price and Consensus | Autodesk, Inc. Quote BIM 360 Adoption Increases RapidlyThe BIM 360 product has gained significant traction in recent times. The solution is rapidly replacing legacy document management tools as well as preconstruction planning software.In fact, Autodesk expects BIM 360 to encompass the entire construction process from start to finish over the next five years.The strong adoption is expected to boost top-line growth. In the last reported quarter, revenues increased 15.3% year over year to $559.4 million.For the second quarter of fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $595-$605 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $600.7 million, reflecting year-over-year growth of 19.7%.However, net subscription addition will continue to get impacted due to consolidation of subscriptions, owing to upgrade to Collections and new packaging for BIM 360.Nevertheless, Autodesk is benefiting from solid growth in product subscriptions and surging maintenance-to-subscription program. In fact, continuing investments in digital infrastructure like e-store and EBA programs are positive.Zacks Rank & Other Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Autodesk has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Adobe (ADBE  -  Free Report), Verint (VRNT  -  Free Report) and Intuit (INTU  -  Free Report) are stocks worth considering in the same sector. While Adobe and Verint sport Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), Intuit has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Long term earnings growth rate for Adobe, Verint and Intuit is currently pegged at 16.2%, 10% and 16.2%, respectively.The Hottest Tech Mega-Trend of AllLast year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion.

304,ADSK,"Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal first-quarter 2019 results on May 24.In the last reported quarter, the company reported non-GAAP loss of 9 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. The figure was also better than the company’s guided range of a loss of 10-14 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 21.7%.Revenues of $553.8 million beat the consensus mark of $545.3 million and increased nearly 15.7% year over year. The figure surpassed the guided range of $537-$547 million.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsAutodesk’s results are expected to be driven by its core business, which comprises maintenance, product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions.Autodesk is gaining from robust growth in product subscription. Autodesk’s broad product portfolio continues to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. The company’s growing maintenance to subscription program coupled with increasing adoption of Collections is a tailwind.Moreover, increasing spend by customers of Collections is leading to an increase in the company’s average recurring revenues (ARR) and average revenue per subscriptions (ARPS).For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for ARR is $2.12 billion, up 21.7% from the reported number in the year-ago quarter.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure. The company’s e-store generated nearly 20% of products subscription sales in the last reported quarter. Moreover, half of AutoCAD LT subscriptions in the United States came through the e-store.Although cloud remains a very small contributor to Autodesk’s total business, growing momentum of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is a positive.However, churn rate for maintenance subscribers is expected to remain high, given the rise in cost of staying on a maintenance plan.Management expects billings growth in the quarter to be impacted by tough year-over-year comparison as the company recorded strong billings in the first quarter of fiscal 2018.Further, cash flow in the quarter will be negatively impacted by the company’s restructuring activity and exit tax related to the shift of European operations center to Dublin from Switzerland.Autodesk, Inc.

Earnings per share (EPS) increased 4.3% from the year-ago quarter but plunged 52.7% sequentially.The year-over-year growth in EPS can be attributed to higher revenues (10 cents contribution), improving gross margin trajectory, pre-tax margin expansion (four cents contribution) and aggressive share buyback (five cents contribution).This was partially offset by higher tax rate (couple of cents negative impact) and headwinds related to initiatives in repositioning IBM’s business (five cents negative impact).Revenues of $19.07 billion outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $18.72 billion and climbed 5.1% on a year-over-year basis.

Shares have lost about 7.4% in that time frame.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is ADSK due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.Recent EarningsAutodesk incurred fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP loss of 9 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 12 cents. The figure was also better than the company’s guided range of a loss of 10-14 cents per share.Revenues of $553.8 million beat the consensus mark of $545.3 million and increased nearly 15.7% year over year. The figure surpassed the guided range of $537-$547 million.Moreover, deferred revenues increased 9% to $1.96 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model.

Total subscriptions increased approximately 127K from the prior quarter to 3.72 million.Subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased approximately 371K from the last quarter to 2.27 million backed by new product subscriptions as well as maintenance to subscription or M2S program which recorded 168K subscriptions.Total annualized recurring revenues (ARR) were $2.05 billion, up 25% from the year-ago quarter, driven by product subscription and Enterprise Business Agreement (EBA) subscriptions.Subscription plan ARR of $1.18 billion surged 106% year over year and 105% on a constant currency (cc) basis. However, maintenance plan ARR of $879 million declined 18% from the year-ago quarter and 17% at cc.Autodesk is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure.

This was partially offset by higher restructuring charges and other facility exit costs, which expanded 1510 bps from the year-ago quarter to 17%.Non-GAAP operating expenses as a percentage of revenues declined 1080 bps to 91.4%.The company reported non-GAAP operating loss of $17.5 million in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter’s operating loss of $81.5 million.Balance SheetAutodesk exited the quarter with total cash and cash equivalents (including marketable securities) of $1.32 billion compared with $1.45 billion as of Oct 31, 2017.As of Jan 31, 2018, cash from operating activities was $0.9 million compared with $169.7 million in the year-ago period.The company repurchased 2.4 million shares in the quarter.OutlookPer the company’s new revenue recognition standard, Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, for first-quarter fiscal 2019, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $550-$560 million.

307,ADSK,"Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2019 earnings on May 31.In the trailing four quarters, Marvell’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate each time, with an average positive surprise of 6.9%. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a positive earnings surprise of 3.2%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderMarvell is a fabless designer, developer and marketer of analog, mixed-signal and digital signal processing integrated circuits. We believe strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products and acquisition synergies will act as catalysts. The company’s current restructuring initiative will help it improve its cloud infrastructure and applications, which is anticipated to drive the top and bottom lines.Notably, Marvell, is also expected to keep on benefiting from the growing demand for SSD products. The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data.The company’s storage revenues contributed to over 50% of total revenues in fiscal 2018. Marvell’s recent launch of “NVM Express (NVMe)-based chipset solutions” is expected to meet new-age data center related SSD needs, which will be a further positive.Additionally, during the soon-to-be reported quarter, the company also announced that it is integrating the first-of-its-kind Secure Automotive Ethernet Switch into NVIDIA (NVDA  -  Free Report) DRIVE Pegasus Platform that will aid in level 5 autonomy of self-driving cars. We believe these initiatives will be beneficial for the company’s financials going ahead.Nonetheless, intensifying competition in the High Definition (HD) storage drive market makes us increasingly cautious about the stock’s growth prospects.Marvell Technology Group Ltd.

309,ADSK,"Investors in Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the May 25, 2018 $138.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Autodesk shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Autodesk is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Top 27% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while one analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 5 cents per share to 3 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Autodesk right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options? Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

Increasing demand for Point-of-Sale (POS) software and Payment-as-a Service technologies is a key catalyst.VeriFone’s strong product portfolio which includes the likes of Carbon 8 and Engage are driving growth in the global market, particularly in Latin America and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA).The company’s mPOS device gained traction within a short span of time. In the quarter, VeriFone announced implementation of Mastercard’s M/Chip Fast technology across its payment solutions to enable faster checkout for EMV transactions. The company also extended global partnership with Alipay, which enables select Lacoste U.S. stores to accept Alipay.However, management anticipates revenues in the Asia Pacific region to decline year over year. This is due to tough year-over-year comparison as in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the company benefitted largely from sudden robust demand in India, courtesy of demonetization.Additionally, the company’s divestitures of Petro Media and the Taxi businesses are expected to dent the top line in North America.Nonetheless, the divestitures of the company’s non-core business are likely to have a positive impact on margins. Verifone Systems, Inc.

313,ADSK,"Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL  -  Free Report) is set to report fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 earnings results on Mar 8. The question lingering in investors’ minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise or not in the quarter.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise history. Over the trailing four quarters, its results surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate each time, with an average positive surprise of 10.1%. So, let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.What to Expect?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at 31 cents, reflecting a massive year-over-year increase of 40.9%. Further, analysts polled by Zacks anticipate revenues of $611.7 million, up roughly 7% from the year-ago quarter.We believe strong demand for Marvell’s 4G LTE products and acquisition synergies will act as catalysts. The company’s current restructuring initiative will help it improve its cloud infrastructure and applications, which is anticipated to drive the top and bottom lines.Factors to ConsiderMarvell is a promising player in the solid state drive (SSD) controllers market. Over the coming years, the company expects an increasing number of PCs/servers to use the flash-based solid state technology for storage. The storage market is witnessing a steady increase in demand, given fast-growing data volume, especially the exponential growth in unstructured data. NAND (non-volatile storage technology) demand is expected to remain very strong in 2018 as well. SSD demand will also rise and might even surpass the manufacturing capacity, leading to periodic shortage and higher pricing in the near term.Marvell has been benefiting from this growing demand for SSD products. Notably, the company’s storage revenues is increasing sequentially in the last two quarters, mainly driven by  higher-than-anticipated demand at the SSD segments, along with elevated demand from enterprise. We believe Marvell’s fiscal fourth-quarter top and bottom-line results will benefit from this uptick in demand.What the Zacks Model Unveils?Our proven model does not conclusively show that Marvell is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Marvell carries a Zacks Rank #3, which increases the predictive power of ESP, but an ESP of -0.74% makes surprise prediction difficult.Marvell Technology Group Ltd.

314,ADSK,"VMware Inc (VMW  -  Free Report) is set to release fiscal fourth-quarter 2018 results on Mar 1.In the last quarter, VMware’s non-GAAP earnings of $1.34 per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.27 while increasing 59.5% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues of $1.98 billion also topped the consensus mark of $1.96 billion and increased 11.1% on a year-over-year basis. At the end of the quarter, unearned revenues were $5.6 billion.Year to date, VMware has outperformed the industry. The stock has returned 42% compared with the industry’s gain of 37.3%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors at PlayVMware’s strength in the virtualization and hybrid cloud market is a key growth driver. The company’s top line is likely to be driven by robust performance of its product offerings like NSX, vSphere and vSAN.The introduction of two major offerings, VMware AppDefense and Pivotal Container Service (PKS), in the last reported quarter is also expected to yield positive results.We believe that along with expanding product portfolio, partnerships with the likes of Intel, Samsung, Fujitsu, Pivotal, Alphabet, AWS and Microsoft and continuing enterprise deal wins will remain tailwinds. Vmware is also witnessing strong and balanced growth in all three geographies.In the quarter, the company completed the acquisition of VeloCloud Networks that will enable it to enhance its product offerings and gain more customers.However, heavy spending on R&D may weigh on its margins. Moreover, intensifying competition from Microsoft and Citrix Systems remains a major headwind.Vmware, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Vmware, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Vmware, Inc.

315,ADSK,"Stratasys Ltd. (SSYS  -  Free Report) is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2017 results on Feb 28. In the trailing four quarters, the company topped earnings estimates, delivering an average beat of approximately 117%.Before we discuss the factors likely to influence the forthcoming results, let’s take a look at how the company performed in the last quarter.The company reported mixed results for third-quarter 2017, wherein the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missed the same. Although revenues declined marginally, earnings improved significantly on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year improvement in the bottom line was mainly driven by the company’s consistent focus on reducing operating expenses, partially offset by lower revenues.Let’s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.Factors to ConsiderStratasys, a manufacturer of 3D printers and in-office rapid prototyping (RP) and manufacturing systems, looks well poised on the back of product launches and strategic partnerships. These initiatives are paving the way for the company to excel in the 3D printing industry, which is anticipated to witness CAGR of 25.76% from 2017 to 2023 and reach $32.78 billion.Notably, during the quarter, the company announced that Skorpion Engineering has accelerated the development of prototypes of luxury cars by around 50% with the help of Stratasys’ additive technology solutions. The company also announced the launch of BioMimics for 3D printing of medical models. This will address the needs of hospitals, manufacturers of medical devices as well as researchers.The company also entered into a collaboration with e-Xstream Engineering, per which the latter will be delivering “process modeling and structural analysis numerical tools” to Stratasys, which will in turn be beneficial for the betterment of the company’s solutions and hence the top line.The company’s strategic partnerships with Schneider Electric, The Boeing Co., Ford Motor Co., Siemens, Boom Supersonic and United Launch Alliance have expanded its geographic reach and market penetration. Its clientele, which includes the likes of Airbus and Koninklijke Philips N.V, is an additional positive. We believe an increase in its client base to aid fourth-quarter 2017 revenue growth.Furthermore, Stratasys has also taken measures to improve margins. It recorded operating margin of 5.2% in the third quarter compared with 2.1% reported in the year-ago quarter.We believe that the company’s consistent focus on reducing operating expenses will also drive results in the soon-to-be-reported quarter.Stratasys, Ltd.

However, revenues were expected to increase on a year-over-year basis due to strength in the industrial end-market.   Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Analog Devices, Inc.

Moreover, ongoing investments are likely to strengthen product portfolio as well as competitive position, which will boost the top line.We believe that top-line growth is likely to be driven by Analog Devices’ diversified product portfolio and expanding customer base. Moreover, higher contribution from Linear Technology acquisition remains a tailwind.Further, Analog Devices is likely to benefit from increasing demand for autonomous driving solutions. Additionally, continuing demand for high value signal processing & power management applications, software-defined radio solutions and portable applications are anticipated to drive the top line.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Industrial, Automotive, Communication and Consumer segment revenues are currently pegged at $704 million, $231 million, $272 million and $234 million, respectively.What Our Model SuggestsAccording to the Zacks model, a company with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a good chance of beating estimates if it also has a positive Earnings ESP.

317,ADSK,"A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report). Shares have lost about 19.1% in that time frame, underperforming the market.Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.Recent EarningsAutodesk reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP loss of 12 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 13 cents. The figure was within the guided range of a loss of 12–16 cents per share.Revenues of $515.3 million beat the consensus mark of $514.1 million and increased nearly 5.3% year over year. The figure was within the guided range of $505–$515 million.Moreover, deferred revenues increased 15% to $1.76 billion in the quarter, which reflects growing strength of the business model. Total recurring revenue was 92% in the reported quarter, a significant increase from 78% reported in the year-ago quarter.Per Autodesk, restructuring will drive long-term growth by realigning investments in strategic areas like digital infrastructure, facilitating development of core products and increasing spend on construction opportunities.Quarter DetailsRevenues were impacted by a 61.7% year-over-year decline in License revenues (7.7% of total revenue), which were $39.8 million in the quarter.Maintenance revenues (47.4% of total revenue) also declined 10.5% from the year-ago quarter to $244.4 million, primarily due to lower subscriptions.However, the company’s business model transition continues to be on track.

In the quarter, the company witnessed a substantial increase in deals valued at over $1 million with significant contribution from EBAs. Notably, Autodesk won large EBA renewals this quarter from two engineering companies, each of which increased their annual contract value by more than 50%.Cloud subscription additions were impressive driven by robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools. The company’s focus to fast integrate new technology into Fusion 360, advancement of BIM 360 platform and the growth of its Forge platform are positives.Total annualized recurring revenues (ARR) were $1.90 billion, up 24% from the year-ago quarter and 25% on a constant currency (cc) basis.

The company now expects revenues in the range of $2.040-$2.050 billion (mid-point $2.045 billion) compared with the prior guidance of $2.030–$2.040 billion (mid-point $2.040).

318,ADSK,"On Dec 6, we issued an updated research report on Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report).The company recently reported better-than-expected fiscal third-quarter 2018 results. The top- as well as the bottom line surpassed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and improved significantly year over year.Notably, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 19.2%.Buoyed by the encouraging third-quarter results, Autodesk revised its full-year revenue and EPS expectations.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Autodesk moved upward following the quarterly results and impressive outlook, which reflects the optimistic view of analysts. In the past 30 days, earnings estimates for the fourth quarter have improved from a loss of 13 cents to loss of 12 cents. The projection is also better than the year ago quarter’s loss of 28 cents.Notably, shares of Autodesk have gained 44.5% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry’s 31.8% rally.Increasing Product SubscriptionsAutodesk’s business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is helping the company to boost subscriptions. We note that Autodesk’s broad product portfolio generates new customers in both domestic and overseas markets.Subscription revenues soared 105.6% year over year driven by strong product subscriptions. The company’s maintenance to subscription (M2S) program recorded 110K subscriptions. New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and contributed a significant portion of subscription additions.Cloud subscription additions were impressive driven by robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools.

Management noted on the last conference call that Autodesk signed a $5 million BIM 360 deal with one of Japan’s largest general contractors and a similar deal in EMEA as well.Autodesk, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Autodesk, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Autodesk, Inc. QuoteRestructuring Plans Raise ConcernsAutodesk announced a restructuring plan during its last earnings release. The stock took a beating following the announcement.However, management believes restructuring will drive long-term growth by realigning investments in strategic areas like digital infrastructure, facilitating development of core products and increasing spend on construction opportunities.The company plans to keep spending levels flat this year as well as the next. Autodesk plans to attain this by discontinuing research and development activities that are “not aligned with reimagining construction, manufacturing and production.”Moreover, Autodesk sites that are no more associated with the company’s global location and talent acquisition strategy will be closed.However, a pretax charge of $135-$149 million owing to the restructuring plans is anticipated. Of this, nearly $91-$100 million is expected to be incurred in the fourth quarter and the rest of it in the next fiscal.  We believe this to remain an overhang on the company’s bottom line.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderAutodesk carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector include Intel Corporation (INTC  -  Free Report), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA  -  Free Report), all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

320,ADSK,"The Nasdaq Composite Index staged a stunning comeback, recouping all losses incurred early last month when the index had slipped into a correction territory. In fact, it hit a record high for the second consecutive session and has been outperforming major indices, which are yet to fully recover from February’s selloff, by a wide margin from a year-to-date look.   The strength in the technology sector, which accounts for nearly half of the index, helped Nasdaq surge on a gain of 8.3% this year compared with gains of 1.4% for the Dow Jones and 3.2% for the S&P 500 (read: Can Tech ETFs Regain Investors' Love After Selloff Snub?).What’s Driving Tech?The sharp gains came from the astounding surge in FAANG stocks and other high-performance technology names. The emergence of cutting-edge technology such as big data, Internet of Things, autonomous cars, gaming, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality devices, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrencies, and other advanced information technologies as well as strong corporate earnings are acting as key catalysts.The twin tailwinds of Trump’s tax reform plan and a rising interest rate scenario are also pushing stocks higher. This is because tech titans hoard huge cash overseas and are poised to benefit the most from the reduced tax rates. Additionally, most of the tech companies are sitting on a huge cash pile and are in a position to increase payouts to shareholders. The cash reserves will ensure that these companies do not face any financial trouble in a rising interest rate environment.Adding to the strength is a pickup in the economy and better job prospects that are boosting economically-sensitive growth sectors like technology, which perform typically well in a maturing economic cycle. With the global economy gathering momentum, technology companies are likely to outperform and are less susceptible to interest rates or deregulation.If these weren’t enough, waves of consolidation among semiconductor manufacturers are driving tech stocks to new highs (read: 5 ETF Ways to Tap Hot Semiconductor Stocks).As a result, PowerShares QQQ (QQQ  -  Free Report), which serves as a proxy for the index, has climbed nearly 12% so far this year. Let’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of QQQ.QQQ in FocusThis ETF provides exposure to 104 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq-100 Index. Information technology accounts for 61.1% of the assets, while consumer discretionary takes a 22.2% share. QQQ is one of the largest and the most popular ETFs in the large-cap space with AUM of $65.6 billion and average daily volume of around 35.3 million shares.

326,ADSK,"Investors in Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the December 1, 2017 $134 Put had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options todayWhat is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Autodesk shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Autodesk is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer - Software industry that ranks in the Bottom 34% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analyst has increased/decreased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate has narrowed from a loss of 13 cents per share to a loss of 12 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Autodesk right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Often times, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Each week, our very own Dave Bartosiak gives his top options trades.

A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP  and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen.The combination of VMware’s Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +0.79% makes us very confident in looking for an earnings beat this quarter.

The company continues to benefit from its strength in the virtualization and hybrid cloud market.Moreover, strategic partnerships with the likes of Intel (INTC  -  Free Report), Samsung, Fujitsu, Pivotal, Google, and Microsoft will bolster its presence in hybrid cloud computing as well as the fast growing Internet of Things (IoT) market.  VMWare recently announced a partnership with SAP to speed up enterprise IoT implementations.Moreover, frequent contract wins and robust international sales are expected to drive results.Further, acquisitions such as that of Wavefront will boost VMware’s cross-cloud service providing abilities. Additionally, the planned divestiture of the vCloud Air will aid the company’s focus on the core business.  However, sluggish IT spending as well as intensifying competition remain the major headwinds in the near term.Stocks to ConsiderHere are some stocks you may want to consider as our model shows that theyhave the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat:Micron Technology Inc (MU  -  Free Report) has an Earnings ESP of +1.60% and a Zacks Rank #1.

329,ADSK,"Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) is set to report fiscal third-quarter 2018 results on Nov 28.In fiscal second-quarter 2018, the company reported non-GAAP loss of 11 cents per share, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 15 cents. The figure was also much narrower than the guided range of a loss of 14–18 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It has beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 23.52%.Revenues of $501.8 million beat the consensus mark of $494.8 million but fell nearly 8.9% year over year. The figure was better than the guided range of $488–$500 million.Management continues to emphasize on the fact that revenues will be negatively impacted by the business model transition from “upfront” to “ratably” as well as lower initial purchase price of new offerings.Notably, Autodesk’s shares have gained 72.6%, substantially outperforming the 35.8% rally of the industry it belongs to. We believe the company’s broad product portfolio and accelerating subscription base to sustain the share price momentum going ahead.Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Key FactorsAutodesk’s business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to boost subscriptions and deferred revenues. The marketing and promotional activities undertaken by the company are anticipated to sustain its growing subscription base.We note that Autodesk’s broad product portfolio generates new customers in both domestic and overseas markets as evident from the year-over-year triple digit growth in product subscriptions in major geographies including emerging countries.Strong adoption of products is driving subscription revenues for the company. In the last reported quarter, the company’s maintenance to subscription or M2S program recorded 63K subscriptions. New customers represented about 30% of the mix in the quarter and continue to contribute a significant portion of product subscription additions.Moreover, robust performance of BIM 360 and Fusion tools is the reason behind the continuous addition to cloud subscription.However, although the company plans to keep spending unchanged over the next one year, it remains concerned about increasing foreign exchange headwinds, which might weigh heavily on its expenses.Stiff competition in the cloud-computing domain from the likes of Amazon (AMZN  -  Free Report), Microsoft (MSFT  -  Free Report) and Adobe Systems (ADBE  -  Free Report) also remain headwinds.Autodesk, Inc.

330,ADSK,"Share price of ANSYS Inc. (ANSS  -  Free Report) rallied to a new 52-week high of $132.07, eventually closing a bit lower at $132.01 on Sep 12. The outperformance can be attributed to the company’s expanding product portfolio and consistent execution, which are driving top-line growth and profitability.We note that ANSYS has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in all of the trailing four quarters with an average positive surprise of 5.02%.Last quarter, earnings increased 6.5% year over year to 99 cents on revenues of $264.4 million, up 13% at constant currency. ANSYS also raised its fiscal 2017 guidance.Moreover, the stock has returned 42.7% year to date, substantially outperforming the industry it belongs to. ANSYS has a market cap of $10.89 billion.Currently, ANSYS holds a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key FactorsANSYS is a dominant player in the high-end design simulation software market and its expanding portfolio has been a key catalyst. The company recently unveiled ANSYS Discovery Live that supports fluids, structural and thermal simulation applications. ANSYS, Inc. Revenue (TTM)  ANSYS, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | ANSYS, Inc. QuoteThe software enables engineers to experiment with design ideas and see instant feedback. Notably, the combination of NVIDIA’s (NVDA  -  Free Report) graphic processing units (GPUs) and ANSYS Discovery Live simulation software makes result calculations a thousand times faster compared with traditional methods.Moreover, acquisitions like Computational Engineering International (CEI), SpaceClaim, Reaction Design and Evolutionary Engineering have expanded the company’s expertise in processing and analysis of simulation data, 3D modelling, chemistry simulation and cloud-based composite analysis and optimization technology.These have eventually expanded ANSYS’s total addressable market (TAM). The company can now address the needs of diverse industries like IoT, next-gen 5G product designs, autonomous vehicle, mobile products as well as high-performance chips for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Moreover, growing demand for energy efficient products is also a key catalyst.Additionally, collaborations with leading vendors like Autodesk (ADSK  -  Free Report), Synopsys (SNPS  -  Free Report) and NVIDIA are expected to drive demand for the company’s products.However, declining perpetual license revenues will hurt top-line growth at least in the near term. Moreover, weakness in Europe and adverse foreign currency exchange rates are other major concerns.Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 has been steady at $3.86 and $4.14 over the last 30 days.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone!It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

331,ADSK,"We expect Autodesk Inc. (ADSK  -  Free Report) to beat expectations when it reports fiscal second-quarter 2018 results on Aug 24.Last quarter, the company reported non GAAP loss of 16 cents, wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of 10 cents, but much narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 22 cents and management’s guided range of a loss of 21-27 cents per share.Notably, the company has a positive earnings surprise track record. It has beaten estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average positive surprise of 51.47%.Revenues of $485.7 million fell nearly 5.1% year over year but came ahead of the consensus mark of $473 million and the guided range of $460–$480 million. Management continues to emphasize that revenues will be impacted by the company’s business model transition from “upfront” to “ratably”.Notably, Autodesk’s shares have gained 46.7%, substantially outperforming the 20.7% rally of the industry it belongs to. We believe the company’s broad product portfolio and accelerating subscription base to sustain the share price momentum going ahead.       Let's see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Why a Likely Positive Surprise? Our proven model shows that Autodesk is likely to beat earnings because it has the right combination of two key ingredients.Zacks ESP: Autodesk currently has an Earnings ESP of +17.39%. A favorable Earnings ESP serves as a meaningful and leading indicator of a likely positive earnings surprise. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Autodesk currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It should be noted that stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 have a significantly higher chance of beating earnings. Conversely, stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) should never be considered going into an earnings announcement.The combination of Autodesk’s Zacks Rank #3 and Earnings ESP of +17.39% makes us confident in looking for an earnings beat.Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Autodesk, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | Autodesk, Inc. QuoteWhat's Driving the Better-than-Expected Earnings?Autodesk’s business transition from licenses to cloud-based services is expected to benefit it by boosting subscriptions and deferred revenues. Additionally, marketing and promotional initiatives taken up by the company have accelerated its subscription base.In the last reported quarter, total subscriptions increased approximately 186,000 from the prior quarter to 3.29 million while subscription plan (product, end-of-life and cloud subscriptions) increased by 233,000 to 1.32 million.In fact, cloud subscriptions in the last reported quarter continued to show strong growth, improving more than four times from the year-ago quarter driven by robust performance from BIM 360 and Fusion tools.Moreover, Autodesk is well positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio. We expect its broad product portfolio to generate new customers in both domestic and overseas markets. Further, the company stated that demand for the core engineering product was strong as evident from 170% year-over-year growth in product subscriptions in the last reported quarter.Notably, the company’s aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing its business. Cost cutting initiatives are also a big positive.Other Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few companies that you may also want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming release:The Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD  -  Free Report) with an Earnings ESP of +1.18% and Zacks Rank #1.
