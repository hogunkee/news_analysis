2,RL,"""Back To The Future"" foresaw an era of video phone calls and personal drones. Now another prediction from the movie series could soon become part of daily life: smart clothing that can self-adjust to its wearer's needs.While an auto-drying jacket like Marty McFly's is some way off, smart clothes are already here. They can heat up, cool down, change color or even size themselves. In fact, the U.S. team at the Winter Olympics in South Korea wore self-heating jackets made by Ralph Lauren (RL).Companies ranging from Nike (NKE) and Under Armour (UAA) to Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are developing smart clothing technology. As apparel makers hunt for tech know-how and tech nerds look for some fashion sense, the clothing trend is stitching together unlikely partners — and could reshape the apparel industry.A partnership between Alphabet's Google and Levi Strauss could be a sign of things to come. They have brought to market the $350 Commuter X, a denim jacket that lets the user control a phone through the use of gestures alone.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseThe coming years will see a variety of ""really wacky partnerships"" between fashion companies and tech specialists, said International Data Corp. analyst Ramon Llamas.""The first time you saw Google and Levi's you probably said to yourself, 'How did this happen?' "" he said in an interview. ""But over time it came to make sense and was a natural fit.""In addition to self-adjusting clothes, smart clothing includes internet-connected clothing. Juniper Research estimated last month that connected clothing is the fastest-growing segment of the wearable technology sector.For now, smartwatches like the Apple (AAPL) watch and activity trackers like the Fitbit (FIT) dominate the overall wearables market. Juniper sees shipments of those devices hitting 137 million this year, with compound annual growth over the next two years projected at 31% for smartwatches and 6% for activity trackers.Meanwhile, Juniper sees 102% compound annual growth in connected clothing, estimating it will be a $1 billion industry in 2020 with 7 million shipments. Just two years later, they will more than quadruple to 30 million shipments.Smart clothes also differ from today's wearables in that they will have longer ranges and more accuracy. They also won't be limited to a small touch point at the wrist.Developers are trying to keep smart clothes practical too. Google and Levi's Commuter X jacket is machine washable and can go in a tumble dryer. But a ""snap tag"" that contains tiny electronics and a battery must first come off.Google is developing a system that weaves technology into the very fabric of clothing as part of its Project Jacquard. Project leader Ivan Poupyrev says Google isn't planning to make its own apparel and instead aims to ""empower existing apparel makers.""Loup Ventures managing partner Doug Clinton believes successful synergies between tech and apparel companies will be a key to success. That will help the smart clothes market be worth several billion dollars in the next few years, he estimates.""I think we are going to see a lot of partnerships like that, and that's what is going to push the market forward,"" he said. ""This combination of design and technology is a really important part of the story.""Perhaps the most famous example of self-adjusting smart clothing on the market is Nike's HyperAdapt shoes, which boast ""Back To The Future""-inspired self-tying laces. Stars such as tennis champion Serena Williams and soccer icon Cristiano Ronaldo promoted the first edition. Initially priced at $720, the highly coveted shoes are being sold on the secondhand market for more than $2,000 per pair.A second version is in the works that will offer upgraded technology at more accessible prices. Nike's vice president for design and special projects, Tinker Hatfield, says the HyperAdapt 2.0 will be a performance basketball sneaker.""We don't really know when it's going to hit the market or be in the NBA, but it will be there for sure,"" he said last September.Microsoft has also explored the technological applications. Researchers previously unveiled a prototype smart scarf that users can heat up using a smartphone app.South Korean electronics giant Samsung has a myriad of offerings, including a golf shirt that can warn wearers of the weather conditions and a solar-powered bag that can charge cellphones.Meanwhile, Under Armour has brought to market shoes that track a runner's data through GPS. Shoes from the Under Armour Hovr line start at $110 and go as high as $140. The company also sells ""athletic recovery sleepwear,"" pajamas that beam infrared radiation onto the wearer's body to boost recovery.And Ralph Lauren looks to use the Winter Olympics publicity as a springboard to launch new smart clothes with smaller battery packs and controls linked to a mobile app. They could arrive on the market as early as this winter.If Ralph Lauren's self-heating jacket is any indication, the new offerings will feature crisscrossing partnerships. The Olympic jacket's conductive ink came from DowDuPont (DWDP). Precision printing company Butler Technologies applied the ink. Apparel maker 99Degrees attached the heating system to the lining. Design and engineering firm Key Tech made the battery pack. Principled Design's ConnexI/O e-textile connector interface linked the battery to the jacket. And Better Team USA made the jackets.That approach can be seen in New York-based Loomia, which started four years ago and makes flexible circuitry that can emit heat and/or light, as well as sense and track data.It has worked with companies such as Google, Singapore-based circuit maker Flex (FLEX), British retailer TopShop and apparel maker VF Corp. A key part of Loomia's business plan is that it is not manufacturing individual pieces of clothing. Instead, it is providing products to commercial partners, such as apparel makers, on a mass scale.Designer Julianna Bass collaborated with Loomia to develop a color-changing textile used in two dresses for her Spring/Summer18 collection. They were showcased on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week.Loomia has also solved one of the great challenges for the technology: creating e-textiles that are machine washable. While the details are secret intellectual property, Loomia's breakthrough comes from the way its textile circuitry is patterned and the fact the fabric itself is a circuit. The custom insulation adds further protection.Over the next year, heated jackets and boots with Loomia's technology will be coming to market. The materials are also seen as being useful for furniture.""There was a three-year process finding the core technology in our lab, finding domestic partners who would be willing to try these processes to scale in the production of these textile circuits, and working through growing pains with our suppliers and manufacturers,"" Loomia CEO Janett Liriano said. ""Now we're at the point where we are getting to market and selling these textile circuits B2B (business-to-business) to brands to integrate into their products.""For mass adoption to occur, consumers will have to overcome a few anxieties. For one, battery-powered clothes, like phones, will carry the risk of exploding. But given the ubiquity of smartphones, wearables, and other personal gadgets, consumers have shown they can live with that risk.Also, smart clothing will not be cheap. Ralph Lauren's self-heating jackets first went on sale for $2,500 and were later auctioned on eBay for $6,000. But consider that wildly successful Canada Goose (GOOS) sells parkas that aren't self-adjusting or laced with circuitry for $1,000.Google's Poupyrev believes smart clothing technology trends make ""ubiquitous connectivity"" an attractive feature for consumers, who might see connected clothing as a practical investment. And Loup's Clinton thinks that a decade from now smart apparel products will be ""almost the standard.""""Over the next few years it will be more experimental, getting consumers comfortable with the idea of having smart apparel,"" Clinton said. ""There's always a bridge where you have to integrate the consumer into the new world. But I think once people see the benefits of the clothes, the demand for them will be pretty significant.""A spokeswoman for Julianna Bass said their color-changing clothes were well received at New York Fashion Week. Demand is expected to grow going forward.""Color-changing offers the ability to extend the life of a garment and allows more flexible identifications,"" said Carolyn Thomas, a spokeswoman for the fashion house.But even before smart clothes catch on with consumers, the path to mass adoption may begin with industry.In the next five years, sectors like health care, pro sports, the military and emergency services like firefighting will adopt intelligent clothes, predicts scientist Pekka Tuomaala. He leads the Smart Clothes 2.0 project at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland. The scientist adds that companies have signaled particular interest in self-heating features.""We human beings tend to be lazy,"" he said. ""If our clothing would be able to help us we would most likely use such products and services.""IDC's Llamas also sees heavy industry putting connected clothes to use. For example, supervisors will be able to track the heart rate of workers and know if a break is necessary.The military is another obvious candidate for such technology. British defense giant BAE Systems has developed an alternative use for e-textiles. Its Broadsword Spine is a power and data network built into clothes using conductive fabrics instead of wires and cables.The technology allows electronic devices to be plugged straight into a vest, jacket or belt. Custom-built connectors hook directly into power and data sources via a USB port. It saves an estimated 40% of weight, a major benefit for infantrymen already loaded down with gear.Circling back to the world of Marty McFly and Doc Brown, Clinton believes the future is bright for smart clothes. He says future inventors will use both the science and the fiction of the past to inspire smart clothing designs.""I think a lot of our movies in the past got the future pretty right. Even with 'Back To The Future,' Nike released self-tying sneakers so that became a reality,"" Clinton said. ""In lots of ways fiction and entertainment inspire entrepreneurs to create the products they think are really cool when they see movies as kids.""As the next generation thinks about what they can build on top of these products, innovation will just compound.""YOU MAY ALSO BE INTERESTED IN:Amazon Vs.

8,RL,"Teenagers' love for streetwear and the 1990s is only growing, and that means good news for a few apparel brands whose heydays happened before those high schoolers were even born.Lest sister-models Gigi and Bella Hadid haven't clued you in, Piper Jaffray's latest semiannual teens survey pegged both Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein as brands that made ""significant upwards moves"" in their top 20 list, with Calvin Klein holding on to its No. 10 spot as the preferred handbag brand for average-income teens, and Tommy Hilfiger remaining popular among teen boys. (Gigi and Bella have endorsement deals with Tommy and Calvin, respectively.)This reads as good news for PVH (PVH), one of the biggest players in the apparel space, and the parent of both '90s sweethearts.Tommy Hilfiger alone makes up 44% of the company's sales. Together with fellow '90s staple Calvin Klein, the two brands account for over 80% of PVH's revenue and 90% of PVH's earnings before interest and taxes, according to the company's latest figures. PVH raked in $8.9 billion in reported revenue in fiscal 2017.Get these newsletters delivered to your inbox & more info about our products & services. Privacy Policy & Terms of UseAnd as Bloomberg reports, Tommy Hilfiger has actively been courting younger shoppers through Hadid, social media and TommyNow, a ""see now, buy now"" offering that makes its latest runway designs available immediately.PVH currently has an exclusive partnership with Macy's (M) in men's sportswear. It's also joined forces in Canada with Hudson's Bay Company, the parent of Saks Fifth Avenue and Lord & Taylor. In North America, Tommy Hilfiger has licensed its womenswear wholesale business to G-III (GIII).PVH closed up 1.5% at 157.95 in the stock market today, nearly back above a 158.06 flat-base buy point. G-III advanced 1% to 38.96, flirting with retaking a 39.04 entry in a double-bottom base. Macy's climbed 0.5% to 29.30, as it works on a flat base with a 31.14 buy point.The Piper Jaffray survey also pointed to ""unprecedented"" momentum for VF (VFC) brand Vans. The shoe line ""continues to find traction across all demographic/socioeconomic groups and categories.""From the fall of 2016, Vans' share of upper-income teens' favor has grown to 16% — a new peak — from 9% and remains No. 2.VF Corp. stock rose 2.4% to 77.92, back above its 50-day line in a flat base.While retaining its monster lead, Nike (NKE) has lost turf over that time, slipping to 42% from 51%. But Vans is increasingly popular with teen girls, and Piper Jaffray notes that Vans ""appears to be taking mindshare from NKE's Converse brand in canvas.""Adidas (ADDYY), another purveyor of throwback footwear fashion, is sitting pretty in third place with gains of its own, now up to 14% from 6% just a year and a half ago.Nike stock fell 0.3%, but found support at its 50-day line in a flat base. Adidas climbed 1.8% to a new high.The nostalgia train isn't picking up everyone. Ralph Lauren (RL) lost its place in the survey's top 10 among upper-income teen boys, a first since Piper Jaffray started issuing the poll in 2002.And the '90s are eating into modern-day brands. In a separate survey, B.

9,RL,"Since going public in March of last year, Canada Goose (GOOS) hasn't disappointed investors yet, beating on both the top and bottom lines each quarter. That trend continued with third-quarter results Thursday morning for the high-end coat maker.But shares are tumbling intraday, with one pro pointing to high expectations overshadowing a solid performance.X Estimates: Per-share earnings of 36 cents on $188 million in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.Results: Canada Goose reported revenue of $209.3 million with earnings per share of 46 cents. No guidance update was provided in the release.Stock: Shares tumbled 16.6% to 31.79 in the stock market today, after hitting a new intraday high of 38.25 on Wednesday.It wasn't immediately clear what was driving the stock lower. Analysts were looking for guidance, but Canada Goose said it will only do so on an annual basis, after the fiscal Q4 report.In trying to make sense of the plummet, Wells Fargo retail analyst Ike Boruchow noted that while the parka maker turned in another consecutive beat, with strong gross margins and continued growth potential, sales were softer than many bulls had hoped and there was ""expectation for a much more material beat, and hope for a raise.""""While results were very strong and fundamentals here remain extremely robust, they simply fell short of the extremely bullish view that most investors had coming into the print,"" he wrote.""That said, there is nothing that gives us pause on our fundamental stance on the name today, and actually today's pullback creates a healthy buying opportunity, in our view, for investors who feel they may have 'missed it' before.""The stock has been on a steady march higher since September, boasting a Relative Strength rating of 98, meaning it has outperformed 98% of all other publicly traded stocks.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Fellow premium fashion name Michael Kors (KORS) topped earnings forecasts Wednesday. Tapestry (TPR) (parent to Coach and Kate Spade) beat views on Tuesday. Ralph Lauren (RL) disappointed on revenue last week.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: These 2 Top Retail Stocks Are Hitting New Highs In Volatile MarketCheck Out These 5 Stocks In This Hot Industry GroupStocks Dive, But S&P 500 Earnings Beating Estimates By Most In YearsInvesting In IPO Stocks: Know The Risk With Snap, Future 'Unicorns'The Next New IPO Gems: Can You Find The Next Google, Facebook, Cisco Or Microsoft?

10,RL,"Fashion house Michael Kors (KORS) defied expectations after reporting an increase in third-quarter earnings early Wednesday and same-store sales that also topped views.X Estimates: A 21% drop in per-share earnings to $1.29, while sales grow 1.6% to $1.38 billion.Consensus Metrix expects Kors same-store sales to fall 6.4% globally, including a 10.9% North America comp slide and 3.3% Europe growth. In constant currency, total same-store sales are seen declining 6.7%.Results: Kors earned $1.77 a share, up 8% vs. a year earlier. Sales climbed 6.5% to $1.44 billion. Global same-store sales fell 3.2%, or 5.2% at constant currency. Retail revenue increased 1.1% to $846.3 million. Wholesale revenue decreased 8.9% to $430.8 million as it reduces inventory in that channel. Licensing revenue grew 12.3% to $48.3 million.""The Michael Kors brand continued to make progress on Runway 2020 initiatives across product innovation, brand engagement and customer experience,"" said Chairman and CEO John Idol in a statement. ""Our innovative fashion luxury product offerings for the holiday season created excitement among consumers. At Jimmy Choo, we continued to deliver glamorous luxury product and engaging brand communications, which helped drive revenue during the quarter.""Outlook: Kors sees fiscal Q4 revenue of $1.11 billion to $1.13 billion, including $110 million to $115 million of incremental Jimmy Choo revenue. Q4 EPS should be 50-55 cents, but that includes a 7-cent dilution due to Jimmy Choo. Analysts expected revenue of $1.13 billion and EPS of 59 cents, but it's not clear if those estimates include Jimmy Choo's impact.Stock: Shares closed up 1% at 66.11 on the stock market today but had risen as much as 7% earlier in the day amid another volatile session in the broader market.IBD'S TAKE: Read IBD's The Big Picture column each day to stay on top of the market direction, a key indicator that lets you know when you can be aggressive and when you should move to the sidelines.Kors' report follows Tapestry's (TPR) forecast-beating quarter Tuesday that included 43% profit growth and 35% in revenue gains to $1.07 EPS and $1.79 billion in sales. Management also guided full-year earnings above consensus views. Tapestry's portfolio includes fashion brands Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman.Ralph Lauren (RL) easily beat EPS estimates but fell a bit short of revenue views last week.Last week, Morgan Stanley analyst Kimberly Greenberger said the handbag market ""remains challenged,"" despite a strong overall holiday shopping season.YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN: Tesla, Top Chip-Gear Makers, Michael Kors: Investing Action PlanInvesting In IPO Stocks: Know The Risk With Snap, Future 'Unicorns'The Next New IPO Gems: Can You Find The Next Google, Facebook, Cisco Or Microsoft?

27,RL,"Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) agreed to buy Jimmy Choo Plc for about 896 million pounds ($1.2 billion), as the maker of handbags popular with the commuter set seeks to restore lost luster by adding ""Sex and the City"" stilettos.The purchase of Jimmy Choo, Michael Kors' first deal to expand beyond its own brand name since its initial public offering in 2011, gives the New York fashion and accessories company a presence in higher-end luxury, in a move similar to that of Coach (COH), which in 2015 acquired shoemaker Stuart Weitzman.London-based Jimmy Choo rose to prominence in the late 1990s, boosted by high-profile devotees including the late Princess Diana and the fictional Carrie Bradshaw in television series ""Sex and the City."" The deal comes amid consolidation in the U.S. luxury industry, with Coach also agreeing to buy Kate Spade earlier this year.""Again, Michael Kors follows the path of Coach — and again, on steroids,"" wrote Luca Solca, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas. ""After a meteoric rise and spectacular crash, it is now the time to recycle cash into other brands.""The company has been closing stores and reducing its exposure to department stores in an effort to boost its exclusivity. Alongside Ralph Lauren (RL) and Calvin Klein, Michael Kors has struggled to maintain its brand image after broadly distributing its products in discount stores and outlet malls. On the Macy's (M) website, for example, the brand's signature $298 tote bags are currently sold for as low as $149.Jimmy Choo competes with the likes of Manolo Blahnik and Christian Louboutin for the attention of fans of high-heeled women's shoes, selling models like the $800 Lance. The brand, named after its Malaysian-born co-founder, was created in 1996 and opened its first store in London a year later.JAB Holding Co., owned by the billionaire Reimann family, has committed to sell its 68% stake. The investment company bought Jimmy Choo for more than 500 million pounds in 2011 and later pared its holdings in a 2014 initial public offering. Before that, Jimmy Choo has been bought and sold by private-equity investors three times.In April, JAB said it was reviewing options for the shoe brand and leather-goods maker Bally International to step away from fashion and footwear. The company plans to focus on its food and beverage businesses, which has grown into one of the world's largest coffee sellers through acquisitions of brands such as Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts and Panera Bread.Michael Kors will pay 230 pence a share for the luxury shoemaker, a premium of 18% over Monday's close, the companies said Tuesday. The price is equal to about 17.5 times Jimmy Choo's adjusted Ebitda for 2016.Michael Kors stock has lost about two-thirds of its value since peaking in February 2014. The stock had more than doubled in the two years prior. Jimmy Choo shares rose as much as 17% in early trading Tuesday, almost reaching the bid price.""Jimmy Choo is a higher-end brand that gives Kors a bit more diversity,"" said John Guy, luxury analyst and managing director at MainFirst Bank. ""The price tag at 2.2 times sales is quite low.""The deal could be susceptible to a counter-offer, Guy said, as some minority shareholders are likely to ask to hold out for a better price.BofA Merrill Lynch and Citigroup advised Jimmy Choo. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase & Co. advised Michael Kors, which said it would keep Jimmy Choo's existing management team, led by Chief Executive Officer Pierre Denis.

28,RL,"Amazon's (AMZN) Whole Foods (WFM) acquisition, the launch of Prime Wardrobe, and Nike's (NKE) decision to sell directly on the e-commerce site have shaken up the grocery and broader retail space, but recent sell-offs could actually prompt ""more investable"" opportunities in retail, says one analyst.X ""Although it may take time for investors to be willing to re-enter the space, we believe this may actually have made the 'winners' within our retail/brands coverage (which have already been coping through the Amazon threat) more investable,"" wrote Instinet analyst Simeon Siegel on Monday, arguing that apparel ""is no 'deader' than it was two weeks ago.""Who are the Amazon-resistant names on his list? Ulta Beauty (ULTA), TJX (TJX), Ross Stores (ROST), Nike and Signet Jewelers (SIG). Ralph Lauren (RL) is also seen potentially benefiting.""With fewer 'safe havens' across the broader consumer landscape, multiple premiums around anything thought to be 'safe' will likely be reinforced,"" he said.Amazon closed down 1% at 993.98 in the stock market today. Ulta finished 1.8% higher, TJX added 1%, Ross gained 0.7%, Nike rose 0.8%, and Signet climbed 3.2%.And while Amazon's foray into ""try before you buy""-style at-home shopping with Prime Wardrobe treads further onto department store and apparel retailers' turf, Siegel wonders if the offering could actually be a boost for brands, given the number of store closures happening on the brick-and-mortar level.The additional distribution provided by Amazon, of all places, could help offset lost distribution at department stores, he said.IBD's TAKE: Meanwhile, Amazon chief Jeff Bezos and other tech heads met with India Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of Modi's meeting with President Trump on Monday. For the latest on FANG stocks, check out IBD's hub on all things Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Nike, Under Armour (UAA), Adidas (ADDYY), PVH (PVH), Ralph Lauren, and Hanes Brands (HBI), which have wide wholesale distribution to department stores ""could stand to gain the most from syncing up with the Amazon machine, as the site's success could provide a new form of wholesale distribution, offering some protection from the structural challenges facing the current establishment,"" Siegel added.Furthermore, he said wider apparel distribution on Amazon would actually help to bolster full-price retail and thereby protect off-pricers like TXJ and Ross Stores.RELATED:Wal-Mart Is Not Mulling A Rival Bid For Whole Foods: ReportHere's The Latest Group Having An Amazon-Induced Anxiety Attack

29,RL,"Wal-Mart (WMT) shares are rallying on an earnings beat, while four other retailers delivered better-than-expected profits. But while Wal-Mart closed at two-year highs, the other retailers had a less-positive day.Children's Place (PLCE) delivered a beat-and-raise quarter that has shares shot up initially in the stock market today, as profit grew 48% to $1.95 a share and revenue rose 4% to $436.7 million from the prior-year quarter.That easily beat consensus for $1.64 a share on sales of $422.5 million.Same-store sales rose 6.1%, which the children's clothier said was its highest Q1 comparable-sales figure ""in over a decade."" The highly watched metric is a contrast to the negative slide from department stores last week and from Target (TGT) on Wednesday.Children's Place ""continues to execute extremely well in a tough environment,"" wrote FBR analyst Susan Anderson, ""with strong inventory control, expanding (average unit retail), and margin expansion.""The company upped its full-year outlook to $7.10-$7.20, up from prior guidance for $6.50-$6.65. Analysts are currently looking for $6.66 a share for 2017.Children's Place shares shot up to 124.90 soon after the open, just below Monday's record 125.30, but reversed sharply, closing down 0.45% at 111.10.Ralph Lauren (RL) beat on both the top and bottom lines. Earnings grew 1% to 89 cents a share, beating views for 78 cents; revenue fell 16% to $1.57 billion, but the slide wasn't as bad as expected. Still, Ralph Lauren, apparel retailer and clothier, reversed from early gains to finish off 1.9%.And shares of Victoria's Secret owner L Brands (LB) did manage to close up 2.6% after disclosing Q1 results late Wednesday that did not disappoint, even as same-store sales dropped 9%. The company nudged up full-year profit guidance to $3.10-$3.40 from $3.05-$3.35.Sporting goods retailer Hibbett (HIBB), which carries Nike (NKE), Adidas (ADDYY), Under Armour (UAA) and other popular brands, beat on profit. Hibbett's same-store sales, however, fell 4.9% in Q1. Shares initially ran up to 24.75, but reversed to trade down 0.65% to 22.90.On the flip side, things are pretty bad for Ascena Retail Group (ASNA). The parent of women's apparel brands Ann Taylor, Loft and dressbarn, among others, is tanking in a major way, down 26.8% to 2.07 after slashing Q3 and full-year guidance. Ascena hit 17-year low of 1.65 intraday.Management now expects 10-15 cents in fiscal 2017 earnings, a fraction of its earlier guidance for 37-42 cents. For Q3, it sees 4-6 cents EPS, down from 7-12 cents in prior outlook.Ascena CEO David Jaffe said ""we ... no longer believe it appropriate to expect a stabilization of traffic and resulting normalization of comp sales against softer demand in the year-ago period."" He expects the specialty retail environment to ""remain challenging"" for the next year or two.As for Wal-Mart, shares rose 3.2% to their best levels in two years as earnings topped and e-commerce sales surged 63%.RELATED:Wal-Mart Signals It's A Real Amazon Rival As Online Sales Spike 63%Target's Big Q1 Beat Offers Some Hope, But There's Still This Scary ThingRetail And E-Commerce News And Stocks To WatchEarnings Distractions Before Next Trump Bombshell: Investing Action PlanThis Is Keeping TJX Bullish Amid The Broader Retail Meltdown

The tech-heavy composite moved up 0.2%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.2%.The Dow Jones industrial average inched lower. Volume was tracking slightly higher across both exchanges vs. the same time Monday. Among the other Dow industrials, IBM (IBM) paced the advancers with a 1.2% rise, while Microsoft (MSFT) and Home Depot (HD) followed up with gains of 1.1% and 1.0%, respectively.On the downside, medical components UnitedHealth Group (UNH) and Pfizer (PFE) pulled the Dow into the red, declining 2% and 1.9%, respectively.Among the S&P 500, two chip stocks were among the leaders on the day. Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 10%, while chip equipment stock Qorvo (QRVO) followed up on Monday's 5.5% advance with a 3.4% rise. Qorvo surged past a 72.52 flat-base entry, but remains within proper buy range.The S&P 500's laggards were once again retail stocks as they drastically underperformed the general market. Apparel companies Under Armour (UAA) and Hanesbrands (HBI) pierced their 50-day lines, falling 4.2% and 3.2%, respectively, while Ralph Lauren (RL) and VF Corp (VFC) dropped over 2% each.Leading retailer Burlington Stores (BURL) gapped below its 50-day line early Tuesday, down 3.3%. Gains from a 92.77 cup-base entry had been as much as 13% just five days ago, but a four-day losing streak has brought the stock's gains to just 3%.China-based stocks drastically outperformed in the stock market today. Internet portal Sina (SINA) and so-called 'Twitter of China' Weibo (WB) reported early Tuesday, causing them to shoot 18.5% and 25% higher, respectively. Both companies topped analyst estimates.

31,RL,"Shares of Kate Spade (KATE) nose-dived Tuesday after a report a day earlier indicated the apparel and handbag company would take more time to work out possible terms of a sale, while Ralph Lauren (RL) said it's examining new approaches to its retail stores.The moves are the latest that reflect the retail industry's struggles with physical stores amid competition from off-price chains, industrywide discounting and online retailers like Amazon (AMZN). Some analysts also say many retailers have far more stores than are needed.Reuters reported late Monday that Kate Spade would give those interested in acquiring Kate Spade more time to get a clearer picture of the company's finances, after Coach (COH) last week offered to buy the company. Michael Kors (KORS) has also expressed interest in buying Kate Spade, but it hasn't been aggressive about a purchase as Coach has, Reuters added.Shares crashed 14.7% to close at 19.46 on the stock market today, nearly wiping out the gains seen since buyout talk first surfaced, as any takeover price is expected to be below its market value of around $2.9 billion on Monday. Coach skidded by 2.6% to 39.56, and Michael Kors lost 3.2% to 36.82.IBD'S TAKE: Even as brick-and-mortar stores suffer due to weak mall traffic, in many cases, their online sales grew during the fourth quarter. News that Kate Spade was exploring a sale first surfaced in December. Coach, the Wall Street Journal noted at that time, had been considered a good match for the company. Shares got a lift then, and climbed further in February after the company said it was exploring ""strategic alternatives.""Ralph Lauren, meanwhile, said it would close its flagship Polo store on Fifth Avenue in New York, saying the closure would help it focus on new ways to ""pilot new and innovative customer experiences.""The company said it would integrate products from the Fifth Avenue location into its Ralph Lauren Men's and Women's flagship stores on Madison Avenue and elsewhere in the city.""We continue to review our store footprint in each market to ensure we have the right distribution and customer experience in place,"" Ralph Lauren CFO Jane Nielsen said in a statement.Those and other cost-cutting decisions would produce around $140 million in annualized savings, Ralph Lauren said and forecast restructuring costs of roughly $370 million from the efforts.The company said it would ""also explore new retail concepts, including leveraging Ralph's Coffee, and developing new store formats that connect the brand to loyal and new consumers.""Shares of Ralph Lauren plunged 4.5% to 77.74.Along with meeting e-commerce delivery needs, analysts have said retail outlets need to do more to appeal to consumers' desires for memorable experiences. Such companies as Apple (AAPL) and Nike (NKE) have stores that allow shoppers to try out products directly.Ralph Lauren also said it would collaborate with Salesforce's (CRM) Commerce Cloud service to offer what it described as a ""more cost-effective, flexible e-commerce platform.""RELATED:Sears: 'Substantial Doubt' Over Survival; Bebe, Payless Pushed To EdgeFinish Line's Dismal Earnings, Guidance Follow Nike's Retail Warning

33,RL,"A blowout private-payroll report from ADP and rebounding oil prices initially helped put the major U.S. stock indexes on pace for weekly gains. A strong start from the tech sector, led by Tesla (TSLA), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and its suppliers also helped send the Nasdaq to fresh record highs.But that all changed with the minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting, as policymakers signaled a surprise tilt toward more monetary tightening. Signs of disarray in Washington, D.C., on the effort to overhaul taxes also weighed on markets. Official U.S. jobs data showing conflicting signals Friday failed to bolster the market, nor did a strong IPO from tech company Okta. The Dow Jones industrial average closed about flat  for the week, while the S&P 500 was down 0.3% and the Nasdaq was off 0.6%.The Labor Department's March payroll report showed a gain of just 98,000 jobs, barely over half of what analysts expected, and January's and February's gains were revised lower. But the unemployment rate fell to a 10-year low of 4.5% as a separate survey found a robust jump in employment. Much of the weakness in payrolls was blamed on unseasonable weather. Underlying trends could be stronger. ADP's private-sector hiring report earlier in the week put March's jobs gain at 263,000. The overall direction of jobs, wages and inflation is seen putting pressure on the Fed to tighten monetary policy.RELATED:Minutes of the Federal Reserve's March 14-15 meeting released Wednesday afternoon revealed that policymakers are ready to start shrinking the central bank's $4.5 trillion balance sheet later this year.The move, which amounts to a tightening of monetary policy, would begin to reverse the accommodation from the Fed's unconventional asset-buying programs launched in late 2008 to combat the financial crisis.The revelation helped turn a solid stock market advance into a small loss. Some analysts suggested that the Fed's policy signal could mean an unexpected rate hike in September, following a widely expected one in June. That would allow the Fed to start reducing the size of its balance sheet in December by no longer reinvesting all of the principal returned when its bond holdings mature.Separately, Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Richmond regional Fed bank, abruptly resigned after admitting that he violated the Fed's confidentiality rules in 2012 by speaking with a financial analyst about policy deliberations.RELATED:Okta (OKTA) raised $187 million late Thursday, pricing 11 million shares at 17, the high end of its estimated range. The stock climbed 38% over its IPO price to close at 23.51 on the Nasdaq Friday. That price values the company at over $2 billion. Okta's Identity Cloud platform provides identity management services for businesses. The San Francisco-based company is the fourth new company worth more than $1 billion to come public this year, following the successful IPOs of MuleSoft (MULE) Presidio (PSDO) and Snap (SNAP).RELATED:Tesla stock soared to a record high, following its Sunday report on car deliveries that beat expectations. Tesla now has a higher market valuation than Ford (F), which sold off Monday on weak U.S. auto sales for March. CEO Elon Musk mocked Tesla short sellers in a Monday tweet. Tesla delivered just over 25,000 vehicles in the first quarter, above its target of 23,000-24,500 vehicles and above Wall Street estimates for about 24,200.RELATED:Panera Bread (PNRA) agreed to be bought by Luxembourg's JAB for $7.5 billion including debt, or $315 per share. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter. JAB also owns Caribou Coffee, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Keurig Green Mountain and Peet's Coffee & Tea. It's the fourth major restaurant acquisition this year following Restaurant Brands' (QSR) purchase of Popeyes, Golden Gate Capital's buyout of Bob Evans Farms and Darden Restaurants (DRI) buying Cheddars. Other transactions could be on the horizon given analysts' forecasts for restaurant traffic to remain under pressure this year as consumers opt to save money and eat at home.RELATED:Google continued introducing remedies to quash an advertising crisis at YouTube that derailed a rally in parent Alphabet's (GOOGL) stock in mid-March. Google introduced a new system that lets outside firms verify ad quality standards on its video service. The advertising uproar began in Europe when major brands complained about ad placement next to videos that promoted hate, violence and racism. Analysts say some advertisers that have suspended ads on YouTube are seeking concessions from Google, aside from resolving the ad placement issue. YouTube, meanwhile, launched a $35 monthly TV streaming service in five U.S. markets — New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and Philadelphia.Meanwhile, Amazon's video business rolled ahead. It won rights to stream 10 National Football League games this fall — taking the ball from Twitter (TWTR), which held the same rights last year. Amazon is paying a big price for the privilege. It's paying $50 million, which is $40 million more than Twitter paid. The games will be available to members of Amazon Prime.RELATED:India is the first target of Twitter's new version, which the microblog service described as ""a new mobile web experience which minimizes data usage, loads quickly on slower connections, is resilient on unreliable mobile networks, and takes up less than 1MB on your device."" Twitter hopes the new mobile-friendly services will topple barriers to usage in countries where networks are slow, data service plans are pricey for much of the population, or mobile devices tend to lack storage. It sees potential in the Asia Pacific region, Latin America and Africa.RELATED:The FDA sent the company a complete response letter after Merck (MRK) said it wanted to include data from a trial evaluating cardiovascular outcomes with sitagliptin — the chemical name for diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet — in the prescribing information of sitagliptin-containing medicines. A complete response letter is issued when an application is rejected. It means Merck still has some work to do to get approval for including cardiovascular outcomes data on the labels for Januvia, Janumet and Janumet XR. Merck said it is exploring its options. The stock lost ground early Friday but recouped most of the losses, closing down 0.2%.U.S. airstrikes on Syria lit up defense stocks Friday. Raytheon (RTN), which makes the Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from the Mediterranean Sea, rose 1.5% and remained in buy range from a 152.68 flat-base entry. Lockheed Martin (LMT) lifted 1.2% to just above a 270 buy point. Lockheed makes the Paveway II Plus laser guided bomb. Northrop Grumman (NOC) added 0.9% and Boeing (BA) 0.8%. Boeing makes joint direct-attack munitions kits that turn dumb bombs into smart weapons.Constellation Brands (STZ) reported that Q4 earnings jumped 24% to $1.48 a share as revenue rose 5.5% to $1.63 billion. Results topped analyst estimates for EPS of $1.36 and sales of $1.59 billion. The alcoholic beverage giant, known for its Corona brand, saw beer sales rise 11%. But net sales of wine and spirits were flat. For the year, Constellation sees EPS of $7.70 to $8, above recent analyst estimates, with sales rising 9% to 11%, also above expectations.RELATED:CarMax (KMX) beat analysts' estimates for its fiscal fourth-quarter results, but continued to have difficulties in its subprime business, and a 1.6% drop in the average used-vehicle price reinforced concerns about industry sales and loan quality.

34,RL,"Kate Spade (KATE) shares are surging early Thursday after the handbag maker said it is ""conducting a process to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives to further enhance shareholder value.""The news confirms an earlier Wall Street Journal report from December that said the company was exploring a sale of itself at the prodding of activist hedge fund Caerus Investors.Shares gapped up nearly 15% to close at 22.56 in the stock market today, hitting the highest level since May, after retaking the key 200-day moving average in recent days. The stock enjoyed a more than 23% pop on Dec. 28, the day the Journal story surfaced.Kate Spade said its board has not set a timetable for the process, and a sale or other strategic alternative isn't guaranteed.The company also disclosed fourth-quarter results, noting a 28% increase in profit to 41 cents a share on 10.1% sales growth to $470.8 million vs. views for 34 cents and $472 million.IBD'S TAKE: Retailers are facing challenges, and malls have been forced to ramp up the drama in the age of Amazon. Here's what that looks like.Coach (COH) shares edged up 0.5%. Michael Kors (KORS) shares rose 0.4%. Coach and Kors, along with other accessible luxury names like Tory Burch, are among Kate Spade's biggest competitors.Both Coach and Kors have indicated in recent months that they will be reducing their department-store selections amid heavy discounting at the brick-and-mortar shops, which is seen as cheapening the brands.Apparel and accessories maker Ralph Lauren (RL) announced some key executive hires, two weeks after the CEO left over ""different views"" from that of the founder.

Michael Kors (KORS) fell 1.1%. Kate Spade (KATE) slid 1.9%. Coach (COH), which rose on earnings earlier this week, was down 2.2%.Chief Executive Stefan Larsson said it was stepping down due to differences between him and founder and former CEO Ralph Lauren on the direction of the company.""We have different views on how to evolve the creative and consumer-facing parts of the business,"" Larsson said in a statement.Larsson, who only joined Ralph Lauren in November 2015 will stay on until May 1 as the company looks for his successor.CFO Jane Nielsen will head the company's ""Way Forward"" plan it announced in June to deliver $180 million to $220 million of annualized savings.Holiday sales were weak overall for U.S. retailers.

36,RL,"The adoption of credit-card chip technology by U.S. retailers is having an unintended consequence: Criminals are moving from brick-and-mortar stores to the internet.The use of stolen card data to pay for merchandise on websites, in mobile apps and by dialing call centers surged 40% last year, according to a report from Javelin Strategy & Research released Wednesday. That's forcing merchants to spend billions on online fraud protection in an effort to detect when a crook is using someone else's card number.""We are seeing more sophisticated type of fraud moving into the online environment,"" said Erika Dietrich, global director of payments risk management at fraud fighter ACI Worldwide (ACIW).By the end of last year, almost 1.81 million U.S. merchants had switched to accepting European-style chip cards, more than double the number the year before, according to Visa (V) Issued by banks, cards containing the so-called EMV technology are much harder to counterfeit, which cuts down on in-person fraud at stores.With worldwide e-commerce surging and more stolen data available on the black market, retailers are ramping up spending on online security. E-commerce merchants and financial institutions will spend $9.2 billion annually in fraud-detection solutions by 2020, up 30% from current levels, according to Juniper Research.As recently as October, the fraud-protection company Radial Inc. used to get one to two inquiries from new large customers a month. That number has since climbed to more than 12 a month, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer. Radial's more than 100 clients include Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), StubHub and Ralph Lauren (RL).Fueling the surge in interest are an increasing number of data breaches at companies ranging from Target (TGT) to Wendy's (WEN), which potentially exposed private financial information from millions of customers to identity thieves. U.S. government agencies and companies suffered a record 1,093 data breaches last year, up 40% from 2015, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.""There's a great deal of investment not only from StubHub peers, but also from the vendors,"" said Joseph Asaro, head of operations for North America at StubHub, a unit of eBay (EBAY). ""The vendors would not be investing so heavily if there's not great profit in it.""To bolster its arsenal, Visa acquired CardinalCommerce in December to help merchants and banks authenticate e-commerce transactions. New vendors are also entering the fray: This year, Tender Armor LLC, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based startup, will offer its fraud-fighting technology to debit-card customers of InComm Holdings, which issues prepaid cards. Tender Armor texts or e-mails customers a daily code that replaces the one on the back of their cards for purchases.""Because the code is dynamic and only known to the consumer, the fraudsters can't use it,"" Madeline Aufseeser, Tender Armor's chief executive, said in an interview. ""This simple solution deputizes the consumers and puts the control back in their hands.""Meanwhile, payment processor Cayan, which serves mid- to small-sized businesses, plans to integrate security software from Kount. That company uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to help merchants pinpoint fraudulent sales. For each transaction, Kount's engine analyzes hundreds of relevant variables and activity across the globe in real time to predict risk of fraud.Existing fraud-fighting companies' business is blooming. Easy Solutions says sales of its product that helps banks and retailers monitor transactions grew 128 last year, up from a 75% gain in 2015. Radial, which promises to shoulder its clients' fraud costs, saw its sales rise 15% last year.Radial's software can use about 800 rules to determine if a transaction is fraudulent. Suspicious transactions are flagged and sent to several dozen human analysts around the world who can verify addresses, or even call the customers to weed out fraud.""They do detective work at some point,"" said the company's Weitz. ""We guarantee to our customers that they pay zero fraud.""Online sales worldwide are projected to rise to $27.7 trillion in 2020, up from $22 trillion last year, according to researcher eMarketer. North America, the second-largest e-commerce market in the world behind Asia, is expected to see double-digit growth through 2020, eMarketer said. Expansion into new categories such as grocery, and increasing sales through mobile devices are helping to boost sales, the company said.More shopping online means more opportunities for crooks, who are now using sophisticated attack tools such as bots. The software programs can run through online checkout pages and place orders using stolen data automatically — without a human being needing to be involved.""Right now the environment is more challenging than it's ever been,"" said Al Pascual, research director and head of fraud and security at Javelin, a consulting firm focused on the financial industry. ""And things will get worse before they get better.""

38,RL,"Upscale jeweler Tiffany (TIF) reported ""somewhat lower"" than expected November-December sales, citing lower consumer spending and a sharp drop in sales at its flagship New York store in part due to protests and security at Trump Tower following the election.Global sales rose 0.5% in the last two months of the year, with worldwide same-store sales down 2%, or 1% excluding currency effects. Comps in the Americas sank 4%. Sales at the Fifth Avenue store tumbled 14%, ""at least partly to post-election traffic disruptions,"" Tiffany said. Trump Tower is located right next door to Tiffany's flagship location.Tiffany had warned in November that post-election disruptions could hurt sales. A strong dollar also can weigh on tourism sales at the flagship store.European comps sank 11%, while Japan comps shot up 21%.Tiffany sees GAAP and non-GAAP earnings falling ""no more"" than a mid-single-digit percentage. Wall Street had seen only a 1% dip to $1.44 a share.Shares of Tiffany fell 2.5% to 79.90 on the stock market today after falling as low as 78.57, briefly undercutting their 50-day line.

39,RL,"Your personal finance plan in 2017 will be like baking a cake. All you'll need is the right recipe. Whether you're investing in stocks, bonds, ETFs or mutual funds in a 401(k) retirement account, now's the time to check to make sure you have the right ingredients at hand.For Phil Orlando, chief equity strategist at Federated Investors, the recipe involves six ingredients: overweight U.S. stocks in general; underweight 10-year Treasury bonds; and overweight financial services stocks, U.S. small-cap stocks, energy stocks and industrial companies' stocks.Orlando's colleague, Steve Chiavarone, associate manager of $414 million Federated Global Allocation Fund (FSTBX), cites holdings which illustrate that recipe. Among them, Apple (AAPL) could see higher profits if corporate taxes are lowered as President-elect Trump wants. It could also boost stock dividends or buybacks and spend more to develop new products with repatriated cash under Trump's tax proposal. ""Still, Trump has issues with parts of the tech industry, so Apple's may be a more mixed picture,"" Chiavarone said.In addition, a more lenient regulatory environment for banks would convert JPMorgan (JPM) from a something akin to a regulated utility back into a growth stock, Chiavarone says. Oilfield services giant Halliburton (HAL) should get more mileage out of its run, fueled by rising energy prices, he adds. And construction aggregates producer Martin Marietta (MLM) is poised to benefit from a boom in infrastructure projects.IBD'S TAKE: Martin Marietta is No. 2 in IBD's Building-Cement/Concrete-Aggregates industry group. To see how the company's growth metrics — like its strong 83 IBD Composite Rating and very strong 96 EPS (earnings per share) Rating stack up against its rivals, visit IBD Stock Checkup.To Orlando and Chiavarone, the 2017 recipe aims to take advantage of several macroeconomic forces now in play.In financials, $1.2 billion Third Avenue Value (TAVFX) lead manager Chip Rewey says U.S. regional banks are likely to benefit from rate hikes and scaled-back regulation. Their valuations are also relatively low ""since people have shunned them since the financial crisis.""Banks he likes include top holdings Bank of New York Mellon (BK), Comerica (CMA), PNC Financial (PNC) and Keycorp (KEY). All have strong Composite Ratings from IBD in the 80s or 90s.Among other stocks, he said home-builder ""Lennar (LEN) is a new position for Value Fund because housing should do well."" Its balance sheet is improving, it is reducing debt and it is trimming its land bank.He also recently bought shares in Johnson Controls (JCI). Some investors still think of it as a maker of automotive seating, a field it has exited. ""Its hidden gem is its car batteries,"" Rewey said. ""They are a leader in lead acid batteries and in start-stop batteries. And they, not Tesla (TSLA), are the leader in lithium ion car batteries.""In addition, Rewey likes biotech Amgen (AMGN), a relative newcomer to the portfolio, largely ""because the market is ignoring its strong pipeline.""And true to his value orientation, Rewey likes apparel company Ralph Lauren (RL). Earnings per share growth has declined eight straight quarters. The stock's Comp Rating is a dismal 7. ""But Rewey likes CEO Stefan Larsson's turnaround credentials. ""We think it's a great opportunity,"" Rewey said.Lee DeLorenzo, president of United Asset Strategies in Garden City, N.Y., says workers should try to take advantage of the same apparent forces in their 401(k) accounts. At the same time, they should cut their interest-rate risk by shifting 5% to 10% of their weighting in traditional bond funds to stable value funds or flexible, go-anywhere bond funds.She advises increasing exposure to small- and midcap stocks and stock funds. Plan members who can stomach risk, she says, should boost their weightings in financials and energy.Rich Weiss, a senior portfolio manager on a team that oversees 20 American Century target-date, target-risk and asset-allocation funds, says 401(k) plan members should also look at whether the year-end spurt in stock prices threw their target asset allocations out of whack. Does your mix of stocks, large and small, U.S. and foreign, specific geographies and selected sectors, still jibe with your overall financial plan? Your risk tolerance? Your financial goals?If something has grown too big, take profits to rebalance. Keep the proceeds inside your account to avoid an early withdrawal.Plan members who'd rather not make their own investment decisions should leave the heavy lifting to target-date and target-risk funds within their accounts, he says. If you do want to forge your own investment decisions, you can look for ideas at the asset allocations of target date and target risk portfolios that match your situation. ""But doing that may be more expensive and complex than simply purchasing an appropriate target-date fund,"" Weiss added.If your 401(k) does not offer target-date or target-risk funds? Consider investing that same money instead in such a fund inside an IRA, where your investment choices are almost unlimited.In addition, Weiss says, if your 401(k) offers a Roth option, use it if you are young and if your tax bracket will stay the same or rise after you retire. Meanwhile, contributions are not tax deductible. But earnings grow tax-deferred. And withdrawals normally will be tax-free, unlike withdrawals from a regular 401(k) or IRA.Suppose you share the Orlando-Chiavarone vision of what 2017 is to bring. How do you act on it?One approach would be to boost the assets, sectors and geographies that they expect to thrive by 10% in your portfolio. Trim from assets like long Treasuries and emerging-markets stocks. You can tweak those numbers up or down, depending on factors such as your time horizon, risk tolerance, long-term goals and any near-term need for cash.If you're an aggressive investor in your 30s, for instance, you might want to boost your U.S. small caps by 11% or 12%.In any case, first form your 2017 financial action plan, either with your financial advisor or on your own. Then look for securities that can bring that plan to life. It's not all that hard. In fact, reflecting holiday cheer, DeLorenzo said, ""The execution of these changes is as easy as baking a cake.""RELATED:2017 Personal Finance Action Plan & 2016 Stock Market ReviewHot Stocks That Made Craig Hodges A Top 2016 Mutual Fund ManagerWhere Mutual Fund Pros See Big Stock Gains In 2017Here's How To Decide Which Retirement Accounts To Fund First

41,RL,"Investing in real estate may help to build a strong foundation in your investment portfolio. These securities diversify portfolios, generate income and hold potential for capital growth -- a trifecta of benefits for ETF investors.And several REIT exchange traded funds may be poised for a sizable rally, having found support around their 200-day moving averages after a recent pullback. They include Vanguard REIT (VNQ), iShares U.S. Real Estate (IYR) and Real Estate Select Sector SPDR (XLRE), which are among the five largest funds in the sector.Real estate debuted as the 11th S&P 500 sector Monday, commanding a roughly 3% weighting in the large-cap index. It's a timely move, given the performance and popularity of REIT exchange traded funds with investors in 2016.As a stand-alone sector, REITs will gain added visibility that may serve to further increase asset flows into this asset class, says Adam Patti, CEO of IndexIQ, the firm behind IQ US Real Estate Small Cap ETF (ROOF). Active managers, many of whom underweighted real estate when it was part of the financial sector, may be forced to adjust.Demand for U.S. real estate securities held strong ahead of the industry's elevation as a new S&P 500 sector. Investors poured $1.33 billion into real estate ETFs in August, following $1.60 billion in July, according to Morningstar data.""The popularity of REIT ETFs persisted last month"" even as other yield-focused ETFs, such as rate-sensitive telecom services and utilities, saw significant outflow, Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research for S&P Global Market Intelligence, wrote Sept. 13.On the stock market today, VNQ showed bullish momentum, extending Wednesday's gains from the Federal Reserve's decision to leave interest rates unchanged in September. The Fed left the door open to hikes later this year. Several other REIT ETFs showed similar action.Investors in REITs should monitor interest rates closely. Lower rates typically make it easier to buy, sell and refinance property, which boosts demand for real estate. Conversely, the sector tends to sell off when rates trend up.IBD'S TAKE: Recent changes to a widely used classification system for equities could significantly impact how fund investors allocate resources.Among real estate ETFs, Vanguard's VNQ dominates in terms of net inflow so far this year, raking in $5.75 billion through August. The $34.83 billion ETF holds traditional real estate such as self-storage company Public Storage (PSA) and health care REIT Welltower (HCN).By comparison, its iShares rival IYR also holds newer ""specialty REITs"" focused on timber, communications or other areas. They include American Tower (AMT) and Crown Castle (CCI), former telecoms that have restructured as REITs, Rosenbluth noted.And the young XLRE invests exclusively in S&P 500 components. This ETF launched in late 2015 in anticipation of the landmark change to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) -- a taxonomy for equities -- that carved out real estate from financials as a stand-alone sector.XLRE swelled from a few hundred million in assets to $2.82 billion as the GICS changes took effect this month. The five largest real estate ETFs skew toward big REITs like Simon Property Group (SPG) and Vornado Realty (VNO).IndexIQ describes ROOF as the only way for investors to gain access to the small-cap segment of REITs and real estate holding companies. It invests across the commercial, residential and specialized REIT sectors.The ETF is relatively small in assets and thinly traded, but has vaulted over the five largest funds so far in 2016.ROOF jumped 16.2% on the stock market year to date through Sept. 21. By comparison, VNQ gained 11.8% over the same period, XLRE 6.8%, and ETFs tracking the S&P 500 7.5%.Index IQ's Patti thinks ""REITs still have room to run"" because they got hit fairly hard in 2015. Funds holding smaller REITs may offer an especially attractive opportunity for investors.Small caps as a group provide higher dividend yield than large caps, according to Patti. ROOF currently has a 12-month yield of 3.80% and VNQ 3.27%.The former invests in the bottom 10% of the domestic REIT market in terms of market capitalization, while filtering out the smallest and most illiquid names. Patti described ROOF's 67 stock holdings as ""hidden gems"" that are underowned and offer attractive relative value. They include First Industrial (FR).Added flow of money to real estate as a new sector could further extend valuations for large caps, while reducing their dividend yield, according to Patti. That dividend income is a big reason why investors seek out REITs in the first place. Real estate investment trusts generate yield by distributing 90% of their earnings as dividends.""The reality is if you're investing in REITs for yield and diversification, you should look at small caps,"" Patti said. He suggests that investors carve out 15% of their overall REIT exposure for the small caps in ROOF.RELATED:The First New S&P 500 Sector Since 1999 Is A Big Deal For InvestorsWith Yields As High As 10%, Real Estate Funds Drum Up Assets And AppealKey Debut For Real Estate Is A Big Opportunity For ETF InvestorsMeet The First New Sector SPDR ETFs In 17 Years

42,RL,"Nike (NKE), Under Armour (UA) and Ralph Lauren (RL) were three of the most recognizable U.S.-traded apparel names in Rio. How did they -- and their share prices -- fare at the Games?The clothier maintained its presence as Team USA's official ceremony outfitter, dressing the American athletes first in navy blazers and white trousers for the opening ceremony, then in boat shoes and button-downs for the closeout celebration.Stock: Since the close of Thursday, Aug. 4, the day prior to the Olympic opening ceremony, Ralph Lauren shares have gained about 15%, though much of that was due in part to a better-than-expected quarterly earnings report.Win: Reviews of this Olympiad's outfits were mixed, but by virtue of being insanely popular athletes, flag bearers Michael Phelps and Simone Biles drew plenty of viewer attention to their outfits. And as other athletes from across the world clamored for a selfie with Simone -- reportedly backing up the whole procession -- the social media value alone was no doubt tremendous.Loss: Gold medalist Ryan Lochte crossed the line from goofy all-American frat boy to diplomatic disaster when he ""over-exaggerated"" about being the victim of an armed robbery in Rio.Ralph Lauren, along with Speedo and Gentle Hair Removal, have since dropped Lochte as an endorser.

The deal will last for eight years.Plus, the sea of neon-yellow shoes on the track made it very clear which brand dominates in running. Nike Brand President Trevor Edwards told Fortune that 70% of the track-and-field gold medalists were wearing Nike.Loss: As an Olympic sponsor, Nike must've spent a pretty penny on the ability to use the rings and other official imagery in its ads. But a key change in Olympic Rule 40 means that Under Armour and other brands have been able to essentially market their Olympians, so long as they're careful enough.IBD'S TAKE: The change to Rule 40 shook up the Olympic advertising landscape and gave Under Armour an opening to steal Nike's thunder in Rio. For a look at how other brands like Apple, McDonald's, Facebook performed at the Games, check out IBD's Brand Olympics series.The much littler athletic apparel brand, though only partnering with a fraction of the number of Olympians as Nike, worked hard to make an impact on the global sporting stage.Stock: Shares are up about 10% since the close of Aug. 4.Win: Sponsoring about 225 athletes in Rio, Under Armour's exceedingly well-chosen endorsement deals include G.O.A.T. swimmer Michael Phelps and Team USA's women's gymnastics team, which includes new all-American sweetheart Simone Biles. (Biles and fellow gymnast Gabby Douglas have individual endorsement deals with Nike, however.)Loss: Its hottest, brightest star of the moment -- i.e. Phelps -- was pictured on the cover of Sports Illustrated wearing Nike sweatpants.

43,RL,"Luxury apparel, accessories and footwear maker Michael Kors (KORS) reported better-than-expected fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue.But shares fell on Kors' first flat sales in years, while the fashion house's Q2 forecasts fell far short of analyst consensus.Ralph Lauren (RL) reported lower earnings and sales. But they topped estimates, driving its stock up sharply.The reports comes follows fiscal Q4 results from rival Coach (COH) on Tuesday. Like Michael Kors, Coach's earnings per share minus one-time items topped estimates but handbag and fashion accessories maker and retailer said it will close 250 department store locations and reduce discounts to try to burnish its image.It's a problem for Coach, Michael Kors and other affordable luxury brands. Expanding the brand to broader distribution can boost sales, but risks undermining the brand and pricing. Kors' Q1 diluted EPS edged up a penny to 88 cents, beating by 14 cents a share. Revenue rose just 0.2% to $987.90 million. Two years ago Kors' growth was 43%, four years ago it was 71%. Still, revenue topped views for $953.04 million.But sales at stores open at least a year slid 7% and gross profit margin dipped to 59.9% from 61.2% in Q1 2015.IBD'S TAKE: Michael Kors stock peaked in February 2014, when earnings and sales growth was still very strong. But a stock can break down long before its fundamentals start to show weakness. Check out this Investor's Corner to learn how Biogen stock triggered sell signals before profits faltered.Like handbag and fashion apparel retailer Kate Spade (KATE), which reported last week, Kors CEO John Idol noted that tourism is weak, dragging down North American sales. Kors Q1 sales in North America fell 5% to $690.8 million.Idol said in a written statement that forward progress in the quarter ""was muted by the continued decline in mall traffic trends as well as a decrease in tourism in certain major cities which negatively impacted our comparable sales performance during the quarter.Michael Kors forecast Q2 EPS of 84 cents-88 cents, vs. forecasts of $1.03 a share, and revenue  of $1.07 billion to $1.085 billion, compared with analyst projections of $1.11 billion. Its also expects sales at comparable stores to decline in the midsingle digits range this quarter.Its stock has been consolidating since mid-March with an entry point of 59.59. Kors fell almost 3% to 48.71 in the stock market today.  Coach, which fell more than 2% Tuesday, fell another 2.3% to 39.60. Kate Spade shares slipped 0.7% by the close Wednesday.Ralph Lauren's Q1 EPS slid 3% to $1.06 on a 4% drop in revenue to $1.55 billion as the apparel brand and retailer closes 10% of stores.

44,RL,"Stock indexes chugged ahead Thursday afternoon, as strength in the retail and apparel sectors aided the market.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.8%, hitting fresh all-time highs after consolidating for three weeks. The S&P 500 rose 0.6%, also setting a new record. The Nasdaq rose 0.6%, just below its peaks. Volume was running narrowly lower on the NYSE but much lower on the Nasdaq in the stock market today.The S&P 500's biggest gainers came from the retail and apparel sectors. Macy's (M) surged 17%; Kohl's (KSS) rose 16.5%; Nordstrom (JWN) climbed 7%; Ralph Lauren (RL) added nearly 6%; and Under Armour (UA) was also up 5%.Macy's, Kohl's results were not great, but they topped Wall Street's consensus earnings estimate by margins of 18% to 20%, a day after Ralph Lauren did the same. Nordstrom will report after the close. Under Armour reported in late July and matched estimates. Macy's also said it will close 100 stores.None of the stocks is top-rated. The department stores and apparel groups are market laggards. Under Armour has the best earnings rating of the five -- its EPS Rating is 72, which means about 28% of the stocks in IBD's database are growing earnings faster than Under Armour.Despite the weak ratings, the retail and apparel groups are relevant. Consumer spending accounts for roughly 70% of overall U.S. economic activity.On Friday, the Commerce Department will report retail sales for July. The consensus estimate is for a 0.4% increase. Wall Street's estimates range from 0.2% to 0.7%. If the report is positive, it will be the fourth consecutive month of improvement. The report for June came in at 0.6%, easily topping the Street's consensus estimate for 0.1%.Recently, retail sales reports around the world have favored the optimists.In Britain, retail sales in July increased 1.1% vs. the year-earlier period, defying those who said the exit from the European Union would act as a depressant. The July sales pop, which was reported Tuesday, was the biggest in six months.Brazil, which is in a recession, reported Tuesday that retail sales inched up 0.1% in June. While the gain was tiny, most economists expected a drop. Consumer confidence and business confidence have been climbing since Michel Temer, the acting president, took over in May. Temer is seen as more business-friendly than recent presidents in Brazil have been. Deposed president Dilma Rousseff, a leftist, faces an impeachment trial.On Wednesday, Hong Kong's largest mall operator, Wharf Holdings, said revenue jumped 12% in the past six months. This was rare good news on Hong Kong's retail front. A downturn in tourism has hammered Hong Kong retailers. On Aug. 2, the South China Morning Post reported that retail sales skidded 10.5% in the first half of this year. Q2 retail sales, however, improved compared with Q1.

45,RL,"A scruffy, bearded Michael Phelps swims punishing laps alone in a darkened pool as an Edith Piaf-like voice croons ""It's the last goodbye, I swear/I can't rely on a dime-a-day love that don't go anywhere.""Cue a montage of the elite swimmer lifting weights, enduring ice baths and fire-cupping therapy, staring wistfully at a leaf-strewn backyard pool as he contemplates something. Actually, it's pretty obvious what the Olympian -- who just won his 19th gold medal on Sunday -- is contemplating, even if Under Armour (UA) isn't allowed to say it explicitly in its ad.""It's what you do in the dark that puts you in the light,"" flashes on the pitch-black screen. ""Rule yourself.""Expect to see that commercial a whole lot over the next few weeks, thanks to a change to the International Olympic Committee's Rule 40 that finally allows non-Olympic sponsors to advertise athletes competing in the Games.The much-talked-about policy shift is a big positive for brands who aren't among the 11 official worldwide Olympic sponsors, like McDonald's (MCD), or any of the 28 U.S. sponsors, like Nike (NKE). But it could especially benefit Under Armour's march toward the global stage.Nike, the far-and-away leader in performance gear, still towers over Under Armour. But the littler athletic company's scrappy-underdog brand image and well-chosen endorsement deals have resonated with young people. Of the three major labels -- Nike, Adidas and Under Armour -- Under Armour is the only one that has not sponsored the quadrennial event before. But the new guidelines may mean that it doesn't have to in order to reap the benefits.""The Rule 40 change really gives (Under Armour) an opening to leverage their athletes,"" said analyst Matt Powell of the NPD Group market research company. ""Before, they were really restricted in how much they could actually (do).""Before Rio, Rule 40 meant that only companies that had plunked down major money to call themselves exclusive sponsors -- like Coca-Cola (KO) or Visa (V) -- were allowed to feature their Olympians in ads during the Games.The restriction ostensibly protected sponsor investments, but it also shut out athletes' ability to capitalize on their medal efforts after years of training, causing a kerfuffle at the 2012 London Games. Non-sponsor brands were not even allowed to tweet ""Good luck at the Olympics!"" to their qualifying athletes.They still aren't. But following the loosening of Rule 40, those that have gotten prior approval can now showcase their finest athletes in ""generic advertising,"" so long as the Olympic rings and the Games' associated verbiage -- ""Olympics,"" ""medal,"" even ""2016,"" depending on how it's used -- are nowhere to be found in the marketing material. Companies had to apply for the waiver six months ahead of the Games.Hence, Under Armour's sentimental Olympic-but-not-really-Olympic commercial that heavily alludes to Phelps' last appearance at the international event. Instead of being kept silent at the world's greatest sports stage, the Baltimore-based brand can tweet and post Facebook (FB) messages, and broadcast their heavy hitters from the rooftops.Under Armour's ode to Phelps brought the athlete to tears when he first watched it, a moment conveniently captured on film and posted on the brand's YouTube page. The reaction video has been viewed over half a million times. The ""Rule Yourself"" ad itself has attracted well over 5.8 million views, the company's second most-watched video on the site despite being posted only four months ago.
"
46,RL,"A similar Olympic-style campaign starring top U.S. gymnasts Madison Kocian, MyKayla Skinner and Maggie Nichols also made the rounds, garnering over 3 million YouTube views in the months before the Games. (Kocian made the Olympic team, and Skinner is an alternate.)""The changes to Rule 40 allow us to fulfill our No. 1 objective, which is to support the nearly 225 Olympic athletes and Olympic hopefuls tied to the Under Armour brand during the Games,"" an Under Armour spokesperson told IBD via email.And the timing of this effort coincides with Under Armour's push to assert itself not just at home, but abroad.International revenue, as of the company's June-ended second quarter, grew 72% year over year and accounted for 15% of total revenue. That's almost double the 8% of revenue that came from sales abroad just two years ago.""Between Nike and Under Armour, this is a big incremental opportunity for Under Armour and the reason they're being so aggressive,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Dave Weiner told IBD. ""Brazil is a huge market.""The Olympics' host country in particular has been a focus of Under Armour's push to grow its global soccer franchise and sell more cleats, he said. But for all the pomp and hype, the major sporting event only comes around every four years and lasts just two weeks, meaning it's not much of a needle-mover when it comes to stock price or annual revenue.For example, Ralph Lauren (RL), the official outfitter of Team USA, has seen its overall sales fall for four consecutive quarters and is expected to continue suffering declines for the next few years.And while the appeal of Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte in a preppy navy blazer and white pants has not been lost on his fans online, it is unclear whether that will translate into sales for a clothier whose Hamptons aesthetic is increasingly losing relevance on athleisure-dominated sidewalks.For Under Armour, the potential comes from establishing presence.""What it's going to do is allow them to get on conference calls and put together marketing with more confidence that they're one of the top three global brands -- help to solidify some long-term projections by country,"" said Weiner, adding, ""These are the kinds of events where you can drive home the point.""Powell echoed that sentiment, saying that this is an ""important"" Olympics for Under Armour.""But that said, the marketing around the Olympics is not really a visceral kind of marketing,"" but more to show ""that they're authentic and (their) Olympic athletes are performing at a high level.""He said he hasn't really witnessed a case of people watching the Olympics and then hopping aboard the brand train. Still, before the Games had even begun, at least one viewer of the Michael Phelps ""Rule Yourself"" campaign was sold.""I'll buy under armour (sic) just because of this commercial,"" said YouTube commenter Kevin Cass. ""Absolutely one of the best I've ever seen ... Under Armour,....you're the best in my books now. Good luck Michael!!!""As much as Under Armour and others are benefiting from the slight breathing room to Rule 40, the restrictions are still annoying parties on all sides of the equation.Athletes still have to watch what they say.How amazing is this! It's for that thing 😉 I'm doing this summer 😉 in South America 😉 #Rule40 pic.twitter.com/nJ2cQxPlXG— Jade Lally (@JadeLallyT69) July 27, 2016Even waivered sponsors must be careful, lest they face repercussions for accidentally using the trademarked #Rio2016 hashtag or mentioning the Olympics by name on Twitter.

51,RL,"The Summer Games aren't just a noble gathering of the world's athletic elite: The event is also a marketing gold mine for official brand partners and sponsors of individual athletes.And perhaps more so in 2016 than in prior Olympic years, trying to harness the life force of the internet can lead to unpredictable results, thanks to an often-rowdy digital commentariat on Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Snapchat and elsewhere. Brands can emerge from the melee as social-media stars or as sore losers.So here's a glimpse at how Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), Nike (NKE) and others are performing in Rio so far:Not Coke's fault, but the soft drink giant got mixed up in a PR debacle when an Olympian from Egypt told NPR that there was no coffee in the Olympic Village, because it was a Coca-Cola-only zone.The story went semi-viral. The New York Daily News, Business Insider, Fusion and others picked up on the NPR segment -- Cosmopolitan even grouped it under a listicle called ""11 Rio Olympic Village Horror Stories.""Spokespeople from Coca-Cola, an official worldwide sponsor of the Games, told several of those outlets that no, the athletes aren't limited to Coke products and yes, there is coffee in Olympic Village, but the damage had been done.That's probably not what gold feels like.Shares rose 0.3% to 43.75 on the stock market today. Coca-Cola stock has been trading below its 200-day average since reporting Q2 results late last month.The Big Mac maker is doing lots of feel-good stuff around the Olympics -- it sent kids to the opening ceremony! Its McNuggets are pink-slime-free! -- but you can trust hungry, tired reporters to weed out the real news: there's no McDonald's in Olympic Park.According to USA Today, Olympiads of years past have prominently featured a McD's in the press center. But McDonald's told the paper that it wanted to get into the local spirit and feature dessert stands instead, of which there are 2,500 in Brazil.There is, however, a full-service McDonald's in Olympic Village. And it is very, very popular with the athletes.Line out the door at McDonald's in Olympic Athletes Village (via @JohnBranchNYT) pic.twitter.com/HJQrxqcP2k— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) August 9, 2016Shares rose 0.5% to 119.38 Thursday.

56,RL,"Ralph Lauren (RL) tumbled as much as 10% after predicting a plunge in sales this year, showing the challenges facing Chief Executive Officer Stefan Larsson as he tries to turn around the nearly 50-year-old brand. But stock pared lossesLarsson, who unveiled his vision for the company for the first time since taking the reins last year, will eliminate three layers of management, slash jobs and shutter stores as part of his “Way Forward” plan. The restructuring costs will amount to as much as $400 million, the company said on Tuesday. It also will refocus on its three core brands: Ralph Lauren, Polo and Lauren.The New York-based company, facing an industrywide slowdown and an aging customer, is revamping its operations to bolster sagging earnings. Larsson’s plan to reinvigorate Ralph Lauren will generate cost savings of about $180 million to $220 annually, on top of an earlier belt-tightening effort. The CEO’s other challenge is making the brand cool again: He’s drawing on his experience at Old Navy and H&M to speed up the company’s supply chain and connect with younger shoppers.“We see a clear path to tap into the potential and massively to drive brand strength growth and profitable sales growth,” Larsson said during the presentation. “It will take time though.”Ralph Lauren closed down 2.4% to 94.06 on the stock market today. The stock was already down 14% this year through Monday’s close., battered by investor fears that the company is mired in a long-term slump.Ralph Lauren now expects sales to fall by a percentage in the low double digits in fiscal 2017, which ends around March of next year. Analysts had estimated a 4 percent drop on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Clearing out inventory, shutting down stores and trying to wean shoppers off of discounts -- combined with weak customer traffic -- will all conspire to hold down sales this year.The brand has been suffering from sluggish demand at many malls and department stores, such as Macy’s, Hudson’s Bay and Nordstrom. A stronger dollar has also eroded the value of its sales overseas and curtailed spending from European and Asian tourists in North America.Larsson took the helm in November after the company’s namesake founder stepped down as CEO. Since then, the executive has shaken up management and pushed forward with a cost-cutting plan, including a reduction of 5 percent of its workforce. He’s been working to eliminate $125 million in annual costs, remodel stores and reduce its product count to keep inventory low.The plan unveiled on Tuesday goes further, and brings more short-term pain. In addition to the $400 million in restructuring expenses, the company will write off as much as $150 million in inventory that has to be liquidated.The idea is to eventually get prices -- and margins -- back up, said Chen Grazutis, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. The company expects its performance to stabilize in fiscal 2018, before emerging as a smaller, more profitable organization in 2019.“They are willing to take an hit on sales in order to refine their distribution and restore full price sales and margins,” he said.

US companies announced 75k job CUTS last month – that is up 200% over December and up 42% from one year ago! Initial jobless claims higher, continuing claims higher, and then the retailers HIT.....Kohl's ( (KSS)) and Ralph Lauren ( (RL)) shocked the mkts with very disappointing earnings and sales figures for December and guidance for the new year…. This is where the concern about the consumer hits you right between the eyeballs....Remember all the chatter last fall - How great the shopping season was going to be, how the consumer was flush with cash, how the tide had turned and retailers were going to be the beneficiaries??? Does any of that ring a bell?Futures did a complete 180 and fell out bed……the pressure was mounting – the storm clouds were building….….
"
62,RL,"RL & KSS and every other retailer was for sale – The DMM (Designated Market Maker) in RL struggled to find bids as the sellers poured in……Sell 20k , then 50k, then 100k – buyers were not be found anywhere in line...…as the sellers get anxious – the buyers recoiled even more…..The stock was indicated down $10, then $12 then $15 as brokers worked to gather interest……then at 9:29:55 the bell began to ring – Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding…… and we're OFF......Stocks began to open, the indices began to reflect the concern as the pressure mounted.....volume surges as the action gets under way......The stock (RL) opened at $103.27 (down $12) and then proceeded to trade down another $15 (to $88) in the mins after as SELLERS (mostly those liquidity providers) came out of the woodwork.....hitting any bid available........The issue now?: The intuitional buyers weren't standing there willing to get run over - so with the guidance of their brokers they moved lower until the selling subsided and the stock found support……The volume exploded in this issue as we traded some 10.8 mil shares vs. the average daily volume of 2.2 mil shares. What had happened? Nothing really – it was just another day in an anxious, nervous, automated, volatile mkt…. where investors are convinced that someone is playing ""I got a secret!"".And then - CNBC runs with the story – The one everyone 'isn't talking about' BUT should be....…Wink, Wink! The one that Ron Insana forced us to address on Tuesday....
"
63,RL,"""Negative Rates in the US? Here's Why It Could Happen""
"
64,RL,"In this expose by Jeff Cox – he makes it very clear that the next move for US interest rates may be down and not up…..and he goes so far to say that down means going to the dark side - Yes folks - get ready for negative rates… and the reasons are many as WE all know - but apparently not to many in DC know - so let me highlight just a few: Building recession fears in the US, unstable financial mkts, currency devaluations by some ‘emerging mkt' countries, weakening global macro data, collapsing oil and commodity prices and pressure from other central banks that have already moved towards negative rates.Jeff points out that while it may seem highly unlikely – ""Snow White and the 10 dwarfs' would have to consider the possibility of going to the dark side ""should financial conditions tighten and threats to economic growth increase."" BankAmerica rates strategist – Mark Cabana echoes that sentiment saying: ""While not our baseline scenario, if the U.S. economy were to sufficiently weaken we believe the Fed could consider negative rates as a means to ease policy,""So I must ask – How could we go from being so strong 6 weeks ago – as indicated by the FED in December, when they raised rates citing 'explosive growth'....which was then echoed by the President in January – to being so weak so quickly? I mean just last week – Vice Chair Stanley Fischer told us that ""4 more rates hikes were in the ballpark for 2016"" – and Wednesday KC Pres Ester George – backed him up!So what gives? Did he mean that ‘4 more rate DECREASES were in the ballpark for 2016?' I mean Fischer is 72 yrs old – maybe he was just confused…..I mean we all know that Greenspan (now 90) was most definitely confused/borderline stunata (Sicilian for nuts) during his tenure at the FED – because this whole mess – I mean THIS WHOLE MESS started under his watch….(but that's a story for another day).
"
65,RL,"So - we must consider the possibility that Cousin Stanley was confused…..In the end – the broad mkt fell 15 pts to 1900, then rallied 27 pts to 1927 only to fail again and then rally again into the close to end the day at 1915 or up 2.92. Oil also had a bit of nutty day…..trading in a 5% range – initially +3% then falling 1.7% by days' end. And all of this makes sense – remember – the mkt has suffered some real damage of late – trading well below any support levels as it thrashes around trying to build a base amid deteriorating macro reports...... Add in all the global geo-political issues and you can see why the mkt is struggling.The Fed is trying desperately to stay calm and hold the mkt steady…..and to do this – they MUST keep crude oil prices from moving lower so how do they do that? Well given the relationship between oil prices and the US dollar, the Fed has been very actively JAWBONING (see yesterday's note) the dollar lower by floating the idea of negative US interest rates. By doing so – they manage to create some demand for gold – which has rallied nicely – since the December lows. The China Yuan devaluation and the threat of more to come coupled with the Japanese move to the dark side – (negative rates) – saw Gold react beautifully as many investors embrace it as the safest haven of all. As of yesterday – it has now managed to pierce all 3 resistance levels – the 50, 100 and 200 day moving averages – which now sets it up for a run….Look for it to test the October highs of $1185/oz and if we blow thru that - then a run to $1250 is clearly a possibility. Back to the FED – Who is kidding who? Rates are not going any higher at all….not now, not in March and not in the summer….at most – the FED will return us to a zero rate policy – because in the end – negative rates suggest desperation, no matter how you slice it. You CAN'T possibly argue that negative rates are just another ‘tool in the toolbox' ....They are the nuclear option....not a place I want to be.Overnight Asian mkts were essentially lower.....no significant news to report - other than more speculation about what China has up their sleeve and what the FED has up her sleeve.....Japan -1.23%, Hong Kong +0.55%, China -0.63% and ASX -0.08%.European mkts are all higher - breathing what feels like is a sigh of relief.....German factory orders the only notable report....and they weren't good....falling by 0.7% vs. the estimate of -0.5%....FTSE +0.48%, CAC 40 + -0.48%, DAX -0.06%, EUROSTOXX +0.38%, SPAIN +1.28% AND ITALY +0.64%.US futures are now UP 2 pts....as the clock ticks on the 8:30 bombshell......What will the gov't tell us today about Non Farm Payrolls and the jobs created? Will it 'blow the doors off the bus?' Expectations are for +200k jobs, but in reality – the range is +150/+220. Anything less than 150k will only add to the angst of a slowing economy – remember what Challenger Gray and Christmas told us yesterday morning…..We announced lay OFFS of 75k people last month – so an NFP that ‘blows the doors off the bus' would hardly be believable at all….

85,RL,"Fear rippled through Wall Street that Macy's disappointing results and massive drop in shares Wednesday could be just the tip of the iceberg for consumer spending as the holiday shopping season starts to hit full stride.
"
86,RL,"Prospects for heavy markdowns and slow tourist trade discounted not only Macy's, but also the shares of department store rivals Wednesday and extended to other players in the retail sector — regardless of whether they had good news to report.
"
87,RL,"While Macy's (M) dropped 14% of its value, upscale retailer Nordstrom (JWN) stumbled to end the trading session down 3.7%. That wasn't the worst of it, though. Value-priced department store operator Kohl's (KSS) plunged 5.4% while JC Penney (JCP) ended the day off 1.8%. JC Penney fell despite an early-morning surge after it reported better-than-expected Q3 same-store sales and announced the $50 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit.
"
88,RL,"Further, concerns about holiday spending hit shares of apparel retailers, including Gap (GPS), which issued its profit warning late Monday. Apparel and shoe makers also skidded, including market leader Nike (NKE).

"
90,RL,"Retailers Are Overstocked
"
91,RL,"A myriad of problems are hitting the sector, analysts say. Unusually warm weather in September and October may well have caused inventory problems for other department stores and for retailers trying to sell seasonal goods like coats and boots. Macquarie Capital analyst Laurent Vasilescu says inventory buildup from warm weather is impacting wholesalers as well.
"
92,RL,"""Macy's is probably the first retailer to call it out as a big problem,"" Vasilescu said. The retailer reported a third straight quarterly decline in sales early Wednesday, prompting it to slash its full-year profit and sales forecasts.
"
93,RL,"Ultimately, it all could lead to heavy markdowns to move products off the shelves during the holiday, a trend that could hurt margins and profits. A highly promotional environment would lead to increased pressure on the likes of Kohl's, JC Penney and Nordstrom during the holidays.
"
94,RL,"It won't stop there, analysts say. Not even luxury retailers are immune as the lack of tourism has been a drag on sales for retailers like Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Ralph Lauren (RL), Vasilescu adds.
"
95,RL,"""It's going to be a very promotional holiday,"" he said. ""November is likely to be a black November this year where promotions will start well in advance of the normal kickoff on Black Friday.""
"
96,RL,"At Macy's, the concerns over inventory were the center of attention when the company reported earnings. Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren told analysts Wednesday that the inventory glut would lead to markdowns in the fourth quarter.
"
97,RL,"""We're selling fashion apparel and so we're going to mark that inventory down,"" he said. ""That will be good for consumers, but it will obviously put pressure on our own margins in the fourth quarter.""
"
98,RL,"Lundgren went on to say: ""We believe that the retail industry is going through a tough period, that we seem to experience something like this every five to seven years or so, and this one feels familiar in that regard.""
"

101,RL,"Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen says because Macy's will need to liquidate inventory in the fourth quarter, it means that the promotional environment could ""intensify, particularly in apparel,"" for all retailers.
"
102,RL,"""That put up some red flags around the promotional environment, which is why you're seeing the weakness in the stocks,"" he said. ""It's too early to tell if (Macy's being more promotional) says anything about the holiday, but if Macy's is going to be promotional then other retailers are going to (have to) be promotional, which will negatively impact profits.""Fear rippled through Wall Street that Macy's disappointing results and massive drop in shares Wednesday could be just the tip of the iceberg for consumer spending as the holiday shopping season starts to hit full stride.Prospects for heavy markdowns and slow tourist trade discounted not only Macy's, but also the shares of department store rivals Wednesday and extended to other players in the retail sector — regardless of whether they had good news to report.While Macy's (M) dropped 14% of its value, upscale retailer Nordstrom (JWN) stumbled to end the trading session down 3.7%. That wasn't the worst of it, though. Value-priced department store operator Kohl's (KSS) plunged 5.4% while JC Penney (JCP) ended the day off 1.8%. JC Penney fell despite an early-morning surge after it reported better-than-expected Q3 same-store sales and announced the $50 million settlement of a class-action lawsuit.Further, concerns about holiday spending hit shares of apparel retailers, including Gap (GPS), which issued its profit warning late Monday. Apparel and shoe makers also skidded, including market leader Nike (NKE).Department stores were the worst performing group out of the 197 industries tracked by IBD, falling 7.1% Wednesday.Retailers Are OverstockedA myriad of problems are hitting the sector, analysts say. Unusually warm weather in September and October may well have caused inventory problems for other department stores and for retailers trying to sell seasonal goods like coats and boots. Macquarie Capital analyst Laurent Vasilescu says inventory buildup from warm weather is impacting wholesalers as well.""Macy's is probably the first retailer to call it out as a big problem,"" Vasilescu said. The retailer reported a third straight quarterly decline in sales early Wednesday, prompting it to slash its full-year profit and sales forecasts.Ultimately, it all could lead to heavy markdowns to move products off the shelves during the holiday, a trend that could hurt margins and profits. A highly promotional environment would lead to increased pressure on the likes of Kohl's, JC Penney and Nordstrom during the holidays.It won't stop there, analysts say. Not even luxury retailers are immune as the lack of tourism has been a drag on sales for retailers like Tiffany & Co. (TIF) and Ralph Lauren (RL), Vasilescu adds.""It's going to be a very promotional holiday,"" he said. ""November is likely to be a black November this year where promotions will start well in advance of the normal kickoff on Black Friday.""At Macy's, the concerns over inventory were the center of attention when the company reported earnings. Macy's Chief Executive Terry Lundgren told analysts Wednesday that the inventory glut would lead to markdowns in the fourth quarter.""We're selling fashion apparel and so we're going to mark that inventory down,"" he said. ""That will be good for consumers, but it will obviously put pressure on our own margins in the fourth quarter.""Lundgren went on to say: ""We believe that the retail industry is going through a tough period, that we seem to experience something like this every five to seven years or so, and this one feels familiar in that regard.""That statement alone raised red flags, analysts say.""He's clearly saying the economy is turning,"" said Macquarie's Vasilescu. ""That's why you (see) the stocks down so meaningfully.""Cowen and Co. analyst Oliver Chen says because Macy's will need to liquidate inventory in the fourth quarter, it means that the promotional environment could ""intensify, particularly in apparel,"" for all retailers.""That put up some red flags around the promotional environment, which is why you're seeing the weakness in the stocks,"" he said.

"
177,RL,"""In recent years, it's been an ideal recovery for REITs .. . a perfect positive storm,"" said Morningstar analyst Robert Goldsborough. ""You've had low rates, but you've also had a very slow and steady growth in the economy.""
"
178,RL,"The largest REIT ETF, $46.98 billion Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ), yields 4.1% and returned from 2% to 30% from 2009 to 2014. But it's down 7% so far this year. The lowest-cost Schwab U.S. REIT ETF (SCHH) yields 2.41% and returned about 17%, 1% and 32% in each of the past three years, respectively. It's down 4% year to date. The S&P 500 is off 2%.
"
179,RL,"In prior years, incremental demand helped push occupancy as well as rental rates higher, driving up REITs' operating income, explains Goldsborough. Low rates also made the higher REIT yields more appealing to investors. As a result, real estate funds saw massive inflow of investor money.
"
180,RL,"But with the anticipation of rates going up, income investors started reallocating some of their investments elsewhere. ""There's an investor sentiment of fear of interest rates going up. When rates go up, REITs have to allocate more to cash-to-debt servicing. That can be a problem for dividend payouts.... If you don't have massive economic growth alongside those interest-rate hikes, that constrains REITs as well,"" he said.
"
181,RL,"But many REITs are exposed favorably to an environment of rising rates, explained Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at S&P Capital IQ. Within the real estate sector, he particularly likes retail and office space REITs.
"
182,RL,"Retail REITs are usually the largest or second-largest holding in many REIT ETFs and mutual funds. If the economy and retail sales are doing well, their prosperity translates into greater demand for retail spaces, driving occupancy and rental rates higher. This is good for mall property owners.
"
183,RL,"A similar situation applies to office space. ""If the economy is doing well, people feel confident in their employment. If companies are hiring well, they need more office space,"" said Rosenbluth. Office REITs take up about 16% of SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF (RWR) and 14% of Vanguard REIT ETF.
"
184,RL,"Todd Lukasik, Morningstar's senior REIT analyst, also likes health care facilities and outlet malls. While multifamily or self-storage places have traditionally been better investments amid rising rates due to their shorter leases, he finds those two sectors to be near their cyclical peak and thus overvalued.
"
185,RL,"The longer-term leases of health care REITs do provide some protection against rising rates: Their lease payments tend to rise at a rate of 2.5%-3.5% or the change in the consumer price index, whichever is greater, said Lukasik in a Morningstar interview. Big industry consolidation and an aging population should also drive demand for health care properties.

They have demanded employee status, which would also give them the right to join the Teamsters Union.The four companies comprise about 470 trucks out of the more than 13,000 registered trucks at the Port of Los Angeles, said Phillip Sanfield, the port's director of media relations.The strike is the latest in a series of actions, dating back several years, where workers have gone on strike to protest being labeled independent contractors.

320,RL,"Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) makes no secret of its desire to become a much bigger player in the global market for high-end fashion items.
"
321,RL,"The company designs, sells and distributes accessories, footwear and apparel. It is named after founder Michael Kors, a designer perhaps best known as a judge on ""Project Runway.""
"
322,RL,"Most of its business comes from accessories such as handbags, small leather goods, eyewear, jewelry, watches and footwear.
"
323,RL,"Michael Kors Holdings operates through a multichannel distribution model that includes its own chain of retail stores as well as wholesale and licensing segments.
"
324,RL,"These channels have produced robust financial gains over the years, helping the company grow from roughly $500 million in annual revenue in fiscal year 2010 to around $2 billion in fiscal 2013, which ended in March.
"
325,RL,"Now Michael Kors has its sights set on $4 billion in annual sales over the next few years. Many analysts reckon the company has the brand strength, growth strategy and financial might to pull it off.
"
326,RL,"Market Share Gains
"
327,RL,"""Doubling sales doesn't sound that hard,"" JPMorgan analyst Brian Tunick noted in a report last month. ""Management suggested that the path to about $4 billion in revenue over the next few years would come through a combination of market share gains, retail expansion and growth internationally.""
"
328,RL,"During a recent meeting with Michael Kors CEO John Idol and CFO Joe Parsons, Tunick found that management sounds particularly upbeat over the company's growth potential in Europe, which it sees as a $500 million-or-greater opportunity.
"
329,RL,"""Michael Kors' strength in Europe is currently driven by only about 35% brand awareness,"" Tunick noted. ""They believe 50% (brand recognition) represents a true inflection point for the business to take off, suggesting meaningful room ahead.""
"
330,RL,"On a fiscal third-quarter conference call with analysts, CEO Idol said the company was ""very pleased"" with the growing acceptance of the Michael Kors brand in Europe despite a weak overall economy there.
"
331,RL,"""We continue to benefit from increasing brand awareness in this region as our strong product portfolio resonates well with the European consumer,"" Idol said.
"
332,RL,"During fiscal year 2012, Europe accounted for about 8% of overall revenue. North America contributed 91% and Japan 1%.
"
333,RL,"As of April 10, Michael Kors had 228 retail stores in North America, 43 in Europe and 26 in Japan. Longer term, the company sees those numbers growing to 400 North American retail locations, 100 European locations and 100 Japanese locations.
"
334,RL,"One potential growth area in Europe is Michael Kors' partnership with Fossil (FOSL). Under terms of that deal, Fossil makes watches that Michael Kors sells under its own brand.
"
335,RL,"Citigroup analyst Oliver Chen notes that the watch brand ""resonates strongly"" with customers and retailers in the UK, Germany and Switzerland.
"
336,RL,"The brand is also beginning to take hold in France despite heavy competition from Louis Vuitton, Longchamp and other European watch brands.
"
337,RL,"Chen cites a number of reasons the Fossil-Kors watches are showing strength across the Atlantic.
"
338,RL,"""We believe customers are responding to color, the fashion point of view, the synthesis of ideas from multiple high-end brands and the price points,"" Chen noted.
"
339,RL,"Michael Kors competes in the luxury end of the fashion and retail sector, along with companies such as Coach (COH), Ralph Lauren (RL) and Donna Karan International.
"
340,RL,"The closest rival in terms of the business model is Ralph Lauren, which also has a multichannel distribution platform that includes a near-equal amount of sales from retail and wholesale.
"
341,RL,"During fiscal year 2012, Ralph Lauren got 50% of its revenue from retail, 47% from wholesale and 3% from licensing agreements. That same year, Michael Kors got 48% of its sales from retail, 47% from wholesale and 3% from licensing.
"
342,RL,"Recent IPO
"
343,RL,"Michael Kors had its IPO in December 2011 at an opening price of $20. Shares peaked at 65.10 this February and now trade near 61.
"
344,RL,"During its first four full quarters as a publicly traded company, Michael Kors grew year-over-year earnings at least 96% and sales at least 58%.
"
345,RL,"It is scheduled to report fiscal Q4 results on May 29. Analysts expect earnings to come in at 39 cents a share, up from 22 cents the previous year. Revenue should be in the neighborhood of $515 million to $525 million vs. $380 million a year earlier.
"
346,RL,"During its fiscal third quarter the company's earnings more than doubled from the prior year to 64 cents a share, comfortably ahead of views. Sales gained 70% to $636.8 million, also well above estimates. Same-store sales in North America climbed 41%.
"
347,RL,"Online sales represent only a tiny percentage of Michael Kors' overall business, at less than 2% of sales. JPMorgan's Tunick says the company can grow that figure to around 10% of retail sales, which would represent about a $100 million opportunity.
"
348,RL,"""At this point, we believe online traffic is driven off of Google searches and email blasts, and we would expect the company to raise their online marketing spend,"" Tunick noted.Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) makes no secret of its desire to become a much bigger player in the global market for high-end fashion items.The company designs, sells and distributes accessories, footwear and apparel.

349,RL,"Michael Kors Holdings (KORS) will give investors a read on the spending habits of the luxury consumer when the high-end fashion house hits the Wall Street runway with financial results Tuesday before the bell.
"
350,RL,"If followers are on target, the seller of luxury clothing and accessories will show that its affluent customers continue to spend at a healthy clip.
"
351,RL,"Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters see earnings rising 44% to 49 cents a share. They expect sales to climb 37.5% to $570.52 million. That would be the slowest pace for both sales and profits the company has seen since its December 2011 IPO.
"
352,RL,"But analysts are still upbeat about the quarter. Kors has consistently topped quarterly sales and earnings forecasts since its IPO. And this quarter will likely be no different, say two analysts.
"
353,RL,"""My expectations are for a beat on sales and earnings,"" said William Blair & Co. analyst Amy Noblin. ""The question is the magnitude.""
"
354,RL,"What gives Noblin confidence in the quarter are her wholesale and retail channel checks, which show the brand continues to see strong ""sell-through"" at full price and minimal markdowns, she says.
"
355,RL,"""The brand momentum remains strong,"" she said. ""The brand is hot. They've got the products the consumer wants.""
"
356,RL,"The growth drivers: Kors is aggressively expanding its store base and converting wholesale locations into ""shop-in-shops,"" which results in a big lift in productivity, she says. And it's seeing continued growth in brand awareness and product category extensions.
"
357,RL,"Cowen and Co. analyst Faye Landes also expects a beat, according to her preview report on the quarter.
"
358,RL,"""We are modeling Kors Q1 revenue and earnings that are both well above sell-side consensus, as our proprietary data shows very healthy demand trends,"" she wrote. ""Recent same-store sales growth has been at levels that have been seen only rarely, and data from the proprietary Cowen consumer survey gives us no reason to suspect any softness in demand or loss of momentum for the brand.""
"
359,RL,"She forecasts Kors will see Q1 comps climb 30% vs. a year earlier.
"
360,RL,"Kors expected strong performance would follow a report of a challenging fourth quarter for rival Coach (COH) on July 30. The luxury designer of handbags and other accessories saw its same-store sales slip 1.7% vs. a year as amid tough competition from brands such as Kors. It also announced several management changes, including the departure of two key executives.

363,RL,"Here comes the new Restoration Hardware (RH).
"
364,RL,"Now that follow-on offerings to let private-equity investors take profits in the wake of November's initial public offering are over, and creative talent Gary Friedman is back at the helm, the firm can focus more sharply on business at hand.
"
365,RL,"It plans to transform itself from a high-end brand in home furnishings to a luxury lifestyle brand under the product-neutral RH logo (think RL, for Ralph Lauren (RL).
"
366,RL,"Not only is the company branching into ""curated"" collections of contemporary art, antiques and kitchenware, it also plans to launch RH Atelier, a luxury brand of apparel, accessories, footwear and jewelry.
"
367,RL,"""We are in the very early stages of a retail renaissance and believe we can curate a world and a business that goes far beyond the four walls of the home,"" Friedman said in the firm's mid-June conference call.
"
368,RL,"It's already been growing the top line in double digits for 13 straight quarters as Friedman and co-CEO Carlos Alberini added new lines in furniture, textiles and lighting.
"
369,RL,"Revenue Growth
"
370,RL,"In the first quarter ended May 4, revenue rose 38% vs. a year earlier to $301 million. Same-store sales jumped 41%, an almost unheard of gain in retailing.
"
371,RL,"""Those are staggering numbers,"" said Wells Fargo analyst Matt Nemer. ""There's no question this is a high-growth company.""
"
372,RL,"Shares have climbed 119% since the November IPO.
"
373,RL,"""The market is desperate for growth stocks in a backdrop of subpar growth,"" said Dan Veru, chief investment officer with Palisade Capital Management, which owns shares in the company.
"
374,RL,"Key to Restoration Hardware's ongoing transformation will be the opening of much larger Design Galleries stores to better showcase all of its products.
"
375,RL,"Products have been ""trapped in legacy real estate that was designed for an entirely different company,"" said Alberini in the conference call.
"
376,RL,"The jury is still out whether the company can make a go of all of its ambitious undertakings.
"
377,RL,"Many of the new lines put Restoration Hardware in ""uncharted waters,"" Nemer says.
"
378,RL,"""These are unproven businesses, particularly art and antiquities,"" he said. ""I don't really know of a significant retailer of scale that has really tackled these markets.""
"
379,RL,"But if anyone can do it, it's Friedman: ""He's a brilliant merchant,"" Nemer said.
"
380,RL,"In early July, Friedman was reappointed to his prior positions as chairman and co-CEO. He resigned ahead of the November IPO after an internal inquiry investigated his relationship with a female employee. But he continued to work as ""creator"" and ""curator.""
"
381,RL,"Friedman joined Restoration Hardware in 2001 from Williams-Sonoma (WSM), where he was president and chief operating officer. He's credited with saving Restoration Hardware from bankruptcy.
"
382,RL,"While the firm was struggling during the recent recession, Friedman took it private in a 2008 leveraged buyout. Many underperforming stores were closed.
"
383,RL,"Although revenue growth has been strong of late, earnings are another story. The company lost money from 2008 to 2011. Costs have continued to rise and some of the earnings gains since last year have excluded compensation, IPO and other expenses.
"
384,RL,"Still, earnings are improving. First-quarter adjusted net income increased to $2.3 million from a net loss of $1.3 million a year earlier, or 6 cents a share vs. a loss of 4 cents.
"
385,RL,"Non-adjusted, the company lost about $200,000 in the quarter vs. a net loss of $3.7 million a year ago.
"
386,RL,"Restoration Hardware's margins are lower than the double-digit EBIT margins typically posted by other furnishings' companies, Nemer said. But investors are ""excited"" about the potential to grow into higher margins.
"
387,RL,"""We're bullish on their ability to be significantly profitable,"" he said. Other analysts are similarly upbeat. They see adjusted earnings rising 46% this fiscal year to $1.46 a share and rising 26% the next year, says a Thomson Reuters poll.
"
388,RL,"One strong point, Nemer says, is the company's positioning. It's above mass-market players such as Crate & Barrel and Williams-Sonoma's Pottery Barn, but below top-end designer showrooms used by decorators.
"
389,RL,"""There is a lot of white space between those two groups,"" he said. ""There are not a lot of companies directly aligned with them.""
"
390,RL,"While the company has a ""differentiated"" product, it's also benefiting from the home-renovation upswing ""that has swept up Home Depot (HD), Lowe's (LOW), Pier 1 (PIR) and others,"" Veru says.
"
391,RL,"Restoration Hardware's sofas, chairs, tables, bureaus and other products are largely modern updates of classical designs. Its target market: households with incomes above $200,000 or ""aspirational"" customers trading up from department stores and other retailers.
"
392,RL,"While products are available in ever larger and multiple catalogs and on the firm's website, less than 20% of the assortment is displayed in retail stores because of space constraints.
"
393,RL,"""The crux of the story is to set the products free,"" said Nemer. ""They're trapped in the catalog and the website. People don't want to spend $3,000 on something without seeing it in person.""
"
394,RL,"Products that move from just the catalog and website into retail stores get a 50% to 150% lift in sales, management says.
"
395,RL,"Designer Galleries
"
396,RL,"Five full-line Design Galleries have opened since 2011 in Los Angeles, Houston, Scottsdale, Ariz., and most recently Boston and Indianapolis.
"
397,RL,"With an average of 21,600 square feet of selling space, they are about three times the size of the company's legacy stores, not to mention more productive.
"
398,RL,"The Boston outlet is the largest at 40,000 square feet. Besides displaying new product categories such as tabletop goods and ""objects of curiosity,"" the four-story historic building features a wine bar, beer pub, billiard lounge, library, club rooms and conservatory.
"
399,RL,"""It's almost like the modern reincarnation of the department store, but almost everything in the store is its own brand,"" Nemer said.
"
400,RL,"The rollout of RH Kitchen and Tableware next year will likely feature other brands by necessity, he says.
"
401,RL,"Leading the merchandising effort is recently hired Richard Harvey, former president of the Williams-Sonoma brand.
"
402,RL,"Two more Design Gallery stores are set to open next year in Greenwich, Conn. and Atlanta. Lease talks are underway in 30 other markets, including New York, Chicago and Miami.
"
403,RL,"The biggest number of openings aren't slated until 2015 and beyond.
"
404,RL,"In a recent filing, Restoration Hardware said it has the opportunity to more than quadruple its current selling space in the U.S. and Canada over the next five to seven years.
"
405,RL,"International expansion is also on the table.Here comes the new Restoration Hardware (RH).Now that follow-on offerings to let private-equity investors take profits in the wake of November's initial public offering are over, and creative talent Gary Friedman is back at the helm, the firm can focus more sharply on business at hand.It plans to transform itself from a high-end brand in home furnishings to a luxury lifestyle brand under the product-neutral RH logo (think RL, for Ralph Lauren (RL).Not only is the company branching into ""curated"" collections of contemporary art, antiques and kitchenware, it also plans to launch RH Atelier, a luxury brand of apparel, accessories, footwear and jewelry.""We are in the very early stages of a retail renaissance and believe we can curate a world and a business that goes far beyond the four walls of the home,"" Friedman said in the firm's mid-June conference call.It's already been growing the top line in double digits for 13 straight quarters as Friedman and co-CEO Carlos Alberini added new lines in furniture, textiles and lighting.Revenue GrowthIn the first quarter ended May 4, revenue rose 38% vs. a year earlier to $301 million.

406,RL,"Leather handbag and accessories maker Coach (COH) plans to open more factory discount outlets in North America, where it's facing tougher competition from rivals like Michael Kors (KORS) and Ralph Lauren (RL). Coach also announced a management shakeup, including the departure of two key executives. Its stock gapped down as much as 9% Tuesday after its earnings release. Fiscal fourth-quarter…

407,RL,"Priceline took it on the chin recently when market tracker ForeSee issued a report showing that the Web travel agency came in with some of the lowest customer satisfaction scores among 100 large U.S. online sellers surveyed.
"
408,RL,"Amazon.com (AMZN) and L.L. Bean, in comparison, weighed in with the highest customer-satisfaction scores in the ""ForeSee Experience Index: 2013 U.S. Retail Edition"" issued on Jan. 7.
"
409,RL,"But there's more to the findings than meet the eye. ForeSee CEO Larry Freed told IBD that the survey results don't necessarily show that Priceline (PCLN) underperforms in customer service. ""That would be too simplistic,"" he said.
"
410,RL,"(In an unrelated move, Answers.com, which in late December acquired ForeSee for a reported $200 million, on Friday announced Freed's resignation.)
"
411,RL,"Freed says comparing Priceline and Amazon's scores isn't parallel, since the holiday study focused mainly on physical products among retailers during their busiest season. Year-end, on the other hand, isn't the peak season for online travel companies.
"
412,RL,"""We measured the largest U.S. retailers during the holidays, so just (placing) on the list for customer satisfaction is good for Priceline,"" Freed said.
"
413,RL,"Nature Of Products Differ
"
414,RL,"Priceline says ForeSee is off the mark to compare its customer satisfaction scores with Amazon.
"
415,RL,"""It's simply not apples to apples,"" Priceline spokeswoman Leslie Cafferty told IBD when asked about the ForeSee study. ""Broad consumer opinion about a retail category like consumer technology goods may be far different from general consumer opinion about booking travel, simply given the nature of the products and processes tied to the purchase of each.
"
416,RL,"""This report is comparing apples to oranges. In reports where Priceline customer service is ranked relative to other companies in our category, we have scored quite well.""
"
417,RL,"ForeSee's surveys ask customers for feedback on companies overall, as well as how the firms provide customer service in stores, on websites and via mobile channels.
"

""Our own Voice of the Customer reports, based on actual customer feedback surveys, indicate strong scores overall. And our customer repeat rates, which are the best indication of customer satisfaction with our service, are very high.""Priceline took it on the chin recently when market tracker ForeSee issued a report showing that the Web travel agency came in with some of the lowest customer satisfaction scores among 100 large U.S. online sellers surveyed.Amazon.com (AMZN) and L.L. Bean, in comparison, weighed in with the highest customer-satisfaction scores in the ""ForeSee Experience Index: 2013 U.S. Retail Edition"" issued on Jan. 7.But there's more to the findings than meet the eye. ForeSee CEO Larry Freed told IBD that the survey results don't necessarily show that Priceline (PCLN) underperforms in customer service. ""That would be too simplistic,"" he said.(In an unrelated move, Answers.com, which in late December acquired ForeSee for a reported $200 million, on Friday announced Freed's resignation.)Freed says comparing Priceline and Amazon's scores isn't parallel, since the holiday study focused mainly on physical products among retailers during their busiest season. Year-end, on the other hand, isn't the peak season for online travel companies.""We measured the largest U.S. retailers during the holidays, so just (placing) on the list for customer satisfaction is good for Priceline,"" Freed said.Nature Of Products DifferPriceline says ForeSee is off the mark to compare its customer satisfaction scores with Amazon.""It's simply not apples to apples,"" Priceline spokeswoman Leslie Cafferty told IBD when asked about the ForeSee study. ""Broad consumer opinion about a retail category like consumer technology goods may be far different from general consumer opinion about booking travel, simply given the nature of the products and processes tied to the purchase of each.""This report is comparing apples to oranges. In reports where Priceline customer service is ranked relative to other companies in our category, we have scored quite well.""ForeSee's surveys ask customers for feedback on companies overall, as well as how the firms provide customer service in stores, on websites and via mobile channels.The results of its latest survey were based on 67,600 customer responses gathered Nov. 29 to Dec. 17.Besides Amazon and L.L.
